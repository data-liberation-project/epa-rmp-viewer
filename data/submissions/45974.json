The terminal is bounded by the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal to the west, Corn Products Corporation to the north, Archer Avenue to the east, and the Shell Oil Terminal and the Univar Distribution Facility to the south.  Bedford Park Fire Station Number 1 is located at the entrance to the Argo Terminal.  The terminal provides tank storage for liquid chemicals, petroleum, food grade products, and raw materials on a \u00bfcontract\u00bf basis.  Presently 217 permitted aboveground storage tanks are available (approximately 100,000,000 gallon capacity) for storage and distribution of customer products or for support activities.  Materials are received at the terminal by tank trucks, rail cars, barge, and pipeline.   \n\nOf the 217 permitted aboveground storage tanks, one tank, Tank 5-15 (for storage of vinyl acetate), is covered by the RMP regulation.  Tank C-11 (storage of cyclohexylamine) was previously part of the RMP; however, this tank has since been removed from service and this RMP is an update to reflect current operations.\n\nPolicies to Protect Health, Safety and the Environment\nRisk management and safety are important concerns at the Argo Terminal.  This RMP formalizes and documents these activities.  The facility is committed to conducting its operations in a safe and responsible manner and to reducing risks to human health and the environment.\n\nPrevention Program \nAn Accidental Release Prevention Program is in place to minimize the risk of hazardous chemical releases in accordance with the EPA Risk Management Program requirements (40 CFR 68). This prevention program covers those processes that handle regulated substances above the threshold amount.  The prevention program provides a structured approach to preventing accidents. Some of the specific activities in the prevention program include:\n\n\u00bf Keeping process safety information accessible at all times.\n\u00bf Conducting a hazard review as part of the preparation"

      "SummaryText": "Introduction\nA facility that uses or stores more than 15,000 lbs. of vinyl acetate is required to submit a Risk Management Program (RMP) to the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA).  An RMP comprises several elements, including an evaluation of potential accident scenarios and a comprehensive program to prevent accidental releases of regulated chemicals. \n\nThe RMP summarizes the management, administrative, procedural, and technological controls that the facility uses in combination to minimize the risk of hazardous chemical releases to the surrounding community.  The RMP includes the following information:\n\n\u00bf Introduction;\n\u00bf Facility identification, regulated substances, and covered processes;\n\u00bf Policies to protect health, environment, and safety;\n\u00bf Hazard Assessment;\n\u00bf Prevention Program;\n\u00bf Five-Year Accident History;\n\u00bf Emergency Response Plan; and\n\u00bf Planned Changes to improve safety\n\nKinder Morgan Liquids Terminals (KMLT) submitted a 5-year update of the RMP for KMLT\u00bfs Argo Illinois Terminal on June 18, 2004.  KMLT has since removed Tank C-11 from cyclohexylamine storage service at the Argo Terminal.  As required by the RMP regulations in 40 CFR 68, Kinder Morgan must update both the RMP and the Accidental Release Prevention Program document to reflect the removal of Tank C-11 from cyclohexylamine service.  Kinder Morgan must also submit an updated RMP to the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). A copy of the updated RMP is included in Section 8.0 of this document. \n\nKMLT has updated this RMP for the Argo Terminal by removing all references to the storage of cyclohexylamine in the text, tables, and figures of the RMP and in supporting documentation\n\nFacility Identification and Regulated Substances\nThe KMLT Argo Terminal is a public \u00bffor-hire\u00bf bulk liquid storage terminal, approximately 145 acres in area and located approximately 15 miles southwest of the Chicago, Illinois.

Examples of safety equipment in place include pressure relief devices, leak detection, and alarm systems.  \n\nIn addition, process operators receive extensive training in the safe operation of the process and are required to follow detailed operating procedures to help ensure safety.  The facility also has implemented a maintenance program to monitor the physical condition of process equipment, and replace or repair equipment before it fails.\n\nIn the unlikely event of a spill or release involving a hazardous material, the Argo Terminal has developed an emergency response plan providing procedures to be followed to minimize the potential impacts of a fire at the facility. In the event of a release, the facility calls the Bedford Park Fire Department located at the facility boundary.\n\nHazard Evaluation\nUnder the EPA regulations, the facility is required to evaluate the potential consequences of a worst case release and various alternate release scenarios.  The following paragraphs provide a description of the worst case and alternate scenarios for the base. \n\nThe RMP regulations define a worst-case release as \u00bfthe release of the largest quantity of a regulated substance from a vessel or process line failure that results in the greatest distance to an endpoint defined in Sections 68.22 (a) (40 CFR 68.3).

The release rate to air is estimated as the rate of evaporation from the pool of spilled toxic liquid.  Each tank at the Argo Terminal is located within a diked area \n\nFor Tank 5-15 (capacity 187,700 gallons), it is assumed that the contents of the tank empty instantaneously to a diked area.  The diked area is capable of holding the capacity of the largest tank, plus sufficient free board to allow for precipitation.  The evaporation rate is then determined using the CHARM model to determine the distance to the toxic endpoint.\n\nFive-Year Accident History\nOn September 29, 1996 the Argo Terminal experienced a release of vinyl acetate, a listed RMP chemical.  During a severe thunderstorm, heavy winds knocked a piece of equipment from the roof of a nearby tank, resulting in a ruptured pipe on Tank 5-16, which, at the time was used to store vinyl acetate.  An estimated 9,000 gallons of vinyl acetate was released to the diked area.  Because of the severe weather, the dike drains had been left open to prevent flooding of the diked area.  As a result, the material was discharged to the Metropolitan Water Reclamation District sanitary sewer system. No material was discharged to a waterway or over land. The discharge did not result in any on-site or off-site deaths or injuries, evacuations, or sheltering in place. Whether the MWRD was able to treat the release or whether it passed through the treatment system and was discharged to waterways is unknown; therefore the environmental impacts of this release are undetermined.\n\nFor the 2004 RMP update, KMLT reported that no accidents had occurred during the previous five years. No accidents have occurred since the 2004 update was submitted.\n\n\nEmergency Response Plan\nThe RMP regulations require that response actions have been coordinated with local emergency planning and response agencies"
