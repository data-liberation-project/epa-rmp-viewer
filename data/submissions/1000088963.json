RMP EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nHolmen Cheese LLC, located at 1775 Granary Street, Holmen, WI 54636 is a processed cheese producer.\n\nAt this facility, anhydrous ammonia (cas #7664-41-7) is used as a refrigerant to cool processed cheese for storage and processing. The refrigeration process at this facility is comprised of one closed-loop, mechanical refrigeration system. Liquid ammonia is supplied by pumps or pressure differential to the evaporators, roof-top RMAUs, vessels, and heat exchangers. Ammonia vapor and liquid from the process equipment returns to the recirculator. The normal high-side operating pressure ranges from 120 to 190 psig. The maximum allowable high side working pressure is 300 psig.\n\nAs part of the PSM program, Holmen Cheese has completed a Process Hazard Analysis, developed written operating procedures, trained employees on awareness and system operation, established procedures to conduct Management of Change procedures and Pre-Startup Safety Reviews, and developed a Mechanical Integrity program for ammonia refrigeration equipment. In addition to the daily monitoring of the refrigeration process, Holmen Cheese has implemented an ongoing Preventive Maintenance program to ensure the refrigeration equipment and safety systems are maintained in good operating condition.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nA PSM program, which meets the requirements of the RMP general accidental release prevention program, is being implemented by Holmen Cheese to address the anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system at the Holmen, WI facility. The PSM program developed and implemented at Holmen Cheese includes the following steps:\n\nManagement System: Designates individuals responsible for implementing, maintaining, and conducting the various duties associated with the PSM program; to ensure it stays current and effectively, protects the employees, "

An Emergency Action Plan (EAP) has been developed that includes coordination with local, county, state, and national responders. Procedures for employees to follow in the event of an accidental release of ammonia and a list of emergency phone numbers have been developed and posted where employees can access the list. Employees have been trained on the EAP and drills are practiced at least annually. \n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThrough the accidental release prevention program, Holmen Cheese LLC, regularly evaluates the need for any changes to improve safety. Currently, Holmen Cheese is a brand-new facility and all equipment and safeties meet, or exceed, current codes. \n\n"
