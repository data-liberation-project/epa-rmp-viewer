New employees receive initial training in refinery operations and maintenance systems.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) they are allowed to work independently. \r\n\r\nIn addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained.  This refresher training is conducted at least every three years.  All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training. \r\n\r\nContractors \r\n\r\nU.S. Oil & Refining Co. uses contractors for specialty services and to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the refinery has a comprehensive pre-qualification procedure in place.  During the pre-qualification process, U.S. Oil & Refining Co. evaluates contractor safety programs and performance prior to selecting the contractor to perform work at the refinery.  Once a contractor is approved to provide service at the refinery, their performance is monitored to ensure that they are meeting the expectation that all work is carried out safely.\r\n\r\nU.S. Oil & Refining Co. provides contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, (4) personal protective equipment requirements, including respiratory protection, and (5) safe work practices prior to their beginning work at the refinery.
