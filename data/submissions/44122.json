To prevent accidental releases of Pentane Fagerdala will perform Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) to identify, evaluate, and control the risk associated with process hazards or highly hazardous chemicals release scenarios subject to the EPA RMP regulations.  The purpose of the PHA will be to comply with these regulations and to prevent or reduce the consequences of a release of a regulated substance.   Recommendations will be presented, where applicable, in the PHA to minimize the risk associated with a release scenario to an acceptable criteria level.\n\nThe PHA will be conducted on all regulated processes at the Fagerdala facility, which includes the:\n\n* Pentane distribution system and reactor process\n\nA regulated process is defined as a process that manages a regulated chemical with an inventory at or above the EPA RMP threshold quantity for that chemical.  For the chemical Pentane this threshold amount is 10,000 lbs.  At Fagerdala the maximum quantity of Pentane handled or stored is 79,689 lbs, which is over the threshold amount mentioned above.\n\nEmergency response policies have been achieved for the following actions: Power Failure, Loss of Agitator, Loss of Computer, Loss of Circulation Pump, Blown Rupture Disk, Fire/Explosion, and Out of Control Fire/Explosion.  \n\nThe scope of the Emergency Action Plan (EAP) currently includes:\n\n1. A pentane release contained within the plant facilities and controllable by plant personnel and equipment.\n\n2. A pentane release affecting or which has the potential to affect the areas surrounding the facility that would require outside assistance.\n\nAny employee sounding any of the general emergency response alarms will initiate the EAP.  Portable air-operated alarms are located in all of the manufacturing areas, office area, and laboratory.  They are to be used as an emergency warning to all employees. There are also automatic alarms that m"

For a major release the initial assembly point shall be at the company sign at the front of the plant along 12th Street.\n\nThe Plant Manager or the ranking supervisor in his absence is the responsible overall emergency response coordinator.  \n\nBased on the Program 3 requirements in accordance with the EPA RMP regulations the worst-case release scenario(s) and the alternative release scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario, covers Pentane, the flammable chemical stored on-site above the threshold quantities.\n\nThe following information summarizes the facilities worst-case scenario:\n\nScenario: \"The total quantity from the 14,700 gallon (79,689 lb.) aboveground storage tank forms a vapor cloud and the cloud detonates.\"\n\nThe EPA's RMP Guidance for Off-Site Consequence Analysis was utilized to model the worst-case scenario utilizing the program's data elements to determine the distance to 1-PSI overpressure endpoint.  \n\nDistance to Overpressure End Point:    0.343 miles\n\nPassive Mitigation Considered:  None\n\nThe following information summarizes the facilities alternative release scenario:\n\nScenario: \"The entire contents of the aboveground storage tank are exposed to fire and a boiling liquid, expanding vapor explosion (BLEVE) occurs at the facility.\n\nThe EPA's RMP Guidance for Off-Site Consequence Analysis was utilized to model the worst-case scenario utilizing the program's data elements to determine the distance to radiant heat dose at potential second-degree burn exposure.\n\nDistance to Radiant Heat Dose at Potential Second Degree Burn E"

These processes include the following:\n\n1. Piping And Instrument Diagrams (P&ID's)\n\n2. Chemical Information - The Plant Manager will maintain the regulated chemical information for pentane in the form of MSDS's (Material Safety Data Sheet).  MSDS's chemical information for Pentane can be found in the Control Room of the facility and at the end of this Chapter.  In addition, operator training manuals and SOP manuals include the MSDS's.\n\n3. Ventilation System Design - In the event of a significant pentane release the explosivity sensors will trigger both supply and exhaust fans to start when the atmosphere reaches approximately 10% of the lower explosive limit of pentane.  The supply and exhaust fan combination are design to dilute pentane vapors as much as feasible to avoid reaching ignitable concentrations.  The ventilation system and explosivity monitors are on emergency back up power and will operate when commercial power is interrupted.\n\n4. If the building fire systems activate the ventilation system is shut down to avoid accelerating combustion.\n\n5. Fire Suppression System Design - Aires recommends revising the fire protection systems in this area to provide a density of 0.40 gpm/ft2 over they hydraulically most remote 2,500 ft2 area with a 500 gpm hose allowance, which requires a total of 1,500 gpm. We also recommend replacing the standard sprinklers with new sprinklers with a minimum K factor of 11.2."

Since this is a new process, no accidents have been reported in the last five years."
