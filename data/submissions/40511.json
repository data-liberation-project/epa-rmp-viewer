These programs have reduced the risks involved with accidential releases of ammonia and eliminated ammonia type injuries.  The main ammonia system has been in operation for many decades without any serious accidents.\n     Over the past three years, Kemps has installed several new continuous ice cream freezers that have shown corrision, desigh flaws, and metal fatigue.  Our safety committee, maintenance department, employees, and management are committed to preventing occurences, minimizing the consequences, and overall training of employees to promote overall plant, employee, and public safety.  Kemps employees know the rules, procedures, and practices which govern individual processes. Activities, and pieces of equipment.  These rules and SOPS are detailed and improved as necessary.  They are communicated to and enforced on employees.  During our recent audit by MN OSHA, one of the inspectors commented on the reports she had received during employee interviews.  She reported that everyone she talked to did feel safe in the plant, that they were properly trained, and that any safety issue that was present would be repaired/replaced to avoid hazard to self and plant. During our recent PSM audit, there are several items the need improvement which will be addressed in the next three months.\n     Kemps did have an accidental release on May 9,2003.  The release occurred during production hours (9:25pm) and the plant was evacuated, along with the areas around the plant.  The ammonia leak occurred in the Tri-tray ice cream hardening unit.  One of the air circualation fans fell into a evaporator coil below the fan.  It cut open a hole in the coil and liquid ammonia ran out.  Since the room is -32, it did not evaporate immediately.  One of the metal support brackets that holds the fans broke loose from"

      "SummaryText": " metal fatique.  Kemps has replaced the coil with a higher strenght stainless steel, increased the metal support of the fans, and started monthly inspections on all of the fans.  Although this was an accidental release, properly trained maintenance employees reacted quickly and safety to reduce the amount of ammonia lost.  Emergency evacuation proceeded worked properly and no one was injured.\n     This past year, Kemps installed two new plate hardening systems to harden square ice cream containers to -20 degrees.  This system was installed with automatic ammonia valves that close when ammonia levels are at 100 ppm.  Warning alarms (audio and visual) warn employees at 50 ppm.  Kemps is also in process of centralizing our whole ammonia process controls.  This sytem will monitor air quality and be capable of automatically shutting down the entire two-staged, closed loop ammonia refrigeration system.  This system will monitor all pumps (by ampere draw), valve positions, and pressures.  King valves will be automatic also.  Within seconds of a leak, the system will shut off liquid feed to the particular area of the system to reduce the release and warn employees.  We have already installed ammonia sensors in all of our penthouse evaporator coils.  These units will be equipped with motorized shut off valves by September 2004.  This system will also have the ability to be accessed by modem, if nessesary, and have automatic notification to key personel.  This process, along with PSM reviews, updates, and training, will greatly improve our control and monitoring of the entire ammonia system, reduce leak exposure, and improve employee and public safety."
