PPGAF also  trains Distribution Center employees in accident prevention, hazard communication, emergency response, safe material handling procedures and fork truck driving safety. All of these activities form an integral part of PPG's overall Environmental, Health and Safety Policy, whose main goal is \"to market, distribute and manufacture products globally in a responsible manner that protect employees, neighbors, customers and the environment.\"\n\nRegulated Substance Handled\n\nPPGAF Texas Distribution Center  is a part of the PPG Architectural Finishes business unit. The Dallas DC stores paint, stain and related products and distributes them to independent dealers, PPG owned stores and home centers throughout the central United States. The DC stores products in various size containers, including aerosol spray cans. Some of the aerosols contain propane, butane, isobutane and methyl ether, which are used as propellants.  These four materials are regulated flammable substances under the EPA-RMP regulation. \n\n** The actual Quantity Released (4.4) and Distance to endpoint (4.6)  for the worst case flammable scenario are below the minimum values allowed to be entered by the RMP ESubmit system.  The minimum values were selected for those fields in order to complete the submittal.

The PPGAF Dallas DC aerosol storage process is classified as a Program Level 1 process because the Worst-Case Scenario has no off-site impact and because there were no accidental releases in the past five years that meet RMP criteria. Submission of specific prevention program information for Program Level 1 processes is not required by RMP. \n\nEmergency Response Procedures\n\nPPGAF coordinates emergency response activities with the local fire department. \n\nAdditional Information\n \nFor additional information, contact Mr. Dave Frame at (972)-488-3454."
