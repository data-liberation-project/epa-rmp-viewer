Describe the Accident Release Prevention and Emergency Policies\n\nThe Campbell Soup Plant in Napoleon, OH is committed to the protection of its employees, its property, and the environment.\n\nIn fulfilling this commitment, the plant will provide and maintain a safe and healthful work environment as indicated by acceptable business practices and compliance with legislative requirements, and will strive to eliminate any foreseeable hazards that may result in fires, security losses, damage to property or the environment, and personal injuries/illnesses.\n\nKey elements of the Napoleon Plant safety program are the precautions taken to prevent or minimize accidental releases of chlorine from the treatment systems.  These precautions include safety controls (alarms and automatic shutdown devices) which are designed to identify and prevent potentially unsafe conditions such as chlorine releases, a preventive maintenance program designed to maintain the on-going integrity of the systems, a training program designed to ensure that the systems are operated by qualified personnel, and emergency response procedures which enable trained personnel to respond quickly to system upsets.\n\nThe Manager, Services and Utilities is responsible for the management of these chlorine safety programs.\n\n\nB.   Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe Campbell Soup Plant in Napoleon, OH produces canned food products for sale to the public.  The facility uses chlorine in its water treatment and wastewater treatment systems.  Chlorine is the only regulated substance handled at the Napoleon Plant.\n\n\nC.   Description of the Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe facility has an accident release prevention program that complies with OSHA's Process Safety Management Standard and EPA's Risk Management Program Regulation.  The prevention program consists of the following elements:\n\no Employee Participation Program\no Process Safety Information\no Process Hazard Analysis\no Operating Proced"

Five-Year Accident History\n\nThere have not been any chlorine-related incidents at the Napoleon Plant during the previous five years that resulted in significant on-site or offsite consequences.\n\n\nE.   Description of the Emergency Response Program\n\nAn emergency response program has been implemented at the Napoleon Plant.  This program contains procedures describing how the facility will respond to chlorine spills and other emergencies, including evacuation procedures and procedures for controlling chlorine leaks.  The program has been coordinated with the local Emergency Response Committee (Henry County Sheriff's Department).\n\n\nF.   Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nSix changes were recommended to improve the equipment and the system operating procedures when the chlorine treatment systems were analyzed in 2002.  The recommended changes have been implemented."
