The substance is delivered via truck or container in 55 gallon drums that are segregated to a designated hazardous storage room in the facility designed for storing flammables. The storage room is equipped with in-rack sprinklers and an AFFF fire suppression system. \n\nThere have not been any accidents in regards to this product with significant onsite or offsite consequences in the past five years.\n\nAccidental release prevention starts with all employees being certified to OSHA forklift operating standards, hazardous material handling and GHS (Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labeling Chemicals). Employees are also trained on the company's procedures, emergency response plan and safety. The product is stored in a designated hazardous storage room equipped with one hour firewall, AFFF fire suppression system, diking, automatic spill barriers and separate ventilation with automatic cut-off controls. Additional site training will be held to implement the Risk Management Plan. Additional changes to improve safety will be implemented upon further evaluation on the handling of the product. \n\nIn the case of an accidental release of the regulated substance, the warehouse employees would not respond with cleanup efforts, but rather a third-party contracted cleanup team would be called in to respond to the release. The warehouse does have an emergency response plan, but since it does not cover employee response to the regulated substance, t"

SDSs are kept on site, and no hazardous products are allowed into the warehouse without the proper SDS. Maximum inventory is anticipated not to exceed 150 drums. Routine cleaning, sanitization and maintenance is done by warehouse employees. Some maintenance is contracted to third parties. Hazard reviews are conducted weekly with more in-depth reviews done monthly. Under the guidance of this RMP, compliance audits will be carried out at least every three years to ensure compliance with the elements in this plan. The site operates by the 24 standard operating procedures established by the operating company. Further information regarding items mentioned in this paragraph along with information on safety and incident investigation can be found in the Prevention Program section of this plan. \n\n"
