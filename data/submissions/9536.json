All applicable procedures of the US EPA Prevention Program are adhered to.  The Division of Public Works continues to evaluate and improve its procedures and practices with regards to its accidental release prevention policy.\n\nThe Division of Public Works response policy involves the preparation of response plans which are tailored to each facility and to the emergency response services available in the community, and is in compliance with the EPA Emergency Response Program requirements.\n  \nB.\tSystem Description and Regulated Substance Handled\n\tThe Gorman Avenue Water Treatment Plant provides the Town of Ocean City with potable (drinking) water.  The Gorman Avenue Water Treatment Plant is located on Gorman Avenue and  Sinepuxent Avenue in Ocean City, Maryland.  Disinfection of water is part of the water treatment process required by the Safe Drinking Water Act and the State of Maryland.  At the Gorman Avenue Water Treatment Plant (WTP), disinfection is accomplished with chlorine treatment. \n\tChlorine liquid is stored and handled at the Gorman Avenue WTP for the disinfection process.  The WTP chlorination system has a chlorine storage room and a chlorination room.  Equipment at the facility includes liquid chlorine containers, chlorine gas manifolds, a vacuum feed system, chlorinators, safety equipment, chlorine leak detectors and an emergency scrubber.\n\tTypically, eight (8) one-ton containers of chlorine are on site.  Two of the eight containers are on-line.  The WTP is normally unmanned.  WTP operators visit the facility daily, and respond to any trouble alarms which may occur.\n\nC.\tOffsite Consequence Analysis\n\tThe Offsite Consequence Analysis includes the consideration of two chlorine release scenarios iden"

The first scenario is defined by EPA, stating that,  \"the owner or operator shall assume that the...maximum quantity in the largest vessel...is released as a gas over 10 minutes\" due to an unspecified failure.  The Alternative Scenario is defined as \"more likely to occur than the Worst-Case Release Scenario.\"  The Offsite Consequence Analysis for the Gorman Avenue WTP was conducted with the use of the EPA Risk Management Program Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants.\n\t1.\tBased on the tables and information provided for a worst-case chlorine release, the following was determined:\n\t\ta.\tThe \"Worst-Case Release Scenario,\" as defined by EPA, would be for a one-ton container of chlorine to release, as a gas, in a ten minute period.\n\t\tb.\tThe toxic endpoint for Cl2 gas is 3 ppm.\n\t\tc.\tPassive mitigation can be expected from the building housing the chlorine and this will reduce the release rate by 45%.\n\t\td.\tThe distance from the release site to the toxic endpoint is 0.9 miles.\nIt should be noted that the design of the chlorine feed system and the presence of an emergency scrubber system make the possibility of the EPA described \"worst-case\" scenario practically impossible.\n\t2.\tThe \"Alternative (Release ) Scenario\" was evaluated with the use of the EPA Risk Management Program Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants.  For the Gorman Avenue WTP a possible alternative release scenario would be a PRV release through a = inch i.d. Cl2 gas pipe.  Such a leak would not have an impact outside the facility boundaries.  The reason for this is because of the active mitigation measures that are in place.  These are:\n\t\ta.\tVacuum feed system and pressure relief vents\n\t\tb.\tChlorine gas leak detectors\n\t\tc.\tEmergency scrubber, that ventilates, captures and treats 99.9% of the chlorine gas.\nD.\tThe general Gorman Avenue WTP accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps are based on the Town of Ocean C"
