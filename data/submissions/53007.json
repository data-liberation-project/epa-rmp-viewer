This Risk Management Plan is intended to comply with the requirements of EPA's Risk Management Program (40 CFR part 68.)\n\n2.0 ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nThe National Cooperative Refinery Association, McPherson County, Kansas, Conway Underground Storage has a long standing commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, the training of personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our facility. Our policy is to implement reasonable contr"

However, if a release does occur, our personnel are trained to respond to control and contain the release.\n\n\n3.0 DESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCES AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe Conway Underground Storage facility provides storage for approximately 4,000,000 barrels of petroleum products including propane, natural gas, butane, gasoline and intermediate refinery feed stocks.  The underground salt layer caverns average about 50,000 barrels capacity each.  Pipelines are used to transfer products to and from the refinery and to various product terminals.\n\nThe Conway Underground Storage has the following EPA listed flammable substances held above the threshold quantity: Alky olefin feed, butane, isobutane and pentane. \n\n\n4.0 HAZARD ASSESSMENT RESULTS\n\nThe McPherson Refinery has completed all hazard assessments required under the Risk Management Program rules.  Details of the Hazard Assessment are included in the RMP*Submit data.\n\n5.0 PREVENTION PROGRAM STEPS\n\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at Conway Underground Storage. Because the processes at the refinery are regulated by the EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) regulation and OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\nEmployee Participation (National Cooperative Refinery Association: PSM, Doc. 8502)\nConway Underground Storage encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention. Conway Underground Storage has one employee representative in the position of Special Project Operator. This employee is responsible for writing and updating operating procedure, verifying P&ID drawings with engineers and interfacing between Conway operators and management. Other examples of employee participation include updating and compil"

Employees have access to all information created as part of the accident prevention program.  The employee participation policy is maintained at the national Cooperative Refinery Association Environment, Health & Safety Department, 1391 Iron Horse Road, McPherson, Kansas.  It addresses each accident prevention program element.\n\nProcess Safety Information (McPherson Refinery policy: PSM, Doc. 8503)\nNational Cooperative Refinery Association keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the Conway Underground Storage. These documents address inventory maximums and safe limits for pressures and flows of transfer pumps.  Up to date information is maintained by the Conway Operators.\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs). \n\nNational Cooperative Refinery Association also maintains numerous mechanical documents that provide information about the design and construction of Conway Underground Storage equipment. This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, etc. This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\nThis information is available through the National Cooperative Refinery Association Engineering Department. \n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA) (National Cooperative Refinery Association: PSM, Doc. 8504)\nConway Underground Storage has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various"

Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nNational Cooperative Refinery Association primarily uses the \"What If\" analysis technique to perform these evaluations. The \"What If\" technique asks a series of questions to review potential hazard scenarios and possible consequences.  This analysis is conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the underground storage as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary. \n\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to the Process Hazard Coordinator for resolution. Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team. This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention. All approved mitigation options being implemented in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, National Cooperative Refinery Association periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.

New employees receive basic training in underground operations. After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks. After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.

This Risk Management Plan is intended to comply with the requirements of EPA's Risk Management Program (40 CFR part 68.)\r\n\r\n2.0 ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\r\n\r\nThe National Cooperative Refinery Association, McPherson County, Kansas, Conway Underground Storage has a long standing commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, the training of personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our facility. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, our personnel are trained to respond to control and contain the release.\r\n\r\n\r\n3.0 DESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCES AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\r\n\r\nThe Conway Underground Storage facility provides storage for approximately 4,000,000 barrels of petroleum products including propane, natural gas, butane, gasoline and intermediate refinery feed stocks.  The underground salt layer caverns average about 50,000 barrels capacity each.  Pipelines are used to transfer products to and from the refinery and"

Because the processes at the refinery are regulated by the EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) regulation and OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\r\n\r\nEmployee Participation (National Cooperative Refinery Association: PSM, Doc. 8502)\r\nConway Underground Storage encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention. Conway Underground Storage has one employee representative in the position of Special Project Operator. This employee is responsible for writing and updating operating procedure, verifying P&ID drawings with engineers and interfacing between Conway operators and management. Other examples of employee participation include updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information, participating in the Union/Management Health and Safety Committee and participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team. Employees have access to all information created as part of the accident prevention program.
