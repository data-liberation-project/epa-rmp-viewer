As part of this commitment, the company has established a system to help ensure safe operation of the hazardous chemical processes at this facility.

One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit a Risk Management Plan (RMPlan) describing the Risk Management Program at Georgia-Pacific in Leaf River. This document is intended to satisfy the RMPlan requirements of the RMP Rule and to provide the public with a description of the Risk Management Program at the facility.\n\nThe Risk Management Program at the facility consists of three elements:\n\n1. a hazard assessment to help understand (a) the potential off site consequences of hypothetical accidental releases and (b) accidents that may have occurred during the last five years associated with the use of the substances regulated by the RMP rule (chlorine dioxide ) - see topic 1.3\n \n2. a prevention program to help maintain and safely operate the processes containing more than the threshold quantity of the regulated substances (covered processes) -see topic 1.4\n \n3. an emergency response program to help respond to accidental releases of the regulated substances from the covered processes - see topic 1.6\n\n4.

In fact, the facility has a comprehensive safety program in place establishing many levels of safeguards that are designed to minimize the potential for the release of any hazardous substance and any injuries and damage that could occur.\n\nLeaf River minimizes the potential releases of the hazardous substances used at the facility. When hazardous substances are used at the facility, the equipment is carefully designed, built, and operated to reduce the likelihood of an accidental release. Industry and government standards are closely adhered to in design, construction, and operation of the equipment.\n\nLeaf River limits damage from a release, if such a release occurs. The facility trains workers to respond to upset conditions, reducing the consequences of a release if it occurs. In addition, the facility will be working with the Local Emergency Planning Commission (LEPC) to help ensure that injuries and/or environmental damage will not occur in the event a release does occur.\n\nThe safety program at Leaf River consists of a number of elements, only some of which are required by the RMP Rule.

As part of this manufacturing process, the facility produces and stores Chlorine Dioxide for the use of bleaching pulp. The Chlorine Dioxide Solution System, which includes the generation, storage and distribution of chlorine dioxide, is considered an RMP covered process in Program Level 3. The threshold quantity for Chlorine Dioxide is approximately 414,000 gallons at a 10-gram per liter (1% in solution) strength during peak operations.\n                                    \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           1.3\tOff Site Consequence Analysis\n\nLeaf River performed an off site consequence analysis to estimate the potential for an accidental release of regulated substances to affect the public or the environment. The off site consequence analysis consists of evaluating a worst-case release scenarios and alternative release case scenarios. The facility does not expect a worst-case release scenario to ever occur. An alternative release scenario represents a release that (1) might occur at a facility like GP/Leaf River and (2) would result in an off site consequence if the release occurred. The alternative r"

The  ClO2 storage tank contains 207,000 gallons of a weak Chlorine Dioxide solution( 1.0 % by weight). The RMP Rule mandates that for the worst case scenario the analysis assumes loss of the entire contents of the tank in ten minutes. The released chlorine dioxide solution would spread to a minimum depth of 1 centimeter and evaporate to form a vapor cloud. The maximum distance to the toxic end point concentration is approximately 25 miles. The United States Census indicates that 103,000 people live within this distance from the storage tanks; several public receptors are also located within this distance (hospitals, county jails, colleges, several public and private schools, several nursing homes, several churches, several recreation parks, shopping malls and numerous subdivisions).

Beginning in 1992, the facility formalized this prevention program for the Chlorine Dioxide Solution System to comply with the 14 elements of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's Process Safety Management (PSM) prevention program. In 1996, the EPA RMP rule established that a Program Level 3 prevention program would become a requirement for these processes as well.
