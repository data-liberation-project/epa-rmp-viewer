      "SummaryText": "A. Description of Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe Pedricktown Cogeneration Plant is owned by Pedricktown Cogeneration Limited Partnership (PCLP) and operated under contract by Conectiv Operating Services Company (COSC).  The facility utilizes anhydrous ammonia in its Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) air pollution control system.  The ammonia vapors reduce the nitrogen oxide (NOx) content in the gas turbine exhaust.  Generally, the process involves receipt of anhydrous ammonia by way of tanker trucks and storage in a 12,000 gallon storage tank.  The ammonia vapor is mixed with air and then injected into the exhaust stream.  The ammonia is drawn into the injection system from the storage tank through a supply line.\n\nAs a result of this process, anhydrous ammonia is stored at the facility in quantities that exceed the 10,000 pound threshold quantity (TQ) specified by EPA regulations and the 5,200 pound TQ specified by the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection's Toxic Catastrophe Prevention Act (TCPA).  PCLP has one covered process that requires compliance with Program 3 of both the EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) regulation and the New Jersey TCPA regulation.\n\nB. Accidental Release Prevention & Emergency Response Policies of PCLP\n\nPedricktown Cogeneration Limited Partnership is committed to protecting facility personnel, the public and the environment from workplace and accidental release hazards.  Appropriate responses to releases of regulated chemicals are documented in the Emergency Response Program/Plan.\n\nSafety, environmental protection and risk management programs are fully implemented and coordinated with community emergency responders for emergency planning and response efforts.\n\nC. Release Scenario Discussion\n\nThe following offsite consequence analyses were performed in accordance with the requirements of the RMP and TCPA regulations.\n\n? One worst-case release scenario for anhydrous ammonia; and\n? One alternate release "

      "SummaryText": "scenario for anhydrous ammonia.\n\nThe following are brief descriptions of the release scenarios that are being submitted by PCLP in the Risk Management Plan (RMPlan).  PCLP elected to use EPA's RMP Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration Reference Tables to determine the distance to the toxic endpoint. \n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario\n\nFor the purposes of the RMP and TCPA rule, the worst case release scenario, as defined by the USEPA, for the Pedricktown facility assumes the loss of the contents of the ammonia storage tank (53,000 pounds) within 10 minutes. This quantity takes into account written procedures that prevent more than 1,800 gallons from being present in the 12,000 gal tank. Using EPA's RMP Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration Reference Tables, the release was estimated to reach the toxic endpoint for anhydrous ammonia at approximately 4.0 miles from the release location.  Sections 2.12, 2.13 and 2.14 of the RMPlan provide information regarding the residential population, public and environmental receptors located within the distance to the endpoint for this scenario.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario\n\nThe alternative release scenario for anhydrous ammonia was determined to be an outdoor release through a leak/hole in a pipe containing ammonia liquified under pressure. It is estimated that the leak would result in a release rate of less than 10 pounds per minute of anhydrous ammonia.  Using EPA's RMP Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration Reference Tables, the release was estimated to reach the toxic endpoint for anhydrous ammonia at approximately 0.1 miles from the release location. Sections 3.12, 3.13 and 3.14 of the RMPlan provide information regarding the residential population, public and environmental receptors located within the distance to the endpoint for this scenario.\n\nD. Five-year Accident History\n\nUnder the EPA RMP regulations, an accidental release is defined as a release of a regulated substance that \"resulted in deaths, injuries or significant property dama"

Prevention Program Elements\n\nManagement System - A management system has been developed that assigns overall responsibility for the development and implementation of the Risk Management Program (RMProgram) to a qualified individual or position of responsibility.  It clearly delineates accountability and responsibilities for any elements where responsibilities are delegated.\n\nProcess Safety Information - Up-to-date process safety information will be maintained for use by employees operating the covered process in accordance with 40 CFR Part 68.65.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA) with Risk Assessment- A PHA with risk assessment has been performed for the Program 3 covered process at the Pedricktown plant in accordance with 40 CFR Part 68.67 and N.J.A.C. 7:31-4.2.  The PHA was performed using the What-If/Checklist method.  The PHA identified the hazards associated with the ammonia process; causes of potential accidental release scenarios; safeguards used to prevent accidental releases; and methods used to detect, monitor or control accidental releases.  Issues identified during the PHA were documented and addressed in a timely manner. The PHA with risk assessment will continue to be revalidated and updated once every five years.\n\nOperating Procedures - Operating procedures have been developed and will be maintained for the covered process in accordance with 40 CFR Part 68.69 and N.J.A.C. 7:31-4.3.  Operating procedures provide clear instructions for safely conducting activities involving a covered process in a manner consistent with process safety information and are readily accessible to employees involved in a covered process.
