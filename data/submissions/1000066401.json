The objective is to minimize the risk of a release of a hazardous material and if a release occurs, to minimize the potential impact to Ajinomoto Foods employees, the public and the environment.This objective will be accomplished by utilizing general good operating procedures, providing appropriate training to all employees, and coordinating response activities, as necessary, with the local response providers. This plan covers all Ajinomoto Foods owned activities at this facility.\n\nAjinomoto Foods management is committed to providing the resources necessary to implement this policy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacility Description: Ajinomoto Foods operates a food processing facility at this location. Ajinomoto Foods is a producer of Asian potstickers, batter fried and batter breaded  vegetable  & cheese appetizer  products. Support operations include cold storage, an analytical laboratory, and administrative offices.\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo chemicals are utilized at the facility in quantities to be subject to the requirements of 40 CFR Part 68. These chemicals are Ammonia and Propane. Ammonia is used as a refrigerant throughout the facility and propane fuel is used as a primary fuel supply for processing equipment and heating purposes. The worst case scenario for an anhydrous ammonia release included a release of all the contents of the high-pressure reciever in a ten minute period. The alternate-release scenario selected for the ammonia system  is a release from a relief valve due to overpressure of a condensing unit.The largest relief valve in the system was used in this scenario, with a relief rate of 57.6 pounds of air per minute.

The Carthage, Missouri facility is governed by a set of OSHA and USEPA regulations that require planning and facility activities intended to prevent a release of hazardous material, or if a release inadvertently occurs, to minimize the consequences of a release to the employees of the facility, the public, and the environment. The key concepts in Ajinomoto Foods release prevention program are employee participation, appropriate design, and maintenance of equipment, and appropriate training of all employees. Ajinomoto Foods has developed and documented these elements in their process safety management plan (PSM)."
