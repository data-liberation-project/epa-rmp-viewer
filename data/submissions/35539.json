(Evans Harvey) are committed to employee, public and environmental safety. This commitment is inherent to our comprehensive accidental release prevention program which covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  If such a release does occur, our trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  \n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe Evans Harvey facility's primary activity is the warehousing of chemicals. Evans Harvey warehouses up to 2 RMP-regulated substances at our facility.  These substances are listed below.  Evans Harvey receives the regulated substances in bulk and stores the products.  Drummed products are either warehoused or shipped, depending on customer specifications.  The inventories of RMP-regulated substances at the facility are dependent upon customer orders, and not all regulated substances are present on site at a given time.  The following summarizes (1) the RMP-regulated toxic and flammable substances that may exceed the RMP threshold quantity at the facility, (2) the Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) numbers associated with the regulated substances, and (3) the maximum quantities of RMP-regulated substances that may be at the facility:\n\nRMP Toxic Substance          CAS No.        Maximum Quantity (pounds)\n\nEthylenediamine                   107-15-3         710,000\n\nRMP Flammable Substance\n\nIsopropylamine                       75-31-0         530,000\n\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\n\nEvans Harvey is the operator of a stationary source that has"

The RMP-regulated process at the Evans Harvey facility is subject to the Program 2 requirements of the RMP rule.  The Program Level 2 requirements apply because the worst-case scenario for the process reaches nearby public receptors (e.g., industrial neighbors) and the process is (1) not subject to OSHA's process safety management (PSM) standard (29 CFR 1910.119) and (2) not associated with any of the high risk North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes listed in the RMP rule.\n\nThe RMP rule requires that an offsite consequence analysis be performed for hypothetical releases of RMP-regulated substances at the facility.  For Program 2 processes, the RMP rule requires that one worst-case release scenario be presented in the risk management plan for each hazard class (i.e., one toxic scenario and one flammable scenario).  The RMP rule also requires that more likely release scenarios, referred to as alternative release scenarios, be presented in the risk management plan.  One alternative release scenario must be presented for each RMP-regulated toxic substance at the facility, and one alternative release scenario must be presented for the RMP-regulated flammable substances collectively.\n\nIn performing the offsite consequence analysis of the worst-case and alternative release scenarios, Evans Harvey used EPA's RMP*Comp software.  RMP*Comp is based on the look-up tables and equations provided in EPA's \"Risk Management Program Guidance for Offsite Consequence Analysis.\"\n\nWorst-case Release Scenarios\n\nFor the RMP-regulated toxic substances, the worst-case scenario is a release of 403 pounds (one drum) of a liquid ethylenediamine inside a warehouse building. The released liquid forms an evaporating pool.  The toxic vapor cloud generated by the evaporating pool is expected to reach offsite locations.\n\nFor the RMP-regulated flammab"

The released material ignites, resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  The pressure wave resulting from the explosion is expected to reach offsite locations. \n\nAlternative Release Scenarios\n\nFor the RMP-regulated toxic substances, only one alternative release scenario is required to be reported in the risk management plan.  The alternative release scenario for ethylenediamine is a release of 200 pounds of liquid from a drum over a 5-minute period (the time required for the operator to orient the drum to stop the leak).  The released liquid forms an evaporating pool inside the warehouse building.  The toxic vapor cloud generated by the evaporating pool is not expected to reach offsite locations.\n\nFor the RMP-regulated flammable substances, only one alternative release scenario is required to be reported in the risk management plan.  A spill of 610 pounds (two drums) of isopropylamine in the warehouse building is selected as the alternative release scenario.  The liquid pool formed by the release ignites, resulting in a pool fire.  The thermal radiation generated by the pool fire is not expected to reach offsite locations.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND THE CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nEvans Harvey has taken the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements of the RMP rule (40 CFR 68).  The repackaging and warehouse processes at our facility are subject to EPCRA Section 302 notification requirements.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nSafety Information\n\nEvans Harvey maintains a record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters, and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\nHazard Review\n\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that ha"

The studies are undertaken by a team of personnel with experience in engineering and process operations and are revalidated on a regular basis or when there is a change in the process.  Any findings related to the hazard review are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Evans Harvey maintains written standard operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown, and startup after maintenance.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nTraining\n\nEvans Harvey has a training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with those processes.  New employees receive training and are tested for competency before starting work.  Refresher training is provided on a regular basis and more frequently as needed.\n\nMaintenance\n\nEvans Harvey carries out documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes pressure valves, hoses and piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls, and pumps.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a timely manner.\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nEvans Harvey will conduct audits on a regular basis to ensure that the facility remains in compliance with the RMP rule requirements.

These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere have been no onsite or offsite releases in the past 5 years at the Evans Harvey facility that are required to be reported in the risk management plan.\n\nEMERGENCY PLANNING AND RESPONSE\n\nEvans Harvey has a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials.  The plan includes all aspects of emergency response, including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident return to work procedures.\n\nTo ensure proper functioning, our emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced.  In addition, the plan is updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within our processes that would require a modified emergency response.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nSince the implementation of the various elements of our accidental release prevention program, there have been no developments or findings that indicate the immediate need to improve safety at our facility.  We have a continuous improvement policy in place that includes safety issues."
