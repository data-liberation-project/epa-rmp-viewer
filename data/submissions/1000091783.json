Accidental release prevention and emergency response polices at Galata Chemicals Taft Facility. \n\nThe facility is committed to ensuring the safety of the St. Charles Parish Community by the implementation of the accident prevention and emergency response procedures. Galata Chemicals' Taft Facility follows the principals of  RC 14001 and ISO 14001 for its Environmental, Safety, and Security Management Systems. Galata Chemicals, LLC follows its Environmental, Health and Safety Policy which dictates senior management's commitment to protecting its employees and the surrounding community.\n\n\n\n2. Regulated Substances Handled at Galata Chemicals Taft Facility.\n\nGalata Chemicals employs approximately 130 people who live and work in the St. Charles Parish area. This facility has been in business at the same location since 1966. The facility produces plastic additives including epoxidized vegetable oils, organo-tin stabilizers, sulfur compounds, and mixed metal stabilizers. Our products are used in Louisiana and globally in the production of plastics and polymers used on a daily basis. The facility has two toxic chemicals in threshold quantities affected by the RMP rule - ammonia (anhydrous) and methyl chloride. The covered processes are the DMT process and MMP/Tin Stabilizer Process. MMP and Tin Stabilizers are treated as one covered process because they all utilize a single anhydrous storage vessel, inter-connected by process piping. Thiocyanates (SCN) was decommissioned in 2010. \n\n\n\n3. Accident Release Prevention Program and chemical-specific prevention steps. \n\nThe facility implements OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) rules to minimize chemical process accidents. The key to these process management practices are:\n\n- Collection and maintenance of process safety information\n\n- Process hazard analysis studies conducted with employee participation\n\n- Mechanical integrity testing of the process equipment\n\n- Operating procedu"

Five year accident history\n\nGalata Chemicals is required to compile an accident release history for the RMP listed chemicals for the past five years. According to the RMP rule, an accidental release is defined as one that resulted in death, injuries, significant property damage, evacuations, shelter-in-place, or environmental damage. The Taft facility has had no RMP releases over the past five years.\n\n\n\n5. Emergency Response Program\n\nGalata Chemicals has documented emergency response procedures to respond to various emergency situations, including fire/explosion, hazardous material releases, medical emergencies, severe weather, bomb threats, etc. One of the key features of the facility response program is the dedicated phone system tied to the St. Charles Parish Emergency Operation Center (EOS). The EOC can call in assistance from the Parish Police, Fire Department, Hospitals and adjacent chemical facilities to mitigate and control emergency situations. The EOC can also take protective measures and alert the community as to the steps to take in response to emergency situations. Galata Chemicals  emergency teams include Fire Brigade, Haz Mat technicians, and Medical First Responders. Galata Chemicals is an active member of the St. Charles Parish Mutual Aid Group.\n\n\n\n6. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nTraining: Safety training is scheduled on a monthly basis. Emergency response personnel (fire brigade, haz mat technicians, confined space rescue teams) are re-trained on an annual basis. Medical teams are trained every two years. Incident Command training is conducted every two years. Galata is rebuilding it's EHSS staff and implementing an "
