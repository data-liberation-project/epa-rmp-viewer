All of us are responsible and accountable for adhering to the letter and spirit of this policy. All of us must incorporate safety, health, and environmental considerations into our daily business activities. It takes a total team effort to truly be a Responsible Care company.\n\nFacility Description:\nThe primary activity at the Portland Plant is the manufacture of chemical additives, including wet strength resins, that are used in the pulp and paper industry.  Epichlorohydrin, is used in the production of wet-strength resins. These resins are used to improve the wet-strength characteristics in a variety of paper applications.  Epichlorohydrin is a raw material for the process and is consumed in a chemical reaction to make the product.  The plant primarily receives Epichlorohydrin in tank cars however there is the capability of receiving tank trucks.  Epichlorohydrin is stored in a tank that holds a maximum of 307,700 pounds; the storage tank is provided with a containment dike and leak detectors to minimize adverse impacts from any leaks or spills.  Spill containment capability is also provided for the area where tank trucks and rail cars are unloaded.\n\nWorst-Case Scenario:\nThe Portland Plant is reporting two worst-case scenarios.  Both scenarios include the complete failure of an entire rail car containing 223,000 of Epichlorohydrin and both scenarios were analyzed using EPA's OCAG lookup tables.  This first scenario gives a distance to the EPA toxic endpoint of 4.2 miles.  This scenario is not limited to any containment  and corresponds to a release on rail tracks leased by Hercules.  The second scenario gives a distance to the EPA toxic endpoint of 3.6 miles; however this scenario is limited by the provisions of d"

In addition, both scenarios require the extremely unlikely event of a catastrophic failure of the rail cars.  \n\nAlternative Case Scenario:\nThe alternative case scenario for Epichlorohydrin is a pipe leak (flange) in the process area that results in the release of 222 pounds of Epichlorohydrin.  This scenario gives a distance to the EPA toxic endpoint of 0.06 miles based EPA's OCAG lookup tables.  The impact from this scenario is mitigated by containment in the process area.  In addition, operating procedures and process monitors will limit the duration of leakage.\n\nAccident Prevention Program:\nThe process is subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management standard (29 CFR 1910.119) and has a complete process safety management system in place.  This includes the use  of process hazards analysis to identify and address potential hazards, management of change procedures to control modifications, mechanical integrity procedures for minimizing mechanical failures, detailed operating procedures for process control, and operator training for the personnel involved in the process.\n\nFive Year Accident History:\nIn the past five years, the Portland Plant has not had any accidental releases of Epichlorohydrin that have resulted in on-site injuries or damage or any off-site impacts.\n\nEmergency Response Program:\nThe Portland Plant has a written emergency response plan and coordinates emergency response matters with the Portland Fire Bureau.  In addition, the plant is an active participant in a mutual support group that includes other companies and agencies in Portland.  The plant has provided emergency response training for all plant employees and has a trained emergency response team."
