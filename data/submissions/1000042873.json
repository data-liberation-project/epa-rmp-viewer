              "Description": "Ammonia is a strong caustic yet relatively stable substance, reacts violently with strong acids.  Reactions with bromine, chlorine, fluorine, iodine, gold, silver or mercury can form potentially explosive mixtures.  Ammonia bulk storage tanks are stored where the tanks are not directly adjacent to other chemicals.  Concrete pylons have been placed around the tanks to prevent them from being accidentally struck.  A physical safety inspection is conducted monthly.  If corrosion is noted, valves are replaced.  Tanks are painted as scheduled.  Two tanks are in place although only one is utilized.  The tank is only filed to 85% capacity and if a problem should occur with one tank, the chemical can be transferred to the adjacent empty tank.  Sensors are in place in the ammonia feed area to monitor alarms.  Employees can be notified of a leak via audible alarms, panic pager and control panel through the S.C.A.D.A. system.",

      "SummaryText": "At the Richmond Road Station, Kentucky American Water (KYAW) handles chlorine and ammonia for the purpose of disinfecting and treating drinking water.  OSHA and USEPA consider chlorine and ammonia as hazardous chemicals.  The hazards of these chemicals make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in the use and handling to prevent unnecessaryhuman exposure, to reduce the threat to our own personal health as well as our co-workers, and to reduce the threat to nearby members of the community.  It is KYAW policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and State rules and regulations.  Safety depends on the manner chlorine and ammonia are handled and used, combined with the safety devices inherent in the design along with operating procedures and the training of our personnel.\n\n\n\nThe facility's emergency response plan is based upon OSHA 1910.38 (Employee Emergency Plans) and 1910.120 (Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response) and experience obtained from community emergency drills.  The facility's emergency response plan is reviewed annually and audited once per 3 years.\n\n\n\nThe Risk Management Plan must be updated and resubmitted every 5 years and/or within 30 days of any change that requires changing the process hazard analysis, the Offsite Consequence Analysis, or USEPA RMP Prevention program.  If a new regulated chemical is introduced above a threshold quantity, a revised submittal is required no later than the date the chemical is first present.  If the inventory of chemicals drops below the USEPA RMP thresholds, a frvised RMP regirstation indicating the change must be submitted within 6 months.\n\n\n\nThe Richmond Road Station water treatment plant has had no reportable releases of ammonia or chlorine in the last 5 years."
