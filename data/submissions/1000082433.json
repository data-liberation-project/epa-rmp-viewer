The Kenova LP Terminal is an on-shore, light products, bulk petroleum storage terminal used in the storage and distribution of petroleum products to retail and commercial end-users in the vicinity of Kenova, WV. The Terminal handles and stores various grades of unleaded gasoline, low sulfur diesel/#2 fuel oil, butane, ethanol, and various other petroleum based additives.\n\n\n\nKenova LP Terminal is committed to operating and maintaining processes in a safe, reliable and environmentally sound manner. MPLX believes that excellent performance in health, safety, and the environment goes hand in hand with operating reliably, and that outstanding HES performance is of paramount importance.\n\n\n\nThe Terminal is designed, operated and maintained in a manner that protects the environment, as well as the health and safety of its employees, contractors and the community. MPLX promotes health, safety, and the environment through programs of awareness, compliance, prevention and protection. These programs include a combination of accidental release prevention and emergency response planning. This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that MPLX has designed and implemented, including:\n\n\n\nA. A description of the facility and the use of regulated substances\n\nB. An overview of the accidental release prevention programs\n\nC. A five-year accident history for accidental releases of regulated chemicals\n\nD. An overview of the emergency response program\n\nE. An overview of planned changes to improve safety\n\n\n\nA. STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n\n\nThe primary function of the Kenova LP Terminal, located in Kenova, WV is to act as a refined petroleum distribution facility. The butane batch blending process has been classified as Program Level 3. No Program 1 or 2 processes containing regulated substances were "

By virtue of the flammable effects associated with butane, it is necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling butane to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to employee health, and to minimize the threat and impact to nearby members of the community. Kenova LP Terminal is strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety and health. Safety at the Facility depends upon the manner in which butane is handled as well as the various safety devices incorporated into the design of the process. Furthermore, comprehensive training is provided to employees, which reinforces the safety policies and procedures of the Butane Batch Blending Process.\n\n\n\nButane Batch Blending is a batch type process based on seasonal RVP adjustments. Butane is received by truck (transports), stored on-site, and piped directly to injection points feeding the dock and off-site locations. Process safety controls include \"Smart-hoses\", low emission couplers, emergency shutoff valves throughout (manual, automated and thermally actuated), vessel PRVs, excess flow valves, hydrostatic pressure relief, and process area hydrocarbon detectors along with on-site fire water monitors. Access to the Kenova LP Terminal and butane offload/storage area is restricted to authorized employees, management personnel and authorized contractors/visitors.\n\n\n\nB. GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION MEASURES\n\n\n\nThe Kenova LP Terminal accidental release prevention programs and emergency planning/response programs help Marathon effectively manage the hazards posed by the regulated substances to the Terminal employees, surrounding public, and environment. The covered process is regulated by the EPA RMP regulation 40 CFR Part 68, as well as the OSHA Process Safety Management standard 29 CFR 1910.119.

Marathon and its employees are committed to the standards required by these management programs. In addition to the above elements, MPLX also has specific prevention measures that are employed as part of the Terminal's operating procedures and engineering and administrative controls to help identify/contain/control a release, and reduce the consequences of a release. These are briefly summarized as follows:\n\n\n\nGeneral Risk Reduction and Safety Measures\n\n\n\n-Engineering and construction in accordance with recognized industry and company standards;\n\n-Equipment properly designed with protection from overpressure (pressure safety relief valves, etc.);\n\n-Updated technical drawings, Piping & Instrument Diagrams and Process/Block Flow Diagrams;\n\n-Operating systems monitored and controlled by trained Operators;\n\n-Redundant control systems;\n\n-Manual shutdown devices for critical systems;\n\n-Scheduled inspection and testing of safety devices;\n\n-Limited/secured facility access;\n\n-Regular safety meetings and safety awareness programs;\n\n-Routinely scheduled safety inspections and audits; and\n\n-Frequent unit surveillance by operators.\n\n\n\nGeneral Release Mitigation\n\n\n\n-Process and remotely operated shutoffs to limit release quantity (also actuated via a fusible\n\nelement);\n\n-Excess Flow Valves;\n\n-Hydrocarbon Detectors with automatic process shutdown function; \n\n-Strategically located valves to isolate leaks; and\n\n-\"Smart-Hose"

FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nThe Kenova LP Terminal has an excellent record of accident prevention. The Terminal keeps records for all incidental and significant chemical releases inclusive of any root cause analyses and associated, follow-up actions. This is a \"new\" butane batch blending process; consequently, there have been no accidents within the past five (5) years resulting from the release of materials covered under the EPA RMP regulation.\n\n\n\nD.
