Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies:\n\nIn this manufacturing facility, we handle  Ammonium Hydroxide  (Aqua Ammonia above 20% by weight analysis of  Ammonia)  which is considered hazardous by EPA.  This product is a well-known nitrogen fertilizer which is used through out Eastern Washington.  The management and employees of Lenroc Company who operate the plant facility are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of Ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the Ephrata Fire Department,  Grant County Emergency Services, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2.  Facility Information\n\n    *  The primary activity at the facility is the production of a cattle feed supplement. Aqua  Ammonia is co-produced during  this production and is used as a nitrogen fertilizer.  Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel and authorized contractors.\n   *   The  regulated substance handled at this facility  is  Ammonia (20% or higher in water solution)\n   *   The maximum quantity stored at the facility  would be  600,000 gallons  of   24.5% Aqua  Ammonia in \n         two tanks  (300,000 gallons each tank)  during the period  March 1  to  July 1  each year.\n\n3.   The worst-case release scenario and the  alternative release scenario.\n\n    *   Worst-case:   The worst-case  scenario would be the release of 300,000  gallons of  Aqua  Ammonia\n         into  a  100 ft  by 160 ft  passive containment pond (with liner).  Release of ammonia gas from the \n        pond surface area  of 16,000 square feet  (24.5%  ammonia in water)   would give an endpoint of .30\n       miles  to a dispersi"

      "SummaryText": "on point of  200 ppm.\n\n   *   Alternative:    250 gallons  (2,000 pounds)  of  24.5%  Aqua  Ammonia  is spilled in truck loading.  This\n        release would give an endpoint of  .09  miles to a dispersion point of  200 ppm.\n\n4.  The general accidental release prevention program\n\nThis facility complies with  EPA's  Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations.  Employees are trained in the safe storage and handling of Aqua  Ammonia.\n\n5.  The Five-year  accident  history\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of Aqua Ammonia in the past five years that have caused any deaths, injuries, property damage, evacuations, or environmental damage at the facility or offsite. \n\n6.  The emergency response program.\n\n     The facility has\n     *  a written emergency action plan and spill response plan in accordance with Washington State Code.\n\n    *  provided state and local authorities emergency planning and community right-to-know information as \n        required under SARA  Title  III  (EPCRA).\n\n    *  a written emergency response program in accordance with Washington State Code , including\n         pre-emergency planning and employee training.\n\n   *  conducted facility tours involving the  Ephrata Fire Department and Grant County Emergency Services\n\n7.  Planned changes to improve safety\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no additional specific Aqua  Ammonia  safety recommendations at this time."
