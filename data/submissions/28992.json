AmeriGas also has six Regional Safety Managers, an Operations Safety Manager, a Safety & Technology Manager and a Logistics & Supply Safety Manager strategically located throughout the United States.  Terminal locations are staffed with a Regional Logistics Manager, who has received extensive safety management training.  These safety professionals are able to immediately respond to a serious incident and provide technical expertise to emergency response agencies on the scene of the incident.  AmeriGas also has a 24 hours-a-day Emergency Communications Center, which handles all after-hours and emergency calls from around the country.  Located in Rocklin, California, the ECC has the ability to contact AmeriGas field personnel on any type of incident encountered at any AmeriGas location, or by AmeriGas customers.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention\n\nAt this facility we store and distribute propane.  The same properties that make propane valuable as a fuel also make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling propane to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce potential hazards to our own personal health and safety as well as our co-workers and to reduce the potential hazard to nearby members of the community.  It is our Company?s policy to adhere to all applicable Fe"

Propane is primarily used by our customers as a fuel.  Propane is received by transport truck and rail cars, and stored in bulk storage tanks.  Propane is distributed to wholesale customers and other AmeriGas locations by bobtails, transport trucks and rail cars.  This facility has specialized equipment for unloading and loading propane.  Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel and authorized contractors.\n\nThe regulated substance handled at this facility is propane.\n\nThe maximum amount of propane that can be stored at this facility is 4,498,200 pounds.\n\nWorst-Case Scenario and Alternative Scenario\n\nInformation concerning the worst-case scenario and alternative scenario for this facility are contained in the appropriate sections of the Risk Management Plan.\n\nEmergency Response Plan, Accidental Release Program and Specific Prevention Steps:\n\nThis AmeriGas propane storage and distribution facility complies with the EPA?s Accidental Release Prevention Rule and all applicable Federal, State and local codes and regulations.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-58.  All of our drivers have been thoroughly trained using the National Propane Gas Association?s Certified Employee Training Program (CETP).
