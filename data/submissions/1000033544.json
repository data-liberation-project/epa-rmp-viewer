The facility is staffed year-round and also employs a large seasonal workforce during certain portions of the year; normally June through October. The facility processes and stores frozen vegetables using anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant in a closed-loop system.  The plant has been operating safely since 1960. \n\nChemical of Concern\n\nThe facility uses anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant in a closed-loop system to cool, freeze and store vegetable products.  Ammonia is the safest refrigerant available and has excellent warning properties; it is extremely pungent at levels far below dangerous concentrations. \n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program \n\nTwin City Foods implements a prevention program to comply with the requirements of the Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (29 CFR 1910.119 and WAC 296-67), which is designed to prevent accidental releases of all chemicals held in quantities over given thresholds.  The PSM program addresses all required elements including employee participation, process safety information and system drawings, operating procedures, hot work permits, management of change, mechanical integrity, training, pre-startup review, compliance audits, process hazard analysis, contractor safety, incident investigation and emergency response.  The system has built in safety features including high level controls and indicators, pressure relief valves, automatic and manually controlled valves and shutoffs, check valves, leak detectors and emergency shutdown devices.\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nPer the requirements of 40 CFR 68.42, facilities must include a five-year accident history for a"

      "SummaryText": "ll accidental releases from covered processes that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.There has been one incident at this facility in the past five years (2/22/2009) that resulted in water contamination, although no actual environmental damage was noted.  There is some ambiguity as to whether this incident needs to be reported, however to take a conservative approach the release was reported and is documented.  \n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nThe Twin City Foods Ellensburg facility maintains a written emergency response plan per 29 CFR 1910.119 and WAC 296-824-100 to facilitate safe response to accidental ammonia releases.  The plan identifies personnel designated and trained to conduct the necessary duties during a response.  Responsibilities include notification of and communication with local responders and authorities, coordinating and conducting responses, as well as maintenance of emergency equipment and trained personnel.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nSafety at the facility is improved continuously through the process hazard analysis process, safety meetings, employee suggestions, accident, incident and near-miss investigations, and as the result of internal and external audits and inspections. Upgrades will be planned on an ongoing basis as needed to keep the system in safe working order.\n\n\n\n"
