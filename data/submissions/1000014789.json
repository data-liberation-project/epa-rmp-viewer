This pre-polymer is then converted to a high molecular weight polymer by reacting it with two amines, diethylamine (DEA), a chain stopper, and ethylenediamine (EDA), a chain extender in static and dynamic mixers.  After stabilization and filtration the higher molecular weight material is spun using the dry spinning process and the solvents are recovered and reused.\n    AKSA has previously maintained onsite EDA storage at quantities less than the 20,000 pounds Risk Management Plan (RMP) threshold value.  AKSA plans to store greater than 20,000 pounds of EDA onsite and therefore is required to prepare a RMP as required by the Chemical Accidental Release Prevention Provisions.\n    AKSA has established comprehensive accidental release prevention and emergency response policies for the Goose Creek, South Carolina facility.  AKSA has implemented numerous fail safe measures to minimize the possibility of an accidental release.  Additionally, AKSA has established a detailed emergency response plan that includes an emergency communication system and plant emergency alarm system.  \n    The following is a description of the stationary source and regulated substance handled:\n    Primary Activity:    Synthetic elastic fiber manufacturing\n    Regulated Substance:    Ethylenediamine (EDA)\n    Quantities Handled/Stored:     EDA Storage Tank (22.3 tons)\n        EDA Drum Storage (2.5 tons)\n    AKSA is in compliance with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Rule and Chemical Accidental Release Prevention Provisions (CARPP) Rule.
