The Hazardous Communication Program has been incorporated into the Risk Management Program to help evaluate the needs of our facility. Informal training sessions with employees on response to an emergency has prepared them to respond in a safe manner. Our facility is a Wastewater Treatment plant and the wastewater is chlorinated for disinfection. One ton containers of chlorine are used in this process and there are usually between one and two containers on site. The two containers can be manifolded at the same time. One is in use while the other is on stand by. the worst case scenario at this facility would be the release of a one ton container. Vacuum regulators are in place on each container. The chlorine system is inspected on a yearly basis . There has never been a chlorine release that could not be routinely handled. The employees at the treatment facility have been trained to respond to leaks and are knowledgable of the emergency agencies to notify if a leak cannot be contained immediatly."
