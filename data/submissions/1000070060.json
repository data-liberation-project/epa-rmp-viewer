Within this program, each existing covered process and future processes are systematically examined.\n\n\n\nDNLA primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations. HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques available. The analyses are conducted using a team of personnel who exhibit operating, maintenance and process engineering experience and expertise. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as recommends accident prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are warranted.\n\n\n\nDNLA periodically updates its process hazard analyses of affected units. These periodic reviews will be conducted at least every five years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating. \n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\n\n\nDNLA maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process. These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.

In addition, the DNLA operating procedures provide guidance on how to respond to events that result in exceeding safe operating limits for specific process or equipment parameters. The written operating procedures are readily available to operators in the process units and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\n\n\n\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, DNLA has implemented a training program for all employees involved in operating a process. New employees receive basic training in DNLA operations if they are not already familiar with such operations. After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks. After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently. In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures in order to maintain skills and knowledge at an acceptable level. \n\n\n\nContractors\n\n\n\n\n\nDNLA uses contractors to supplement its work force during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities. Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, DNLA has procedures in place to provide that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform DNLA personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.

DNLA personnel monitor contractor performance to evaluate the level at which contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\n\n\nPre-Startup Safety Reviews\n\n\n\nDNLA conducts a pre-startup safety review for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information. This review provides that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service. This review provides one additional check to corroborate that construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready. The review team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness. A review involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\n\n\nDNLA makes use of established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition. The basic aspects of this program include: \n\n\n\n?    conducting training, \n\n?    developing written procedures, \n\n?    performing inspections and tests, \n\n?    correcting identified deficiencies, and \n\n?    applying quality assurance measures. \n\n\n\nIn combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process equipment.\n\n\n\nMaintenance personnel receive training on \n\n?    an overview of the process, \n\n?    safety and health hazards, \n\n?    applicable maintenance procedures, \n\n?    emergency response plans, and \n\n?    applicable safe work practices to help ensure that they can perform their job in a safe manner. \n\n\n\nWritten procedures are used in order that work is performed in a consistent manner and provide a basis for training.

If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service (if possible), or a management of change team will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment.\n\n\n\nAnother integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance. DNLA incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs. This practice assesses suitability of new equipment for its intended use and establishes that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.\n\n\n\nManagement of Change\n\n\n\nDNLA has a comprehensive system to manage changes to processes. This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented. Changes are reviewed to ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards, and verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.

Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are retained.  \n\n\n\n\n\nHot Work Permit\n\n\n\nThe facility's hot work procedure requires that detailed permitting activities take place before, during, and after any job that has the potential to provide a source of ignition. The permit is followed through to completion of the work and those permits are maintained on-site. The facility implements other work permits as necessary to ensure safe work conditions are communicated to maintenance and contract personnel.\n\n\n\nSafe Work Practices\n\n\n\nDNLA has safe work practices in place to sustain worker and process safety. Examples of these include (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous materials before process piping or equipment is opened, (4) a permit and procedure to control welding and other spark-producing activities, and (5) a permit and procedure to ensure"

      "SummaryText": " that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space. These procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to foster that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\n\n\n\nChemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nThe processes at the facility have hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation. The accident prevention program summarized previously is applied to the facility. Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios of releases of RMP regulated chemicals caused by equipment failures or human errors.\n\n\n\nAdditional Safety Features\n\n\n\nIn addition to the accident prevention program activities, the facility has many safety features to help prevent the accidental releases of regulated substances in the facility. These safety features help to prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human error. These features include but are not limited to: \n\n\n\n?    Operating parameter monitors with alarms\n\n?    Process relief systems\n\n?    Isolation valves (manual or automated)\n\n\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\n\n\nDNLA's accident history is included in Section 6 of the RMP. Since DNLA is a relatively new site that has recently started operations, there is no relevant accident history to report at this time. In accordance with the requirements of 40 CFR 68.42, information relating to any accidental release that results in death, injury, significant property damage, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage will be documented for the facility and provided in future RMP submittals.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\n\n\nDNLA's emergency response program is set forth in its Emergency Procedures Manual. That manual is comprised of numerous relevant sections. Those sections deal with, but are not limited to:\n\n\n\n?    Employee participation \n\n?    Incident command management\n\n?    R"

Also, DNLA's pre-startup safety review includes, among other things, 'show stoppers' that prohibit any startup until those items are closed. DNLA assigns respective tasks resulting from each of these mechanisms to responsible persons, and closure is approved only after all recommendations and action items are documented complete.\n\n"
