This philosophy involves making each and every employee and contractor accountable for their own safety as well as that of the community around them.  As a company we follow a close adherence to all applicable federal, state, and local laws to ensure a safe and healthy environment for all.\n\n\n\nEmployees who enter the Beckville Plant complete a thorough training, both in the classroom and on-the-job, that enables them to address emergency issues as they arise.  This preparation includes standard operational, emergency operational, and release prevention training.  In addition, periodic refresher courses help to keep operators' problem solving abilities up to date and in sync with our recurring safety improvements.  Our regular internal audits provide an excellent checks and balances system for monitoring these high standards that we set.\n\n\n\nThe Beckville Plant, located in rural Panola County, Texas, operates a variety of processes to recover petroleum products (e.g., natural gas, natural gas liquids, condensate) from field gas. This plant consists of a cryogenic processing unit, an amine treating unit, a glycol dehydration unit and residue electric compression.  Gas flows through an inlet separator where pipeline liquids are dropped out. The gas from the inlet separator is then treated to remove acid gas (CO2) and dehydrated before entering the cryogenic processing unit where a 16,000 gallon surge tank is utilized for processing.  Natural gas liquids (NGL) produced from the cryogenic processing unit are sent out of the plant by pipeline.  There are no threshold quantities of toxic substances present.  The facility also has multiple small storage tanks including methanol, lube oil, waste oil, produced water/slop oil and their associated piping, valves, and pum"

As such, the Beckville Plant is classified as a Program 3 RMP facility.\n\n\n\nThe purpose of the Risk Management Plan (RMPlan) is to provide information about our operations at the facility, our programs to prevent accidental chemical releases, our emergency response plans in case an accidental release should occur, our 5-year accident history, and our planned changes to improve safety at the facility.  \n\n\n\nWorst Case and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\n\n\nAs specified by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) RMP Regulations, our worst-case release scenario for flammables would be the loss of all of the liquids in our largest vessel causing a vapor cloud explosion.  In the case of the Beckville Plant, this would involve the 16,000 gallon flammable natural gas liquids surge tank (47,546 pounds of NGL).  Such a scenario is highly unlikely; however, using the EPAs RMP*Comp &trade; calculations, the distance at which the resulting vapor cloud explosion could cause an overpressure of 1 psi would be approximately 0.3 miles (approximately 1,750 feet).  An overpressure of 1 psi is the EPA's threshold for measurable impacts. \n\n\n\nThe alternative release scenario characterized as a more likely scenario that would involve offsite consequences is calculated to reach approximately 0.2 miles (approximately 582 feet) from the release point.  This distance calculation is also based on the EPAs RMP*Comp &trade;, which is known to be highly conservative and should over predict any potential release from such a scenario.  We have selected the alternative release scenario based on a release from the 16,000 gallon NGL surge tank due to a four inch puncture of the tank and a release of 47,350 pounds of NGL in 5 minutes resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  This incident could occur if vehicle traffic impacts the tank resulting in piping damage.  As a method of preventing such events, signs and barriers are posted in conspicuous locations"

Barriers are in place to prevent trucks from hitting tanks.\n\n\n\nEnbridge has discussed these potential hydrocarbon releases with its employees and with local emergency response officials in Panola County, thereby further reducing the possibility of any impact on the public.  \n\n\n\nPrevention Program\n\n\n\nBelow is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the Beckville Plant.  Because the processes at the facility are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) Risk Management Program (RMP) and are also subject to the OSHA PSM, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation:  Active employee participation and involvement in the development and implementation of Beckville Plant's PSM program is an important step toward achieving the objective to prevent or minimize the consequences of catastrophic releases of toxic, reactive, flammable, or explosive chemicals.  Employee involvement will help to ensure that all perspectives regarding PSM are considered, and that the best ideas are implemented.  Open communications are encouraged between supervisors and employees regarding all safety and health issues.  Beckville Plant strongly promotes employee imvolvement in safety issues through existing programs.  These programs include Unit Safety Teams (which are made up of a cross section of employees and supervision), regularly scheduled safety meetings, tail-gate safety meetings, Hazard Communication, Safety Suggestion Forms, and special training programs (Emergency Response Training, First Aid, etc.). \n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information:  Complete and accurate written process safety information (PSI) concerning process chemicals, process technology, and process equipment is essential to an effective PSM and RMP program and to completing and maintaining a process hazard analysis (PH"

The PSI will be useful to the operators; the team performing the PHA; those in charge of training; contractors; those conducting pre-startup safety reviews; and those in charge of updating the emergency preparedness plans.  Process safety information is readily available to all employees.  Beckville Plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the process.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  Chemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response / exposure treatment consideration, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs).\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA):  Beckville Plant has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.  The facility primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) method analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.  Periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.  \n\n\n\nOperating Procedures:  Beckville Plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, normal shutdown, and initial startup of a new process.  These procedures provide guidance for experienced operators and also provide the bas"

The review and certification process involves both operators and technical staff.  \n\n\n\nTraining:  In addition to training on operating procedures, the facility has a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating the process.  New employees receive basic training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skill and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years.  All of this training is documented for each operator including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.  \n\n\n\nContractors:  Beckville Plant uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the facility has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have appropriate skills, (3) are aware of the hazards of their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site specific safety rules, and (6) inform facility personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.  This is accomplished by providing contractors with orientation sessions pertaining to these key points.  \n\n\n\nPre-startup Safety Review (PSSR):  Beckville Plant conducts a PSSR on any new facility or facility modifications that require a change in process safety information.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.

      "SummaryText": "ange.  \n\n\n\nIncident Investigation:  Beckville Plant promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in or reasonably could have resulted in a fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury.  The goal of each investigation is to gather the facts, determine the root cause, and develop corrective action to prevent the reoccurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a reoccurrence, and forwards these results to the business management team for resolution.  \n\n\n\nCompliance Audits:  To help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, the Beckville Plant periodically conducts an audit to determine whether procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented.  Compliance audits are conducted at least every 3 years.  Both hourly and staff personnel participate as audit team members.  The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to Beckville Plant management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are retained.  \n\n\n\nFive-year Accident History\n\n\n\nNo incident resulting in onsite or offsite impacts from a hydrocarbon release has occurred at the Beckville Plant within the last five years.  Although we take pride in that record, we also place daily emphasis on our prevention and safety programs to ensure this record continues.  \n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\n\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving our natural gas liquid extraction, LP-Gas handling and storage facility, it is our policy to follow our Emergency Action Plan, which is linked with the Panola County Emergency Management District Emergency Response Plan.  Activation of this emergency response plan sets in motion a pre-planned series of events tha"
