      "SummaryText": "DAIRY FARMERS OF AMERICA\nCabool, MO  \nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n1.0 Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nDairy Farmers of America located in Cabool, Missouri (DFA-Cabool) is\ncommitted to the protection of the safety, health, and environment in\nour routine operations and emergency responses.  Our prevention and\nemergency response practices are developed to protect the public as well\nas our own employees.  It is our policy to comply with applicable laws,\nand to support and work with local emergency response agencies.\n\nDFA-Cabool has a refrigeration system which contains anhydrous ammonia\n(ammonia) in an amount greater than the threshold under the Risk\nManagement Program (RMP) of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)\naccording to Section 68 of Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations\n(40 CFR 68).  The refrigeration system is designed and operated\naccording to good engineering and safe work practices.\n\nDFA-Cabool has established an Emergency Response Program that provides\nfor trained personnel on call in the event of a release. DFA-Cabool is\nalso coordinated with the Cabool Fire Department and the Texas County\nLocal Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).\n\nDFA-Cabool has an excellent safety record in preventing and minimizing\nreleases of ammonia.\n\n2.0 Facility description and Regulated Substances\n\nThe DFA-Cabool facility processes and packages dairy related products.\nDFA has on-site an ammonia refrigeration system used to maintain product\nfreshness, to meet processing requirements, and to provide cooling for\nemployee comfort.  DFA-Cabool is subject to the requirements of 40 CFR\n68 because the refrigeration system contains more than the 10,000-pound\nthreshold for ammonia, a regulated hazardous substance.\n\n3.0 Worst-case and Alternative-case release scenarios\n\n3.1 Worst Case Release Scenario\n\nSection 68.25 of the RMP requires a modeling of a worst-case scenario of\na release of the hazardous substance. A worst-case scenario release is\ndefined as the release of "

      "SummaryText": "the largest quantity of a regulated substance\nfrom a [single] vessel or process line failure. RMP*Comp is used to\ncalculate the greatest distance from the point of release where a\nspecified toxic concentration is reached.\n\nAt DFA-Cabool, the worst-case accidental release scenario assumes an\ninstantaneous release of the entire contents of the largest vessel\ncontaining ammonia.  Application of EPA'sdispersion modeling software \nRMP*Comp shows that the toxic endpoint would affect residential \npopulations and industrial areas.\n\nThis worst-case release scenario is pre-defined and is highly unlikely\nto occur.\n\n3.2 Alternative Case Release Scenario\n\nA Process Hazard Assessment (PHA) was recently performed at the\nDFA-Cabool facility. From the PHA, the alternative case release scenario\nwas determined.  The alternative release scenario is based on a 1/4\"\nhole in the process piping.  This failure will conservatively assume\nammonia will release for 30 minutes from the roof of the facility \n(30 feet above ground).  Modeling of this release was performed using \nthe EPA's dispersion modeling software RMP*Comp and shows that the toxic \nendpoint will affect residential populations.\n\n4.0 The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and\nChemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nDFA-Cabool has an accidental release prevention program to prevent and\nminimize the effects of a spill or release of ammonia.  This program\nincludes a training program for all operators and maintenance personnel,\nwritten maintenance and operating procedures, and a preventative\nmaintenance program that includes regular inspections and tests of all\nequipment within the ammonia system.\n\n5.0    Five year Accident History\n\nIn the past five years, there have been no accidental releases of\nammonia as outlined in '68.42 of the RMP Regulations.\n\n6.0    The Emergency Response Program\n\nDFA-Cabool maintains a written Emergency Response Plan to help assure\ntimely, safe, compliant responses in the event of an emergency.
