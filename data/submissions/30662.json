The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of annually. Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner. The most recent PHA/update was performed on 03/01/1999 for process number 1. The compeltion of the updated PHA/HAZOP for process No. 1 is scheduled for June 30, 2004. The PHA/HAZOP for the predictive process No, 2 will be completed no later than June 30, 2004. \nOperating Procedures:\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Sloss Industries Corporation, Ariton Facility maintains written operating procedures. These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround. The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\nTraining\nSloss Industries Corporation, Ariton Facility has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes. Refresher training is provided at least every year and more frequently as needed.\nMechanical Integrity\nSloss Industries Corporation, Ariton Facility carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations. Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps. Qualified personnel carry out maintenance operations with previous training in maintenance practices. Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized trai"
