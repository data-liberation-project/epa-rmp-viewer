Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at Sloss Industries Cooperation, Ariton Facility are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety. This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent releases of regulated substances.\n2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities encompass Specialty Chemical Production. We have 2 regulated substances present at our facility. The first substance is Sulfur trioxide. Sulfur trioxide is used for STB and KSS production. Both processes share a common storage tank of Sulfur trioxide.  The maximum inventory of Sulfur trioxide at our facility is approximately 45,000 pounds.   The second substance is Formaldehyde water solution.
