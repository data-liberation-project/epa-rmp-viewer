      "SummaryText": "Specialty Chemical Manufacturing compounds coil cleaners that are compounded from 70% hydrofluoric acid (HF) and other materials in addition to a host of other cleaning products for the comfort cooling industry. We blend this material with other mineral acids, water and surfactants to produc a product that is widely used in both the U.S. and abroad.\n\nFrom the beginning of production in 1999 until the present, we have not had any HF spills, hazardous releases or hazardous incidents.We credit this to regular training and retraining, rigorous enforcement of manufacturing and safety procedures and the engineering controls that have been designed into the manufacturing and filling system.\n\nWe receive hydrofluoric acid in DOT/UN approved drums. These drums kept on containment pallets in a storage room until they are ready to be used. The acid storage room was built to comply with the International Building Codes and NFPA Life Safety Codes. It was duly inspected by the local Fire Marshall and the Gadsden County Building Inspector and found to be in compliance with the applicable codes.\n\nAt the outset, we designed a blending and filling system to minimize personnel exposure to HF, both in the concentrated form and in the final product. In order to capture HF fumes, we incorporated  fume scrubbers in the system to absorb and neutralize the incidental vapors and fumes released during the manufacturing process. The last step in dispensing concentrated HF into the blending tank is a washout cycle so residual acid in the empty drums is rinsed out with part of the makeup water. The rinse water is incorporated into the final product. Empty drums are consigned to a recycler. Suitable amounts of lime are kept on hand to neutralize residual acid on equipment and to mitigate possible hazardous releases that could occur. \n\nWe held a corporate training session, and then invited the members of our local fire department and police department, along with the local paramedics to alert them "

      "SummaryText": "to the nature of the product we were planning to store and handle. At this same meeting, we invited our HF supplier to audit the manufacturing and filling system, and offer suggestions on ways we might improve our engineering controls and/ or our proposed manufactring procedure. We inplemented the suggestions that came from the \"round table'\" discussion, modified our manufacturing procedure and incorporated recommendations from the local emergency response personnel. We commissioned an air study by and Industrial Hygienist to quantitate the levels of HF present during the manufacturing and fillig process, and these studies showed that there were negligible amounts acid fumes present at the points of greatest exposure.These steps gave us a high level of confidence at the beginning, and we have maintained our diligence and dedication to protect both our workers and the local community from HF incidents ever since. \n\nAt least once every year, we revisit our emergency response and spill control programs. We provide safety training as well as training in other areas such as forklift operation, spill response and emergency action training to designated members of our Emergency Response Team. \n\nIn addition, Specialty Chemical Manufacturing seeks to comply with all applicable government regulation concerning our industry, and be a good corporate neighbor."
