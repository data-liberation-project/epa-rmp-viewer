We will accomplish this by using the most current design, training, and inspecting processes available.  \n\nEmergency Response Policy (ERP).   The Town will respond to any emergency in a manner best suited to protecting our employees, the public, and the environment.  Trained on-site responders will access the emergency, and decide on a coarse of action.  For emergencies within their training level they will respond.  For any emergency not included in their training, off-site emergency response agencies will be called.     \n\nThe Stationary Source.  The stationary source is the chlorination/dechlorination system at this municipal waste water treatment plant.  Chlorine (CAS No. 7782-50-5) and sulfer dioxide (CAS No. 7446-09-5) are the regulated substances handled at this facility.   The chlorine system has a maximum inventory of 16,000 pounds.  The sulfer dioxide system has a maximum inventory of 8,000 pounds.  These quantities qualify the system as a Program 3 process.\n\nFive Year Accident History.   There were no reportable accidents in the last five years.\n \nEmergency Response Program (ERP).  The wastewater treatment plant has a written ERP that includes specific actions to be taken in response to an accidental release.  On-site responders will respond to small accidental releases.  Any large or uncontrolled release will require assistance from off-site responding agencies.  The ERP plan states the specific procedures for informing the public and local agencies responsible for responding to an accidental release.  The ERP also includes information on emergency health care for exposure to chlorine and sulfer dioxide.  The ERP was last reviewed on May 5, 1999.  ERP training for all employees was last conducted on May 5, 1999.  The ERP is coordinated with the Manchester Fire Depa"
