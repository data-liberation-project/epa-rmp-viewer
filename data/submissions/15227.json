All Feed is imported via pipelines and all products are exported via pipelines.\n\nThe liquefied petroleum gases and other liquid hydrocarbons, produced, stored, and distributed at the complex are highly volatile, flammable, and explosive materials.  The process unit operated by Enterprise involves processing of liquefied petroleum gases (LPG) into their individual components such as ethane, propane, isobutane, normal butane and natural gasoline.  The primary separation process utilized is fractionation by distillation.  A supplemental fired heat recovery unit provide heat energy to the process via a heat medium system.  A gas turbine is utilized to drive a refrigeration compressor while recovering the heated exhaust gases in the fired heat recovery unit.  The facility utilizes an air assisted flare for any and all venting of the process.  \n\nIn our processes, we use the following chemicals that EPA has identified as having the potential to cause significant off site consequences in the event of a substantial accidental release:\n\nToxics\n\nThere are no toxic chemicals to report.\n\nFlammables\n\nEthane is a finished product at the Port Allen facility.

      "SummaryText": "contingency planning efforts help us effectively manage the hazards that are posed to our employees, the public, and the environment by our processing of these flammable chemicals.\n\nKEY OFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS SCENARIOS\n\nEPA's RMP rule requires that we provide information about the worst-case release scenario(s) and alternative release scenario(s) for our facility.  The following are brief summaries of these scenarios, including information about the key administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the exposure distances for each scenario:\n\nWorst-case Release Scenario - Regulated Toxic Chemicals\n\nThere are no regulated toxic chemicals on site and therefore there will be no worst-case release scenario reported.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario(s) - Regulated Toxic Chemicals\n\nThere are no regulated toxic chemicals on site and therefore there will be no alternate-case release scenario reported.\n\nWorst-case Release Scenario - Regulated Flammable Chemicals\n\nThis simulation involves the rupture or failure of the DeEthanizer tower shell which contains a flammable mixture of hydrocarbons which are ethane, propane, isobutane, normal butane and natural gasoline (pentanes and hexanes) resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  The total pounds release would be approximately 186,301 pounds.  The simulated end point distance to the 1 pound overpressure would be approximately 0.47 miles.  This scenario would not be mitigated due to the type of scenario modeled.  All emergency response and early warning to the employees and the community would be exercised immediately if this were to occur.  All ERT protocols would be in effect.  The off site consequence will not affect any of the residential population.  There would be no off site environmental impact in this scenario due to the material being consumed on site.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario(s) - Regulated Flammable Chemicals\n\nThe alternative release scenario is the simulation of a 3/4\" bleed valve shear from the Deisob"

      "SummaryText": "utanizer tower.  The material released would be an isobutane/normal butane mix and would result in a vapor cloud explosion.  The total release would be 5,060 pounds at a rate of 506 lbs/minute for 10 minutes.  The simulated end point distance to the 1 pound overpressure would be approximately 0.14 miles.  This scenario would be mitigated by means of the emergency shutdown system and the activation of the emergency response team.  All emergency response and early warning to the employees and the community would be exercised immediately if this were to occur.  There would be no off site environmental impact in this scenario due to the material being consumed on site.\n\nWe are using this information to help us ensure that our emergency response plan and the community emergency response plan address all reasonable contingency cases.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nWe take a systematic, proactive approach to preventing accidental releases of hazardous chemicals.  Our Process Safety Management Systems address each of the key features of successful prevention programs including:\n\n *  Process safety information\n *  Process hazard analysis\n *  Operating procedures\n *  Training\n *  Mechanical integrity\n *  Management of change\n *  Pre-Startup Safety review\n *  Compliance audits\n *  Incident investigation\n *  Employee participation\n *  Hot work permit\n *  Contractors\n\nAs part of our prevention efforts, we have a multitude of programs in which our employees participate.  We have a training program in which the Operations and Maintenance personnel are specifically trained in the operations of the plant, the operating procedures, maintenance procedures, and specific other regulations and policies as well as train in all areas of emergency response.  We train, use and apply the guidelines of our PSM program which include all of the above listed areas.   All of these programs come under scheduled scrutiny and critique.\n\nWe have"

      "SummaryText": "an ongoing inspection program designed to search out and find deficiencies with the process equipment prior to any incident.  \n\nThe Operations personnel make regular walk through inspections of the equipment and processes they operate.  If anything out of the ordinary is found, it is repaired by the observer or reported to management in order to expediently resolve any problems.\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nWe will keep records for all significant accidental chemical releases that will occur at our facility.  Since this is a new facility that is not yet operational, there is not any reportable history of accidental chemical releases involving materials covered under EPA's RMP rule for the past five years.\n\nIn the future if there are any accidental releases, we will conduct incident investigations to identify and correct the root causes of any event(s) that may occur.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nWe maintain an integrated contingency plan, which consolidates all of the various federal, state, and local regulatory requirements for emergency response planning.  Our program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.  Furthermore, we coordinate our plan with the West Baton Rouge Emergency Response Task Force which includes the Port Allen Police, Fire Dept., and Emergency Medical Service as well as West Baton Rouge Parish Emergency Management system. \n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThe following is a list of improvements that we are planning to implement at the facility to help prevent and/or better respond to accidental chemical releases:\n\nWe are constantly reviewing and improving our PSM program.  This program is presently undergoing a front to back cover review of the program and its written management system.  The same is being done to the mechanical integrity program.  The Safety Procedures and Policies were reviewed and updated in May of 1998.\n\nWe plan to conduct"
