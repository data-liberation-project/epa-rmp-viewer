The maximum quantity stored would be 280,000 pounds in three separate tanks.Sizes are a twelve thousand gallon,a eighteen thousand gallon, and a thirty thousand gallon tanks.The worst case scenario would be the release of product out as a gas over ten minutes out of the largest storage tank at 85% capacity. The distance to the end pointof disperation based on the degadis model used is 1.16 miles.The alternative-case scenario is the assumption of a release from a ruptured three inch pipeline.the release would be 26,638 pounds released over two minutes.The distance to the endpoint of dispersionis .78 miles.This Facility complies with the rules and regulations relating to the handling of Anhydrous Ammonia.These regulations administered by the Illinois Department of Agriculture are consistent with ANSI K61.1 and OSHA 29 CFR 1910.111 Regarding storage and handling of Anhydrous Ammonia.There have been no accidental releases of Anhydrous Ammonia in the past five years at this facility.Training and safety improvements are an on going process at this facility.Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the needs and the maintenance of safe equipment.Safe operations and material handling along with storage are discussed evry spring before the season starts.The only additional specific Anhydrous Ammonia safety recommendations,are to update the emergency "
