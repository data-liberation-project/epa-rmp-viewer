      "SummaryText": "Since the Charles Allen Treatment Plant was built in the early 1950's, gaseous chlorine has been used for the disinfection process.  This chemical has been readily available, relatively inexpensive and effective in the disinfection of our drinking water.  With new regulations anticipated in the future and the plant's inability to properly treat the changing quality of the source water, it was decided in 1996 to embark on an upgrade of the plant's processes.  During the next 18 months, workshops were held with the plant staff, management and the consultant.  The groups were given alternatives to treatment processes and decided which alternatives would fulfill our treatment, financial, safety and limited space goals.  One process discussed in length was the choices we had concerning the disinfection of the water.  Although gaseous chlorine has worked well, as you can see by the complexity of the Risk Management Program, this is a dangerous chemical and many precautions must be taken for its use.  One alternative to gaseous chlorine is Sodium Hypochlorite.  This chemical is commonly known as bleach.  Although somewhat stronger than household bleach, it is essentially the same chemical.  As with all chemicals, specific precautions must be taken, but the posibility of widespread comtamination is eliminated with the use of Sodium Hypochlorite.  It was, therefore, decided to switch from gaseous chlorine to Sodium Hypochlorite which should be on line by the end of October, 1999."
