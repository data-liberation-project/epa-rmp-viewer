Johanna Foods, Inc. has operated its ammonia\nrefrigeration system following its RMP Program. The RMP Program was developed in 1991\nto comply with New Jersey's Toxic Catastrophe Prevention Act. The Standard Operating\nProcedures, Preventative Maintenance Program, Management of Change Program, Emergency\nResponse Plan, and other elements of the RMP Program have developed over the years to\nfurther improve the safety, reliability, and risk reduction of the ammonia refrigeration system.\n\n                      Johanna Foods, Inc.\n\n     Johanna Foods, Inc. has three production plants on one site. The Juice Plant packages\nchilled juice products in half gallon, quart and pint paper containers that require refrigeration\nfor processing and storage. The Aseptic Plant packages juice products in Brik Pak containers\n(drink boxes) in a variety of s and flavors that requires refrigeration for processing but not\nfor storage. The Yogurt Plant packages yogurt products in cup containers of various s,\nstyles, and flavors that require refrigeration for processing and storage. Anhydrous ammonia\nis the regulated chemical that is used as the refrigerant. The quantity of anhydrous ammonia\ncontained in the refrigeration system  on site varies up to 60,000 pounds. The anhydrous\nammonia is not consumed or produced by the refrigeration system. The refrigeration system\ncirculates the anhydrous ammonia converting it from a liquid to a vapor to create cooling, then\ncondensing the vapor back to a liquid to be used again. \n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-specific Prevention\n\n     Johanna Foods, Inc. has operated its ammonia refrigeration system following its RMP\nProgram developed in 1991 to comply with New Jersey's Toxic Catastrophe Prevention Act"

      "SummaryText": ".\nThe Standard Operating Procedures are used for every task performed on the refrigeration\nsystem. All equipment is checked daily using checksheets from the S.O.P.'s Steady State\nOperations section. The Preventative Maintenance Program requires checksheets to inspect all\nrefrigeration equipment in greater detail every six months, yearly testing of all safety\ninterlocks and controls, and a five year schedule to replace safety relief valves. Any\nmodification to the system is performed following the Management of Change Program. The\nM.O.C. requires a dispersion analysis to determine if the change could cause offsite impact or\nnot. Offsite impact would result in performing a risk assessment of the change to identify all\nhazards and items to further reduce the risk of a release. All EHS operators are trained in all\naspects of the RMP and annual refresher training is performed high lighting any changes to\nprocedures or equipment.\n\n                   Five Year Accident History\n\n     There have been no reportable accidents.\n\n                    Emergency Response Plan\n  \n     Johanna Foods, Inc. has an Emergency Response Plan that\naddresses emergency situations including an anhydrous ammonia\nrelease. This description will address procedures for an\nanhydrous ammonia release. There are procedures to follow for\nanyone who discovers a potential release to notify the Johanna\nFoods, Inc. guard shack. The guard would notify an EHS operator,\nby radio, to investigate the potential release. If the EHS\noperator finds a release he notifies the guard to sound the\nammonia release evacuation alarm that sounds in the effected\narea. The site personnel evacuate the area, lead by an Evacuation\nCoordinator (EVC), who upon meeting at the designated evacuation\narea, conducts a headcount.
