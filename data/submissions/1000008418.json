A guiding principle, as stated in our Yerkes Vision Statement, is \"We will secure our future by.... advancing our Core Values of Safety, Ethics, Environmental Stewardship and Respectful Treatment of People\", both at our facility and in our community.\n\n\n\nThe DuPont Yerkes Plant adheres to Corporate policies.  These policies are embodied in numerous Safety Health & Environmental and Engineering Standards, which apply globally.  These standards can be summarized as follows:\n\n\n\no All Safety and Environmental incidents are preventable.\n\no Total Committment to Zero Incidents.\n\no All employees and contractors are responsible for their safety.\n\n\n\n\n\nFACILITY DESCRIPTION AND SUBSTANCE REGULATED BY RMP REGULATION\n\n\n\nThe Yerkes plant covers approximately 100 acres in a highly industrialized section of the Town of Tonawanda, NY.

Currently, the site consists of two manufacturing businesses:\n\n\n\no Tedlar(R); polyvinyl fluoride films\n\no Corian(R); sheet and shape filled acrylic building materials\n\n\n\nThe EPA has identified VINYL FLUORIDE (VF), which is flammable, as a chemical at Yerkes which has the potential to cause significant offsite consequences in the event of a substantial accidental release.\n\n\n\nWORST-CASE AND ALTERNATIVE-CASE RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\n\n\nFollowing are brief summaries of the Worst and Alternate case scenarios, including information about the key administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the exposure distances for each scenario:\n\n\n\nWorst-case Release Scenario: Vinyl Fluoride, Regulated Flammable Chemical\n\n\n\nThe worst-case release scenario is a Vinyl Fluoride storage tank failure, with no mitigation assumed.  A release if ignited could result in a vapor cloud explosion that with an off-site impact but no public receptors.  A release is unlikely due to the construction and high-integrity design of tanks / associated equipment, and dual water deluge / emergency tower venting systems.\n\n\n\nAlternative Release Scenario Vinyl Fluoride, Regulated Flammable Chemical\n\n\n\nThe alternate-case release scenario is being updated in this submittal to a different scenario.  The old alternate scenario was a flex hose failure during unloading of Vinyl Fluoride from a tank truck to a storage tank, with no passive mitigation assumed.  A release if ignited could result in a flash fire.  This scenario has changed to highly unlikely because of the addition since last filing of a liquid hose break away coupling, which will automatically close if the hose is disconnected during transfer.  This new mitigation, in addition to the pre-existing tank truck excess flow valve, automatic shutdown equipment, procedures, preventive maintenance of the hoses, use of checklists and the construction and high-integrity design "

This would be a 1/4 inch hole in either the unloading flex hose or any part of a storage tank or piping.  The leak was assumed to impinge on the ground to maximize the impact in the area.  This could result in a vapor cloud fire.  The details of this scenario are available in the PHA report.\n\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY FOR ACCIDENTAL RELEASES OF RMP CHEMICALS\n\n\n\nWithin the past five years, the Tedlar(R); process has had no accidental release that caused offsite impacts provided in the Risk Management Plan regulation, (40 CFR 68.10(b)(1)).\n\n\n\nRecords are kept for all Serious Incidents (non-standard operations) that occur at our facility.  For every Serious Incident, we conduct a formal incident investigation to identify and correct the root causes of the event.  \n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND VINYL FLUORIDE SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nYerkes accidental release prevention programs and contingency planning efforts help us effectively manage the hazards that are posed to our employees, the public, and the environment by our use of Vinyl Fluoride.  The site takes a systematic, proactive approach to prevent accidental releases of Vinyl Fluoride.  The process to react Vinyl Fluoride to form polyvinyl fluoride follows the requirements of the DuPont Corporate Process Safety Management (PSM) standard.  This standard includes and embraces the requirements of 29 CFR 1910.119 and 40 CFR Part 68.
