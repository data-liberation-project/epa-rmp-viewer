While the site's refrigeration process utilizes multiple Condensers, the new Condenser affected compiled Process Safety Information (PSI) and a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) was performed in conjunction with the MOC.  The RMP is being updated and re-submitted according to the RMP rules when such events occur.  \n\n\n\nThis is the Executive Summary component of the Risk Management Plan for 6th Street Cooling, LLC.  The facility is subject to the Federal Risk Management Program and the California Accidental Release Prevention Program (Cal/ARP) in the Level III designation, and the Cal/OSHA Process Safety Management Program (PSM).  The Cal/ARP Program establishes additional state-specific requirements.  Additional state-specific requirements are addressed in an addendum report submitted to the local implementing agency (Department of Toxic Substance Control/Imperial County Certified Unified Program Agency a.k.a. Imperial CUPA).  \n\n\n\nUSEPA Region IX, the Southern California Cal/OSHA PSM Unit and Imperial CUPA Agency have inspected the facility.  The Holtville Fire Department periodically visits the facility to assure effective emergency response preparation & coordination.  6th Street Cooling strives to maintain good working relationships with these oversight agencies.  \n\n\n\n1.1 Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nThe 6th Street Cooling Accide"

The Company endeavors to execute this policy through the daily implementation of its Safety Programs.  The Company safety program includes but is not limited to a comprehensive Process Safety Management Program (PSM). The PSM Program is an integrated approach to the safe operation of processes using Regulated Substances and forms the Program Level III Prevention Program component of the RMP.  The PSM Program is specifically designed and intended to prevent accidental releases, and to deal safely with emergencies if they happen.  It is the primary goal of 6th Street Cooling to protect its employees, visitors and neighbors from harm due to Company operations. With this in mind, the priorities of protection of life, the environment, and then property have been established.  Only when these goals are achieved may the focus shift to resumption of business operations.\n\n\n\n6th Street Cooling has adopted a \"non-responding facility\" policy but recognizes the need to be prepared for an emergency.  A California Hazardous Material Business Plan has been developed and submitted to the local Certified Unified Program Agency (CUPA) via the CA Electronic Reporting System (CERS).  The Plan is consistent with Emergency Action Plan requirements and includes written regulatory release or threatened release notification requirements.  The Business Plan includes the Hazardous Material Inventory consistent with EPCRA compliance in California, and the information necessary to be included in the Area Emergency Plan.  An Emergency Coordinator has been established.   Emergency response pre-planning is coordinated and kept current through the annual submittal of appropriate reports; and relationships with the aforementioned Holtville City Fire & DTSC/CUPA.
