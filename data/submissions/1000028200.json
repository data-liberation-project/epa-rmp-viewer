The hazard assessment for this process identifies potential off site consequences related to an accidental release of the chemical, anhydrous ammonia that is contained in the process.  A program management system is also in place at the facility that details the lines of authority for overall responsibility and maintenance of the release prevention program. \r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE PREPAREDNESS\r\nThe AmeriCold Grand Chute, Wisconsin (Plant #2321) facility abides by the emergency procedures of OSHA 1910.38 emergency action plan. However this process is covered by hazwoper 1910.120 in the event of a chemical accident that requires emergency response.  The emergency response plan is coordinated with Outagamie County hazmat and the Wisconsin Emergency Management.  This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives: \r\n\r\nTo save lives.\r\nTo minimize off site impacts and avoid injuries.\r\nTo protect the environment.\r\nTo minimize property damage.\r\n\r\nAmeriCold maintains a (safety) committee and has employees designated as coordinators for the facility emergency action plan.   The Facility Service Manager and Plant Manager are responsible for the process safety and the emergency planning for off site consequences that are primary objectives of the risk management program. The emergency plan includes the instructions for notifications, safe evacuation and mitigation procedures to handle small releases.  To respond effectively in emergency situations involving a chemical release, employee responders are on call 24/7.  The emergency plan is reviewed"

The refrigeration process, consisting of piping, valves, vessels, air units and compressor equipment utilizes anhydrous ammonia, a natural refrigerant for the industrial refrigeration system. Changes in pressure through the refrigeration cycle relate directly to changes in temperature of the refrigerant. For example, lowering the pressure of a refrigerant lowers its temperature. Low pressure, (cold) The ammonia refrigerant absorb heat through storage room air units.  Removal of the heat from the room provides the refrigeration affect.  Removal of ambient heat from products in turn reduces the spoilage and allows for extended storage of food products.\r\nAnhydrous ammonia (CAS #766-41-7) Refrigerant grade, pure anhydrous ammonia is the chemical in the process.  In low concentrations ammonia is easily detectable and has a pungent odor that makes it ideal as a refrigerant because of this self alarming characteristic. \r\nThe ammonia inventory at the Americold Grand Chute facility is above the Threshold Planning Quantity of 10,000 lbs.  Ammonia is listed and reportable as an extremely hazardous substances, EHS.
