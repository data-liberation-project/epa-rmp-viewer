Utah Gas Corp. takes an active role in preventing accidental releases at all of its facilities by ensuring that its employees are properly trained in the safe operation of covered processes and the safe handling of regulated chemicals. As for emergency response, the Company has established and maintained site-specific procedures for emergency notification and response. These procedures are reviewed with employees on a periodic basis and revised to accommodate changes in staffing when they occur.\r\n\r\nUtah Gas Corp. understands its duty to provide a safe working environment and to take measures to prevent accidents that may have an effect on the surrounding community. This understanding is reflected in procedures described and referenced in the UGC Emergency Response Manual and Emergency Action Plan.\r\n\u00a0\r\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\r\n\r\nThe Rangely NGL Injection Facility is located at the intersection of CR 99 and CR 21 in rural Rio Blanco County, Colorado. The facility collects natural gas liquids (NGLs) from tank trucks, stores NGLs in above ground pressurized tanks, and injects NGLs into an interstate pipeline. NGL is a flammable pressurized liquid mixture of aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons including regulated flammables ethane, propane, butane, isobutane, isopentane and pentane. There are no threshold quantities of toxic substances present. This facility was designed and constructed in accord with applicable state and federal regulations.\r\n\r\nGeneral Accident Release Prevention Program an"

This stationary source was designed and constructed in accord with applicable state and federal regulations and applicable good engineering practices. The following briefly describes the release prevention program that is in place.\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\n\r\nA variety of documents are available and used to help maintain safe operation of the process. These documents cover chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters, and specific chemical inventories, equipment specification and design basis/ configuration information. This information is updated when a change occurs that makes the information inaccurate.\r\n\r\nChemical specific information describing the chemical hazards associated with regulated substances is maintained e.g. material safety data sheets. For specific process areas, safety related limits for specific process parameters (e.g. temperature, pressure, level) are documented. Process controls and monitoring instruments, protective instrument systems and trained personnel are used to maintain the process within these limits.\r\n\r\nInformation about the design and construction of the process equipment is maintained and readily available. This information provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities as well as evaluating proposed changes to make sure that process safety features are not compromised.\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis\r\n\r\nA hazard review and safety inspections are conducted to identify and control hazards associated with the process and regulated substances including the potential equipment malfunction or human error and the safeguards needed to detect, control or prevent hazards, equipment malfunction and human error. The hazard review will be updated whenever a major process change occurs. Additional reviews/inspections include pre startup for new"

The findings and final resolutions are documented and retained.\r\n\r\nOperating Procedures\r\n\r\nWritten operating procedures for safely conducting activities associated with the process and regulated substances have been prepared and are maintained at the facility. These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown, startup after an emergency shutdown and temporary operations. The procedures address deviation from operating parameters and actions to correct and to avoid deviations and equipment inspection. The procedures are readily accessible to operators involved with the process; and are updated, if necessary, upon a major change and before startup of a changed process.\r\n\r\nTraining\r\n\r\nAn operator training program is in place to train employees involved in the process. New employees receive basic training in process operations followed by on-the-job supervision until they are determined to be competent to work independently. Training in updated or new procedures is provided before process startup after a major change. Refresher training is provided if needed or requested. In addition, employees not operating the process receive safety training on the hazards associated with the process and regulated substances at the facility.\r\n\r\nEmployee Participation\r\n\r\nEmployees are encouraged to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention. Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team. Employees have access to all information created as part of the gas plant accident prevention program.\r\n\r\nMaintenance Procedures\r\n\r\nMaintenance checks are performed on the equipment to ensure proper function"

Trained and qualified personnel perform the maintenance tasks. Equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\r\n\r\nWhen contractors are required for construction and maintenance activities, procedures are in place to ensure they perform their work in a safe manner, are aware of hazards in their work place, understand what they are to do in an emergency, understand and follow facility safety rules, and inform the facility representative of any hazards that they find during their work.\r\n\r\nIncident Investigation\r\n\r\nAn incident that results in, or could have reasonably resulted in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance will be investigated promptly as possible, and will be initiated within 48 hours after the incident. The goal of the investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence, or a similar incident. A summary report will be prepared at the conclusion of the investigation. The resolutions and action taken will be documented. The findings will be reviewed with the affected personnel. \r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program\r\n\r\nUtah Gas Corp. has established and coordinated emergency response action plans with the Rangely Fire Department.  The emergency response plan also includes procedures for responding to releases of regulated substances, including the possibility of associated fires or explosions. The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including evacuation plans, accounting for personnel after an evacuation, and notification of local emergency response agencies, if a release occurs.

Utah Gas Corp. confirmed that the nearest public receptor to the Rangely NGL Injection Facility is beyond the 1-psi overpressure endpoint distance of the flammable WCS.\r\n\u00a0\r\nFive-Year Accident History\r\n\r\nThere were no accidental releases of regulated flammable materials at the Rangely NGL Injection Facility meeting the five-year accident history requirements of 40 CFR 68.42.\r\n\r\nPlanned Changes for Improved Safety\r\n\r\nIdeas for changes to improve safety are actively sought from employees. Employee safety meetings that focus on chemical safety issues are held regularly at this facility. Employees are encouraged and trained to recognize hazards and present ideas to eliminate them or to minimize the potential consequences of those hazards."
