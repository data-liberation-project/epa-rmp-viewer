The regulation requires procedures to protect the public and employees from the risk of accidental emissions of certain hazardous chemicals.  The following facility meets the criteria for a Program 2 category as defined in 40 CFR Part 68:\n\n7 Northeast Water Treatment Plant\n4210 East Lake Rd.\nAbilene, TX\n\nThis Risk Management Plan offers a systematic process for design, operation, and maintenance of a water treatment plant in such a way as to minimize risks associated with storage and use of 24,000 lbs. of chlorine and 40,000 lbs. anhydrous ammonia utilized in the disinfection process.  \n\nIn the development of this plan, existing operational and safety policies and procedures were evaluated and, in some areas, enhanced to assure compliance with the law and optimum safety for the public and employees.  Various staff levels were involved in the development of this plan including management, supervisory, operations, and maintenance. The City of Abilene's Risk Management Plan will be incorporated as an element in the Water Utilities' overall health and safety program.\n\nThe City of Abilene conducted a release analysis utilizing the EPA's RMP Comp Model to determine the off-site consequence of a worst case release for both chlorine and anhydrous ammonia.  The criterion used, and the results of this modeling are as delineated:\n\n1. Chlorine - 6000 lbs. released across 10 minutes duration, in an enclosed structure vented to atmosphere, in a rural environment, with a wind speed of 1.5 meters/second, and with an atmospheric stability class \"F\".  Administrative controls at this facility dictate that no more than 6000 lbs. of chlorine are utilized in the process at any one time.  The distance to the toxic end point was determined to be 7.4 miles.\n2. Anhydrous Ammonia - 40,0"

The distance to the toxic end point was determined to be 3.0 miles.\n\nAdditionally, the City of Abilene conducted an alternative release scenario utilizing the EPA's RMP Comp Model to determine the off-site consequence of a release that is more likely to occur than the worst case scenario for both chlorine and anhydrous ammonia.  The criterion used, and the results of this modeling are as delineated:\n\n1. Chlorine - 3.1 lbs. released from a pipe across 10 minutes duration, in an urban environment, in an enclosed structure vented to atmosphere, with a wind speed of 3.0 meters/second, and with an atmospheric stability class \"D\".  Mitigation measures for this analysis include chlorine detectors in process area, visual and audio alarms, 24 hour manned operation, written operating procedures, vacuum and pressure regulators, manual and automatic shutoffs, and no history of a release.  The distance to the toxic end point was determined to be 0.11 miles.\n2. Anhydrous Ammonia - 1.4 lbs. released from a pipe across 10 minutes, in an urban environment, vented to atmosphere, with a wind speed of 3.0 meters/second, and with an atmospheric stability class \"D\".  Mitigation measures for this analysis include an elevated air vent with a pressure relief valve, process control monitoring equipment, pressure regulators, written operating procedures, 24 hour manned operation, manual shutoffs, and no history of a release.  The distance to the toxic end point was determined to be 0.06 miles.\n\nIn addition to the mitigation measures delineated in the off-site consequence analysis the City of Abilene has implemented a Prevention Program that consists of; updated safety information on all process chemicals; designing, constructing and operating all processes in accordance with regulatory and industry-specific codes and s"

The emergency responder for this facility will be the City of Abilene Fire Department.  The Fire Dept. conducts annual inspections and requires procurement of a hazardous materials permit of this facility. The plant personnel will initiate immediate response to any chemical release by shutting down and isolating the source."
