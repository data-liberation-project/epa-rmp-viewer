Nevertheless, RB Sandrini continually strives to improve in all areas, including safety.\n\nBy utilizing PSMWriter software, all necessary employees have access to every aspect of the RMP-PSM program. This has improved RB Sandrini's ability to communicate hazardous situations to employees and contractors. In addition, PSMWriter tracks all RMP-PSM related events so that RB Sandrini's management team can ensure that the RMP-PSM program is being implemented.\n\nRB Sandrini has implemented all aspects of the RMP-PSM program. When a RMP-PSM program requirement is completed (i.e. mechanical integrity inspection, process hazard analysis, compliance audit, etc.) any specific action items related to that event are entered into PSMWriter, assigned a responsible person, and given a due date. Once the action item has been completed, the resolution can be documented using PSMWriter as well. A list of current or past due action items can be accessed at any time by those with access to PSMWriter.\n\nIn addition to utilizing PSMWriter to create, schedule, track, and document events, RB Sandrini has also entered into a contract with Resource Compliance to obtain help with RMP-PSM program implementation.\n\nFor the future, RB Sandrini now thinks of the RMP-PSM program as a living document. It is an interactive framework that guides safe action for RB Sandrini employees, but allows for feedback and continual improvement. Through the RMP-PSM program RB Sandrini will continue to maintain overall plant worker and public safety."

As such, the information, procedures, policies, and documentation that make up this program must be made easily accessible and updated as necessary. To accomplish this, RB Sandrini has elected to use PSMWriter, software developed and distributed by Resource Compliance, Inc. This software will assist us with updating, maintaining, scheduling, and tracking RMP-PSM related activities. \n\n1.1 RB Sandrini, Risk and Process Safety Management Program\n\nThis is to inform all interested persons, including employees, that RB Sandrini has updated/developed their unified RMP-PSM Program. This program has been prepared to address the risks involved in operating and maintaining the following processes which have the presence of hazardous chemicals above threshold quantities: \n\nProcess Name                | Process Chemical               | Process Quantity(lbs.)\nNorth System                  Anhydrous Ammonia                18,000\n\nOur RMP-PSM program promotes overall plant, worker, and public safety. The program enables our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of hazardous chemicals. Overall, the program is designed to prevent accidental fatalities, injuries, illnesses, and physical property damage.\n\nOur company has many policies and procedures in place to promote overall plant, worker and public safety.
