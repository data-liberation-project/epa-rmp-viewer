BOX  398\nHAMPSHIRE, IL   60140\n\n\n\nPhone (847) 683-2188\nFax : (847) 683-2253\n\n\nJune 1, 1999\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY OF RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN\n\n\n\n1.  The Facility Policy:  The owners, management, and employees of  Petersen Propane Companys\n The Ammonia Plant are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia by\nutilization of proper equipment, regular inspections and maintenance and training of all persons that work with the material.  Should an accidental release occur,  the facility has orientated the local fire department and the local emergency planning committee so they can plan for response to any release and minimize the impact  of  therelease to people and the environment.\n\n2.  Facility Information:   The primary activity at the facility is the storage for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous\nammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient.  The maximumquantity stored would be 224,314 pounds in the facilitys two  tanks.  The capacity of each of these tanksare, 84,118 pounds and 140,196 pounds .                                                                                       3The worst-case release scenario would   be the release of the total  contents of  the storage tanks released as agas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 140,196 pounds, which represents the volume ofthe storage tanks at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards and company procedures.  The distance tothe endpoint of dispersion based on the model used is 2.68 miles.\n\nThe alternative-case release scenario is assumed to be a release from the rupture of a __2__ inch transfer hose,with 12,000 pounds released over 2 minutes.  The distance to the endpoint of dispersion is 0.56 miles.\n\n\n4.  The accidental release program:    The facility complies with th;e Rules and Regulations relating to The\nHandling of Anhydrous Ammonia and Low Pressure Nitrogen Solutions,"

The Five-year Accident History\n      a.  There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia for the covered process in the past five yearsthat have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site; nor to our knowledge, have anyaccidental releases resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage orenvironmental damage.\n\n\n6.  The Emergency Response  Program:  The facility has a written emergency action plan in accordance withOSHAstandard 29 CFR 191.38 and provide state and local authorities the emergencey planning and communityright-to-know information as required under  SARA Title III of EPCRA.  Our emergency response action plan hasbeen reviewed with the local fire department and provided to the local emergency planning committee for coordination in  the community response planning.\n\n\n7.  Planned changes to improve safety:  Safety improvements is an on-going process at the facility .  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe practices and operaions.  There aare no additionalspecific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
