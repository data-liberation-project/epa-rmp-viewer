      "SummaryText": "The facility covered in the Risk Management Plan (RMP) includes the Lake O' the Pines Water Treatment Plant for the City of Longview.  The process included in the RMP is the disinfection process using chlorine.  Currently, the plant uses one-ton cylinders (2000 pounds).  The chlorine system includes four cylinders mounted for use, with two cylinders online (4000 pounds) and two cylinders ready for service on stand-by (4000 pounds) when the other two are empty.  Since the threshold quantity for chlorine is 2500 pounds, this process is regulated by the current RMP rules.  The ammonia system includes a 3000 gallon steel pressure tank.  The maximum capacity of the 3000 gallon tank is approximately 17,000 pounds.  The City stores 50% of the maximum tank capacity or a total of 8,530 pounds.  The threshold quantity for anhydrous ammonia is 10,000 pounds.  This storage capacity has been reduced since the last RMP submittal and is no longer regulated by the current RMP rules.  The facility handles several other chemcials and processes.  The chemicals are either not on the list of regulated substances or do not exceed the threshold limits.   \n\nA worst-case release scenario and an alternative release scenario were developed for chlorine at the plant.  The OCA Guidance Tables from the EPA Guidance Manual were used for the worst-case and alternative release scenarios for the chemical.  Mitigation measures were not considered in the analysis.  The worst-case release scenario for the process consists of release of the greatest amount held in a single vessel over a ten minute period of time.  The chlorine scenario produced a distance to end-point of release of 4.3 miles.  The alternative release scenario for the chlorine cylinders consists of failure of a 1-inch schedule 80 pipe connected to two 1-ton containers.  The result is a distance to end-point of release of 0.24 miles.  The alternative release scenario was chosen to better represent a possible release event.  \n\nThe preventi"

The safety information, hazard review, and operating procedures sections are completed for the chlorine system.  The training, maintenance, compliance audits, and incident investigations sections are completed for the plant as a system.  The safety information includes material safety data sheets for each chemical, maximum inventories, safe operation limits, equipment specification, and codes and standards for design.  The plant maintains a form specifying the current safety information used and documents any changes as they occur.  The safety form must be updated at least every two years.  The hazard review information includes the forms necessary for the reviews that will be performed at least every five years for the different processes.  The operation procedures information includes standard operating procedures for initial startup, normal operatiion, temporary operations, emergency and normal shutdown, and startup following emergency or normal shutdown.  Forms are provided to document the procedures for the plant, including a chlorine checklist and chlorine change-over form.  The training information includes certification that employees have been trained for the processes and equipment that they operate.  Documentation is also kept for refresher training that must be provided at least every three years.  The maintenance information includes a form to document testing and inspections.  The forms also include verification and information documenting the development of the maintenance program for the facility that must be updated at least every two years.

The investigation summaries are maintained for at least five (5) years.  \n\nThe emergency response program includes the response program for incidental leaks as handled by plant employees and the program for major spills and/or releases as covered in the City of Longview's Emergency Response Program.  The incidental releases include leaks encountered when installing the cylinders for use, dismantling the chlorine cylinders, and any minor release found upon inspection or testing of the equipment.  Proper equipment is maintained at the plant for use in the incidental release situations.  Major releases or problems encountered with the smaller releases will be handled by outside assistance.  The plant will be set-up to contact the City of Longview Fire Department for assistance with chemical releases.  The local Hazmat team will then be contacted by the fire department if needed.  The First Call emergency contact system is also available for persons in Gregg County.  The fire department will initiate contact with the First Call program for emergency notification assistance.  \n\nThe City of Longview Emergency Response Plan for Hazardous Material Incidences is identified in detail in the RMP with copies of the forms for emergency notification.  These emergency notification forms include:  Emergency Public Information Checklist for Hazardous Material Incident, Sample Radio/TV Message for Unidentified Spill/Release in Heavy Traffic Area, Sample Radio/TV Message for Low Hazard/Confined Spill/Release-No General Evacuation, Sample Radio/TV Message for High Hazard Spill/Release-In Place Sheltering, Sample Radio/TV Message for High Hazard Spill/Release-General Evacuation, and Sample Radio/TV Message for High Hazard Spill/Release-School Evacuation."
