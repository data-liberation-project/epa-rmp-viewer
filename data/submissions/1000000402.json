Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies\n\nIt is the policy of the Fogelsville Division to comply fully with all federal, state, and local rules and regulations regarding the proper handling, use, storage, and emergency response preparedness to prevent accidental release of chemicals toxic or otherwise.  Furthermore, Fogelsville Division is committed to protecting the health and welfare of both its employees and community residents.\n\nFogelsville Division makes all effort not to have an accidental release by having:\na.\tTraining and testing program\nb.\tSafety check sheets\nc.\tEquipment inspections\n\nOur emergency response program is based upon the requirements in OSHA's Hazardous Waste and Emergency Operations (HAZWOPER) regulation (29 CFR 1910.120).  For emergency response the company has in place:\na.\tContingency plan\nb.\tEvacuation plan\nc.\tChemical spill procedures\nd.\tFirst aid and CPR training\n\n2.\tStationary source and regulated substance handled\n\nCarpenter Co., Fogelsville Division contains two manufacturing facilities built on 34.65 acres and is accessed from Olin Way on the west side of the property.  Carpenter Co. is located in Fogelsville, PA, south of Route 78 and East of Route 100 and is surrounded by an industrial neighborhood.\n\nThe main building, located at 57A Olin Way, contains a prime foam line.  The prime foam line converts raw materials into polyurethane foam, primarily used in bedding and furniture applications.  The polyurethane process uses Toluene Diisocyanate (TDI).  TDI is stored in three steel storage tanks inside the building, containing up to 375,000 pounds of TDI.  The tanks are located in a cement containment pit that can hold 62,000 gallons.  TDI is shipped primarily via railcar, which contains approximately 190,000 lbs.  The covered process is assigned a Program Level 1.\n\nThe second building, located at 57B Olin Way, manufactures expanded polystyrene (EPS).  The EPS building does not contain any che"

If this happens the contents would be contained in a 14' x 87' diked area surrounding the rail tracks.  The diked area is large enough to contain a full railcar.  The endpoint distance is equal to 91 feet.  The nearest fence line is 141 feet away.  A worst case spill would remain onsite.  No alternative release scenario is required for the Program Level 1 covered process.\n\n4.\tGeneral accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps\n\nTo prevent an accidental release, the following are implemented:\na.\tProcedural\n1.\tBack-up chemical unloading\n2.\tCheck-off lists\n3.\tVisual observation while unloading\nb.\tTraining\n1.\tHands on training and test\n2.\tvideo training\n3.\tUnload training documentation\n\n5.\tFive-year accident history\n\nDuring the last five years no TDI related incidents were recorded.\n\n6.\tEmergency response program\n\nCarpenter Co. has a Contingency Plan.  The plan is a combination of a Preparedness, Prevention and Contingency (PPC) Plan and a Spill Prevention Response (SPR) Plan.  The plan is written to comply with all portions of our NPDES storm water permit (PAS232208) and RMP for toluene diisocyanate.  Telephone numbers of all agencies we expect to respond are in the Contingency Plan.  The following have received a copy of the Contingency Plan.\na.\tFogelsville Fire Department\nb.\tUpper Macungie Fire Marshall\nc.\tLehigh County Emergency Management Agency\nd.\tThe Pennsylvania Emergency Management Agency\ne.\tAllentown Fire Department\nCarpenter Co. has a coordination agreement with the Shaw Group (Nationwide Emergency Response) for environmental incidents we cannot handle.  Our in house Haz Mat Team members are First Responder Operational certified.  Safety meetings are held monthly.  Evacuation drills are conducted annually.  We have employees trained"
