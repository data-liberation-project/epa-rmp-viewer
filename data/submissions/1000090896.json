Compliance audits are conducted at least every three years.  The audit team includes those knowledgeable in the process, operations personnel, and at least one person trained in audit techniques and practices.  The audit team develops findings and corrective actions are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are retained.\r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\r\n\r\nAs required by RMP regulations, Entergy conducts process hazard analyses (PHA), compliance audits, and mechanical integrity inspections of the Anhydrous Ammonia System on a periodic basis.  Based on the findings of these audits and inspections, Entergy implements changes to the system as needed.

These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a consistent training basis for new operators.  Operating procedures are periodically reviewed and certified as current.  When process change occurs, operating procedures are revised as necessary through the management of change process.\r\n\r\nTraining\r\n\r\nTo complement the written process operation procedures, the PPS has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees.  New employees receive job specific training in plant operations.  Employee training includes emphasis on safety and health hazards, emergency shutdown operations, and safe work practices.  Operations demonstrating adequate knowledge to safely perform duties and tasks are allowed to work independently.\r\n\r\nHot Work Permit\r\n\r\nThe Perryville Electric Generating Plant issues a hot work permit for all hot work operations conducted on or near a covered process.  Procedures for issuing a hot work permit are clearly outlined in the Safety Manual.  The Perryville Electric Generating Plant provides Hot Work Permit training to all plant employees. Copies of issued work permits are maintained in operations and maintenance for a period of one year following completion of work.\r\n\r\nContractors\r\n\r\nThe Perryville Electric Generating Plant periodically uses contractors to perform maintenance or repair, outage, or specialty work on or adjacent to a covered process.

This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention such as training personnel and considering safety in design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the facility's processes.  The Entergy Louisiana, Inc. (ELL) policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of substances.\r\n\r\nELL operates the Perryville Electric Generating Plant located in Ouachita Parish, Louisiana. The Perryville Electric Generating Plant is a gas fired steam electric plant that produces approximately 725 megawatts of electricity.  The heat recovery steam generators used to turn electric generating units produce electricity for sale to homes and businesses.  As evidenced in the ensuing text and based on criteria in the Accident Release Program (ARP), the Perryville Electric Generating Plant is a Program 3 process.\r\n\r\nThe Perryville Electric Generating Plant was evaluated to determine if any regulated flammable or toxic substances were or would be present in the planned process and if they exceeded the threshold quantity.  There is one ammonia tank at the facility.  The identification of a vessel exceeding threshold quantities of a regulated flammable or toxic substance would subject a process to threshold determination for offsite consequence analysis.\r\n\r\nELL identified one regulated toxic substance and no flammable substances above the threshold values at Perryville Electric Generating Plant.  The anhydrous ammonia tank with a capacity of 5,000 gallons was determined to exceed the threshold quantity.

This participation begins with well established mechanisms of communication with all employees regarding covered process information.  Employees are involved in maintaining Process Safety Management (PSM) rule compliance based on their knowledge, skill job responsibilities, and experience.
