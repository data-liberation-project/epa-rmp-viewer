The Risk Management Program identifies the equipment, procedures, maintenance, inspection, and training associated with Regulated Substances (RS's) handled at this facility in excess of Federal threshold quantities; describes the structured assessment of hazards which was conducted to assess possible effects on employees and offsite public and environmental receptors; provides the results of an offsite consequences analysis; defines a prevention program, emergency response program, and mitigation measures to reduce the probability and magnitude of accidental releases of RS's; and establishes a schedule and responsibilities for implementation of mitigation measures and auditing of program elements.  This Risk Management Plan (RMP) is being filed with the USEPA and Sacramento County Environmental Management Department as required by CalARP regulations in order to report the elements of the current Risk Management Program and to describe further measures planned to mitigate or prevent accidental releases of RS's. \n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nEthosEnergy Group is the contract operator of a cogeneration facility, CVFA Carson Ice-Gen, located at 8580 Laguna Station Rd., Elk Grove, CA in Sacramento County, owned by Central Valley Finance Authority.

There are 8 full-time employees at this site.  Anhydrous ammonia is received in bulk and charged into a 12,000 gallon capacity bulk storage tank. Administrative controls based on RAGAGEPs limit the maximum amount of the tank to 10,800 gallons. Ammonia vapor is injected into each of the two gas turbine exhaust ducts and the auxiliary boiler unit where it dissociates into free nitrogen and hydrogen under high temperature conditions and then re-combines with nitrogen oxides and oxygen under the influence of a catalyst to produce nitrogen gas and water vapor. The feed rate of ammonia is adjusted automatically, based on continuous emission monitors in the exhaust gas.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nIt is the policy of EthosEnergy Group that the receipt, storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia at its facility be done in a manner which meets regulatory requirements and minimizes the probability and severity of accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia to the atmosphere, in order to protect the health and safety of its workers, the public, and the environment. In order to accomplish this goal, EthosEnergy Group has gathered safety information on anhydrous ammonia and on the process, equipment and procedures involving anhydrous ammonia; performed a structured assessment of hazards of the process and external events which might affect the process; performed an offsite consequences analysis of defined release scenarios; established a written program for prevention and mitigation of accidental releases; and established a written emergency response program coordinated with emergency response agencies.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Programs\n\nGeneral accidental release prevention programs instituted by EthosEnergy Group are categorized as administrative (management) progra"

This constitutes the general accidental release prevention program elements required for both the RMP and PSM for EthosEnergy Group's operations.\n\nChemical-Specific Release Prevention Steps\n\nRelease prevention steps specific to anhydrous ammonia have been identified and implemented. These include, among other things, installation of an additional emergency shower and eyewash station for the auxiliary boiler, and the creation of numerous equipment-specific operation procedures required for the introduction of new equipment.  \n\n\n\nLong term maintenance is ongoing at the facility with the bulk ammonia tank being taken out of service for approximately 1 week for inspection and maintenance.\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nThere have been no accidents involving anhydrous ammonia at this facility within the past five years resulting in injuries or offsite consequences.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nEthosEnergy Group's Emergency Response Program applicable to anhydrous ammonia has been coordinated with Sacramento County Environmental Management Department, Consumes Fire and Sacramento City Fire Special Operations Division (HazMat)  It consists of notification of the public agency assigned responsibility for First Response to hazardous materials release emergencies.
