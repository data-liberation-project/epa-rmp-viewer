      "SummaryText": "ng with the Chlorine Institute and the National Association of Chemical Distributors.\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled:  This facility is a chemical distribution and manufacturing facility that handles several products used to protect public health by treating water, wastewater, swimming pools and other uses.  For example, this facility supplies bleach used in disinfection at food processors and health facilities.  This site manufactures sodium hypochlorite which uses chlorine in the process.  Chlorine is regulated by the EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) and OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM).  The only chemical covered by Process Safety Management and Risk Management Plan for this facility is chlorine.  \n\nPrevention Program:  Accident prevention is achieved through safe handling procedures and safety systems that properly protect chemicals during shipping, storage, and use.  This starts with DOT FRA approved 90-ton rail cars that are robustly designed to contain chlorine through expected conditions during transport, storage and unloading.  It continues through having employees trained in proper handling procedures and equipping them with equipment to safely transfer chemicals during manufacture.  \n\nHawkins accident prevention program includes:\n1.\tProcedures and training for handling chlorine during manufacturing of sodium hypochlorite\n2.\tImplement safety systems to manage risks identified during process hazard analysis\n3.\tConduct necessary plant maintenance and inspections to ensure equipment is in good working order\n4.\tVendor provided DOT approved railcars\n5.\tAdhere to OSHA workplace safety regulations\n6.\tFollow Chlorine Institute standards\n7.\tMembers in good standings with National Association of Chemical Distributors\n\n5-year Accident History:  There has not been an accident involving chlorine at this facility in the last 5 years.\n\nEmergency Response:  In the event of a maintenance issue with chlorine equipment/rail car, employees are traine"

      "SummaryText": "Introduction\nHawkins, Inc. was founded in 1938 and is a progressive business that supplies chemicals, delivery systems and expertise to improve the environment. Hawkins is based in Roseville, Minnesota with branches throughout the United States. Hawkins purchased the Dupo facility from Vertex Chemical Corporation in January 2011. \n\nThis facility batch manufactures sodium hypochlorite using chlorine, sodium hydroxide and water, providing water and waste-water treatment, pulp and paper, and pool chemicals to improve the quality of life and operate in concert with the environment.\n\nThe Dupo facility is sited remote from immediate population groups, in an industrial/rail yard area with space, fences, security, natural obstacles separating the areas from casual public.  Secondary security fencing is located around the chlorine rail car unloading area to keep unauthorized personnel away from the chlorine unloading area.  Batch process is set up as close as possible to the chlorine railcars to reduce pipeline distance which reduces the hazard of mechanical failure and how much chlorine would be released in a pipeline failure.\n\nExecutive Summary \nPrevention and Emergency Response policies:  Hawkins' management and safety committees have set a motto of Think Safe! Be Safe! regarding accidents and injuries.  Support for this motto is manifested in several ways, including:\n1.\tA corporate Health, Safety and Environmental (HSE) department staffed with trained professionals.\n2.\tTraining programs in chemical safety, safe material handling, accident prevention and emergency response.\n3.\tPrompt investigation of near misses and incidents to identify root causes and implement measures to prevent future occurrences.\n4.\tAdherence to all EPA and OSHA regulations governing our operations.\n5.\tCompliance with DOT requirements regarding shipping and materials.\n6.\tInternal and 3rd party audits of Health, Safety and Environmental procedures at all Hawkins locations.\n7.\tMembers in good standi"
