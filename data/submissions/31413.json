(YAC) Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies are simply not to have accidental releases or emergencies.  The company endeavors to execute these policies through the implementation of its Safety Program.  The company safety program includes, but is not limited to a comprehensive Process Safety Management (PSM). The PSM program is executed through YAC?s partner, Western Precooling Systems (WPS).  WPS is a stakeholder in the YAC operation and has offices and staff about 100 yards from the facility.  PSM is specifically designed and intended to prevent accidental releases.  It is the primary goal of YAC and WPS to protect employees, visitors and neighbors from harm due to company operations. \n\nYAC has adopted a ?non-responding facility? policy; has an established Emergency Action Plan and has taken the steps necessary to be included in the community emergency plan.  An Emergency Coordinator has been established and coordination with the State Emergency Response Commission (SERC), Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and Fire Department is performed on an ongoing basis.  Emergency response pre-planning is coordinated and kept current through the annual submission of appropriate Reports and periodic tours of the facility by the Fire Department.  \n\nWPS policy includes maintaining appropriate emergency capabilities and to deal with emergencies safely if and when they do happen.  Key WPS employees attend 1910.120 (q) Emergency Response training that is refreshed annually.  Emergency equipment is maintained under the control of WPS.  \n\nEach company strives to execute its emergency response policies through skilled employees that are provided with adequate and appropriate equipment and training (production workers contracted by YAC are trained for their emergency actions.  Refrigeration Technicians employed by WPS are tra"

The facility was built in 1987.  The facility provides refrigeration effect for the removal of field heat from freshly harvested vegetables (produce) and subsequent short-term refrigerated storage.  The product that comes to the facility for pre-cooling and subsequent short-term storage is on-site generally four days from harvesting.  The facility is a seasonally operated plant with product harvest periods beginning in mid-November and finishing in early April.  \n\nThe refrigerant in use is Anhydrous Ammonia, CAS #7664-41-7, which is used in a closed-loop mechanical refrigeration system.  Pressure and temperature controls are installed in accordance with appropriate standards, including isolation and overpressure relief valves.  At certain times of the year portable cooling equipment is required to augment the fixed equipment at the facility. Due to the seasonal operation of the Plant, the refrigerant is removed and placed in storage vessels at the end of each season.  The vessels are rated at higher pressure and temperature than the equipment it is transferred out of.  The vessels are provided shade, traffic barriers and a water sprinkler system.  The water sprinkler system reduces pressure and temperature on very hot days in the Yuma area.   \n\nOperation of the facility is a coordinated effort.  Yuma American Cooling Systems, Inc. is a California Corporation made up of Salyer American Fresh Foods?52%, Western Precooling Systems?24% and Skyview Cooling Company?24%.  Yuma American Cooling Systems, Inc. contracts with American Cooling Inc. to supply all production workers and forklifts necessary for the operation, in addition to having total management responsibilities for day-to-day shipping operations.  \n\nYuma American Cooling Systems, "

Portable refrigeration equipment is owned either by Western Precooling Systems or by Salyer Western (a partnership between Salyer American and Western Precooling Systems).  Maintenance of the entire refrigeration system has been delegated to Western Precooling Systems, who has offices and staff about 100 yards from the site.  Western Precooling Systems is also responsible for the Risk and Process Safety Management Plans and their implementation. \n\n1.3  General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\nA comprehensive Process Safety Management (PSM) Program  has been established in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.119.  The PSM Program is specifically intended to prevent accidental releases & promote the safe operation of ammonia-handling equipment and processes.  PSM is an integral part of daily Plant operation.  The written PSM document is maintained in the site RMP binder.\n\nWPS is the company that maintains the ammonia refrigeration equipment at the site.  WPS has developed comprehensive written procedures for the operation and maintenance of ammonia-handling equipment, including the steps to be taken in the event of a release or threatened release.  The written procedures include necessary safety precautions for Plant operation, from installation and start-up to daily operation, to teardown and removal of portable equipment.  As equipment maintenance needs are determined, the need is expressed at the workload meetings conducted by the WPS Area Manager.  The specific repair task or upgrade for the expressed need is decided by the WPS Area Manager and entered into the work order system. Tasks are tracked through the work order system.  Through this regular routine of inspect, discuss, assign and confirmation of completion, Yuma American Cooling Systems, Inc. and WPS have reduced equipment operational problems and also reduc"

Technicians only perform tasks for which they have been pre-qualified.\n\nChemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nIt has become apparent in the industry that a mishap while draining oil from the system is one of the most common incidents to occur.  If a release were to develop during the oil-draining task, the mechanic simply releases the handle of the self-closing valve and flow is terminated.  WPS has installed these special valves at all oil drain points.\n\nOther release prevention steps taken at Yuma American Cooling Systems, Inc.:\n?The facility is enclosed with fencing and gates to limit access to the facility and to increase the security of the facility from potential ?wrong-doers?.\n?Employees are trained for hazard communication (discovery and communicating) for releases, fires, vandal?s etc.  Training is documented in each employees training record file.\n?Staff is trained in the benefits of good housekeeping.  The general appearance of the facility is maintained on a day-to-day basis.\n?Security Service on-site to control casual visitors (truck drivers reporting to pick-up produce).\n?A controlled pressure receiver was added for daily operational swing capacity.\n\n1.4  Five-Year Accident History\n\nThere have been no qualifying accidental releases at the site over the last five years.  There is no data to report.\n\n1.5  The Emergency Response Program\n\nThe Emergency Response Program is divided into two elements, as only properly trained and qualified personnel are authorized to respond to emergencies.  Production workers contracted by YAC are trained to notify and evacuate via the Plant?s Emergency Action Plan.  Only the Rural Metro/Yuma Fire Department would respond to an emergency; support would be made available via WPS personnel trained to 29 CFR 1910.120(q) standards.  Emergency equipment is maintain"
