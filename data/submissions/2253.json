      "SummaryText": "1.0\tSOURCE AND PROCESS DESCRIPTION\n1.1\tSOURCE\nThe Hiland Roberts Ice Cream Company in Norfolk, Nebraska is subject to the USEPA's Risk Management Program (RMP) for Accidental Chemical Release regulation (40 CFR 68) because it has a refrigeration system that contains more than the threshold quantity (10,000 pounds) of anhydrous ammonia (CAS Number 7664-41-7).  Anhydrous ammonia (NH3), is a gas at ambient conditions.  The anhydrous ammonia (ammonia) refrigeration system is used to manufacture and store ice cream and related dairy products.  It is a closed system that contains approximately 26,800 pounds (i.e., 5,400 gallons) of ammonia in various physical states (gas, liquid, and saturated vapor).  The largest vessel is the high pressure receiver that operates at approximately 150 psig and can contain as much as 9,500 pounds of liquid ammonia (at its maximum safe fill volume of 90%).  However, during typical operation, the vessel contains only 3,600 pounds of ammonia.  Most of the ammonia equipment is located indoors.  The condensing towers, receiver, and some piping runs are located outdoors.  The Norfolk plant is located in a rural setting.\n\nAmmonia is the oldest and most common refrigerant in general industrial use throughout the world.  It is a high capacity refrigerant that operates at reasonable pressure.  Although exposure to ammonia is irritating and potentially toxic in large doses, personnel exposure to more than a small leak is rare because ammonia operates within a closed system of vessels, piping, and equipment.  In addition, ammonia can be easily detected by smell at levels well below its toxic endpoint.\n\n1.2\tPROCESS DESCRIPTION\nThe anhydrous ammonia refrigeration at the Norfolk plant is a two-stage system consisting of a high (pressure) side and a low (pressure) side.\n\nThe ice cream processing units (barrel freezers) and storage freezers operate on the low side (low pressure and, therefore, low temperature).  Ammonia suction from the units, at about 0"

Any liquid ammonia in the low side suction is trapped in the liquid recirculator and pumped-out to the low side load units.  The booster discharge passes through an intercooler before entering the high side compressors. \n\nThe high stage compressor suction draws from the intercooler (booster discharge) and two high side suction accumulators at about 25 psig.  These accumulators receive suction from the ice builder, air handlers, various cooler units, and the milk silos.  Ammonia liquid which collects in the high side accumulators is transferred by pumper drums to the control pressure receiver.\n\nDischarge from the high side compressors (hot gas) is vented to three roof-mounted condensors.  A portion of the hot gas is also used for defrost, operation of the pumper drums, and for the control pressure receiver.\n\nThe condensed liquid is returned to the high pressure receiver where it is fed to either the control pressure receiver or to the low pressure liquid recirculator.  The liquid passes through a liquid cooler before entering the low pressure liquid recirculator. \n\nThe control pressure receiver is used to supply high pressure liquid to the high side load units.  The pressure of the liquid is maintained by feeding hot gas into the vessel.\n\n\nVarious safety systems are part of the anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system.  These include pressure relief valves, engine room ventilation, and safety interlocks.  \n\nSafety relief valves (SRVs) protect the compressor discharge, condensors, pumper drums, suction accumulators, intercooler, and liquid recirculation system from overpressurization.  SRVs on the compressor discharge and condensers are set at 250 psig.  SRVs for the suction vessels are set at 150 psig.\n\nSafety interlocks include high pressure and high temperature alarms and cut-outs for the compressors, as well as high level floats and/or sensors for the vessels.

If the intermediate pressure increases to 30 psig, an alarm also sounds.  If the pressure continues to rise to 40 psig, the boosters are shut down.\n\nFloat switches on the suction vessels alarm when a high level is reached.  If the liquid level continues to rise, additional float switches and/or level control shut off the appropriate compressors or boosters to avoid slugging.\n\n2.0\tPOTENTIAL RELEASE SCENARIOS\nThe refrigeration system is a totally closed system.  Historically, releases of ammonia from industrial refrigeration systems most often occur from leaking valves, malfunctioning pressure relief devices, or inadvertent releases during repair activities.  While these incidents can impact employees, they seldom lead to a release of a reportable quantity or represent an off-site impact.\n\nConsistent with the RMP rule requirements, two specifically defined release scenarios (a worst-case release and an alternative release) were analyzed to determine the maximum distance to an endpoint where the ammonia concentration is 200 parts per million in air, or 0.02 percent.  This endpoint represents the maximum airborne concentration below which nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing irreversible effects or symptoms that could impair their ability to take protective action.\n\nThe release scenarios analyzed are based upon the guidance contained in the USEPA's Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration (the \"Model Plan\"), dated November 1998.  This guidance document used the SACRUNCH atmospheric dispersion model to construct \"lookup\" tables that relate the quantity and rate of ammonia released to the endpoint distance.\n\n2.1\tWORST-CASE RELEASE\nThe worst-case release is considered to be defined by the catastrophic rupture and complete loss of the max"

Using the specified worst-case meteorology contained in the Model Plan, the distance to the endpoint for a worst-case release was estimated to be 9,200 feet or 1.75 mile.\n\nAlthough the worst-case consequence analysis is required by the RMP, it should be considered a highly unlikely event.  Design, construction, and operation of the high accumulator is such that catastrophic failure is extremely remote.  The vessel was designed and constructed in strict accordance with the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code (Section VIII), and was certified and stamped by the National Board of Pressure Vessel Inspectors (National Board).  Third party and state mandated inspections of the vessel's condition occurs annually by a boiler and machinery insurance inspector who has been certified by the National Board.  In addition, the vessel is visually inspected daily.\n\nThere are only two plausible causes for a catastrophic loss of containment of the receiver:  (1) the internal pressure were to increase uncontrollably and rupture the vessel from the inside; or (2) rupture of the vessel wall due to inadvertent contact (e.g., vehicular) from the outside.\n\nThe vessel is operated well below the design pressure (i.e., maximum allowable working pressure) of 250 psig and because of the safety factors built into the ASME Code, a fourfold pressure excursion, to approximately 1,000 psig, would have to occur before catastrophic vessel failure.  Such pressures could not be generated internally.  The only logical external cause of high pressure would be flame impingement or surface radiation from a high challenge fire adjacent to the vessel.  If this were to occur, the vessel is equipped with a safety relief valve (SRV) set to relieve internal pressure at 250 psig.  A high pressure excursion would not occur as long as the SRVs continued to function"

The SRVs are scheduled to be replaced every five years, in accordance with the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) guidance contained in IIAR Bulletin Number 109, Minimum Safety Criteria for a Safety Ammonia Refrigeration System, to ensure that they will function properly when required.\n\nFurther, rupture of the vessel from the outside as a result of inadvertent vehicular contact is unlikely since the unit is protected by guard posts.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario is unlikely for the following additional reasons:\n\n* The worst-case weather conditions which were used for this scenario are uncommon;\n\n* Industry standards were followed for the manufacture and quality control of this vessel;\n\n* Ammonia is not corrosive in this service;\n\n* Safety relief valves limit operating pressures;\n\n* The facility has a preventive maintenance program in place to maintain the ongoing integrity of the vessel;\n\n* The facility has a training program designed to ensure that the system is operated by qualified personnel;\n\n* The facility has emergency response procedures which enable trained personnel to respond quickly to isolate any potential releases;\n\n* Main ammonia shut-offs have been labeled to allow personnel to stop the flow of ammonia quickly in an emergency.\n\n2.2\tALTERNATIVE-CASE RELEASE\nThe alternative, or \"more likely\", scenario is considered to be defined by a release of ammonia through a 1/4-inch effective diameter hole in a high side (i.e., 150 psig) pipe or vessel, releasing 100 pounds of ammonia per minute for up to 60 minutes.

To help minimize the probability and severity of an ammonia release, a prevention program that satisfies the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), Process Safety Management (PSM) of Highly Hazardous Chemicals  standard (29 CFR 1910.119) has been implemented.

The objective of the investigation is to correct deficiencies in such a way as to prevent recurrence.\n\n* Contractors that are hired to work on, or adjacent to, the refrigeration system are \"pre-qualified\" based upon their knowledge of ammonia refrigeration, understanding of applicable codes and standards, and their demonstrated ability to work safely.  \n\n* Prior to the performance of any hot work (i.e., spark or flame producing operations such as welding, cutting, brazing, grinding), management must approve the work by executing a written hot work authorization permit to verify that precautions to prevent fire have been implemented.\n\n* Periodic formal walk-throughs occur to find unusual or increasing vibration, incipient leaks, or other indications of potential upsets or failures that could lead to a release.\n\n* Replacement of all pressure relief valves is scheduled every five years.\n\n* Numerous safety systems, including pressure relief valves, ammonia vessel level controls, and safety interlocks are used in the refrigeration system.\n\n* Periodic inspection and calibration is performed on liquid level sensors, temperature and pressure instruments, switches and shutdown devices that have safety implications.\n\n* Periodic inspections are performed for major powered equipment, including compressors, pumps and large fans, bearings, couplings, shaft seals, mountings, etc., for vibration or incipient"

Any deficiency found in an audit is corrected.\n4.0\tACCIDENT HISTORY\nThere have been no accidental releases of ammonia at the facility in the last five years (since June 1994) that have resulted in death, injury, or significant property damage on-site or off-site death, injury, evacuation, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n5.0\tEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\nThe facility has implemented a detailed written Emergency Action Plan (EAP).  The EAP is intended to address all emergencies at the facility, in addition to incidents related to a release of ammonia.\n\nThe EAP includes awareness and response training for employees, coordination with the local fire department, and evacuation of the facility.  The plan details what personal protective equipment and spill response equipment is available; identifies specific individuals, their 24-hour telephone numbers, and their responsibilities; identifies procedures for emergency medical care; and refers to other pertinent elements of the management system (i.e., standard operating procedures).\n\n1\tPassive mitigation means equipment, devices, and technologies that function without human, mechanical, or other energy input.  Examples include enclosures (e.g., buildings) for compressed gases and secondary containment dikes for liquids.\n2\tActive mitigation means equipment, devices, or technologies that require human, mechanical, or other energy input to function.  Active mitigation for compressed gases, like ammonia, may include"
