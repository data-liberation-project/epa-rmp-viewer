It is the policy of the J. R. Simplot Company to manufacture, handle, transport, store, and dispose of all substances safely and in compliance with the requirements of federal, state, and local environmental, health, & safety laws while reducing the risks to human health, safety, and the environment.  This policy applies to all groups, divisions, operations, and departments of the J. R. Simplot Company, including the Simplot Grower Solutions (SGS) facility located at 35836 W. Bullard Avenue, Firebaugh, Fresno County, California.  Facility management is expected to implement, and all employees are expected to comply with, the spirit and letter of this policy.\n\n\n\nSGS Firebaugh is an agricultural retail store, providing ag-related products and services to area farmers.  The facility stores and handles bulk dry fertilizers, bulk liquid fertilizers, bulk liquid pesticides, and performs both dry and liquid custom fertilizer blending.  The facility also stores prepackaged fertilizers and other agricultural chemicals for sale and delivery to growers.  The regulated substance stored and handled at this location is aqua ammonia solution (aqua).  Aqua is received and unloaded from cargo tank trucks, and stored in a 30,000-gallon aboveground carbon steel tank.  For delivery to growers, the product is loaded into bobtail trucks and tank trailers as 20% nitrogen liquid fertilizer.  No production of aqua is done at this facility.\n\n\n\nThe worst-case release scenario for the facility is the catastrophic failure of the 30,000-gallon aqua storage tank.  This event would result in a release that would be fully contained within the tank secondary containment struc"

      "SummaryText": "ture.  The calculated distance to the toxic endpoint is 0.4-miles.  The alternative release scenario involves rupture of a 3-inch transfer hose, in which aqua is released at the loadout pad for a period of 2-minutes before human intervention stops the flow.  The calculate distance to the toxic endpoint is 0.2 miles.  The area surrounding the facility is rural with flat terrain.  Potential receptors in the area are a plastics recycling plant and a single farm residence.\n\n\n\nThe facility Plan complies with the EPA Risk Management Plan (RMP) regulations, and the California Accidental Release Prevention Program (CalARP) regulations under 19 CCR Division 2 Chapter 4.5. The covered process is subject to Program 2 requirements.  The storage tank is fitted with a pressure and vacuum relief valve and an emergency pressure relief valve.  A key practice at this facility is ammonia training.   All employees receive ammonia general awareness training.  Operators receive classroom and field training, and are certified by management.  Operators are involved in reviewing and updating standard operating procedures.\n\n  \n\nDuring the past 5 years, the facility has had no accidental releases of ammonia that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n  \n\nThe facility has an emergency response plan that provides evacuation procedures and notification contact information.  Employees receive annual training on the plan and periodically participate in evacuation drills.  The facility hazmat response team is qualified to respond up to Level C, but does not have the training or equipment to respond to a large release of aqua ammonia.  In this case, Cal Fire Mendota Station 96 would serve as the primary emergency responder.  Emergency plans and procedures have been coordinated with the Fire Department and Fresno County Environmental Health Services.  As proce"
