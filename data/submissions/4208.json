Facility Accidental Release Policy - The owners, management, and employees of Walla Walla Farmers Coop, 111 North 9th., Walla Walla, Washington 99362, with branch operations at 113 South \"D\" Street, Prescott, Washington 99348, and 5003 West Brinkley Road, Kennewick, Washington are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia and aqua ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.  A detailed emergency response plan has been developed and will be implemented in the event of an accidental release.  2.  Facility Information - * The primary activity at the Walla Walla Fertilizer Facility is the storage, blending and sale of fertilizers to farmers.  * Anhydrous ammonia and aqua ammonia are received, stored, and distributed for both direct application and for blending into mixed grade fertilizers for crop production nutrients.  * At Walla Walla the anhydrous ammonia is received by tanker truck and put into an 18,000 gallon and a 30,000 gallon above ground storage tanks.  The maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia at Walla Walla in storage is 210,120 pounds.  * At Walla Walla the converter, converts anhydrous ammonia to aqua ammonia and the product is transferred on site to 4 - 30,000 gallon above ground storage tanks.  During the peak seasons of the year additional product can be transported from off-site by truck to the Walla Walla storage tanks.  Product is transferred from the Walla Walla location by company tank truck to a 20,000 gallon above ground storage tank at the Prescott branch and to a 20,000 gallon above ground storage tank at the Kennewick branch.  The maximum quantity of aqua ammonia in storage at Walla Walla is 866,400 pounds.  3. The Worst CAse and Alternate Release Scenario's - a. Anhydrous Ammonia Worst Case and Alternativ"

      "SummaryText": "e Release Scenarios. - The worst case release scenario for the facility is failure of the largest storage tank when filled to the greatest amount would release 131,300 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.  The distance to the endpoint is 1.07 miles.  The alternative release scenario, based on the most likely potential incident is a release of 11,900 pounds from a 2-inch diameter pipe or hose.  The distance to the endpoint is .41 miles.  b. Aqua Ammonia Worst Case and Alternative Scenarios. - The worst case release scenario for the Walla Walla Fertilizer Facility is failure of the largest storage tank whenfilled to the greatest amount would release 216,600 pounds of 20% aqua ammonia.  The distance to the endpoint is .66 miles.  The alternative release scenario, based on the most likely potential incident is a release of 15,200 pounds from one of the 30,000 gallon tanks.  The distance to the endpoint is .18 miles.  4. Accidental Release Prevention Program - The facility has implemented the provisions for the \"Safety Requirement for Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\" published by the American Standards Institute, Inc. and the standards of OSHA 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\".  5. Five-year Accident History - There have been no accidental releases or near misses of anhyrous ammonia or aqua ammonia in the past five years.  6. The Emergency Response Program - The facility's emergency response program was written in accordance with the following regulations:  * OSHA 29CFR 1910.38. * OSHA 29CFR 1910.120.  7. Planned Changes to Improve Safety - Safety improvement is an ongoing process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no additional specific planned changes to the anhydrous ammonia and aqua ammonia processes at the facility."
