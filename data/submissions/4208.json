Facility Accidental Release Policy - The owners, management, and employees of Walla Walla Farmers Coop, 111 North 9th., Walla Walla, Washington 99362, with branch operations at 113 South \"D\" Street, Prescott, Washington 99348, and 5003 West Brinkley Road, Kennewick, Washington are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia and aqua ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.  A detailed emergency response plan has been developed and will be implemented in the event of an accidental release.  2.
