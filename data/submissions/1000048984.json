      "SummaryText": "The Bridgeport Gas Plant is a natural gas condensate, amine treating and gas dehydration facility (\"Facility\"), which utilizes more than the threshold quantity of a \"regulated flammable substance (10,000 pounds)\" in the processing of natural gas.  The natural gas condensate is an RMP-regulated flammable mixture.  Therefore, this Facility is subject to the Risk Management Plan (RMP) requirements codified in Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations Part 68 (40 CFR 68) administered by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). \n\n\n\nThe Bridgeport Gas Plant is also subject to Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (29 CFR 1910.119) and public receptors are located within the worst-case release scenario for the plant.  Therefore, the Bridgeport Gas Plant is subject to Program 3 requirements as stated in 40 CFR 68.10. OSHA's PSM standard closely parallels requirements outlined in USEPA's RMP Rule.  All elements required by USEPA's 40 CFR 68 - Program 3 Prevention Program are also required by OSHA's PSM. \n\n\n\nWithin the last five (5) years, the Bridgeport Gas Plant has not had an accidental release of a regulated substance where exposure to the substance, its reaction products, overpressure generated by an explosion involving the substance, or radiant heat generated by a fire involving the substance led to any off-site death, injury, or response or restoration activities for an exposure of an environmental receptor.  \n\n\n\nThe Bridgeport Gas Plant employs 58 full-time employees on-site who ensure the proper operation and maintenance of the Facility.  \n\n\n\nEnLink Midstream Operating, L.P. (EnLink), formerly Devon Energy Corporation, last submitted a full RMP the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) in July 2013 for the Bridgeport Gas Plant.  The current RMP includes administrative updates addressing the change from Devon Energy Corporation to EnLink, Facility modifications, and is being submitted"

      "SummaryText": " as a full 5-year update.   \n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\n\n\nThe Bridgeport Gas Plant maintains a policy of safe natural gas condensate separation operations, reducing to the greatest extent possible hazards associated with the separation processes, and reducing subsequent risk to the surrounding community, employees, and the environment.    \n\n\n\nThe Bridgeport Gas Plant has procedures in place, including both on-site activities and coordination with off-site responders that are to be followed in the event of a natural gas condensate release.\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n\n\nThe Bridgeport Gas Plant separates natural gas condensate from raw inlet gas in various aboveground vessels and associated piping and valves.  Natural gas condensate is a flammable hydrocarbon mixture that may contain the following RMP-regulated flammables: isobutane, N-butane, neopentane (2,2-dimethylpropane), isopentane, and N-pentane.    Although natural gas condensate is often classified as an NFPA Class 3 flammable substance, testing completed by EnLink demonstrates that the mixture would, at times, be considered an NFPA Class 4 flammable based upon the flash point and boiling point of the mixture. As such, EnLink has chosen to include natural gas condensate in the RMP-regulated inventory.\n\n\n\nThe Facility also stores and processes the following RMP-regulated substances: natural gasoline, ethyl mercaptan, natural gas liquids (NGL), propane, isobutane, N-butane, and ethane.  NGL is a flammable mixture that contains propane, ethane, N-butane, isobutane, isopentane, N-pentane, and methane; isobutane is a flammable mixture that contains propane, N-butane, and isobutane; ethane is a flammable mixture that contains propane, ethane, and methane; natural gasoline is a flammable mixture that contains Isopentane and pentane.   Propane ethyl mercaptan, and N-butane are stored at the Facility in their pure form.  \n\n\n\nThe following provide"

The Bridgeport Gas Plant does not accept gas that contains greater than 1 percent hydrogen sulfide; therefore, hydrogen sulfide is not required to be considered as an RMP-regulated toxic at the Facility.  \n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nThe Bridgeport Gas Plant maintains a consistent accidental release prevention program to eliminate or minimize releases of propane.  As previously indicated, the Prevention Program required under 40 CFR 68 is identical to the prevention program required under OSHA's PSM.  The Bridgeport Gas Plant's Prevention Program 3 elements, as required under 40 CFR 68 Subpart D, are included in the Facility's PSM Plan, which is kept on-site as a separate document. Required elements include:  \n\n\n\nEmployee Participation; \n\nProcess Safety Information; \n\nProcess Hazard Analysis;\n\nOperating Procedures;\n\nTraining;\n\nContractors; \n\nPre-startup Review; \n\nMechanical Integrity; \n\nHot Work Permits;\n\nManagement of Change; \n\nIncident Investigation; and \n\nCompliance Audits.\n\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nThe Bridgeport Gas Plant has had no accidental releases of flammable materials regulated under the RMP program that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on-site, or off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or any environmental impact for the period of five (5) years prior to May 2015.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\n\n\n\nThe Emergency Response Program requirements for Program 3 Facilities are very similar to those required under the PSM Rule.  The Emergency Response Program required under the RMP and PSM Rules must be site-specific and comprehensive, including the following elements: \n\n\n\nPublic and emergency response agency notification procedure"

The ERP addresses all aspects of emergency response, including proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post incident cleanup and decontamination requirements.  In addition, the Facility has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment, as well as instructions that address the use of emergency response equipment.  Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties.  The emergency response program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to facility processes.\n\n\n\nOperating procedures and equipment design codes and standards associated with the operations at the Facility are maintained.  Furthermore, the Facility has coordinated the ERP with the Wise County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and the Wise Fire Department.  This coordination includes periodic meetings of the committee, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials, and industry representatives.  The Facility has around-the-clock communications capability.  EnLink operators are automatically called in the event of a process upset.  The operator will then call the appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., fire department).  This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.  In addition to periodic LEPC meetings"
