This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training and consideration of safety in the design, operation, and maintenance of the polyurethane foam manufacturing system. The facility's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of a regulated substance.\r\n\r\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\r\nThe Carpenter Co. - Riverside facility maintains and operates a process system comprised of Methyl Formate and Toluene Diisocyanate, 80:20 TDI blend (80 wt% 2,4 TDI and 20 wt% 2,6 TDI) hereby referred to as TDI. Not including unloading of the regulated chemicals Methyl Formate and TDI to their respective storage tanks,there is one process these regulated chemical are involved in.\r\n\r\nPolyurethane Foam Manufacturing Process: Equipment for the regulated substances involved in the manufacturing of polyurethane foam include: four 55,000 gallon TDI storage tanks, two 12,500 gallon TDI metering tanks, one 10,000 gallon Methyl Formate storage tank, one Methyl Formate booster pump, one Methyl Formate pump metering skid, two heat exchangers, and multiple TDI transfer pumps. Both Methyl Formate and TDI are individually piped and do not come into contact with one another until they meet at the mixing head where the foam is poured. Additionally, there can be up to four approximately 23,700 gallon (each) TDI railcars stored onsite. Details of the inventory calculation can be found in the Process Safety Information (PSI) section of the Compliance Workbook.\r\n\r\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT SUMMARY/OFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\r\nWorst-Case Release Scenario Results Summary:\r\nScenario Description: Per the CalARP Regulations, one worst-case release scenario has been defined for the regulated toxic chemical involved in the polyurethane foam manufacturing process (TDI). The results can be found in the Hazard"

The results can be found in the Hazard Assessment documentation.\r\n\r\nRisk Considerations:\r\nAlthough both the handling of Methyl Formate and TDI and the production of polyurethane foam have inherent potential risks and the release scenarios can potentially reach sensitive populations within the community, the facility has recognized these potential risks and structured its safety programs to make the worst case type of event non-credible. In addition to the safety practices of the facility and plant personnel to make the worst-case event non-credible, it should also be recognized that there are inherent analysis assumptions that make the results of the atmospheric dispersion analysis appear worse than what would actually be expected during such an event.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the use of conservative analysis assumptions that over-predict the effects of a potential release, other characteristics of the facility and site serve to minimize the potential risks associated with a Methyl Formate and/or TDI release. The facility utilizes pressure relief valves, manual and automated shutoffs, and emergency shutdown systems.\r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\r\nAs part of the implementation of the Prevention Program, key Prevention Program elements were documented and implemented by the facility to manage process safety issues associated with the use of Methyl Formate and TDI. Prevention elements for each program are listed in Table 1 below.\r\n\r\nList of Prevention Program Elements:\r\n- Process Safety Information\r\n- Process Hazard Analysis\r\n- Operating Procedures\r\n- Training\r\n- Mechanical Integrity\r\n- Management of Change\r\n- Pre-Startup Safety Review\r\n- Compliance Audits\r\n- Incident Investigation\r\n- Employee"

The facility began storing methyl formate above the threshold quantity on April 25, 2013.  There have been no CalARP-applicable releases of Methyl Formate at the facility since that time.\r\n\r\nEXTERNAL EVENTS ANALYSIS\r\nPursuant to the requirements of California Health & Safety Code, Title 19, Division 2, Chapter 4.5, \u00a72745.7(q); the following external events analysis information shall be submitted:\r\n\r\nThe types of natural and human caused external events considered in PHA Section 2760.2 or Hazard Review Section 2755.2.\r\n\r\nDuring the January 2011 PHA a broad list of external events was considered by the Team. General events external to the plant that can conceivably cause a release of either Methyl Formate or TDI were addressed. The External Events that were considered credible include, but are not limited to, earthquake, vandalism, sabotage, external fire, human error/misoperation, and vehicle impact.\r\n\r\nThe estimated magnitude or scope of external events which were considered. If not known, the owner or operator of the stationary source shall work closely with the AA to determine what is required. If seismic events are applicable, the parameters used in the consideration of the seismic analysis and which edition of the Uniform Building Code was used when the process was designed.\r\n\r\nThe magnitudes of the external events considered are detailed within the PHA Worksheets and were qualitatively risk-ranked by the PHA Team.\r\n\r\nFor each external event, with a potential to create a release of a regulated substance that will reach an endpoint offsite, apply\r\n1) The expected date of completion of any changes resulting from the PHA;\r\n2) Major hazards identified;\r\n3) Process controls in use;\r\n4) Mitigation systems in use;\r\n5) Monitoring and detection systems in use; and,\r\n6) Changes since the la"

Contact phone numbers are listed in the Incident Investigation section of the facility's program binder. Carpenter Co. - Riverside will coordinate with local Fire Department and their privately contracted Emergency Environmental Response provider Shaw Environmental & Infrastructure, Inc. in the event of an emergency due to an uncontrolled release of a regulated hazardous substance. The facility has filed a Business Emergency Plan to help coordinate with local responders.\r\n\r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\nThe Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) study has been conducted to examine mitigation measures to improve safety at the facility.
