The following effects could occur at the endpoint distance.  At distances less than the endpoint distance, the effects would be greater; at distances greater than the endpoint distance, the effects would be less.  When considering the release of a toxic substance, such as anhydrous ammonia, most people at the endpoint distance would be able to walk away from the exposure without any long-term health consequences, although some short-term consequences (e.g., strong eye or throat irritation) are likely.  The recommended response to a release is to shelter-in-place and to shut off any air intakes (e.g., air conditioners or fresh air make-up systems).\n\nThe RMP rule includes specific requirements for the worst-case and alternative release scenarios that must be reported by Conectiv.  These requirements are:\n\n* One worst-case release scenario for each Program 1 process (the Bethlehem Plant does not have any processes meeting the Program 1 definition)\n* One worst-case release scenario for the class of toxic substances in Program 3 processes (i.e., one scenario representing the anhydrous ammonia process)  \n* One alternative release scenario for each of the toxic substances in a Program 3 process (i.e. one scenario representing the anhydrous ammonia process)\n* One wors"

The solution evaporates and forms a vapor cloud. The Anhydrous Ammonia would be released to atmosphere over a 10-minute period. The scenario results in off-site impacts to both public and environmental receptors.  Each system was analyzed as a separate source due to the location and seperation of each system. \n\nAlternative Release Scenario 1 for the anhydrous ammonia system is a 3-inch hole in the storage tank.  Operators would be notified of a release by ammonia monitors located around the tank and throughout the process area.  The containment area would limit the extent of spread of the liquid ammonia and the water spray system would limit the vaporization of ammonia. Conservatively, 56,000 pounds of ammonia would be released from the time the incident began until it would all vaporize or be captured by the water spray system in an aqueous solution.  The scenario results in off-site impacts to both public and environmental receptors.\n\nAlternate Release Scenario 2 for the anhydrous ammonia system is a tank failure that results in a release of liquid ammonia into the containment area.  The liquid ammonia slowly fumes off (rate reduced by the auto-refrigeration effect of evaporating ammonia).  The release scenario was modeled to represent the effects without the water spray system since the water would add heat to the system causing a further release.\n\n1.4 Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-specific"

Executive Summary \n\nConectiv Bethlehem, LLC(Conectiv) is committed to operating in a manner that is safe for Conectiv workers, the public, and the environment. As a demonstration of that commitment, Conectiv has developed and implemented Environmental and Workplace Health and Safety Policies to serve as guiding principles for all it's employees and operations.  Conectiv believes that following these policies is the responsibility of every employee. \n\nAs part of this commitment, Conectiv has established a system to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility.  One component of this system is a Risk Management Program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at Conectiv and that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) regulation 40 CFR part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule).  One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit a risk management plan (RMP Plan) describing the risk management program at Conectiv.  This document is intended to satisfy the RMP Plan requirement of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program at Conectiv.\n\nThe risk management program at Conectiv consists of three elements:\n\n1. A hazard assessment to help understand the potential offsite consequences of hypothetical accidental releases and a history of accidents that have occurred during the last five years associated with the use of substances regulated by the RMP rule (regulated substances) - see topics 1.3 and 1.5\n\n2. A prevention program to help maintain and safely operate the processes containing more than a threshold quantity of a regulated substance (covered processes) - see topic 1.4\n\n3.

In fact, Conectiv has a comprehensive safety program in place establishing various levels of safeguards against release of a hazardous substance and injuries/damage from a release of a hazardous substance.\n\nConectiv limits the use of hazardous substances.  Before using a hazardous substance at Conectiv, less hazardous alternatives are considered. Part of Conectiv's RMP compliance philosophy has been the reduction of the use of hazardous substances covered under this regulation. When a hazardous substance is used, Conectiv considers the potential for this substance to adversely affect Conectiv workers, the public, and the environment and takes steps to prevent any such effects.\n\nConectiv works to prevent releases of the hazardous substances used at the facility.  When a hazardous substance is used at Conectiv, the equipment is designed, built, operated, and maintained to reduce the likelihood of an accidental release.  Industry and government standards are adhered to in the design, construction, operation, and maintenance of the equipment.\n\nConectiv limits damage from a release, if such a release were to occur.  Conectiv trains workers to react quickly in the event of an accidental release, reducing the consequences if a release were to occur.  In addition, Conectiv works with the local fire department and with the local emergency planning committee (LEPC) to help ensure that injuries and/or environmental damage will be minimized if a release does occur.\n\nThe safety program at Conectiv consists of a number of elements, only some of which are required by the RMP rule.

In order to support these operations, Conectiv handles regulated substances (anhydrous ammonia) in sufficient quantities to be covered by the RMP rule, as shown below.\n\n\nProcess                        Program                    Regulated        Maximum          Largest\n                                     Level                         Substance       On-site            Single\n                                                                                               Quantity           Vessel\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia       3                 Anhydrous Ammonia  112,000 lbs    56,000 lbs\n\nThe plant is designed in two identical power blocks.  Each block contains three combustion turbines, three heat recovery steam generators and one steam turbine generator.  Each block has its own anhydrous ammonia system to control NOx emissions from the combustion turbines."

      "SummaryText": "1.3 Offsite Consequence Analysis\n\nConectiv performed an analysis of the potential offsite consequence for an accidental release of a regulated substance that could have on the public or the environment. The RMP regulations require that such an analysis include an evaluation of both worst-case release scenarios and alternative release scenarios.  Conectiv does not expect a worst-case release scenario to ever occur. However in accordance with the RMP requirements, a worst case release analysis was conducted and the results are reported in this document. \n\nThe alternative release scenarios evaluated are intended to represent releases that might occur and were based on Conectiv's experience with ammonia systems. The alternative release scenarios were selected to help the local emergency planning committee (LEPC) improve community emergency response plans.  An alternative release scenario represents a release that (1) might occur at a facility like Conectiv's and (2) would result in the greatest potential offsite consequences if the release occurred.  While Conectiv believes that such releases are unlikely to occur at the Bethlehem facility, Conectiv has evaluated the offsite impact of the releases in accordance with the regulatory requirements.  Even though not required by regulation, Conectiv performed two alternate release scenarios.  \n\nConectiv has conducted the offsite consequence analysis for the worst-case release scenario using the EPA's guidance document and RMP*Comp that was developed to provide the highest estimate of the possible offsite consequences of such a release. The main objective of performing the offsite consequence analysis is to determine the distance at which certain effects might occur to the public because of an accidental release (called the endpoint distance).  The model was developed to provide information on the estimated distance to the toxic endpoint for a chemical of concern. Conectiv has not conducted a more detaile"

Typical information input to the model to characterize a chemical release is:\n\n* Physical State:  gas, liquid, aerosol, and multi-phased\n* Release Type:  continuous, instantaneous, point (stack releases), and area (releases from a pool)\n* Release Condition:  height, substrate type (concrete, soil), area and height of curbing, exit velocity, release diameter, and exit temperature\n* Chemical Properties:  molecular weight, specific gravity, vapor pressure, density, latent heat, and other properties depending upon the model\n\nIn addition to the physical parameters that characterize a release, meteorological data is needed by the model to characterize the ambient release conditions.  Meteorological data is used in dispersion models to calculate the distance that the pollutant plume moves downwind and the concentration of the pollutant at any given time or distance.  The meteorological variables that affect the dispersion of a chemical release are as follows:\n\n* Wind Speed and Direction: The wind speed is used to determine the plume dilution, plume transport, plume rise, evaporation rate, and magnitude of the concentration.  Wind direction defines the direction in which the plume travels.\n* Temperature:  Temperature is used to calculate plume rise and evaporation rates.\n* Atmospheric Pressure: is used to calculate gas and liquid release rates.\n* Atmospheric Stability: Stability is an indication of atmospheric turbulence.  The turbulence is depended upon thermal (heating of the ground) and mechanical (surface roughness and wind speed) effects.  Turbulence also acts to dilute the plume and reduce concent"

A team composed of personnel with engineering, process operating experience, maintenance, and a leader with process hazard analyses experience is assembled to analyze the hazards of the process.  Conectiv primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) technique, supplemented with checklists, to perform this analysis.  The PHA team prepares a written report describing the results of the analysis, including a list of recommendations.  Responsibility to resolve the recommendations is assigned to area personnel and, when appropriate, changes to enhance the safety of the process are implemented.\n\n\n3. Operating Procedures: Conectiv operators, process engineers and supervisors work together to develop and maintain operating procedures to define how tasks related to process operations should be safely performed.  The operating procedures (1) are used to train employees and (2) serve as reference guides for appropriate actions to take during both normal operations and emergency operations.\n\nConectiv personnel develop and maintain operating procedures that cover all phases of operations, including initial startup, normal operations, normal shutdown, emergency shutdown, startup following a turnaround or emergency shutdown, and temporary operations.  The operating procedures are used both to help in operating the covered processes and as a training guide for both new and experienced operators.  Operating procedures are updated at least annually to ensure they reflect current operating conditions.\n\n\n4.

Conectiv reviewed OSHA's fire prevention and protection requirements in 29 CFR 1910.252(a) and created a Hot Work Permit Form to comply with these requirements.  Personnel performing hot work are required to have an approved permit prior to beginning their work.  Training in the use of the Hot Work Permit Form is included in the Conectiv safe work practices orientation.\n\n12. Contractors:  Conectiv has established Contractor Safety and Health Guidelines to outline expectations related to contractor work at the Bethlehem Plant including work on the covered process.  The program reviews the safety record of all contractors to help ensure that Conectiv only hires contractors who can safely perform the desired job tasks.  Conectiv explains to the contract supervisors the hazards of the process on which they and their employees will work, Conectiv safe work practices, and Conectiv emergency response procedures.  Conectiv requires that the contractor supervisors also train each of their employees prior to beginning their work on a covered process.

The storage tank is engineered specifically for anhydrous ammonia service.  The piping is double-contained, wrapped with corrosion protection tape, cathodically protected, and the interstitial space is charge with nitrogen and monitored.   The process uses an advanced control system with emergency shutdowns to ensure safe operation.   Detectors and alarms located around the tank, injection skids, and Heat Recovery Steam Generators provide continuous monitoring for ammonia in the event of a release, providing early detection and helping to ensure quick response if an incident were to occur.\n\n\n1.5 Five-Year Accident History\n\nConectiv is required to complete a review of the covered process for incidents occurring in the five-year period prior to the submittal date for the regulation.
