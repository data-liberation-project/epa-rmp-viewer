(CDPI) are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is the basis of having a comprehensive accidental release prevention program in place that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with all processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls, both engineering and administrative, to prevent possible releases of not only regulated substances, but all potentially hazardous materials. If such a release were to occur, we are prepared to work closely with the local Emergency Response agencies such as the Fire Departments and LEPCs in providing trained emergency response personnel to control and mitigate the effects of the release.\nFacility Overview\nChemDesign Products, Inc (CDPI) is a custom manufacturer of a wide variety of fine organic chemicals with the end uses of our products many and varied.  It offers a broad range of manufacturing flexibility for its customers and produces materials for the paper, electronics, agricultural and other industries.  Sales are worldwide.\nBuilding 52 is designed to offer a wide range of manufacturing capability and be modified quickly to suit our customers needs.  This building serves as the major area of production of CDPI.\nBuilding 38/70 us a two-part building generally housing CDPI?s long term processes as well as thin film evaporator and product flaking operations.  The CDPI Risk Management Plan covers chemicals for this facility, methyl chloride is handled in this building.\nBuilding 69, is a facility for small volume campaigns and limited large volume work.

The chemist who staff the Process Development Labs research the safest and most efficient means of producing various chemical products.  The Quality Control Laboratory assures that products meet customer expectations.\nWorst Case Scenarios\nHydrogen Chloride\nIn ChemDesign Product's process using hydrogen chloride, the hydrogen chloride is used directly from the shipping container to avoid making multiple transfers. The shipping container is a Department of Transportation (DOT) approved tube trailer containing multiple tubes, each containing about 3,500 pounds of hydrogen chloride with a total maximum of 21,500 pounds.  In the worst case scenario, these tubes rupture under fire or catastrophic damage from such things as an aircraft crash, releasing all 21,500 pounds instantaneously (within 10 minutes) into the atmosphere under weather conditions stability class F.   Based on the EPA tables this would extend downwind of the release about 5.7 miles potentially affecting a portion of the population within a circle of about 26,000 persons.  The size and configuration of the Tube Trailer do not allow greater than 21,500 pounds in any one trailer.  CDPI's inventory control procedures limit the incoming trailers to arrive when there is less than ? tube of hydrogen chloride on site.  The full trailer is staged in a location where the same catastrophic event can not affect both trailers.\nThe full trailers for charging are staged in a protected area of the plant adjacent to the building where the material will be charged.  The staging area is barricaded to avoid inadvertent striking from material handling equipment.\nMethyl Chloride\nChemdesign  receives methyl chloride from bulk trucks, which are off loaded directly into our methyl chloride bulk tank system.  Inventory control requires that less than 20,000 pounds remain in inventory before a shipment is received.  The maximum loa"

      "SummaryText": "d on a bulk truck of methyl chloride is 40,000 pounds resulting in a maximum on-site inventory of 60,000 pounds.  The bulk tank is designed for pressure storage with extra thick walled construction and double weld seams.  Due to the evaporative nature of this material, no dike or containment walls exist at this tank.  The worst case scenario is the release of the entire contents of the full tank (60,000 pounds) over ten minutes.  \n\nIt would take a major catastrophic event such as an airplane crash on its approach to the local airport to cause that release.  The tank is located in a protected area of the plant adjacent to the building it feeds.\nThe material is charged from the bulk tank to a pressure rated \"day tank\" for each reaction.  The contents of the day tank are then metered into the reaction at a controlled rate.  This reduces the amount of material that could be potentially released in the event there were a problem with the feed rate or system to the reactor.  A rupture disk which discharges through a re-seating pressure release valve to a containment tank protects the \"day tank\".\nAlternative Case Scenarios\nHydrogen Chloride\nThe hydrogen chloride is charged to the reactor vessel through an overhead line from the tube trailer.  Only one tube is opened at a time and each tube is protected by an internal high flow shutoff a check valve.  The overhead line is further protected by a needle valve at the beginning of the line and it's own high flow cut off check valve.  The line has minimal flanges to reduce the possibility of flange gasket failure but these flanges have been determined to be the weakest link in the system.  In the event of a gasket failure and the flow was small enough not to trip the high flow protection device it has been determined up to 81 pounds may be released over three hours creating a potential radius of effect of 0.07 miles.  This extends off the plant boundaries into the Menominee River where fishing is a popular sport.  To reduce the "

The warning properties of hydrogen chloride are evident at very low levels and the persons fishing would have substantial time to leave the area before hazardous levels are present.    \n\nThe full trailers for charging are staged in a protected area of the plant adjacent to the building where the material will be charged.  The staging area is barricaded to avoid inadvertent striking from material handling equipment.  Water is readily available to provide a water curtain in the event a leak is discovered reducing the amount that may get off site.\n\nMethyl Chloride\nMethyl chloride is charged to the process through the use of a \"day tank\" or staging pressure vessel.  This vessel holds enough material for one reaction.  This reduces the amount of potential release in the event of an upset condition.  The \"day tank\" is protected by a rupture disk and then a re-seating pressure release valve.  The tank vents back to the bulk tank when filling. This tank offers the most possible alternative case scenario.  In the event the vent line were not completely open the day tank could overpressurize and rupture the burst disk.  The pressure release valve would in turn open, relieve the pressure and then re-seat in about 3 seconds releasing about 25 pounds.  The material would flow to the pressure containment tank and release the contents to the atmosphere through a controlled point.  This would have a potential range of effect of 0.06 mile radius potentially affecting the public recreation area of the Menominee River where fishing is a popular sport.\nAdministrative controls in the operating procedures are in place to minimize the potential for venting line plugging or reduction.\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program\nDue to the nature of constantly changing production capabilities of the custom chemical manufacturing busi"

Key to the process safety efforts, covering both OSHA and EPA requirements and more, is our formal five part program conducted on all processes before any are begun.  This program consists of:\n1. Hazard Assessment Profiles (HAP) consisting of a detailed review of all chemical hazards specific to the process, \n2. Development of Custom Chemical Checklists (CCC) which consists of a documented detailed review of the hazards compared with regulatory requirements, \n3. Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) usually consisting of a 'What If' method of analysis, as well as CDPI Chemical Operator Involvement/feedback.\n4.

We are active members of both states' (Counties) Local Emergency Planning Committees.  We also work closely with the two Fire Departments both for training as well as drilling purposes.  The City and County have detailed emergency notification systems and our internal Contingency Plan clearly outlines our means of communicating with these organizations.  We have both a detailed Contingency Plan detailing our response mechanisms for any type of situation and an Off-Site Plan filed with the State detailing our capabilities for off site assistance. The Marinette Fire Department is located less 2 miles from our site with a response time of less than five minutes.  CDPI is very proud of our working relationship with the local Emergency Responders and provides yearly tours and training opportunities for all local response agencies. \nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\nCDPI is constantly looking to discover new and better ways to enhance our safety programs.  We are currently engaged in an active one-on-one dialogue between all personnel and top management to determine how we can further increase the effectiveness of our safety and environmental programs.
