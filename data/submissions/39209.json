These procedures insure the proper operation of the chlorine system.  In addition, these procedures insure that the equipment is calibrated, inspected and properly maintained to insure the mechanical intergity of the Chlorine System .\n\nThe system is designed to prevent the release of Chlorine by including  layers of safety.  Chlorine is stored in a concrete building, remotely monitored by the 24-hour Operations Center.  The Chlorine storage building has automated valves that will close if a Chlorine leak is detected.  The Chlorine storage building has a scrubber incorporated into its design. The scrubber is designed to absorb and neutralize approximately 3000 lbs. of chlorine gas (1.5 full cylinders).  Distribution of the chlorine gas outside of the scrubber protected building is through buried vacuum pipelines designed to stop the flow of gas if a break occurred in any pipe.\n\nGeneral Accidential Release Prevention Program and Chemical-specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe Prevention Program includes the full range of preparation and chemical specific measures available to prevent and prepare for an incident.  All information concerning Chlorine and the detailed engineering design information has been consolidated and is available.  An independent engineering consultant has completed the process hazard analysis.  They have reported that, The facility was found to be well designed with many safety systems in place to prevent and/or mitigate potential chlorine releases.    \n\nThe Five-Year Accident History\n\nSince 1964, Calleguas has used chlorine gas as a disinfectant for the water treatment proces.; Calleguas has never had an accident having offsite consequences. Within the last ten years Calleguas has not had an accident involving chlorine gas at this facility.\n\nEmergency Response Program \n\nCalleguas has a very active Emergency Response Program.

This commitment is reflected in the design, operation, maintenance, and procedures used to operate the plant. Calleguas has used chlorine gas safely at this facility since 1964.  The focus of Calleguas policies are to operate and maintain the chlorine disinfection system of the Lake Bard Water Filtration Plant in such a way as to protect Calleguas employees, the surrounding communities and the environment from the effects of a Chlorine leak.  The policies direct that the highest priority is a commitment to establishing and insuring that multiple, redundant and parallel layers of equipment and procedures are in place to prevent or mitigate the consequences of a Chlorine gas release.  The equipment is engineered for safety, procedures are developed to insure the plant is operated safely, safety is incorporated into training, employees are provided personal protective equipment, and emergency response procedures are coordinated with the local responding agencies. \n\nThe Calleguas Facility and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nCalleguas Municipal Water District ownes and operates the Lake Bard Water Treatment Plant.  This is a Drinking Water Treatment Facility that disinfects and treats water to meet or exceed potable water standards.  It uses and stores only one regulated substance.  Chlorine gas is the single regulated substance requiring the development of the Risk Management Plan.  The maximum quantity stored on site is 40,000 lbs.  However, the maximum quantity normally stored on site seldom exceeds 30,000 lbs.  The chlorine gas is stored and used directly from Department of Transportation certified one (1) ton cylinders. \n\nCalleguas Staff, in conj"

      "SummaryText": "an active member of the Ventura County Community Awareness and Emergency Response (CAER) Group.  Through this organization Calleguas actively participates with the local Hazardous Materials Response Teams to prepare for emergencies at our facility and provide resources for emergency responses throughout Ventura County.  Together with the local emergency responders, we have had full-scale exercises at our facility to prepare and familiarize the planned responding units with our facility.  These exercises have resulted in the Emergency Response Groups having planned and prepared to respond to the Lake Bard Water Filtration Plant if an incident were to occur at the Calleguas Facility.  Our internal Emergency Response Team receives annual training from a Fire Department Captain assigned to the Ventura County Hazardous Materials Team stationed at the nearest Fire Department to this facility.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nIn our continuing effort to improve the safe operation of the Lake Bard Water Filtration Plant, we are in the process of rewriting the Operating Procedures Manual.  This rewite is a cooperative effort involving design engineers, and Calleguas Staff.  In addition to improvements in procedures, Calleguas will be implementing the use of a real time modeling system using current weather and remote sensors to detect and predict the toxic end point if a Chlorine gas release occurred."
