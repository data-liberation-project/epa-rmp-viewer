Introduction\n\nA Risk Management Program has been implemented at the Metropolitan Pier and Exposition Authority (MPEA) Energy Center, located at 2211 South Martin Luther King Jr. Drive in Chicago, Illinois, for the reduction of accidental releases of hazardous materials. This updated, five (5) year Risk Management Plan (RMP) summarizes the management, administrative, procedural, and technological controls that work together to minimize the risk to site personnel, contractors, visitors, and the community and environment at large of hazardous chemical releases. The RMP is organized to correspond with specific U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) RMP, Program 3 of 40 CFR 68, definitions and requirements of Subpart G, including: \n\n?

MPEA Policies To Protect Health, Environment, and Safety\n\nRisk management and safety are important concerns at the MPEA Energy Center; this RMP formalizes and documents these activities. The MPEA Energy Center is committed to conducting its operations in a safe and responsible manner and to reducing risks to human health and to the environment. It is the MPEA Energy Center's policy to comply with all applicable federal, state, and local rules and regulations.  This updated risk management plan is being submitted to comply with EPA 40 CFR 68 requirements to submit a risk management plan, every five (5) years.\n\n\n\nThis RMP has identified potential hazards and has taken steps to design and maintain a safe facility in order to prevent releases, and minimize the consequences of accidental releases, which could occur.

MPEA Energy Center has developed an Emergency Response Plan (ERP) that contains procedures designed to maximize the safety of all employees, contractors, and visitors in the event of an emergency and also guard against environmental consequences.\n\n\n\nIII.    Facility Identification\n\nThe MPEA Energy Center is located at 2211 South Martin Luther King Jr. Drive in Chicago, Illinois.  The facility provides steam/heating and chilled water/air conditioning for the Chicago Metropolitan Pier and Exposition Authority's McCormick Place exhibition and Convention Center and surrounding buildings. The NAICS code for the facility is 22133. \n\n\n\nThe facility uses ammonia for refrigeration, and is regulated under 40 CFR Part 68, the EPA RMP Rule. There is one recirculating closed-loop refrigeration system onsite. The system contains a charge of 29,000 pounds of ammonia, which is above the minimum threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds.\n\n\n\nAn aerial map identifying the site location is included as Appendix A. \n\n\n\nIV.    Hazard Assessment - Worse Case Scenarios (WCS)\n\nAppendix B consists of the RMP*Submit Printout and contains additional information on the worst-case scenario.  Appendix C consists of the offsite consequence analysis data and maps for the worse case release scenario. \n\n\n\nV.    Hazard Assessment - Alternative Release Scenarios (ARS)\n\nAppendix B consists of the RMP*Submit Printout and contains additional information on the alternative release scenario.  Appendix D consists of the offsite consequence analysis data and maps for the alternative release scenario. \n\n\n\nVI.    General Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nA prevention program is in place to minimize the risk of hazardous chemical releases in accordance with the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (29 CFR 1910.119) and the EPA Risk Management Program.

The next audit of the PSM program will occur by April 19, 2015, in compliance with the requirement to conduct PSM audits every three years.  The elements of the PSM / Program 3 prevention program and a brief description are listed below.\n\n?    Employee Participation - MPEA Energy Center has updated a site-specific employee participation plan that ensures employees and their representatives are consulted when conducting and developing process hazard analyses and other information required to be developed under the PSM/RMP regulation.  In addition, the employee participation program will ensure employees and their representatives have access to process hazard analyses and all other information required to be developed under PSM/RMP.  \n\n?    Process Safety Information - MPEA Energy Center maintains a site-specific PSI program that ensures information pertaining to the hazards, technology, and equipment of the process are properly developed and maintained. Process safety information for the ammonia process has been compiled and was last reviewed/ updated as of April 19, 2012.\n\n?    Process Hazard Review - MPEA Energy Center has updated a site-specific PHA program that ensures a PHA is conducted initially, at a minimum of every five (5) years, and whenever a change is significant enough to require a change in PSI.  In addition, this program ensures PHAs are conducted in accordance with OSHA and EPA regulations and ensures findings and recommendations of PHAs are properly documented. MPEA Energy Center conducted a thorough PHA study for anhydrous ammonia system during October 2009.\n\n?
