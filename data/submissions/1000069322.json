      "SummaryText": "The Humble Renewable Energy (HRE) facility is part of TX LFG Energy, LP (TX LFG). TX LFG is committed to being a responsible member of the communities in which it has operations.  TX LFG gives top priority to operating in a safe and environmentally sound manner. Corporate policy dictates that all facilities continuously identify methods to reduce overall site risks and the use of hazardous materials. Reducing site risks and hazardous materials mitigates the risk to the community and environment. \n\n\n\nThe commitment to safe and environmental sound operations is documented in the corporate safety manual, environmental compliance manuals, and the corporate mission statement; these documents are available to all employees. As a general practice for corporate-wide safety, in the case of an emergency, trained outside personnel will be contacted. \n\n\n\nHRE stresses safe and environmentally sound operations in employee training programs.  TX LFG holds mandatory monthly safety and environmental compliance meetings where important EHS topics are openly discussed with all staff.  All TX LFG and HRE employees have copies of EHS manuals and training.  All employees have access to EHS corporate compliance personnel 24 hours a day. There are regularly scheduled internal safety and environmental audits conducted by HRE and corporate compliance personnel.  Periodic safety and environmental audits of the stationary propane system are conducted by TX LFG corporate personnel. \n\n\n\nA general overview of HRE's purpose on this site is to remove harmful greenhouse gases from the environment by operating a large scale landfill gas to energy facility. To do this, propane is used to heat the process where the gas stream and catalyst interact to remove oxygen. This propane quantity qualifies HRE for both EPA's Risk Management Plan (RMP) and OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM).\n\n"
