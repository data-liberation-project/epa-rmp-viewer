The facility receives ethane, propane, and butane by pipeline; stores them in a underground rock caverns; and transports them from the facility by pipeline, with some of the propane sent out by tank truck.\n\nThe ethane cavern capacity is 3,200,000 gallons, the propane cavern capacity is 6,500,000 gallons, and the butane cavern capacity is 2,300,000 gallons.  The truck loading part of the facility has three 75,000 gallon (water capacity) propane \"bullet\" storage tanks and 2,100 gallons (13,000 pounds) of ethyl mercaptan storage capacity.  The ethyl mercaptan is an odorant that is injected into the propane during truck loading for safety requirements. \n\nProcess controls in place at the facility, to prevent or minimize an emergency release, include automatic and manual shutoffs, alarms, vents, relief and check valves, excess flow devices, and grounding equipment.  In addition, the facility has UV/IR fire detection \"eyes\" process area detectors.\n\nThe worst case scenario (WCS) for the facility is a release from the propane storage cavern due to aboveground piping failure that results in a vapor cloud explosion. The estimated amount of propane released in the WCS is 420,000 gallons (1,800,000 pounds).  Under EPA requirements, the WCS assumes weather conditions that allow the chemical to travel as far as possible, and further assumes that none of the facility's mechanical controls or safety systems are functioning.  Based on these assumptions, the WCS could potentially affect nearby public receptors.  The process controls mentioned in the previous paragraph minimize the potential for the worst case scenario to occur.\n\nThe facility complies with Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) regulations, including the process safety management (PSM) requirements.  Facility personnel undergo opera"

The response training and drills program includes notification of the State Emergency Planning Commission, the Local Emergency Planning Committee, and local fire department.  These three agencies also receive SARA Tier II Chemical Inventory reports annually.  In addition, the facility is inspected and audited on a compliance schedule.  A Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) is conducted at least every five years as part of the OSHA PSM requirements. \n\nThe facility had one reportable accidental release in the past five years.  The release of approximately 420 gallons of propane occurred in 1998.  There were no offsite or onsite injuries, deaths, property damage, or environmental damage.  However, 20 persons were evacuated as a safety precaution.  Emergency response organizations were notified and responded to each release."
