Morris, Illinois\n\n1) Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe facility is strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at the facility.  It is the facility?s policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  \n\n2) The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe facility?s primary activities encompass the production of Nitric Acid, Low Density Ammonium Nitrate, Ammonium Nitrate Solution, and Nitric Acid Blending.  We have three regulated substances present at the facility.  These substances include 98% Nitric Acid, Anhydrous Ammonia, and Nitric Oxide.  The quantity of Nitric Oxide stored onsite is below the regulatiory threshold, and therefore, it does not require risk management planning.  98% Nitric Acid (strong nitric acid) is used in the Acid Blend Operations to produce different grades and concentrations of acid.  Ammonia is used to produce ammonium nitrate.  \n\nThe maximum inventory of Ammonia is 1,142,756 pounds and the maximum inventory of 98% Nitric Acid is 227,200.\n\n3) The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe facilty has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set forth under 40 CFR part 68.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at the facility.  \n\na) Process Safety Information\n\nThe facility maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemicals hazards, operating parameters, and equipment designs associated with all processes.  \n\nb) Process Hazard Analysis\n\nThe facility conducts comp"

The methodology used to carry out these analyses is Checklist, What If/Checklist (combined), HAZOP, and Fault Tree.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed according to risk-based priority approach.  \n\nc) Operating Procedures\n\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, the facility maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address vafious modes of operation such as initial startup. Normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdowns, emergtency operations, normal shudown, and startup after a tunaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readiliy accessible to operators involved in the processes.  \n\nd) Training\n\nThe facility has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Refresher training is provided as required by applicable regulations or at least every three years.  \n\ne) Mechanical Integrity\n\nThe facility carries out a highly documented maintainance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others: pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, contols and pumps.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous trainig in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safety and timely manner.  \n\nf) Management of Change\n\nWritten procedures are in place to manage changes in process chemicals, tec"

Process operators, maintenance personnel, or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification.  \n\ng) Pre-Startup Safety Reviews (PSSR?s)\n\nPSSR?s related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.  \n\nh) Compliance Audits\n\nCompliance audits are conducted on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set forth under the RMP regulations are being implemented.  \n\ni) Incident Investigations\n\nIncidents are promptly investigated if they result in, or could reasonable result in, a release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent he release from recurring.  All investigation reports are retained for a minimum of five years.  \n\nj) Employee Participation\n\nThe facility truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.  Company employees are strongly encouraghed to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  In addition, employees have access to all information created as part of the the facility?s implementation of the RMP regulations, including information resulting from the process hazard analyses in particular.  \n\nk) Contractors\n\nOn occasion, the company hires contractors to conduct speacialized maintenance and construction activities.  Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of safety performance on the contractor is carried out.  There is a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related to the contractor?s work and the processes.  Contract"

Due to our stringent release prevention policies, no accidental RMP releases have occurred in the past five years.  \n\n5) Emergency Response Plan\n\nThe facility has a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials.  The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notifications of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decomtamination of affected areas. \n\nTo ensure proper functioning, emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced.  In addition, the plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within our processes that would require a modified emergency response.  \n\nThe Grundy County Emergency Management Agency provides oversight and guidance for the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) with which the emergency plan has been coordinated and verified.  \n\n6) Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nSeveral developments and findings have resulted from the implementation of the various elements of the accidental release prevention program.  The facility is continuously improving safety elements to meet and exceed standard industry practices and procedures."
