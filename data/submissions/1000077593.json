      "SummaryText": "Heber 1 Executive Summary\r\nThe Heber 1 Geothermal Power Plant has one process that is comprised of four Ormat Energy Converters (OECs).  The process contains in excess of 10,000 lbs of isopentane.  A 5-year update to the risk management plan was last filed in 2016.  At the time, there were three OECs.  In April, 2018 a new OEC was added to the process and one of the existing OECs was revamped.  This modification further increased the inventory of isopentane. This risk management plan is being revised because there was a change significant enough to require a revised PHA.\r\nTwo existing OEC units, OEC-11 and 13, are binary geothermal plants that extract heat from an adjacent geothermal brine flash plant, Heber 1.  Heber 1 flashes geothermal brine to produce steam to drive turbines and electrical generators.  OEC-11 and 13 extract heat from the hot residual liquid that remains after the brine is flashed.  The heat from the flash plant liquid is used to vaporize isopentane, which in turn drives associated turbines. The isopentane exiting the turbine is condensed, pumped and re-vaporized in a closed-loop cycle. The OEC-11 turbine drives an electrical generator, producing approximately 6.7 megawatts of power.  The OEC-13 turbine drives a brine reinjection pump\r\nThe other two OEC units, OEC-12 and 14, extract heat from brine that is pumped directly from geothermal wells.  Except for the heat source, the OEC process is the same as OEC-11 and 13. OEC-12 and 14 both drive generators.  Approximately 4 megawatts of power is generated from OEC-12 and 16 megawatts from OEC-14.\r\nOrmat operates the Heber 1 Geothermal Power Plant in accordance with all applicable federal, state, and local environmental and safety regulations and is committed to maintaining compliance with these regulations. The plant has emergency response procedures and protocols in place at the facility in coordination with local emergency response agencies.  The Imperial County Fire Department is the first respon"
