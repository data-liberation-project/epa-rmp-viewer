      "SummaryText": "Heber 1 Executive Summary\n\nThe Heber 1 Geothermal Power Plant has one process that is comprised of four Ormat Energy Converters (OECs).  The process contains in excess of 10,000 lbs of isopentane.  A 5-year update to the risk management plan was last filed in 2016.  At the time, there were three OECs.  In April, 2018 a new OEC was added to the process and one of the existing OECs was revamped.  This modification further increased the inventory of isopentane. This risk management plan is being revised because there was a change significant enough to require a revised PHA.\n\nTwo existing OEC units, OEC-11 and 13, are binary geothermal plants that extract heat from an adjacent geothermal brine flash plant, Heber 1.  Heber 1 flashes geothermal brine to produce steam to drive turbines and electrical generators.  OEC-11 and 13 extract heat from the hot residual liquid that remains after the brine is flashed.  The heat from the flash plant liquid is used to vaporize isopentane, which in turn drives associated turbines. The isopentane exiting the turbine is condensed, pumped and re-vaporized in a closed-loop cycle. The OEC-11 turbine drives an electrical generator, producing approximately 6.7 megawatts of power.  The OEC-13 turbine drives a brine reinjection pump\n\nThe other two OEC units, OEC-12 and 14, extract heat from brine that is pumped directly from geothermal wells.  Except for the heat source, the OEC process is the same as OEC-11 and 13. OEC-12 and 14 both drive generators.  Approximately 4 megawatts of power is generated from OEC-12 and 16 megawatts from OEC-14.\n\nOrmat operates the Heber 1 Geothermal Power Plant in accordance with all applicable federal, state, and local environmental and safety regulations and is committed to maintaining compliance with these regulations. The plant has emergency response procedures and protocols in place at the facility in coordination with local emergency response agencies.  The Imperial County Fire Department is the first respon"

      "SummaryText": "der.\n\nOffsite consequence analyses have been conducted for Heber 1.  A worst case release can potentially impact offsite public receptors in a local residence on an adjacent agricultural land.  The most stringent prevention program requirements are applied at Heber 1.\n\n\n\nOrmat has re-validated the prevention programs required by RMP, PSM and CalARP.  \n\nProcess Safety Information:  \n\n?    MSDS (in the new Safety Data Sheet format) is available for isopentane and the hazards are well understood.  \n\n?    Block flow and heat & mass balances are available for all OECs\n\n?    Maximum intended inventory is defined\n\n?    Safe upper and lower limits with consequences of deviation are defined for each OEC.\n\n?    Piping & Instrument Diagrams were re-validated as part of the PHA re-validation effort.\n\n?    Electrical Hazardous area classification is Class I, Division 2 within the process areas where isopentane is present.\n\n?    Relief system required design capacities and set pressures were determined.  \n\n?    Safety system descriptions are developed and confirmed current.\n\n?    Codes and standards related to foundations, pressure vessels, piping and electrical were defined and current at the time of the plant construction.  \n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA):  \n\n?    The PHA for the Heber 1 process was re-validated in 2016 to reflect current operation.  This re-validation included the addition of one new OEC (OEC-14).  Operation of each of the four OECs plus the two storage tanks received dedicated attention.\n\n?    Potential hazards were identified and the adequacy of hazard mitigation evaluated.\n\n?    Recommendations resulted from the PHA re-validation to improve hazard mitigation.  Implementation of those recommendations is being tracked.\n\n?    A seismic assessment has been re-conducted and recommendations will be implemented and tracked.\n\nStandard Operating Procedures:\n\n?    Standard Operating Procedures have been validated and deemed current.\n\nTraining Programs:\n\n?    Training programs have been restructured and generall"
