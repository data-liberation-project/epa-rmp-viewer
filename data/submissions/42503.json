      "SummaryText": "Heartland Grain Fuels, L.P. is a fuel ethanol plant operating in Huron, SD.  This facility will be able to process approximately 11.4 million bushels of grain per year and produce up to 30 million gallons of denatured ethanol per year (after a planned expansion in 2005). The facility produces dry and wet distiller?s grains and solubles as a saleable by-product.\n\nGrain is received by truck and dumped into an enclosed receiving pit. The grain is transported from the receiving pit to grain storage bins. The grain is then transported from the grain storage bins to a hammer mill. The hammer mill grinds the grain into flour which is blended with hot water and enzymes to produce a mash.  The mash is pumped to the fermentation process. In the fermentation process, yeast and enzymes are added to the mash to convert the starch to sugars, which are then converted to ethanol and carbon dioxide. The resulting liquid (beer) contains ethanol. After approximately 54 hours, the beer in the fermentation tank(s) is pumped to a beer well.    \n\nIn the distillation process, the beer from the beer well is pumped to the top of the stripper column and is heated. The ethanol vaporizes and is collected in the rectifier, producing approximately 186 proof ethanol (93% ethanol and 7% water). The 186 proof ethanol is superheated and sent to one of two molecular sieve beds where the remaining water is removed to produce 200 proof ethanol (100% ethanol). The 200 proof ethanol is condensed and pumped to outside storage tanks.\n\nThe whole stillage (beer without the ethanol) is centrifuged to produce thin stillage and a solid fraction. The thin stillage is sent to an evaporator where the water is evaporated to produce a syrup containing about 27 to 30 percent solids. The syrup is added with the solid fraction, which is referred to as wet distiller?s grain and solubles. Heartland will sell the wet distillers grain and solubles or transfer it to a dryer. The dryer will dry the wet distiller?s grain and s"

Denaturing is required to render the ethanol unfit for human consumption.  The gasoline used may either be unleaded gasoline or natural gasoline (sometimes referred to as well head gasoline or well head drip gas).  The facility has chosen natural gasoline, due to restrictions on specifications of impurities for fuel ethanol in some states.  Fuel ethanol can be combined with 15% gasoline to make E85 (85% ethanol) for use in Flexible Fuel Vehicles (FFV), or with 90% unleaded gasoline to make E10 (10% ethanol) for use in common automobiles.  Ethanol is added to gasoline as an oxygenation agent to aid in combustion and reduce pollution.  It replaces the current additive, methyl-tert-butyl-ether, which has been found to be a contaminate in ground water in many areas.\n\nThe process of making fuel ethanol at a plant this size does not subject it to the regulations of the Risk Management Plan (RMP).  However, natural gasoline contains carbon chains greater than 5 carbon atoms, making pentane (a hydrocarbon molecule with 5 carbon atoms) a component.  Pentane is listed as a regulated chemical subject to the RMP, and therefore making the storage of natural gasoline for denaturing an RMP covered process.\n\nFor Heartland Grain Fuels, L.P., this RMP is completed only on the natural gasoline storage tank, associated piping, pumps and metering controls.\n\nHeartland Grain Fuels, L.P. (HGFLP) has an active preventive maintenance program that incorporates the inspection of the natural gasoline (denaturant) storage tank and the associated piping and equipment.  In an effort to assure protection of the environment, the denaturant tank is situated in a bermed area to provide secondary containment for the denaturant tank contents in the event of an accidental uncontrolled release.

In the event of a large release of denaturant, the Plan calls for contacting a large local construction company with equipment to build additional dikes and containment, as necessary.\n\nIn addition to the physical protection of secondary containment, there is also a fusible link valve on the denaturant tank.  This valve closes in the event of a fire, preventing the tank to drain through a damaged header or ruptured pipe.  The facility also maintains a portable trailer with a fire-fighting foam eductor capable of connecting to a fire hydrant to foam flammable liquid fires.  This trailer has been made available for local fire department use in the event of a community emergency.\n \nHGFLP is instituting Process Safety Management (PSM) as a voluntary program (the facility size does not subject it to the OSHA regulations of PSM).  We believe this is another tool to enhance employee safety programs, protect the environment and continue safe operation of equipment.  As a rule, very few hazardous chemicals are stored on site in a quantity to cause significant problems in a release situation.  HGFLP actively trains employees on chemical use and handling procedures.  \n\nOnly one substance is present at this facility in sufficient quantities to be regulated under the Risk Management Planning regulations.  A single tank of natural gasoline, sometimes called drip gas, stores a maximum capacity of 19,800 gallons.  This tank measures 8 feet in diameter and is 52.5 feet long.  During the course of the year, approximately 635,500 thousand gallons are cycled through this tank, or the equivalent of filling the tank just over 32 times.  This tank contents are used to denature ethanol to render it unfit for human consumption.  \n\nHGFLP is subject to and complies with several federal and state regulations.  These regulations govern the storage and use of hazardous chemicals, purity of waste waters, air emissions and product tracking.  The Occupation"
