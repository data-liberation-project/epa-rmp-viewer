There are three inset clearwells as well as two off site elevated storage tanks.  The chemical feed system consists of two chemical feed pumps that inject liquid alum as a coagulant and polymer as a coaulant aid to the rapid mix.  There is also a chlorination feed system that injects chlorine at the influent line to the rapid mix and a lime feeder that feeds into it also.  Chlorine is injected again after the filters and prior to the clearwells.  The system is capable of treating potable water at a rate of 2.779 million gallons per day (MGD).  This plant serves approximately 8,049 people.  Approximately 12,000 pounds of chlorine are kept at the p"

Aprroximately 1.25 MGD of water is treated daily.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario:\n\nBoth of these scenarios are included as part of the RMP*Submit Program.  The ALOHA Model was used for the 1-ton worst case scenario.  The RMP-Method Model was used for the alternative release of chlorine gas.\n\nGeneral accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps:\n\nThe Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission (TNRCC) annually inspects this facility to insure that chlorination equipment and processes meet state requirements.  Entity will conduct a Safety Unit Inspection and a \"Compliance Audit\" on or before December 15, 2000 to insure that equipment and process conform to state/EPA requirements.  The Safey and Audit Inspections will be inclulded as part of the O & M Water Treatment Plant Manual.  The City will continue to train personnel to insure that accidental releases of chlorine gas are minimized or do not occur.\n\nFive-Year Accidental History:\n\nFor the last 5 years, there have been no accidents due to the release of chlorine gas from this facility.  There have been no accidental releases from this facility that have caused property damage or injury to the public.  The City will continue to train plant personnel to prevent any releases of chlorine gas.\n\nEmergency Response Program:\n\nThe Emergency Response Program for this facility is referenced in the City of Raymondville's Emergency Evacuation Plan as previously noted.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:\n\nAt the present time, five (5) permanent operators are employed at the plant.  All five operators are certified (3-B and 2-C).  All certified operators are required to attend Texas A & M Training Classes to maintain their certification.  All water training courses contain at least one section that emphasizes chlorine safety.  All certified employees will continue to attend these training classes to upgrade or maintain "
