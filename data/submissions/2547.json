(GPRI), a wholly owned subsidiary of Georgia-Pacific Corporation, owns and operates a formaldehyde manufacturing facility in Healing Springs, NC.  The facility is located on NC Highway 8.  The facility consists of a plant that manufactures formaldehyde, which was constructed in 1971. Overall, the facility employs 12 full-time employees.\n\nGPRI is committed to operating the Healing Springs, North Carolina plant in a manner that is safe for its workers, the public, and the environment.  As part of this commitment, GPRI  has established a system to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility.  One component of this system is a risk management program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at the Healing Springs Plant and that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agencys (EPA's) regulation 40 CFR part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule).  One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit a risk management plan (RMP Plan) describing the risk management program at the Healing Springs Plant. This document is intended to satisfy the RMP Plan requirement of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program at the Healing Springs Plant.\n\nThe risk management program at the Healing Springs Plant consists of the following three elements:\n\n7 a hazard assessment to help understand (a) the potential offsite consequences of hypothetical accidental releases and (b) accidents that have occurred during the last five years associated with the use of substances regulated by the RMP rule (regulated substances).\n \n7 a prevention program to help maintain and safely operate the processes containing more than a threshold quantity of a regulated substance (covered processes).\n \n7 an emergency response program to help respond to accidental releases of regulated substances from covered proc"

In fact, the Healing Springs Plant has a comprehensive safety program in place establishing many levels of safeguards against release of a hazardous substance and injuries and damage from a release of a hazardous substance.\n\nGPRI limits the use of hazardous substances.  Before using a hazardous substance at the Healing Springs Plant, less hazardous alternatives are considered. When a hazardous substance is used at the Healing Springs Plant, GPRI considers the potential for this substance to adversely affect plant workers, the public, and the environment and takes steps to prevent any such effects.\n\nGPRI prevents releases of the hazardous substances used at the facility.  When a hazardous substance is used at the Healing Springs Plant, the equipment is carefully designed, built and operated to reduce the likelihood of an accidental release. Industry and government standards are closely adhered to in the design, construction, and operation of the equipment. \n\nGPRI limits damage from a release, if such a release occurs.  GPRI trains its workers to respond to an accidental release, reducing the consequences of a release if it occurs.  In addition, GPRI works with the Healing Springs fire department and with the local emergency planning committee (LEPC) to help prevent injuries and/or environmental damage if a release does occur.\n\nThe safety program at the Healing Springs Plant consists of a number of elements, only some of which are required by the RMP rule. This RMP Plan is primarily intended to describe those parts of the safety program at the Healing Springs Plant that are required by the RMP rule.\n\n1.1 Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Po"

      "SummaryText": "licies\n\nGPRI is committed to the safety of workers and the public, and the preservation of the environment, through the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances.  GPRI implements reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous substances.  These controls include training programs for personnel, programs to help ensure safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of processes at the Healing Springs Plant; and programs to evaluate the hazards at the plant.\n\nIn the event of an accidental release, the Healing Springs Plant controls and contains the release in a manner that will be safe for workers and will prevent injury to the public and the environment.  GPRI provides response training to its personnel, designates an emergency response coordinator to oversee response activities, and coordinates response efforts with the local fire department.  Response activities have also been discussed with the LEPC.  \n\nIn order to effectively implement these policies, GPRI established a management system headed by the Plant Manager to oversee safety-related activities.\n\n1.2 Regulated Substances\n\nThe Healing Springs Plant handles formaldehyde solution in sufficient quantity to be covered by the RMP rule, as shown in the following list of RMP-covered Program Level 3 processes at the plant.\n\n Regulated Substance    Process    Process Quantity*, lbs    RMP Threshold, lbs*\nFormaldehyde Solution (50%)    Storage in Unpressurized Tanks    493,400      15,000\n\n* Process and threshold quantity is the quantity of pure chemical, not of the solution\n\n1.3 Offsite Consequence Analysis\n\nThe Healing Springs Plant performed an offsite consequence analysis to estimate the potential for an accidental release of a regulated substance to affect the public or the environment.  The offsite consequence analysis evaluates a worst case release scenario and an alternative release scenario.  GPRI does not expect a worst case release scenario to ever occur.  The alternat"

An alternative release scenario represents a release that (1) might occur at a facility like the Healing Springs Plant and (2) would result in the greatest potential offsite consequence if the release occurred.\n\nThe main objective of performing the offsite consequence analysis is to determine the distance at which certain effects might occur to the public because of an accidental release (called the endpoint distance).  The following effects could occur at the endpoint distance.  At distances less than the endpoint distance, the effects would be greater; at distances greater than the endpoint distance, the effects would be less.\n\nWhen considering the release of a toxic substance, most people at the endpoint distance would be able to walk away from the exposure without any long term health consequences, although some short term consequences (e.g., strong eye or throat irritation) are possible.  Some people who are particularly susceptible to the substance released could be incapacitated.\n\nThe RMP rule includes specific requirements for the worst-case and alternative release scenarios that must be reported by GPRI.  These requirements are:\n\n7 one worst case release scenario for the class of toxic substances in Program 3 processes\n \n7 one alternative release scenario for each of the toxic substances in a Program 3 process\n \n7 one worst case and one alternative release scenario for the class of flammable substances in Program 3 processes\n\nThe following information summarizes the offsite consequence analysis performed by the Healing Springs Plant:\n\n1.3.1 Program 3 Processes-Toxic Substances - Formaldehyde Solutions\n\nThe worst case release scenario for a 50% solution of formaldehyde is the release of the entire contents of the largest storage tank, a 102,800 gallon (493,400 lbs of pure formaldehyde) tank.  A concrete/earthen diked area contains the released formaldehyde so"

A survey indicates that 201 people live within this distance from the location of the storage tank; and a convenience store/gasoline is also located within this distance. No environmental receptors are located within this distance.\n\nThe alternative case release scenario for a 50% solution of formaldehyde is the overfilling of a formaldehyde storage tank and the spillage of 100 gallons (480 lbs of pure formaldehyde) of solution into the concrete diked area.  Modeling this scenario indicates a toxic endpoint distance of 0.1 mile.  A survey indicates that no people live within this distance from the storage tank.   No environmental receptors are located within this distance.\n\n1.3.2 Program 3 Processes-Flammable Substances\n\nThere are no regulated flammable substances in quantities above the threshold quantities at the plant.  Propane is stored on-site in a 500 gallon (4,165 pound) storage tank, however, this quantity is less than the threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds.\n\n1.4 Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nSince 1972, the Healing Springs Plant has used a prevention program to help prevent accidental releases of hazardous substances.  Beginning in 1989, the plant formalized this prevention program for the formaldehyde manufacturing and storage process to comply with the 14 elements of the OSHA process safety management (PSM) prevention program. In 1996, the EPA RMP rule established two levels of prevention requirements:\n\nProgram 3essentially the same as OSHA PSM, except that the program also focuses on protecting the public and the environment\n\nProgram 2requires simplified versions of 7 of the 12 elements of the Program 3 prevention program (not applicable for Healing Springs Plant)\n\nThe following sections briefly describe the elements of the Healing Springs Plants Program 3 preventio"
