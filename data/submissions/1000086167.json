This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, our highly trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release. We are also completely coordinated with the local Fire Department which provides additional emergency response expertise. Univar carries a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials. The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas. To ensure proper functioning, our emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced. In addition, the plan is properly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within our processes that would require a modified emergency response.\n\nName:             ___Christina Harris______________________________________________\n\nSignature:       __________________________________________________\n\nTitle:                __Sr. Manager Environmental Compliance & Integration______________\n\nDate Signed:   _____6/4/2023______________________________________"
