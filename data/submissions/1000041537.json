For this reason, the Western Virginia Water Authority has developed this Risk Management Plan in order to respond to emergencies as rapidly and safely as possible.\n\n\n\nIn recognition that the elements of response for all hazards are similar, and whereas there are almost limitless contingencies, which could be encountered, this plan has been designed to be applicable to any emergency involving the release of regulated substances, which Authority personnel may encounter.  However, the plan contains certain hazard specific information in cases where the hazard requires a response that is unique and not covered by other elements of the plan.\n\n\n\nAlso, this is more than just a response plan.  It is based on the concept that one must do more than simply respond to emergencies, that the only way to effectively manage emergencies is to plan to prevent, prepare for, response to, and recover from emergencies.  This concept is known as Comprehensive Emergency Management and is incorporated in this plan.\n\n\n\nAll members of the Western Virginia Water Authority are to abide by the provisions of this plan and are to participate in plan development and administration.  Only through concentrated and timely effort can the full benefits of this plan be attained.\n\n\n\nThis plan has been developed to comply with the spirit and letter of all applicable federal and state laws pertaining to emergency situations.\n\n\n\nCertain assumptions have been made in the formulation of this plan, namely:\n\n\n\nThat the County of Roanoke Fire Department, Police Department, and Emergency Services will be available to respond to an emergency occurrence and provide emergency technical support.\n\n\n\nThat Spring Hollow Water Treatment Facility employees will recognize"

      "SummaryText": " and carry out their responsibilities in an emergency.\n\n\n\nThat the local fire and police and other local authorities will assume their responsibilities for off-site emergency response.\n\n\n\nThese assumptions are made after extensive planning and contact with these entities regarding the implementation of this plan.\n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n\n\nThe stationary source for this Risk Management Plan is the Spring Hollow Water Treatment Facility, which has a rated treatment capacity of 18 MGD.\n\n\n\nChlorine gas is utilized for disinfection of filtered water before it is delivered to Western Virginia Water Authority water customers.\n\n\n\nChlorine gas is introduced to the filtered water by means of a vacuum regulated gas feed system.  Chlorine gas for the process is stored in ton cylinders.  The maximum number of ton cylinders stored at any given time is four (8,000 pounds of chlorine gas).  \n\n\n\nWORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\n\n\nScenario includes failure of single ton cylinder containing 8,000 pounds of chlorine with a release rate of 440 lbs/min to the outside air for a period of 18 minutes.\n\n\n\nDistance to endpoint is 2.3 miles based on the rural character of the area, 1.5 meter per second wind speed and Category F stability.  \n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe Spring Hollow Water Treatment Facility is in compliance with the OSHA PSM rule and the Risk Management Program (40 CFR Part 68) rule.\n\n\n\nOne of the keys to the success of the Spring Hollow WTF risk prevention program is the utilization of the following emergency exercises and drills:\n\n\n\nTabletop exercises involve presenting key personnel a simulated emergency situation in an informal setting to elicit constructive discussion as the participants examine and resolve problems based upon the plan."
