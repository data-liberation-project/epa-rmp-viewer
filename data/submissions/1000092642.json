The procedures address or reference all aspects of emergency response, including proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post incident cleanup and decontamination requirements.  \r\n\r\nIn addition, the plant has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response.  Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties, and participate in plant monthly emergency drills to ensure system integrity and reinforce proper employee response. \r\n\r\nThe emergency response plan is updated when necessary based on modifications made to gas plant process or other DCP Midstream Energy facilities.  The emergency response program changes are administered through the MOC process, which includes informing and/or training affected personnel in the changes.\r\n\r\nThe overall emergency response plan for the Roggen Gas Plant is coordinated with the Weld County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) which is responsible for preparing the community's emergency response plan.  The local responder for plant emergencies is the Roggen Fire Department.  The Roggen Gas Plant has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., fire department).

Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human errors.\r\n\r\nSpecialized Safety Features\r\n\r\nThe Roggen Gas Plant has safety features on many units to help (1) contain/control a release, (2) quickly detect a release, and (3) reduce the consequences of (mitigate) a release.  The following types of safety features are used in the covered processes: \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRelease Detection\r\n\r\nDaily operator inspection.\r\n\r\nGas detectors and fire eyes.\r\n\r\nRelease Containment/Control\r\n\r\nProcess relief valves that prevent vessel over pressurization.\r\n\r\nValves to permit isolation of the process (manual or automated).\r\n\r\nAutomated shutdown systems for specific process parameters (e.g., high temperature).\r\n\r\nCurbing or diking to contain liquid releases.\r\n\r\nRedundant equipment and instrumentation (e.g., uninterruptible power supply for process control system).\r\n\r\nRelease Mitigation\r\n\r\nFire suppression and extinguishing systems.\r\n\r\nTrained emergency response personnel (HAZWOPER, fire response).\r\n\r\nPersonal protective equipment (e.g., hard hat, safety glasses, protective clothing, etc.).\r\n\r\n\r\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nWe investigate every incident very carefully to determine ways to prevent similar incidents from recurring.  The Roggen Plant has an excellent record of accident prevention over the past 5 years. There has been only one accidental releases in the past five years.  The incident involved a release natural gas during a plant startup that resulted in a vapor cloud fire and injury to one employee.

The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings.  Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years so that the reports can be reviewed during future PHAs and PHA revalidations.\r\n\r\nCompliance Audits\r\n\r\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, the RoggenGas Plant is periodically audited by DCP MIDSTREAM Corporate. DCP MIDSTREAM conducts an audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented.  Compliance audits are scheduled at least every 3 years.  Audit findings are forwarded to local and regional management for resolution.  The local and regional management are in charge of the corrective actions taken in response to the audit and also to track them until they are complete.

      "SummaryText": "s, the Roggen Gas Plant has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process. New employees receive basic training in gas plant operation and are paired with senior operators to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years.  All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\r\n\r\nContractors\r\n\r\nThe Roggen Gas Plant uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the gas plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform gas plant personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.  This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work.
