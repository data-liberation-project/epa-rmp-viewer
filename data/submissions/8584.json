The facility Policy:\n                                  The management and employees of The Pulaski Chase Cooperative are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of annhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire company, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n\n\n2.  Facility Information:\n                                  * The primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers.               \n                                   *Annhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for both direct application and for blending into mixed-grade fertilizers for crop production nutrients.\n\n                                   *The maximum quantity stored would be 120,000 pounds in a large Ammonia vessel with the remainder being located in the nurse tanks.  the nurse tanks have a 1000 gallon capacity and are filled to a maximum of 85%.    \n\n\n\n3.  The worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario:\n                                    The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of the large vessel (120,000).  The release rate would be 23,182 lbs/minute.  The release duration would last 5 minutes at wind speed of 1.5 m/sec.  The distance to the endpoint  is 3.8 miles, which could affect 4,000 people.\n                                      The alternative release scenario based on the five-year accident history is a release from a pipe leak.  Then the release rate would be 50 pounds/minute, with a duration rate of 4 minutes, with wind speed of 3.0 m/sec.., with a distance endpoint of .25 miles.\n\n\n4.  The"
