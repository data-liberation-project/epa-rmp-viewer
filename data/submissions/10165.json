Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies:\n \n At this distribution facility, we handle propane which is considered a regulated flammable substance by EPA. The same properties that make propane valuable as a fuel also make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling propane to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to our own personal health as well as our co-workers, and to reduce the threat to our near by community. It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and state rules and regulations. Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle propane combined with the safety devices inherent in the design of this facility combined with the safe handling procedures that we use and the training of our personnel\n \n Our emergency response program is based upon the NPGA's \"LP-Gas Safety Handbook\", \"Guidelines for Developing Plant Emergency Procedures\", and How to Control LP-Gas Leaks and Fires.\" The emergency action plan includes procedures for notification of the local fire department and notification of any potentially affected neighbors.\n \n2. The primary purpose of this Crestland Cooperative facility is to repackage and distribute propane to our customers. Propane is used by our customers as a fuel. Propane is received by transport truck and stored in one 30,000 gallon storage tank. Propane is distributed to customers by delivery trucks (bobtails). This facility has equipment to unload transports, fill bobtails, and fill portable propane tanks. The access to this storage tank is restricted to authorized facility employees and authorized contractors by the means of a locked chain link fence around the storage tank.\n \n The regulated substance handled at this distribution facility is propane\n \n The maximum amount of propane that can be safely stored at this facility is 64,260 pounds.\n \n3. The worst-case release"

      "SummaryText": " scenario and the alternative release scenario, including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario.\n \n Worst-Case Scenario - Failure of the 18,000 gallon storage tank filled to a maximum of 85% fill capacity would allow a release of 64,260 pounds of propane. Company policy and generally accepted safe handling and storage of propane limits the maximum filling capacity of this tank to 85% capacity. It is assumed that the entire contents are released as vapor which finds and ignition source. The distance to the endpoint of 1 psi overpressure for the worst-case scenario is     .3 miles. This distance extends beyond the facility boundary, encompasses several residences and other businesses.\n \n Alternative Scenario - A pull away causing failure of a 25 foot length of 4 inch transfer hose. The excess flow valves function to stop the flow. The contents of the hose is released. The vapor extends and upon finding an ignition source, it explodes. The shock wave from the explosion creates over pressure. The 1 psi overpressure is projected to extend 175 feet. This distance extends beyond the boundaries of this facility and encompasses an adjacent state highway, railroad right of way, residential areas and local businesses. \n \n4. The general accidental release prevention program and the specific prevention steps of this facility comply with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations. This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-58. All of our drivers have been thoroughly trained in handling and transferring propane.\n \n5. Five-year accident history -No Data to Report\n \n6. The emergency response program for this facility is in place.\n \n7. Planned changes to improve safety - This facility has been repaired to specs of NFPA-58, 1995 edition."
