The scales are calibrated every six minoths to make sure they are correct. If any deviation is noticed before six months have passed, the scales are immediately recalibrated.  The calibration schedule is mentioned in our document LAB 015 (Schedule for the Calibration of Laboratory Equipment and Plant Scales).\n\n2.  Training is an ongoing requirement of plant employees.  Regarding RMP Training, it is required of any employee assigned to a new task involving RMP chemicals. Refresher training is required every three years. See our document EPA 004 (Risk Management Plan for Hazardous Substances, Page 13 of 74, Section 6.54 (Training)).\n\n3.  Regarding documentaiton of storage inspections, o0ur document OPD 002 (Supervisors Daily Plant Inspection Procedures) gives the daily inspection procedure and an inspection form to document the inspections.
