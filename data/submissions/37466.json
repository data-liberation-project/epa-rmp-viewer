      "SummaryText": "Bongards' Creameries management is commited to a safe work environment for it's employees and the community.  Bongards Creameries manufactures cheese.  Bongards' facility includes a process plant, a cheese plant and a non-operational drying plant.  The Bongards facility has a Risk Management Program (RMP) which complies with the requirements of Title 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) part 68.  The facility is also complying with OSHA's Process Safety Management Standard (PSM), Title 29 CFR 1910.119.  The Bongards' PSM/RM Program, along with other company safety and training programs, deal with the risks involved in the storage, hadling, and processes utilizing hazardous chemicals.  In this way Bongards, promotes overall pant, worker, and public safety.  These programs enable our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of toxic substances as well as fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents.  Overall, these programs prevent accidental fatalities, injuris and illnesses, and avoid physical property and environmental damage.                                                                                                                                                                              The Bongards' facility safety programs are applied to any activity involving hazardous chemicals including any use, storage, handling, or the on-site movement of such chemicals, or combination of these activities.  Any group of vessels which are interconnected and separatevessels which are located such that a hazardous chemical could be involved in a potential release is considered a single process.

They are also communicated to and accepted by all employees at the facility.                                                                                          The process covered by the Bongards' PSM/RM Program is the ammonia refrigeration system.   Anhydrous ammonia is utilized in the refrigeration system serving the cheese plant and process plant.  The refrigeration system provides cooling for food processing, packaging and storage operatons at the facility.  The refrigeration process involves a typical vapor compression refrigeration cycle with compressors, condensers, chillers and evaporators.  The system is closed and is designed to completely contain the ammonia refrigerant within vessels, equipment and piping specifically constructed for ammonia refrigeration.  Liquid ammonia is circulated from the vessels to the evaporators and chillers which cool the process and the refrigerated spaces by boiling off some of the liquid to vapor.  The ammonia then returns to the vessels where liquid is separated from vapor.  The vapor enters the compressors and is discharged at higher pressure to the condensers.  The vapor is cooled and condenses to liquid in the condenser and then drained to the vessels to repeat the refrigeration cycle.                                                                                                                                                                                  In addition to the implementation of safety programs in compliance with the OSHA PSM standard and the EPA RMP regulations the Bongards' refrigeration system has been constucted in accordance with applicable codes and standards.

The Bongards' facility's emergency response program is based on the OSHA requirements for Emergency Action Plans (29 CFR 1910.38 and 1910.119).  We have trained employees in the Bongards' Emergency Action Plan and maintain a written Emergency Action Plan.  This plan is coordinated with the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and the local fire department.  We conduct regular drills for implementation of the emergency action plan at the facility.  The Bongard's facility has a management system in place which has been developed to assure that the PSM/RM Program is implemented, documented and updated to assure its effectiveness.  The 1999 RMP Submit listed processes: Refrigeration System 1, Nitric Acid Storage (80% Conc.), and Propane Storage.  Refrigeration System 1 was eliminated, Nitric Acid Storage is not at or above 80% concentration, and Propane Storage is for fork truck use only.  Refrigeration System 1, Nitric Acid Storage, and Propane Storage do not meet RMP requirements and thus are not listed in the RMP Re-submit."
