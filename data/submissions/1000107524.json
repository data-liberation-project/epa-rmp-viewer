      "SummaryText": "Hydrite Chemical Co. operates as a distributor and manufacturer of inorganic chemicals used in a variety of industries from food processing to waste water treatment.  The facility maintains anhydrous ammonia and aqua ammonia (>20% concentration) on site in quantities above threshold valves. We at Hydrite Chemical are strongly committed to employee and public safety and environmental responsibility.  It is our policy to control our processes to prevent the accidental release of harmful or noxious materials that could endanger or irritate our employees, plant visitors, or neighbors.  This commitment is integrated into our design standards, equipment installation and maintenance practices, operating procedures and training programs.\r\n\r\nHydrite Chemical has developed and trained written emergency response procedures in the event of an accidental release from any of our processes.  These written plans have been provided to the local emergency response agencies including local emergency response personnel, hospitals, state and federal agencies.\r\n\r\nRegulated materials are received from various suppliers and stored in containers including drums, tote tanks, tank trucks, bulk storage tanks and compressed gas cylinders.  These containers meet DOT specifications.  All storage and ancillary equipment is designed to comply with National Standards including the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME), the Fertilizer Institute, National Fire Protection Association (NFPA), Chlorine Institute, and OSHA.\r\n\r\nHydrite Chemical has multiple release prevention programs integrated into all phases of operation from design through maintenance.  Each chemical is reviewed for physical hazards, health hazards, environmental hazards and process hazards.  All processes that are subject to the OSHA PSM or EPA RMP program  undergo a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA).  Written operating procedures have been developed and are reviewed on a regular basis.

      "SummaryText": "veloped and are implemented ensuring the employees understand the hazards of the chemical, know how to operate the equipment, know how to shut down the process and how to respond to a release.  Pre-start up safety reviews are performed prior to operation of new equipment or receipt of new chemicals.  Equipment maintenance procedures have been developed and implemented, including routine inspections and scheduled maintenance.  Hydrite Chemical believes that every incident has the potential for serious impact and conducts Incident Investigations to determine root cause and corrective action for all releases.\r\n\r\nA review of the previous five year accident history indicates a release as described in Section 6 that did not have any offsite impacts.\r\n\r\nHydrite Chemical has developed and maintains an Emergency Response Plan (Contingency Plan).   This Plan is integrated into the Local Emergency Planning Committees' (LEPC's) county wide plan.  The Plan is reviewed and updated as required.  Emergency Responders receive formal training on the Plan annually.  The Plan includes:\r\n\r\n\u00b7 Actions facility personnel must take in the event of fire, explosion or  release\r\n\r\n\u00b7 Arrangements with the local and state governments in the event of an accident\r\n\r\n\u00b7 Names, addresses and telephone numbers of all emergency responders\r\n\r\n\u00b7 Necessary emergency equipment and how it is to be implemented\r\n\r\n\u00b7 Resources available at the plant for use in responding such as\r\n     chemical resistant suits, \r\n     self-contained breathing apparatus, \r\n     two way radios for communication, \r\n     gas monitors, and \r\n     repair kits for leaking cylinders and tanks.  \r\n\r\nHydrite Chemical is strongly committed to employee and public safety and environmental responsibility and continually works to improve processes or procedures that advance our goal of zero releases."
