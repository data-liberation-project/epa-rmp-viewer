      "SummaryText": "1.  The Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies at Our Facility\nWe, at the City of Abbeville, are strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, training, and audits associated with the chlorination and de-chlorination systems at the wastewater treatment plant.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent accidental releases of regulated substances.  The City of Abbeville is coordinated with the Abbeville Fire Department, which will provide highly trained emergency response personnel to respond to a release of chlorine or sulfur dioxide, and is currently included in the Abbeville County community emergency response plan.\n\n2.  Our Facility and the Regulated Substances Handled\nChlorine and sulfur dioxide are the regulated substances present at our wastewater treatment plant.  Chlorine and sulfur dioxide are used for disinfection and de-chlorination, respectively, in the treatment of wastewater.  Chlorine and sulfur dioxide are stored as liquefied gases under pressure.  The vapor pressure of stored chlorine is 6.8 atmospheres (99.89 pounds per square inch [psi]).  The vapor pressure of stored sulfur dioxide is 3.2 atmospheres (47.01 psi).  Chlorine gas is non-flammable, but it is a strong oxidizer that can support combustion of other materials.  Chlorine is a toxic gas that is considered by the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) to be immediately dangerous to life and health at concentrations exceeding 10 parts per million (ppm).  Sulfur dioxide is a toxic gas that is considered by NIOSH to be immediately dangerous to life and health at concentrations exceeding 100 ppm.\n\nThe maximum inventory of chlorine and sulfur dioxide at our plant is 6,000 pounds (lbs) or three one-ton containers of each chemical.

The chlorination and de-chlorination systems are vacuum feed systems with safety features such as automatic shutoff at the container during loss of vacuum, gas detectors, and alarm.\n\n3.  The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nThe chlorination and de-chlorination systems must meet Program 3 prevention program requirements, as the covered process is subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard under the South Carolina OSHA program.  The following sections briefly review and update the elements of the Program 3 prevention program.  In the past five years, our wastewater treatment plant has taken all the necessary steps to address the requirements of each element of the program.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nOur operating staff at the wastewater treatment plant ensures the process safety information that describes the chemical properties and hazards, operating parameters, and process equipment associated with the chlorination and de-chlorination systems is accurate and complete.  Process safety information was last reviewed on January 13, 2004 and there have been no major changes to the chlorination or and de-chlorination systems in the last five years.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur utility district uses personnel familiar with the plant?s chlorination and de-chlorination systems and the PHA technique to review the hazards of the process and to review the adequacy of the safeguards in place.  The recommendations, resolutions, and corrective actions resulting from the PHA are addressed in a timely manner.  The last PHA was conducted on January 13, 2004.  No changes were recommended from the PHA.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, written operating procedures are in place, regularly reviewed, updated to reflect changes, and accessi"

The most recent review/revision of the operating procedures for the chlorination and de-chlorination systems was conducted on January 13, 2004.\n\nTraining\nA comprehensive training program is in place to ensure that the operating staff is competent to operate the plant?s chlorination and de-chlorination systems.  Refresher training is provided at least yearly and more frequently as needed.  The training program was last reviewed/ revised on January 13, 2004.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nPreventative maintenance, inspection, and testing of the chlorination and de-chlorination equipment are critical to the mechanical integrity of the systems and their safe operation.  Written inspection/preventative maintenance procedures for the chlorination and de-chlorination equipment are used at the plant.  The preventative maintenance procedures/ schedule were reviewed/ revised on January 13, 2004.  The most recent equipment inspection/ testing were also conducted on January 13, 2004.\n\nIncident Investigation\nThe City of Abbeville has in place an incident investigation procedure that calls for the investigation of each incident which results in, or could reasonably have resulted in, a catastrophic release of chlorine or sulfur dioxide from its plant.  An investigation is initiated as promptly as possible by an incident investigation team, but not later than 48 hours following the incident.  Incident investigations have not been required in the last five years.\n\nCompliance Audits\nThe City of Abbeville has selected personnel to conduct audits of the risk management program, to determine whether the elements of the program are being implemented.  These audits are carried out at least every three years and any recommended corrective actions are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.  The most recent self-audit was conducted on January 13, 2004.  No changes were recommended by the audit team.\n\nManagement of Change\nWritten procedures are in place at the wastewater "

Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a change to the chlorination and de-chlorination systems are promptly informed of the change and offered training on the change before startup.  In the last five years, there have not been changes to the chlorination and de-chlorination systems that would have triggered the management of change procedure.  The last review/revision of the management of change procedure was January 13, 2004.\n\nPre-startup Reviews\nPre-startup safety reviews are required for major changes to the chlorination and de-chlorination systems.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction and equipment meet design specifications and operations and maintenance procedures are in place for the safe startup and operation of the systems.  The most recent review/revision of the pre-start-up procedure for the chlorination and de-chlorination systems was on May 5, 1999.\n\nContractors\nOn occasion, the City of Abbeville hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities with the or near the area of the chlorination and de-chlorination systems.  The City of Abbeville has a procedure in place to inform contractors of known potential hazards related the contractor?s work and the covered processes.  The most recent review/revision to the contractor safety procedures was conducted on September 15, 2003.\n\nEmployee Participation\nThe City of Abbeville believes that successful implementation of the risk management program is a team effort.  All plant employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to make recommendations.

This applies to work performed by the operating staff and to outside contractors.  The most recent review/revision of the hot work permit procedure plan was conducted on September 15, 2003.\n\n4.  Five-year Accident History\nThe wastewater treatment plant has had an excellent record in the prevention of accidental chlorine and sulfur dioxide releases over the last five years.  There have been no reportable accidental releases during this period.\n\n5.  Emergency Response Program\nThe wastewater treatment plant has in place a written emergency plan to deal with various emergency situations.  This plan is supplemented by an emergency response procedure specifically for minor chlorine and sulfur dioxide releases.  To ensure proper response during an emergency, our emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced.  In addition, the plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within our processes that would require a modified emergency response.  The Abbeville Fire Department will provide highly trained emergency response personnel to respond to any catastrophic release of chlorine or sulfur dioxide that may have offsite consequences.\n\n6.  Planned Changes to Improve Safety\nFuture improvements to improve safety include additional training, public education, and coordination with emergency responders."
