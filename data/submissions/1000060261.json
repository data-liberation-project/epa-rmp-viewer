Awareness training has been coordinated with the West Jordan Fire Department and Salt Lake County HAZMAT. No accidental release of ammonia has occurred since the installation of the ammonia freezing system in June of 1995. \n\n\n\nEmergency Response Policy: \n\nIn the event of an emergency and depending on the type and magnitude of the emergency, OSI Industries LLC will evacuate or shelter in place its employees and call the West Jordan Fire Department and Salt Lake County HAZMAT teams to respond to the emergency. \n\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances: \n\nOSI Industries LLC West Jordan is a producer of frozen meat products. OSI Industries LLC West Jordan is a producer of value added meat products and uses a closed-loop ammonia freezing system to quick-freeze different meat products. Anhydrous ammonia is a regulated substance under the Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions, 40 CFR 68. \n\n\n\nGeneral accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps: \n\nOSI Industries LLC West Jordan has a written program in compliance with OSHA regulations 29 CFR 1910.119 \n\n(Process Safety Management or PSM). The PSM program outlines start-up and shutdown procedures for safe \n\noperation of the ammonia freezing system. The PSM program procedures are followed to prevent the \n\naccidental release of ammonia from the freeing system.
