To assist with ongoing compliance, a \"Chemical Accident Prevention Compliance Manual\" has been prepared and implemented.  Concerning the emergency response policy at the facility, the owner has made the decision that employees will not respond to accidental releases of regulated substances and will instead evacuate.\n\nThis facility produces natural gas and oil which are EXEMPT from the RMP per regulation 40 CFR 68.115(b)(2)(iii) which states that naturally occurring hydrocarbon mixtures prior to entering into a natural gas processing plant need not be considered when determining threshold quantity.  The facility no longer has a gas processing plant and therefore oil products are not processed. The oil products are naturally occurring and exempt.\n\nThe facility does contain  two 30,000 gallon pressurized bullet tanks operating at approximately 200 psig and containing NGL.  The NGL was obtained by separation by a JT Unit that was removed from the site and gas is no longer processed at this site. One of the tanks will remain empty and the other tank is approximately half full. The NGL is not sold and remains at the facility to facilitate operations.  The facility is subject to the RMP requirements since the NGL was processed using a gas plant and is contained on site in greater than  threshold quantities of regulated substances. The amount of NGL contained on site will not exceed 156,000 pounds.\n\nThe NGL and oil products are a mixture of hydrocarbons consisting of methane, ethane, butane, isobutane, propane, pentane, and isopentane.  For purposes of determining the largest weight on site, the highest density substance was used (butane for NGL and pentane for condensate).\n\nSince this facility is a Program 1, a documented prevention program is not required.  The operator is aware of the Gene"

      "SummaryText": "ral Duty Clause in the Louisiana regulations and accidental release prevention is a policy adopted by the operator.\n\nAs documented in Section 4.0 of the RMP, the facility has not experienced a release as defined in the regulation within the past five years.  \n\nSince this facility is a Program 1, a written Emergency Response Plan is not required.  Emergency response procedures have been developed and are contained at the front of the RMP plan and these procedures will be implemented in the event of an accidental release or the threat of such a release. Basically, the instructions are to evacuate the facility and then notify the proper authorities.\n\nAt present time, there are no planned changes to improve safety."
