This facility will deliver the DAPI for a new innovative oral treatment of diabetes through a process of fermentation, purification, and recovery.\n\n\n\nThe 'Novo Nordisk Way' is a set of guiding principles that describes who we are, where we want to go and the values that characterize our company. The Essentials defined in the Novo Nordisk Way set direction for and apply to all employees in Novo Nordisk formulating the underlying promise we make to each other and our external stakeholders. Our Triple Bottom Line (TBL) principle, Essential #3, anchors the way we do business, ensuring that our decisions balance financial, environmental, and socially responsible considerations. \n\n\n\nNovo Nordisk is committed to making safety, health, and environmental considerations an integral part of planning and manufacturing activities. This includes all aspects of fire and building code compliance, site security, and compliance with applicable legislation, such as Process Safety Management (PSM) and Risk Management Plan (RMP). Novo Nordisk will operate the facilities in a manner that protects the environment, safety and health of our employees, contractors, and our community. \n\n\n\nManagement maintains the highest standards for safety and health in the design of buildings, equipment, and processes. High standards are also be maintained in the development of job methods, the provision for personal protective equipment, the training of employees and in the development and implementation of all elements of the PSM and the RMP program standards.  \n\n\n\nThe site relies on a strong prevention plan and robust monitoring, in place to preclude incidents that includes risk-based preventative maintenance programs, site-wide gas detection integrated with our Building Management System, process telemetry, safety and process interloc"

The Alternate case for the RMP was determined based on Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) and Layer of Protection Analysis (LOPA) assessments.  \n\n\n\nAs a newly constructed facility, this is Novo Nordisk - DAPI's first RMP submission and, with no RMP regulated source prior, there are no accidents to review. \n\n\n\nNovo Nordisk's Emergency response plan for the release of hazardous materials consists of multiple facets including operations response, emergency response team actions, and emergency services aid.  The emergency response plan instructs employees to take specific actions in the event of various environmental, health, and safety incidents including chemical release. The emergency response team is equipped and trained to respond to Hazmat incidents consistent with their level of training, up to and including calling upon the Regional Hazmat Team for incidents outside the scope of the training.  Johnston County Emergency Services and Wilson's Mills Fire Department serve as the first responders to Novo Nordisk, providing medical aid support for chemical releases and will deploy Regional Hazmat Team(s) when necessary. \n\n\n\nNovo Nordisk maintains communication with our local emergency services, including Johnston County Emergency Services and Emergency Management, Wilson's Mills Fire Department, and North Carolina Department of Public Safety and is committed to furthering their partnerships and capabilities through participation in regular, joint planning and exercises. \n\n\n\nNovo Nordisk understands that safety and the environment must undergo constant examination as part of our commitment to continuous improvement. \n\n\n\n\n\n"
