In this effort our highest priority will be the proactive pursuit of cost-effective process changes that reduce or eliminate the use and/ or generation of hazardous toxics at the endpoint of service. Where hazardous toxics cannot be eliminated, improving controls to handle these substances will be explored and implemented wherever possible.\n\n1.1.4.    Supreme Oil has prepared a facility safety policy and procedures program specifically tailored for the facility. In addition, a Process Safety Management Program has also been established regarding the ammonia process. It is the responsibility of designated facility personnel to carry out these programs.\n\n1.1.5.    The first duty of Supreme Oil employees is to exercise care in the performance of his/her work tasks to prevent an accident to him/her, co-workers, the general public or equipment. Safety-consciousness must take precedence over expedience, and is required as a condition of continued employment of all employees at all levels of the organization. \n\n\n\n1.2.    Facility Description\n\nSupreme Oil is an edible oils, mayonnaise, salad dressings, and condiments processing facility; where food ingredients are received, blended, mixed, cooked, packaged and boxed for shipment to end users. There are approximately 130 employees working at the facility.\n\n1.2.1.    The substance regulated under the Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions (40 CFR 68) located on site, in various locations and quantities is anhydrous ammonia.\n\n1.2.2.    Anhydrous Ammonia is utilized on site for the \"Process System\".  Approximately 13,800 pounds of ammonia is used as the refrigerant in the system. The ammonia is contained in various vessels, cooling units, accumulators, piping, and heat exchangers throughout the Process System. The facility compressor room houses the compressors.\n\n1.2.3.

Supreme Oil is equipped with an emergency information system.\n\n1.3.1.1.    Evacuation plans are placed throughout the facility to inform personnel in an emergency relating to the accidental release of ammonia, or other emergencies that may be encountered.\n\n\n\nThere are specific procedures that all employees must follow in the event of a release; which can be found in the Supreme Oil Emergency Action Plan. These procedures include evacuation of personnel, notification of authorities and actions to be taken to stop, or mitigate the emergency if it is safe to do so.\n\n\n\nPlant personnel have received emergency response training as outlined in OSHA's HAZWOPER regulation 29 CFR 1910.120.\n\n1.3.1.2.    Supreme Oil is willing to work with the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and Area Fire Department to ensure understanding of the Process operations, safety systems and discuss emergency Response coordination.\n\n\n\n2. Management\n\n2.1.    Under EPA's 40 CFR 68.15, the facility is required to assign a qualified person with overall responsibility for the development, implementation, and documentation of a system to manage the Risk Management Program elements.\n\n2.2.    Consistent with OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM), the facility's Plant Manager, Richard Grasser, has overall responsibility for program implementation and management, with support from the Supreme Oil employee staff.\n\n\n\n3.

A block flow diagram of the process is on file in the engineering department office.\n\n3.1.1.3.    The process system used at Supreme Oil is an enclosed loop mechanical process system that utilized anhydrous ammonia as a heat exchange media in the processing of the refrigerated food products. There are no chemical reactions involving ammonia that occur. The principle involved is the ability of a refrigerant, in this case ammonia, to absorb heat as it changes state from a liquid to a gas, and to give up that heat as it changes back to a liquid. The compressors supply the change in pressure levels required to accomplish this.\n\n3.1.1.4.    The heat is absorbed in the cooling evaporators of various designs, and removed from the system by the condensers. More detailed and specific descriptions of the process system are provided in the PSM files.\n\n3.1.1.5.    The process system is charged with 13,800 pounds of anhydrous ammonia to achieve the proper operating pressures and levels that are required within the Process system.\n\n3.1.1.6.
