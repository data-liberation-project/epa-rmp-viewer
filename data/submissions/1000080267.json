The Institute establishes written pamphlets and videos to guide facilities in prevention and emergency programs that cover processing, handling, storage, and release of chemicals such as Chlorine.  Coupled with the numerous training programs from the Institute, the company also complies with DOT container specifications, inspections, and testing requirements. These programs and regulations in conjunction with company policy help to ensure the safe operation of the facility.  \r\n\r\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENTAL RELEASE HISTORY\r\nThe Brenntag Southwest Longview branch has never experienced a release that caused the facility to implement evacuation measures.\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\r\nThis facility has emergency plans which are coordinated with local fire departments and the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC). Our response plan for chlorine and sulfur dioxide is based upon the Chlorine Institutes Pamphlet 64, Emergency Response Plans for Chlorine Facilities. The emergency response plans for all company facilities include procedures for notification of any potentially affected neighbors, the local fire authority, and federal, state, and local agencies.\r\n\r\nSUMMARY\r\n\r\nIn order to have continuous improvement of its safety record, Brenntag Southwest requires all of its facilities to conduct incident investigations, safety compliance audits, repeat training of normal and emergency procedures, and ongoing community outreach actions including: educating and training neighbors, customers, fire departments, and emergency response teams.

The company also maintains agreements with area response companies. \r\n\r\nThe Emergency Programs in place at the facility include a Fire Prevention Plan, Emergency Response Plan, and Transportation Emergency Plan.  These plans require the facility to maintain an open door policy with local fire departments and other emergency groups in the area, and to invite emergency responders from both the public and private sectors to tour the facility annually in order to gain knowledge of the physical setup of the plant.  This information becomes very valuable in the event of an emergency incident.
