      "SummaryText": "SAFETY POLICY STATEMENT\nIt is the policy of Davis Gas Processing that accident prevention shall be considered of primary importance in all phases of operation and administration. It is the intention of Davis Gas Processing  management to provide safe and healthy working conditions and to establish and insist upon safe practices at all times by all employees. The prevention of accidents is an objective affecting all levels of our company and its operations. It is, therefore, a basic requirement that each supervisor make the safety of all employees an integral part of his or her regular management function. It is equally the duty of each employee to accept and follow established safety regulations and procedures. Every effort will be made to provide adequate training to employees. Employees are expected to assist management in accident prevention activities. Unsafe conditions must be reported immediately. Safety is everyone\u0012s business.\n\nSITE DESCRIPTION\nThe Cedar Hill DGP Plant is located about 2 miles south of Post, Texas on FM669\nThere is a Product Propane Storage Tank, which is a 525 barrel painted, welded steel, above ground, horizontal pressure vessel. The  tank operates up to 200 psig and is protected by a pressure relief valve. Liquid flow into this tank is determined by the process operations. Liquid flow out of this tank goes to tank truck loading and is manually controlled. Operating personnel on a daily basis visually inspect this tank. If a spill occurred at this tank, the contents are so volatile that they would evaporate before penetrating the ground to any significant degree. The ground would freeze and contain the propane as it evaporated.\n\nPURPOSE AND GOALS FOR THE CEDAR HILL DGP PLANT\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE AND ACTION PLAN\nEmergency Response And Action Plans (ERAP) were developed by Davis Gas Processing  for its Cedar Hill DGP Plant located in Garza County, Texas.  The ERAP was developed to assist the Cedar Hill DGP Plant Foreman in his responsibility to"
