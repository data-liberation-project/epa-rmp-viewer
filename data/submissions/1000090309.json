We're a full service provider/processor supplying a broad spectrum of species specific proteins including beef, pork, organic and natural chicken, turkey, duck, salmon and white fish blends, formulated to client specifications, grind requirements, and delivered either frozen or in a fresh bulk pump ready form. Ammonia is used as a refrigerant to maintain freezing temperatures in the various stages of the process. \n\n\n\nThe facility has two separate ammonia systems.  The refrigeration systems exceed the 10,000-pound threshold required for our production process and necessitates the submission of this Risk Management Plan.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICY\n\nIt is the policy of BHJ USA, LLC to conduct business in a manner that is safe to the employees, the community, and the environment. The company's officers, managers, and supervisors are accountable to carry out the policies of the company relevant to the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous materials. Protein, Inc. has made a determined effort to develop a plan to prevent releases of extremely hazardous substances. Procedures to assist in the prevention of extremely hazardous material releases are set forth in EPA's Risk Management Program. In the event of a release, the Emergency Response Plan will be the guidance for responding to, containing and reporting such releases.  The Response Plan includes an incident command system for decision making authority for each stage of a release situation.  The company will coordinate with public responders and emergency services in ensuring safety of the public.\n\n\n\nWORST AND ALTERNATE CASE DESCRIPTION\n\nThe worst case scenario is of a vessel being ruptured by a forklift or other form of impact.  The alternate case scenario is a pipe rupture on the outlet of an ammonia pump, this could be caused by a forklift or other form of impact.\n\n\n\nRELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nBHJ USA, LLC "

The company has aggressively developed programs, policies and materials requirements to minimize the possibility of releases. These programs include compliance with appropriate OSHA and EPA regulations and sound safety practices. Stringent material and contractor requirements have been developed to assure that materials and work conform to recognized standards. Training for employees is conducted to maintain a high level awareness when working with hazardous materials.\n\n\n\nVolume 1 of the PSM/RMP Library incorporates several policies. Many policies are included in Volume 1, the remaining are referenced from other training manuals maintained in the facility.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation Guidelines: This policy outlines the commitment between management and employees to establish a program for a successful (safe) program.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information: This includes information on the ammonia inventory at the facility, applicable codes, design standards, and information pertaining to the hazards of ammonia (referenced from the IIAR ammonia Data Book).\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis Program: This program outlines a thorough, orderly, systematic approach for identifying, evaluating, and controlling potential hazards within a process involving potentially hazardous chemicals such as ammonia.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures: develop, implement, and maintain clearly written, detailed procedures, guidelines, rules, and practices for the safe operation of the ammonia refrigeration process during all operating phases. The operating procedures provide all employees involved in the operation and maintenance of the ammonia refrigeration process with the written information and precautions necessary to safety perform their tasks in a consistent manner.\n\n\n\nContractor Qualification Guidelines: This guideline has been established to verify that the contractors working in the facility are qualified to work on the system, trained in t"

The purpose of an MI program is to maintain process equipment so that a catastrophic release of ammonia is avoided or properly contained. The emphasis should be on preventive maintenance rather than breakdown maintenance.\n\n\n\nMany more specific programs and policies (Hot Work, Confined Space, Lockout / Tagout, Employee training, etc.) have been developed. For information specific to these see the Operations Manager.\n\n\n\nAs part of the Prevention Program, Protein, Inc. has developed a method to evaluate the Risk Management Program.
