The site comprises a total of 285 acres with the actual manufacturing facilities occupying 26 acres. An additional 80 acres of the site is used for environmental treatment of wastewater before it is discharged to Aux Sable creek, a tributary of the Illinois River.\r\n(Latitude = 41.406460 / Longitude = -088.336000)\r\n\r\nThe plant, which began operating in 1973, employs approximately 107 people (plus approximately 45 contract maintenance personnel) and is a manufacturer of industrial chemicals, primarily cationic surfactants, derived from naturally occurring fats and oils. The basic raw materials are tallow and grease, by-products of the meat packing industry, and vegetable oils including coconut oil and soybean oil. Additional raw materials include ammonia, hydrogen, methyl chloride, acrylonitrile and formaldehyde solutions.\r\n\r\nThe major processing units at the site include a fat splitter, a nitrile unit, continuous and batch hydrogenation units, nitrile treatment, amine and fatty acid distillation units, amine esterification unit and a quaternization unit.\r\n\r\nThe fat splitter utilizes hot water and high pressure steam to convert the natural occurring fats and oils into organic fatty carboxylic acids and glycerin.  The glycerin is a by-product and is recovered and sold for further processing into soap and personal care products.\r\n\r\nThe fatty acids are transferred to the nitrile unit where they are reacted with ammonia in the presence of a catalyst to form fatty nitrile. The nitrile is then reacted with hydrogen in the presence of catalyst in either the continuous or batch hydrogenation units to form primary, secondary, and tertiary amines. The addition of acrylonitrile or formaldehyde solutions are also made in the batch hydrogenation units to form various seconda"

The scenarios were chosen based upon a review of prior accident history, Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) results and maintenance history. The requirement that the release have an offsite consequence was also a major consideration. A team comprised of operating, maintenance, and engineering personnel conducted the PHA review.\r\n\r\nThe ARS for each of the toxic chemicals was defined as a split or sudden uncoupling of a transfer hose during unloading operations. In the case of acrylonitrile, ammonia, and methyl chloride the action of an excess flow device was considered as a mitigating factor in limiting the release. The release of formaldehyde solution is mitigated by the intervention of operation personnel.\r\n\r\nThe ARS for the flammable chemical was defined as an external fire at the bottle (gaseous hydrogen bullet tank) location which triggers a release from the single relief valve protecting the largest portion of the bullet tank farm.

The following types of safety features are used in various processes:\r\n\r\n\u00bf\tSite wide video monitoring for release detection\r\n\u00bf\tIncineration of specific process relief valve releases\r\n\u00bf\tAutomatic isolation valves for specific processes automated shutdowns for systems for specific process parameters (e.g. high level, high temperature)\r\n\u00bf\tDikes for toxic liquid storage tanks\r\n\u00bf\tEmergency electrical backup for critical control and safety systems\r\n\u00bf\tFire suppression and deluge systems for specific equipment\r\n\u00bf\tReal time simulation capabilities for accidental releases\r\n\r\n5.\tFive Year Accident History\r\n\r\nThere have been no accidental releases of the regulated chemicals that resulted in any death, injury or property damage on the Akzo Nobel Surface Chemistry, LLC Morris site within the last five years.\r\n\r\nThere has never been a release of the regulated chemicals from the site that has resulted in an offsite consequence to the commu"

      "SummaryText": "agement Plan.\r\n\r\n4.3\tProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\r\n\r\nAkzo Nobel Surface Chemistry, LLC Morris site uses OSHA accepted Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) Methods. The PHA is one of the most important elements of the process safety management program. A PHA is a detailed description of deviations, factors, causes, consequences, indications and recommendations. This analysis is completed for each piece of the process. This site uses a PHA computer software program to assist with evaluation and documentation of possible hazards.\r\n\r\nThe recommendation section of the PHA directs efforts to establish a written schedule of what actions are to be taken. The documentation varies depending on the recommendation. Many require capital expenditure requests, training or process change requests.\r\n\r\nPHA team members represent all departments associated with the process. These departments include engineering, maintenance, management, safety, and operations. All team leaders are trained in conducting PHA analysis.  One member of the team is knowledgeable in the specific hazard analysis methodology being used. Also, at least one team member has experience and knowledge specific to the process being evaluated.\r\n\r\nThe process hazard analysis depends upon the quality of the Process Safety Information. Akzo Nobel uses this information primarily to identify and evaluate potential hazards. The goal is to prevent a hazardous situation. If one occurs, the secondary goal is to minimize the effects of that situation.\r\n\r\nAll PHA and revalidation documents are kept in the company computer Intranet and Safety Department.\r\n\r\n4.4\tOperating Procedures\r\n\r\nAkzo Nobel Surface Chemistry, LLC operating procedures are an integral part of the safe operations of the plant. All procedures are part of the facilities document control system. \r\n\r\nThe steps for each operating procedure include (1) initial startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency operations including the conditions under"
