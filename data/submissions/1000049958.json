The site comprises a total of 285 acres with the actual manufacturing facilities occupying 26 acres. An additional 80 acres of the site is used for environmental treatment of wastewater before it is discharged to Aux Sable creek, a tributary of the Illinois River.\n\n(Latitude = 41.406460 / Longitude = -088.336000)\n\n\n\nThe plant, which began operating in 1973, employs approximately 107 people (plus approximately 45 contract maintenance personnel) and is a manufacturer of industrial chemicals, primarily cationic surfactants, derived from naturally occurring fats and oils. The basic raw materials are tallow and grease, by-products of the meat packing industry, and vegetable oils including coconut oil and soybean oil. Additional raw materials include ammonia, hydrogen, methyl chloride, acrylonitrile and formaldehyde solutions.\n\n\n\nThe major processing units at the site include a fat splitter, a nitrile unit, continuous and batch hydrogenation units, nitrile treatment, amine and fatty acid distillation units, amine esterification unit and a quaternization unit.\n\n\n\nThe fat splitter utilizes hot water and high pressure steam to convert the natural occurring fats and oils into organic fatty carboxylic acids and glycerin.  The glycerin is a by-product and is recovered and sold for further processing into soap and personal care products.\n\n\n\nThe fatty acids are transferred to the nitrile unit where they are reacted with ammonia in the presence of a catalyst to form fatty nitrile. The nitrile is then reacted with hydrogen in the presence of catalyst in either the continuous or batch hydrogenation units to form primary, secondary, and tertiary amines. The addition of acrylonitrile or formaldehyde solutions are also made in the batch hydrogenation units to form various seconda"

These intermediates and products are used as surfactants in agricultural products, personal care products, detergents and fabric softeners. They are also used as surfactants in a wide range of other industrial processes including food, chemical, highway paving, metal processing, mining, petroleum, paint, ink, paper, pharmaceutical, rubber and polymer processing industries.\n\n\n\n    Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nThe site has five substances that are covered by the Risk Management Plan regulations. These substances are raw materials and are acrylonitrile, ammonia, formaldehyde solutions, methyl chloride and hydrogen. \n\n\n\nThe maximum quantities of these materials in process at the plant site at anytime are as follows:\n\n\n\nAcrylonitrile (toxic)    399,168 lbs\n\nAmmonia (toxic)    989,808 lbs\n\nFormaldehyde Solutions (toxic)    477,251 lbs(as 100% Formaldehyde 238,626lbs)\n\nMethyl Chloride (toxic)    1,026,246 lbs\n\nHydrogen (flammable)    12,815 lbs\n\n\n\nThese quantities represent full storage tanks and maximum number of full delivery containers that could be on site. Under normal operating conditions the quantity stored on site is approximately one half of the maximum quantities listed above.\n\n\n\nIn the 2015 updates, Hydrogen has been conservatively added to the site RMPlan.  Akzo Nobel uses a direct feed of hydrogen from the neighboring Lyondellbasell facility to pressurize onsite \"bottle\" tanks of gaseous Hydrogen that feed process operations.  The capacity of the bottle tanks and supply piping is below the RMP threshold quantity for Hydrogen.  During short turnaround periods or when the Lyondellbasell supply is unavailable, the liquid Hydrogen auxiliary storage tank can be used.  The liquid Hydrogen auxiliary storage"

Consequence Analysis\n\n\n\n    Worst Case Scenario (WCS)- Toxics\n\n\n\nThe potential impact of the dispersion of the four toxic chemicals listed in section 2.2 resulting from the rupture of the largest single vessel containing each of the chemicals was conducted using the OCA Guidance document and the RMP Comp dispersion model. Where appropriate for toxic liquid releases, site specific weather data was used.\n\n\n\nThe analysis revealed that the WCS toxic release for the site is a catastrophic rupture of a railcar containing 221,760 lbs of acrylonitrile. The potential impact zone is defined by a circle with a radius of 17 miles and its center at the acrylonitrile unloading station on the site. Using census data, provided by the U.S. Census Bureau in the MARPLOT 4.2.5 program, the estimated population that could potentially be impacted by this release is 316,303 people.\n\n\n\nThe potential impact zone also contains a number of small communities, churches, state parks, Goose Lake Nature Preserve, National Tallgrass Prairie and recreational areas.\n\n\n\n    Worst Case Scenario (WCS)- Flammables\n\n\n\nThe potential impact of the dispersion of the one flammable chemical listed in section 2.2 resulting from the rupture of the largest single vessel containing hydrogen was conducted using the OCA Guidance document and the RMP Comp dispersion model. The generic weather data from the RMPComp model was used.\n\n\n\nThe analysis revealed that the WCS flammable release for the site is a catastrophic rupture of the pressurized liquid hydrogen storage tank containing 9,219 lbs of hydrogen.

Using census data, provided by the U.S. Census Bureau in the MARPLOT 4.2.5 program, the estimated population that could potentially be impacted by this release is 0 people.\n\n\n\nThe potential impact zone contains small lakes and recreational areas.\n\n\n\n    Alternative Release Scenarios (ARS)\n\n\n\nAlternative Release Scenarios as defined by the regulation were developed for each of the five regulated chemicals. The scenarios were chosen based upon a review of prior accident history, Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) results and maintenance history. The requirement that the release have an offsite consequence was also a major consideration. A team comprised of operating, maintenance, and engineering personnel conducted the PHA review.\n\n\n\nThe ARS for each of the toxic chemicals was defined as a split or sudden uncoupling of a transfer hose during unloading operations. In the case of acrylonitrile, ammonia, and methyl chloride the action of an excess flow device was considered as a mitigating factor in limiting the release. The release of formaldehyde solution is mitigated by the intervention of operation personnel.\n\n\n\nThe ARS for the flammable chemical was defined as an external fire at the bottle (gaseous hydrogen bullet tank) location which triggers a release from the single relief valve protecting the largest portion of the bullet tank farm.  The release of hydrogen is mitigated by the intervention of operation personnel and external emergency responders.\n\n\n\nThe offsite consequence analysis for each of the Alternative Release Scenarios was developed using the RMPComp dispersion modeling program and the MARPLOT 4.2.5 census data.
