This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n1.)To save lives.\n2.)To minimize and avoid injuries.\n3.)To protect the environment.\n4.)To minimize property damage.\n\nBama Frozen Dough maintains an emergency response committee whose members are the designated emergency coordinators for the facility.  The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year.  This Plan was reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations, as well as to incorporate any facility changes. \n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nThe Bama Frozen Dough facility prepares bread products for distribution.  The refrigeration process, consisting of piping, valves, and equipment, cycles ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration for process equipment and cold storage rooms.  Changes in pressure are directly related to changes in temperature.  For example, lowering the ammonia pressure lowers its temperature.  Low pressure (cold) liquid ammonia provides refrigeration by removing ambient heat.  Removal of ambient heat causes the liquid ammonia (contained within the system) to vaporize.  Heat is later removed from the ammonia as it is condensed back into a liquid.  Typical operating conditions range from vacuum (approximately 12 Hg) on the low pressure side of the system to 150-160 psig on the high side.\n\nAmmonia is used as the refrigerant in the refrigeration proce"

However, one release was filed with the NRC on 1/1093 but lated was determined to be under the reportable quantity (approximately 76 pound release).\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe Bama Frozen Dough has an Emergency Response Program in place.  The facility has an Emergency Response Team that is trained to First Responder Technician Level on an annual basis.  All Emergency Response Team members are fit tested and respiratory trained annually.   \n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThe Process Safety Management team is planning to complete several items over the next year as their continued effort to provide a safe work environment for the Bama Frozen Dough employees.  These changes include the following items:\n\n1.Complete a Process Hazard Analysis by the year 2000 and implement changes as needed.\n\n2.Continue to train all employees in Process Safety Management and the Bama Safety Plan/Programs.\n\n3. Continue to have employee involvement in Safety Plan"
