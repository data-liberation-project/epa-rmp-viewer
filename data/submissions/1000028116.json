FBC will utilize its Risk Management Program to identify ways to reduce its use of hazardous materials and minimize potential risks to its employees, the community, and environment.\n\n  \n\nFBC will comply with applicable safety, health, and environmental regulations; identify, report, and promptly correct unsafe conditions; train personnel to safely perform their job duties; and work to maintain a safe workplace.\n\n\n\nDescription of Stationary Source and Substance Handled\n\n\n\nFBC has implemented a Level 3 Risk Management Program to prevent the accidental release of anhydrous ammonia from its plant at 960 South Schneider Street in Fremont, Nebraska.  At this location, FBC processes and vacuum packs fresh pork and beef products for distribution to domestic food service companies and export abroad.  The industrial process relies on chillers to keep the food products cold during preparation, packaging and storage.  The chillers and refrigeration system uses anhydrous ammonia as the coolant in quantities exceeding EPA's regulatory threshold.  \n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nFBC relies on several safeguards as part of it accidental release prevention program.  FBC designers and suppliers use recognized design codes and standards for the equipment and system components; standard operating procedures specify safe practices used at the plant; a maintenance program establishes proper testing, calibration, and cleaning procedures.  Also hazard communication occurs frequently between management, operators, and employees during the process hazard analysis, process safety information reviews, training, safety briefings, and the annual program review. \n\n \n\nFive Year Accident History\n\n\n\nFBC filled out an incident report on a minor rele"

      "SummaryText": "ase that occurred in May 2010.  That release was estimated to have resulted in 10 pounds of ammonia vented to the atmosphere.  The incident resulted in no on-site deaths, injuries, or significant property damage onsite; nor any offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage and was not a reportable accident.  \n\n\n\nEmergency Response \n\n\n\nThe FBC Emergency Action Plan has been coordinated with the Region 5/6 Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC), the Fremont Fire Department and it provides guidance for the notification, response and evacuation of FBC's employees.  The emergency action plan acknowledges the LEPC as the emergency coordinators and recognizes the Fremont Fire Department and their affiliates with the Bellevue Fire Department as the first responders.  \n\n\n\nProcess Safety Improvements \n\n\n\nFBC's regular participation in safety related activities results in safety improvements at the facility.  FBC regularly participates in training and internal facility safety reviews offered by the Nebraska Safety Council;  hosts the local Fire Department during facility walk through, receives annual insurance carrier facility safety inspections, conducts third part audits to identify potential improvements, conducts regular pipe integrity testing, and offers FBC employees awareness level, initial and refresher training on the ammonia refrigeration system.  This Risk Management Plan and information used to prepare it are readily available to all FBC employees.\n\n"
