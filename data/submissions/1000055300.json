The EPA Facility ID of 1000-0015-7572 was assigned to it.\n\nThis RMP submission is the year 2016 update to the present FPWWTP RMP as required by USEPA every 5 years.\n\nThe FPWWTP is an Oxidation Ditch Wastewater Treatment Facility designed for an average flow of 6.0 MGD.  The treatment processes include bar screens, grit and grease removal, fine screening, high rate trickling filters, aeration basins (oxidation ditch), final clarifiers, aerobic digesters, belt filter press for sludge dewatering, and chlorination of final effluent prior to discharge to Big Wills Creek.\n\nThe present average flow rate is approximately 1.8 MGD, which has decreased significantly over the last few years due to industrial plant and hosiery mill closures within the service area.\n\nThe chlorination process utilizes chlorine gas, stored in one ton cylinders.  The maximum number of cylinders maintained on-site is three, or a maximum of 6,000 pounds at any one time.  Chlorine gas utilization over 2,500 pounds is a regulated substance in accordance with 40 CFR 68.\n\nThe chlorine cylinders are stored inside a totally enclosed, fire proof concrete block building.  Vacuum chlorinators are located in a separate chlorine feed room within the building.\n\nThe entire chlorination system was renovated and updated in 2002 as a part of an overall WWTP upgrade and renovation.  The Risk Management Program was reviewed and updated at that time and the update was attached as an Addendum to the original RMP.The RMP was audited by USEPA (Private Contractor) in a site visit on 5/29/2008. All comments were addressed during the week following the site visit.\n\nThe chlorinators are vacuum fed, with no water supply or pressurized chlorine lines required.  The vacuum r"

      "SummaryText": "egulators on the ton cylinders provide the initial safety procedures for the system.  These valves only release gas when a vacuum is applied; therefore a break in the chlorine manifold or discharge lines will cause the regulator valve to automatically shut off.\n\nThe system is completely automated, with continuous leak detectors, and monitors located in both the storage and feed rooms.  The leak detector monitors are part of the plant SCADA system which is monitored by the plant operators in the plant control room.\n\nThe leak detectors are checked daily by the operating personnel to ensure their responsiveness.  They are tested monthly using a gas sensor test kit to verify that the sensors' life has not expired.  Any failure detected in any leak detector is corrected immediately by the repair or replacement of the monitor.\n\nIn the event of a leak, when a chlorine gas concentration of 1.0 mg/l is detected, the leak detectors and monitors initiate an alarm both within the building and in the SCADA system at the control room.  Simultaneously the leak detector initiates a total building exhaust fan with discharge to a vapor scrubber which neutralizes the chlorine gas leaked into the building.\n\nAn auxiliary generator is on-line at the plant to ensure operation of the building exhaust system and vapor scrubber even in the event of a power outage.\n\nAll plant operators are trained and familiar with the safe operation, maintenance, control, and trouble shooting of all aspects of the chlorination facility including unloading and exchanging chlorine cylinders, proper mounting of vacuum regulators on the cylinder, connections, vents, minor leak detection (utilizing ammonia), vacuum regulators, automatic switch over modules, chlorinators, leak detectors and monitors, chlorine leak exhaust fan and vapor scrubber, and utilization of Personal Protection Equipment (PPE) and Self Contained Breathing Apparatus (SCBA) which are available for operator use at the WWTP.

      "SummaryText": " personnel receive daily on the job training supervised by the Chief Operator. Annually, numerous Safety Videos furnished by AMIC/MWCR are viewed by the operators. \n\nThe plant operators receive a yearly chlorine safety training seminar provided by the chlorine supplier,Brentag Midsouth and the Fort Payne Fire Department.  The seminar includes general chlorine safety, affect of chlorine on individuals, repairing of cylinder and line leaks, proper opening and closing of valves, proper use of Personal Protection Equipment (PPE) and Self Contained Breathing Apparatus (SCBA) and demonstration of Fire Department Hazmat equipment.  The Fort Payne Fire Department has a regional training center, and a Hazmat Team which is one of the best trained and equipped in the state.  They are equipped and ready to respond to any chlorine emergency at the WWTP.\n\nIn case of an uncontrolled release of chlorine gas from the WWTP (assuming failure of the vapor scrubber to neutralize the leak) an integrated emergency response plan has been adopted and includes the coordination with several local organizations including DeKalb County Emergency Management Agency, Fort Payne Fire Department, Fort Payne Police Department, DeKalb County Sheriff, the local hospital, and Ambulance Service.  There have been no accidental releases of chlorine gas, other than minor incidental leaks inside the building during the last five years.  The vapor scrubber has never been initiated by a leak detected by the leak detection monitors.\n\nThe WWTP is owned and operated by the City of Fort Payne under the supervision of the Mayor and City Council.  The daily plant operation is directly supervised by the Chief Operator who reports to the Mayor.  The Chief Operator is responsible for plant operation, maintenance, training of plant operational personnel, coordination and execution of all health, safety, and environmental protection programs.\n\nThe City of Fort Payne, its Mayor, Council, and the operators of the WWTP are "
