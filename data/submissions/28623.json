To ensure the safety of the public, Clackamas Distribution Center - Freezer Warehouse personnel, and the environment, the plant has implemented a management system that integrates the elements of OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) standard, 29 CFR 1910.119 and EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP) rule, 40 CFR part 68.  The policies and procedures integrated under the Clackamas Distribution Center - Freezer Warehouse's management system specifically address prevention of the release of anhydrous ammonia, and emergency response to an accidental release of ammonia.\n\nB. STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nThe Clackamas Distribution Center - Freezer Warehouse operates one refrigerated warehouse and freezer.  Anhydrous ammonia is used as a refrigerant in the mechanical compression refrigeration system at the facility.  Ammonia is handled in a closed-loop process that consists of the following general stages: liquid storage; expansion; evaporation; compression; and condensation.\n\nRefrigeration process equipment at the facility operates continuously.  Compressors and condensers cycle on and off to comply with system demand during operation.  The ammonia refrigeration system provides cooling for dock operations and freezers.  \n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system is the only process at the Clackamas Distribution Center - Freezer Warehouse which is subject to the EPA RMP rule (and the OSHA PSM standard).  Anhydrous ammonia is the only regulated substance handled in the ammonia refrigeration system.\n\nThe refrigeration cycle begins with the transfer of high pressure liquid ammonia from the Thermosyphon Receiver to the 65 psig Controlled Pressure Recei"

The 65 psig Controlled Pressure Receiver sends liquid ammonia to the Dock Area Evaporators and the 25 psig Controlled Pressure Receiver (CPR-1).  At the Dock Evaporators, the liquid ammonia is partially vaporized as it absorbs heat from the product and room.  The resultant vapor/liquid mix is drawn back to the +15\u00b0F Suction Accumulator (ACC-2).\n\nThe 25 psig Controlled Pressure Receiver sends liquid ammonia to the Freezer Penthouse Evaporators.  At the Freezer Penthouse Evaporators, the liquid ammonia is partially vaporized as it absorbs heat from the product and room.  The resultant vapor/liquid mix is drawn back to the -25\u00b0F Suction Accumulator (ACC-1).\n\nAt the Suction Accumulators, the wet suction from the evaporators is separated.  The liquid falls to the bottom and the vapor is drawn from the top by the Compressors.  The Booster Compressors and High Stage Compressors draw from the -25\u00b0F Suction Accumulator and +15\u00b0F Suction Accumulator, respectively.   Liquid is returned to the respective Controlled Pressure Receiver via two Drum Traps associated with each accumulator (PD-1, 2, 3, & 4).\n\nThe Swing Compressor may operate as either a Two Stage or High Stage Compressor, depending on system demand.  The Booster Compressors discharge vapor to the +15\u00b0F Suction Accumulator and the High Stage Compressors discharge vapor to the Condensers.  High stage discharge from the Compressors is also used in i) the hot gas defrost cycle of the evaporators, ii) pressurizing the Drum Traps during the liquid transfer process, and iii) maintaining pressure in the Controlled Pressure Receivers.\n\nThe high stage discharge from the Compressors is condensed back into high pressure liquid at the Condensers.  Latent heat is rejected by spraying water and blowing air over coils filled with ammonia.  The resultant high pressure ammonia liquid is returned to the Thermosyphon Receiver to begin t"

The Auto Purger removes non-condensables (i.e., air and water) from the system.  There are four purge points located at the Condenser, and one at the Thermosyphon Receiver.  The Glycol Heat Exchanger uses high stage discharge to reheat glycol chilled in the freezer underfloor heating system.\n\nThe relief valves are set at 250 psig on the high pressure vessels, the compressors, the heat exchanger, the purger, and the condensers and 150 psig on the low pressure vessels.  The relief valves vent to an Ammonia Dump Tank located outside the equipment room.\n\nC. HAZARD ASSESSMENT SUMMARY\n\n Worst Case Release Result Summary\n\nThe worst case release scenario is a release of the total quantity of ammonia in the largest vessel in the ammonia refrigeration system, taking into account administrative controls that limit the maximum quantity in the vessel.  If a vessel is located inside a building, the EPA allows a passive mitigation factor of 55% to be used in calculating the release rate to the outside atmosphere when the release is enclosed by a building.\n\nThe 65 psig Controlled Pressure Receiver has a capacity of 18,600 pounds, is located inside the engine room and is the largest vessel in this system.  The entire system charge of ammonia is 20,000 lbs.  Therefore, the total release quantity is 18,600 pounds.  This results in a release rate of 1,023 lbs to the outside atmosphere.\n\nFor analyzing the worst case release scenario, EPA requires the use of the most pessimistic meteorological conditions that will allow for the maximum downwind exposure.  Low wind speeds (1.5 m/s) and stable atmospheric conditions (F stability) will allow the gas cloud to travel as far as possible by limiting cloud dispersion.  The results are conservative.\n\nEPA's 'Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration,' May 2000, Exhibit 4-4 was used to find the downwind distance for the worst case re"

These safety features include ammonia sensors throughout the plant, pressure relief valves to protects vessels' integrity, and automatic shut down systems that prevent equipment damage and ammonia releases.  In the event of ammonia detection, audible and visual alarms are triggered throughout the facility. \n\nAmmonia refrigeration systems do not experience any chemical reactions or internal corrosion.  The only composition changes that occur within the systems are phase changes, as ammonia is cycled through various stages of liquid and vapor, similar to a household refrigerator.  The refrigeration system is a closed-loop system without any regular emissions or releases.  Any leaks are noted and repaired immediately.\n\nIn addition to the Uniform Mechanical Code, the facility will operate in accordance with the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) guidelines.\n\nE. FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe Clackamas Distribution Center - Freezer Warehouse began operation in July 2003.  Therefore, the facility has not had any ammonia releases that resulted in deaths, injuries, property damage, environmental damage, or offsite evacuations.\n\nF.

The PHA provided mitigation measures to improve safety at the Clackamas Distribution Center - Freezer Warehouse located at 16800 South Evelyn Street, in Clackamas, Oregon. \n\nThe following recommendations from the PHA are scheduled to be completed by March 2004:\n\nR01  Develop a policy for investigating the causes of any abnormal operations within the ammonia process prior to making any \"quick fixes\". \n\nR02  Conduct an ammonia awareness training program that includes informing all employees of the following: 1) the presence of and the hazards associated with ammonia at the facility, 2) how to recognize ammonia, 3) what to do if they observe an ammonia leak, and 4) where to go when they are told to evacuate.\n\nR03  Follow manufacturer's recommended maintenance schedule to test, and if necessary, calibrate ammonia detectors every six months.  Include in Mechanical Integrity program.\n\nR04  Implement a policy to not store any excess material inside engine room, such as pallets, extra oil, or other flammable materials.\n\nR05  Implement a maintenance program to replace/recertify relief valves every five years (as per industry standard).  Automatically replace any relief valves that unseat.  Include in Mechanical Integrity program.\n\nR06  Include a weekly visual inspection of the pressure relief valves for frost.  Include in Mechanical Integrity program.\n\nR07  Conduct annual visual inspection of vessels, paint and repair any signs of corrosion and insulation damage as necessary.  Include in Mechanical Integrity program.\n\nR08  Train maintenance employees in the proper procedure for isolating the thermosyphon receiver.  (Shut inlet valve and allow the vessel to evacuate all ammonia before working on it.)\n\nR09  Cons"
