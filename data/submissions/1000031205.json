California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program - Title 19 CCR, Chapter 4.5\n\n?    Federal EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) - Title 40 CFR ?68\n\n?

Federal Process Safety Management (PSM) Program, Title 29 CFR ?1910.119\n\n\n\nHereafter this program will be referred to as the RMP-PSM program.\n\n\n\nThis program is intended to be a \"living document\". As such, the information, procedures, policies, and documentation that make up this program must be made easily accessible and updated as necessary. To accomplish this, Lindsay-Strathmore Irrigation District has elected to use PSMWriter, software developed and distributed by Resource Compliance, Inc. This software will assist us with updating, maintaining, scheduling, and tracking RMP-PSM related activities. \n\n\n\n1.1    LINDSAY-STRATHMORE IRRIGATION DISTRICT, RISK & PROCESS SAFETY MANAGEMENT PROGRAM \n\n\n\nThis is to inform all interested persons, including employees, that Lindsay-Strathmore Irrigation District has updated/developed their unified RMP-PSM Program. This program has been prepared to address the risks involved in operating and maintaining the following processes which have the presence of hazardous chemicals above threshold quantities: \n\n\n\nChlorine Process | Chlorine | 2,500lb\n\n\n\nOur RMP-PSM program promotes overall plant, worker, and public safety. The program enables our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of hazardous chemicals. Overall, the program is designed to prevent accidental fatalities, injuries, and illnesses and avoid physical property damage.\n\n\n\nLindsay-Strathmore Irrigation District has an exemplary safety record, one that we are quite proud of. Our company has many policies and procedures in place to promote overall plant, worker and public safety. We have: \n\n\n\n1.    "

Organized the program so that it meshes closely with general Lindsay-Strathmore Irrigation District business practices\n\n3.    Utilized PSMWriter software to ensure that all necessary Lindsay-Strathmore Irrigation District employees have access to relevant information (SOPs, PHAs, audits, etc.)\n\n\n\nThe RMP-PSM program sets forth rules, procedures and practices that will help our employees protect themselves and our neighbors.\n\n1.2    PROCESS DESCRIPTION\n\nThe Lindsay-Strathmore Irrigation District owns and operates the Trauger Pumping Plant. Chlorine is utilized to disinfect water that is served to land and residences within the District. One-ton cylinders are installed on a scale and the chlorine is injected through three Wallace and Tiernan V-notch chlorinators to a sump located beneath the chlorine room. \n\n\n\nThe Trauger Pumping Plant is remotely located and is situated behind a high-banked canal with the prevailing wind away from any populated areas. Only a few residences are located within the Estimated Distance to Toxic Endpoint. Although the Trauger Pumping Plant is remotely located and poses only a minimal risk to the surrounding population, administrative and engineering controls are in place to respond to a chlorine leak. These administrative and engineering controls include: \n\n\n\n1.    All employees involved in the chlorination process will be properly trained. Training will include leak control procedures as well as emergency measures in the event of a leak. \n\n2.    All employees who perform work operations around the chlorine storage areas, including but not limited to changing chlorine containers, will be equipped with and trained to use the proper protective gear including air packs. \n\n3.    All employees who change chlorine containers will be trained in the use of A and B patch kits for leak repair. \n\n4.    Employees will be instructed that if a chlorine leak is uncontrollable, "

All chlorinating rooms, where practical, will be equipped with a chlorine leak detector that alarms when chlorine is detected. \n\n\n\nThe District's Emergency Response Plan directs the Plan Coordinator to alert several agencies including local police and sheriffs offices, environmental health offices, hospitals and the Visalia Fire Department, the designated HAZMAT team for Tulare and Kings counties. \n\n\n\nThe Trauger Pumping Plant is occupied 24-hours per day. The maintenance and inspection program is carried out daily.\n\n\n\n1.3    GENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE & CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\n1.3.1    GENERAL \n\n\n\nWe inform our employees engaged in process operations of the dangers of an accidental release of chlorine in annual safety meetings. During these meeting we also discuss preventative measures, such as evacuation, in order to be prepared for a release.\n\n\n\nLindsay-Strathmore Irrigation District has also conducted an off-site consequence analysis of worst-case and alternative release scenarios for the chlorine process. These are for the purposes of informing the public in the event of an accidental release. The results of the analyses are reported in the body of the program. \n\n\n\n1.3.2    CHLORINE\n\n\n\nThe chlorination process at the Lindsay-Strathmore Irrigation District facility is an integral part of the overall business and operates for only a few months out of the year. As with the chlorine process management is committed to making sure that employees are made aware of the potential danger of a chlorine leak. \n\n\n\nLindsay-Strathmore Irrigation District personnel monitor the chlorination process. In addition, the process is checked frequently during the operational season by our outside water treatment contractor. This contractor also assists in performing the annual mechanical integrity review of our chlorine equipment. \n\n\n\n1.4    FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nLindsay-Strathmore Irrigation District has had no"

California \"Emergency Action Plan\" - Title 8 CCR ?3220\n\n?    Federal \"Emergency Action Plan\" - Title 29 CFR ?1910.38 \n\n?

Federal \"Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response\" (HAZWOPER) - Title 29 CFR ?1910.120(q)\n\n\n\nStrategically, we will respond \"minimally\" to a release. Under this plan we will call emergency personnel and evacuate the facility. All response activities would be done in coordination with the Local Fire Department and their Hazardous Materials Response Team. \n\n\n\nEvery year we review with our employees our evacuation procedures in the event of an emergency, including a hazardous chemical release.\n\n\n\n1.6    PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nOur company has an outstanding safety record, one that we are quite proud of. Many policies and procedures have been implemented to promote overall plant, worker and public safety. Nevertheless, Lindsay-Strathmore Irrigation District continually strives to improve in all areas, including safety.\n\n\n\nBy utilizing PSMWriter software, all necessary employees have access to every aspect of the RMP-PSM program. This has improved Lindsay-Strathmore Irrigation District's ability to communicate hazardous situations to employees and contractors. In addition, PSMWriter tracks all RMP-PSM related events so that Lindsay-Strathmore Irrigation District's management team can ensure that the RMP-PSM program is being implemented.\n\n\n\nLindsay-Strathmore Irrigation District has implemented all aspects of the RMP-PSM program.

Once the action item has been completed, the resolution can be documented using PSMWriter as well. A list of current or past due action items can be accessed at any time by those with access to PSMWriter.\n\n\n\nIn addition to utilizing PSMWriter to create, schedule, track, and document events, Lindsay-Strathmore Irrigation District has also entered into a contract with Resource Compliance to obtain help with RMP-PSM program implementation. A copy of Resource Compliance's service agreement has been included in this program with the support material.\n\n\n\nFor the future, Lindsay-Strathmore Irrigation District now thinks of the RMP-PSM program as a \"living document\". It is an interactive framework that guides safe action for Lindsay-Strathmore Irrigation District employees, but allows for feedback and continual improvement. Through the RMP-PSM program Lindsay-Strathmore Irrigation District will continue to maintain overall plant worker and public safety. \n\n \n\n"
