As such, the information, procedures, policies, and documentation that make up this program must be made easily accessible and updated as necessary. To accomplish this, Lindsay-Strathmore Irrigation District has elected to use PSMWriter, software developed and distributed by Resource Compliance, Inc. This software will assist us with updating, maintaining, scheduling, and tracking RMP-PSM related activities. \r\n\r\n1.1\tLINDSAY-STRATHMORE IRRIGATION DISTRICT, RISK & PROCESS SAFETY MANAGEMENT PROGRAM \r\n\r\nThis is to inform all interested persons, including employees, that Lindsay-Strathmore Irrigation District has updated/developed their unified RMP-PSM Program. This program has been prepared to address the risks involved in operating and maintaining the following processes which have the presence of hazardous chemicals above threshold quantities: \r\n\r\nChlorine Process | Chlorine | 2,500lb\r\n\r\nOur RMP-PSM program promotes overall plant, worker, and public safety. The program enables our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of hazardous chemicals. Overall, the program is designed to prevent accidental fatalities, injuries, and illnesses and avoid physical property damage.\r\n\r\nLindsay-Strathmore Irrigation District has an exemplary safety record, one that we are quite proud of. Our company has many policies and procedures in place to promote overall plant, worker and public safety. We have: \r\n\r\n1."

Chlorine is utilized to disinfect water that is served to land and residences within the District. One-ton cylinders are installed on a scale and the chlorine is injected through three Wallace and Tiernan V-notch chlorinators to a sump located beneath the chlorine room. \r\n\r\nThe Trauger Pumping Plant is remotely located and is situated behind a high-banked canal with the prevailing wind away from any populated areas. Only a few residences are located within the Estimated Distance to Toxic Endpoint. Although the Trauger Pumping Plant is remotely located and poses only a minimal risk to the surrounding population, administrative and engineering controls are in place to respond to a chlorine leak. These administrative and engineering controls include: \r\n\r\n1.\tAll employees involved in the chlorination process will be properly trained. Training will include leak control procedures as well as emergency measures in the event of a leak. \r\n2.\tAll employees who perform work operations around the chlorine storage areas, including but not limited to changing chlorine containers, will be equipped with and trained to use the proper protective gear including air packs. \r\n3.\tAll employees who change chlorine containers will be trained in the use of A and B patch kits for leak repair. \r\n4.\tEmployees will be instructed that if a chlorine leak is uncontrollable,"

The maintenance and inspection program is carried out daily.\r\n\r\n1.3\tGENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE & CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\n\r\n1.3.1\tGENERAL \r\n\r\nWe inform our employees engaged in process operations of the dangers of an accidental release of chlorine in annual safety meetings. During these meeting we also discuss preventative measures, such as evacuation, in order to be prepared for a release.\r\n\r\nLindsay-Strathmore Irrigation District has also conducted an off-site consequence analysis of worst-case and alternative release scenarios for the chlorine process. These are for the purposes of informing the public in the event of an accidental release. The results of the analyses are reported in the body of the program. \r\n\r\n1.3.2\tCHLORINE\r\n\r\nThe chlorination process at the Lindsay-Strathmore Irrigation District facility is an integral part of the overall business and operates for only a few months out of the year. As with the chlorine process management is committed to making sure that employees are made aware of the potential danger of a chlorine leak. \r\n\r\nLindsay-Strathmore Irrigation District personnel monitor the chlorination process. In addition, the process is checked frequently during the operational season by our outside water treatment contractor. This contractor also assists in performing the annual mechanical integrity review of our chlorine equipment. \r\n\r\n1.4\tFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nLindsay-Strathmore Irrigation District has had no"

Under this plan we will call emergency personnel and evacuate the facility.

Many policies and procedures have been implemented to promote overall plant, worker and public safety.

A copy of Resource Compliance's service agreement has been included in this program with the support material.\r\n\r\nFor the future, Lindsay-Strathmore Irrigation District now thinks of the RMP-PSM program as a \"living document\".
