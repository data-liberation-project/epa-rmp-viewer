The Emergency Response Program required under the RMP and PSM Rules must be site-specific and comprehensive, including the following elements: \r\n\r\n\u00bf\tPublic and emergency response agency notification procedures; \r\n\u00bf\tProper first aid and emergency medical treatment; \r\n\u00bf\tEmergency response measures; \r\n\u00bf\tProcedures for inspecting, testing, and maintaining emergency response equipment; \r\n\u00bf\tEmployee training; and \r\n\u00bf\tProgram review procedures. \r\n\r\nThe Mermentau Facility maintains written Emergency Shutdown and Startup Procedures (ESSP) that provide guidance for emergencies expected at the Facility.

Therefore, this Facility is subject to the Risk Management Plan (RMP) requirements codified in Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations Part 68 (40 CFR 68) administered by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). \r\n\r\nThe Mermentau Facility is also subject to Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (29 CFR 1910.119) and public receptors are located within the worst-case release scenario for the plant. Therefore, the Mermentau Facility is subject to Prevention Program 3 requirements as stated in 40 CFR 68.10. OSHA's PSM standard closely parallels requirements outlined in USEPA's RMP Rule. All elements required by USEPA's 40 CFR 68 - Program 3 Prevention Program are also required by OSHA's PSM. \r\n\r\nThe Mermentau Facility has not had an accidental release of a regulated substance where exposure to the substance, its reaction products, overpressure generated by an explosion involving the substance, or radiant heat generated by a fire involving the substance led to any off-site death, injury, or response or restoration activities for an exposure of an environmental receptor.  \r\n\r\nThe Mermentau Facility does not have permanent full-time employees on-site.  \r\n\r\nThe Mermentau Facility was taken out of service in 2008 and placed back into service in March 2010.

      "SummaryText": "ing of flammable materials, and reducing subsequent risk to the surrounding community, employees, and the environment.    \r\n\r\nThe Mermentau Facility has procedures in place, including both on-site activities and coordination with off-site responders that are to be followed in the event of a butane or natural gasoline release.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\r\n\r\nThe Mermentau Facility receives natural gasoline, n-Butane and isobutane via pipeline for storage and subsequent off-loading via barge.  Natural gasoline is not considered an RMP-regulated flammable mixture because it is a National Fire Protection Agency (NFPA) Class 3 flammable based upon the current Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS); however, because the flammable characteristics of natural gasoline vary by batch, Crosstex has chosen to include natural gasoline in the RMP-regulated inventory at the Facility.  Natural gasoline may include the following RMP-regulated flammable substances: ethane, propane, n-butane and n-pentane. The maximum inventory of natural gasoline at the Facility at any given time is 81,103 gallons (473,780 lbs), which is also the largest vessel  for natural gasoline.  \r\n\r\nThe Mermentau Facility also receives n-butane and/or isobutane, which are regulated flammable mixtures.  N-Butane contains n-butane, pentane and isobutane; and isobutane contains isobutane, n-butane and propane. N-butane and/or isobutane are stored interchangeably in one of three pressurized vessels.  The maximum inventory of n-butane or isobutane at the Facility at any given time is 1,928,294 gallons (9,674,626 lbs).  The largest vessel containing either n-butane or isobutane at the Facility is 642,765 gallons (3,224,877 lbs). \r\n\r\nGENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\n\r\nThe Mermentau Facility maintains a consistent accidental release prevention program to eliminate or minimize releases of n-butane, isobutane and natural gasoline.
