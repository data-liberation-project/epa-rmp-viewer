Therefore, this Facility is subject to the Risk Management Plan (RMP) requirements codified in Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations Part 68 (40 CFR 68) administered by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). \n\n\n\nThe Mermentau Facility is also subject to Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (29 CFR 1910.119) and public receptors are located within the worst-case release scenario for the plant. Therefore, the Mermentau Facility is subject to Prevention Program 3 requirements as stated in 40 CFR 68.10. OSHA's PSM standard closely parallels requirements outlined in USEPA's RMP Rule. All elements required by USEPA's 40 CFR 68 - Program 3 Prevention Program are also required by OSHA's PSM. \n\n\n\nThe Mermentau Facility has not had an accidental release of a regulated substance where exposure to the substance, its reaction products, overpressure generated by an explosion involving the substance, or radiant heat generated by a fire involving the substance led to any off-site death, injury, or response or restoration activities for an exposure of an environmental receptor.  \n\n\n\nThe Mermentau Facility does not have permanent full-time employees on-site.  \n\n\n\nThe Mermentau Facility was taken out of service in 2008 and placed back into service in March 2010.  The following information serves to reinstate the Mermentau Facility as an RMP-regulated facility and is a complete RMP recertification.  \n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICIES\n\n\n\nThe Mermentau Facility maintains a policy of safe natural gasoline and butane handling operations, reducing to the greatest extent possible hazards associated with the handl"

Natural gasoline is not considered an RMP-regulated flammable mixture because it is a National Fire Protection Agency (NFPA) Class 3 flammable based upon the current Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS); however, because the flammable characteristics of natural gasoline vary by batch, Crosstex has chosen to include natural gasoline in the RMP-regulated inventory at the Facility.  Natural gasoline may include the following RMP-regulated flammable substances: ethane, propane, n-butane and n-pentane. The maximum inventory of natural gasoline at the Facility at any given time is 81,103 gallons (473,780 lbs), which is also the largest vessel  for natural gasoline.  \n\n\n\nThe Mermentau Facility also receives n-butane and/or isobutane, which are regulated flammable mixtures.  N-Butane contains n-butane, pentane and isobutane; and isobutane contains isobutane, n-butane and propane. N-butane and/or isobutane are stored interchangeably in one of three pressurized vessels.  The maximum inventory of n-butane or isobutane at the Facility at any given time is 1,928,294 gallons (9,674,626 lbs).  The largest vessel containing either n-butane or isobutane at the Facility is 642,765 gallons (3,224,877 lbs). \n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nThe Mermentau Facility maintains a consistent accidental release prevention program to eliminate or minimize releases of n-butane, isobutane and natural gasoline.

      "SummaryText": "Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and the Jennings Fire Department. The Jennings Fire Department is designated as the first responder in the event of n-butane, isobutane and/or natural gasoline release.  For these reasons, the Mermentau Facility meets the exceptions listed in 40 CFR 68.90(b) and therefore the Facility is not required to have the Emergency Response Program as described in 40 CFR 68.95.  \n\n\n\nA site map, MSDSs, and a list of chemicals kept on-site are maintained at the Facility. Complete details on the Emergency Response Program required under the PSM Rules are included in the Mermentau Facility's PSM Plan, which is kept on-site as a separate document.   \n\n\n\nSAFETY IMPROVEMENTS\n\n\n\nCrosstex has a continued commitment to update equipment and improve safety pertaining to the covered process when necessary.  The most recent Process Hazard Analysis for the Facility was completed on November 29-December 1, 2005, at which time several safety improvements were recommended including updating standard operating procedures, and P&IDs.
