      "SummaryText": "ACCIDENT RELEASE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nTexas Pipeline LLC owns and operates a non-fractionating natural gas plant, the Reef Station West Texas Gas Delivery (Reef), in Maverick County, Texas. The facility is designed to process natural gas and recover liquid product from natural gas by physical separation and cryogenic means. Both petroleum condensates and natural gas liquid are recovered from the inlet pipeline gas in this process for offsite sales.\n\nThe Reef facility has a long-standing commitment to workers and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by our efforts in accident prevention, such as training personnel, quality assurance, and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of our process. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, facility trained personnel will evaluate the situation, take actions within the capabilities of the facility, and notify the necessary outside agencies.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nThe Reef facility is located approximately six miles East of Eagle Pass, Texas and operates a variety of processes to produce the following petroleum products:\n\n1. Y grade mixture from natural gas\n2. Condensate\n3. Residue gas\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nTexas Pipeline encourages employees to participate in accident prevention activities such as:\n1. Updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information\n2. Performing necessary calculations for RMP\n3. Maintaining good engineering practices\n4. Participation in monthly safety meetings\nThe Reef facility keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes. These technical documents address the following:\n1. Chemical properties and associated hazards\n2. Maximum intended inventories\n3. Equipment design basis and configuration info"

Sufficient information to assure good engineering practices\nChemical -specific information, including hazard and emergency response/exposure considerations, is provided in material safety data sheet (MSDS). For specific process areas, the facility has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters such as temperatures, level and composition in the operators' procedures manual. The facility maintains the process within these limits by using process controls and monitoring instruments, trained personnel and protective instrument systems such as automated shutdown systems.\nThe facility also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of the process equipment. This information includes materials of construction, design pressures, temperature and electrical ratings. This information, in combination with procedures and equipment operating history, provides a basis for inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to safety features in the process are not compromised.\nOperating Procedures\nThe Reef facility maintains written Operating Procedures of the covered process that address primary operations mandated by manufacturers. These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators. The procedures are maintained current and accurate revising them as necessary by employee's suggestion, compliance audit, and Good Engineering practice. \nCovered Process Operating procedures are readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job task and maintain the covered process unit operating within its safe limits.\nTraining\nReef facility has implemented a training program for all employees involved in operating the covered process.

After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks. After the operator demonstrates adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they are allowed to work independently. In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level. All training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify and demonstrate skills.\nContractors\nReef facility uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities. Because some contractors work on or near Covered Process equipment, the facility has procedures in place to ensure that contractors:\n1. Perform their work in a safe manner\n2. Have the appropriate knowledge and skills\n3. Are aware of the hazards in their workplace\n4. Understand what they should do in the event of an emergency\n5. Understand and follow site safety rules\n6. Inform facility personnel of any hazard that they find during their work\nThis is accomplished by providing contractors with:\n1. A process overview\n2. Information about safety and health hazards\n3. Emergency response plan requirements\n4. Safe work practices before beginning work\nIn addition, Reef facility Management will evaluate the contractor safety program and performance during the selection of a contractor. Facility personnel periodically monitor contractor performance with regard to their safety obligations.\nMechanical Integrity\nThe Reef facility has established practices and procedures for the safe operation of fixed, rotating and emergency shutdown equipment. The basic aspects of the program include, but are not limited to, the following:\n1. Conducting training\n2. Performing inspections and"

Overview of the process\n2. Safety and Health hazards\n3. Applicable maintenance procedures\n4. Emergency response plan\n5. Applicable safe work practices to help ensure that they can perform their jobs in a safe manner.\nWritten and verbal procedures provide that work is performed in a consistent manner and serve as a basis for training. Inspections and tests are performed to help verify that equipment functions as intended and that equipment is within acceptable limits. If a deficiency is identified and the situation presents an immediate safety concern, the deficiency is corrected before placing the equipment back into service. A management of change team will review the use of equipment and determine what action is necessary.\nAn integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance. The Reef facility incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs. This helps to determine that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.\nSafe Work Practices\nThe Reef facility as long-standing safe work practices as mandated by OSHA, EPA, Industrial Standards and Good Engineering Practice in place to help provide employee, public and process safety.\nIncident Investigation\nThe Reef facility promptly investigates all incidents related to a covered process that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in a fire/explosion, property damage, environmental loss or personal injury. The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective action to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.

The prevention program helps prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human errors.\nRelease Containment/Control\n1. Process relief valves that discharge to a flare to capture and incinerate episodic releases\n2. Automated and manual valves to permit isolation of the process\n3. Automated facility shutdown system to shut down facility utilities and automatically operate all automatic valves to their fail-safe position\n4. Curbing or diking to contain liquids releases\n5. Atmospheric relief devices\nRelease Mitigation\n1. Fire suppression and extinguishing system\n2. Trained emergency response personnel\n3.
