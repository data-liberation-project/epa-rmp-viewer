Our customers include the leading manufacturers of high power industrial lasers, medical/scientific lasers and military systems worldwide.  Our eV Division services industry and the medical profession with a wide variety of industrial and medical radiation detection devices from gamma ray to far infrared wavelengths. \n\nAt our headquarters located in Saxonburg, Pennsylvania,  II-VI Incorporated has been a pioneer in the growth of  infrared materials (IR) since 1971.  Today, we are the world's leading producer of Zinc Selenide and Zinc Sulfide materials used in the manufacture of infrared (IR) optical components and systems.   II-VI Incorporated is one of  only three companies in the United States that produces Zinc Selenide.  This process represents a niche business for our company.\n\nThese materials are grown by a chemical  vapor deposition process that requires the  chemical  Hydrogen Selenide as a raw material.   Hydrogen Selenide is a regulated, acutely toxic and flammable substance subject to requirements of 40CFR Part 68 (the Rule) under the Clean Air Section 112(r).  Hydrogen Selenide has a threshold quantity (TQ ) value of 500 pounds.  The maximum daily amount of the chemical stored at the Saxonburg site is less than 6000 pounds.   Therefore, Hydrogen Selenide must  be included in a Risk Management Program for all operations which store, deliver or use this chemical. \n\nHydrogen Selenide is a liquefied gas under its own vapor "

At room temperature and atmospheric pressures, Hydrogen Selenide is a colorless gas.  \n\nThe major Clean Air Act Section 112(r) requirements with which II-VI Incorporated must comply for use of Hydrogen Selenide include:\n\n7 Management System development and documentation\n7 Hazard Assessment for each affected process\n7 Prevention Program completion\n7 Emergency Response Program coordination  and\n7 Risk Management Plan submittal.\n\nIn addition, II-VI Incorporated recognizes its' responsibilities under Section 112(r) (\"the general duty clause\") to handle all Extremely Hazardous Substances safely to prevent an accidental release and to minimize the consequences of any such release.  II-VI follows a prevention program including the use of process safety information, operating procedures, employee training, mechanical integrity, management of change, pre-start up review, incident investigation, compliance audit, \"safe work practices\" and contractor safety programs.  \n\n\nMANAGEMENT SYSTEM\n\nII-VI Incorporated is subject to a number of regulatory laws from numerous agencies due to the complexity of its' operations.  As such, a holistic approach to regulatory program management has been developed.   Management has assigned  Program Administrators  who have expertise in a specific area and/or because a particular regulation mainly applies to one function unit.   This diversified structure is coordinated through a Senior Programs Administrator.  An organization chart has been prepared to identify the responsible personnel and lines of authority for implementing any and all programs.   \n\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT:\n\nThe Hazard Assessment portion of the 112(r) rule requires facility owners or operators to prepare \"worst-case\" and \"alternative\"  release scenarios as appropriate for our operations.

The probability that a worst-case release might occur or the possible causes of such a release are not considered.   The alternative scenario involves an accidental release that is \"more likely\" to occur than the worst-case scenario.  \n\nII-VI Incorporated has carefully reviewed its operations involving Hydrogen Selenide and contracted a credible engineering consulting firm (ENSR) to prepare worst case scenario analysis and alternative scenarios based on the requirements of the 112(r) rule.  In each case, an offsite consequence analysis (OCA) was performed using appropriate air dispersion analysis and modeling techniques. \n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario:\n\n- The worst-case scenario is assumed as a rupture of a single storage cylinder containing 160 pounds of Hydrogen Selenide, and is released over a period of 10 minutes using conservative atmospheric release conditions.   The DEGADIS (DEnse GAs DISpersion) model was selected to determine the maximum possible area potentially impacted by the unlikely worst case scenario.  The modeling distance to the toxic endpoint of  0.00066 mg/l (0.2 ppm) was determined to be 3.0 miles.   Due to strict adherence to proper cylinder testing, transport and handling procedures, this scenario is not considered likely. \n\nAlternative Release Scenario: \n\n- An  alternative \"more likely\" scenario is assumed to be the a release of Hydrogen Selenide from a single \nvertical cylinder equipped with  a low flow device.

This early warning device, emergency shut off systems, established procedures and trained operators serve to reduce the probability of  even the \"more likely\" accident from occurring.  \n\n \nPREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nII-VI Incorporated continuously works to ensure that all regulated substances are safely stored, used and handled.  If a chemical release were to occur, the Prevention Program  is to ensure that procedures and equipment are established to detect and mitigate the impact of such a release.  II-VI Incorporated is governed by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)  Process Safety Management (PSM)  requirements \n\nEmployee Participation is considered critical to our  prevention program.   Employee representation and active participation is evident in the writing of operating procedures, process hazard analysis, pre-start up reviews as well as other elements of the process safety management elements.  \n\nThe II-VI program provides that Process Safety Information be compiled for all operations prior to conducting any process hazard analysis as required by the Rule.  This information serves as the basis for employee awareness and training on safely operating our processes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA).  A written PHA system has been developed which provides that PHAs be developed and implemented, as appropriate.  Under the program, PHA teams consisting of engineering, knowledgeable staff and employee representatives work to identify, assess and control the hazards involved in our processes.

Normal, shut-down and emergency shut down procedures are readily accessible to all operators.\n\nTraining:  All operators are trained on procedures and safe work practices for our operations.  Verification of operator training is confirmed by oral testing, by demonstration and observation.\n\nMechanical Integrity:  Process maintenance activities, inspection and testing of critical equipment is performed.  Further, mechanical integrity checks are incorporated into operating procedures to confirm operations are within safe operating conditions prior to proceeding.   The department maintains a maintenance group experienced in maintaining the process equipment and trained operators to ensure our systems integrity.\n\nManagement of Change procedures have been developed and implemented.
