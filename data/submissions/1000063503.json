      "SummaryText": "Elanco, a division of Eli Lilly and Company (Lilly), a global research-based pharmaceutical corporation, is a world leader in developing products and services that enhance animal health, wellness and performance.  Elanco manufactures animal health products at its Clinton Laboratories facility (Clinton Laboratories).  Clinton Laboratories is located approximately five miles north of Clinton, Indiana.  Operations at Clinton Laboratories began in June of 1970.  Clinton Laboratories is located on a 700-acre site.  The plant itself includes 85 buildings on 200 acres.\n\n\n\nThis document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that Clinton Laboratories has designed and implemented, including:\n\n\n\n1. Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies\n\n2. The stationary source and regulated substances handled\n\n3. The general accidental release prevention program and the specific prevention steps\n\n4. Five-year accident history\n\n5. The emergency response program\n\n6.

ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES:\n\n\n\nClinton Laboratories is committed to operating and maintaining all processes in a safe and responsible manner.  This is especially important for those processes using hazardous chemicals. Clinton Laboratories has numerous systems in place to manage these chemicals.  Elanco uses a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to ensure the safety of employees and the public as well as protection of the environment. Clinton Laboratories accidental release prevention programs and contingency planning efforts help effectively manage the hazards that are posed to employees, the public, and the environment by the use of these chemicals.\n\n\n\nClinton Laboratories has a Plant Emergency Response Plan that contains procedures on how to handle emergencies that occur.  The emergency response plan includes procedures for notification of"

A primary goal of the LEPC is to protect local citizens by developing and maintaining a coordinated emergency response plan and working with industry to minimize the impacts of chemical hazards.  Through the LEPC, citizens can obtain information about hazardous substances handled at local facilities and about emergency planning efforts designed to successfully cope with accidents if they occur.  The LEPC maintains a coordinated emergency response plan for the community detailing operational procedures to be followed in the event of an accident involving hazardous materials.  The plan is available for public inspection.\n\n\n\nClinton Laboratories actively supports local community outreach efforts through Community Advisory Panels and neighbor groups.  These panels provide useful feedback from the community and advise Lilly on community issues. Site management and employees are committed to process safety and actively seek opportunities for continuous improvement.\n\n\n\n2. THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED:\n\n\n\nClinton Laboratories is divided into two main functional areas.  Animal Health manufacturing, on the south end of the plant, manufactures feed additives and other animal health products.  Manufacturing activities include fermentation, recovery, finishing, and packaging products onsite for worldwide delivery to customers.  The second functional area, site services, is located primarily in the center of the plant, with other buildings throughout the plant. Services provided include: steam, water, heat transfer media, electricity, and maintenance support. The services area provides support for Animal Health areas.  The facility has a Title V operating permit under the Clean Air Act.\n\n\n\nThe following regulated substances are handled at Clinton Laboratories in quantities above the thr"

THE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND THE SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS: \n\n\n\nClinton Laboratories is subject to Indiana OSHA's Process Safety Management requirements, as well as other Indiana OSHA requirements.  The facility is also subject to regulation by other agencies, including the Indiana Department of Environmental Management and the United States Environmental Protection Agency.\n\n\n\nSpecific prevention programs include conducting pre-startup and design hazard assessments, proactive maintenance programs, routine vessel inspections, emergency response training, safe to work programs, employee and contractor safety programs, and accident investigation programs.\n\n\n\nAs a member of the American Chemistry Council (ACC), Lilly participates in a program known as Responsible Care. The purpose of Responsible Care is to commit companies to performance improvement in health, safety, and environmental quality. The Responsible Care initiative is driven by the following guiding principles: \n\n? To lead in ethical ways that increasingly benefits society, the economy and the environment.  \n\n? To design and develop products that can be manufactured, transported, used and disposed of or recycled safely.   \n\n? To work with customers, carriers, suppliers, distributors and contractors to foster the safe and secure use, transport and disposal of chemicals and provide hazard and risk information that can be accessed and applied in their operations and products.  \n\n? To design and operate facilities in a safe, secure and environmentally sound manner.   \n\n? To instill a culture throughout all levels of the organizations to continually identify, reduce and manage process safety risks.   \n\n? To promote pollution prevention, minimization of waste"

THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM:\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY MANAGEMENT AT CLINTON LABORATORIES\n\nThe Clinton Laboratories Incident Management System is comprehensive.  It includes elements such as:   site emergency response plan, employee protective actions, the emergency management organization, and implementation of a response, post incident procedures and building specific pre-emergency plans.  The plan is executed through a cooperative effort between the site's management support team, full time emergency response teams, local law enforcement, and local emergency management. The on-site emergency response capabilities include full time emergency response teams (described below), fire and spill response equipment, rescue apparatus, ambulance service, and clinic. Regular drills test readiness and help employees practice responses to alarms and incidents.\n\n\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE TEAMS \n\nSite emergency response team members participate in frequent training conducted both internally and externally. In an emergency situation, a member of the plant security staff fulfills the incident commander role. The Incident Commander directs all field response activities and makes regular reports to the management support team as the incident proceeds.  The Incident Commander and Incident Team Leaders direct the specific tactical actions of the emergency response teams, described below.  Approximately 80 employees who hold full time jobs elsewhere on the site make up the emergency response teams.  Most of the employees are cross-trained on more than one team.  A brief description of the teams follows.\n\n\n\nFIRE BRIGADE/HAZARDOUS MATERIAL (HAZMAT) TEAM\n\nThis is a combined team of both fire fighting and hazardous material spill response.\n\nThe fire brigade is a structural fire fighting organization trained to respond to industrial fires and are trained to the Indiana state mandat"
