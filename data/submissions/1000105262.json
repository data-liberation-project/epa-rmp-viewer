This commitment is integral to the effectiveness of the facility-specific programs and policies developed to prevent an accidental release of hazardous materials. The prevention of accidental releases has been provided by developing and implementing design and installation specifications, operating procedures, maintenance programs, employee training, and continuous improvement practices.\n\nAn accidental release prevention program intends to prevent a highly hazardous chemical incident or minimize the potential consequences of an accidental release. In a highly hazardous chemical incident or accidental release, employees, visitors, and contractors are trained to act following the facility-specific Emergency Action Plan (EAP).\n\nThe Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nReddy Ice-Athens (324), located at 15960 Shaw Road, Athens, Alabama 35611, is a packaged ice manufacturing and storage facility. The Risk Management Program (RMP) regulated substance for this facility is anhydrous ammonia (ammonia), which is utilized as a refrigerant for the closed-circuit mechanical refrigeration system. Ammonia, when properly used, has proven to be a safe, reliable, and efficient refrigerant, although, because of moderate toxicity and slight flammability, ammonia is considered a highly hazardous chemical. The closed-circuit ammonia refrigeration system provides process cooling for product manufacturing and refrigerated warehouse storage to maintain product quality.\n\nDue to the operating inventories of the ammonia refrigeration system, this facility is covered under Program Level Three [3] requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s (EPA) RMP regulation.\n\nThe Worst-Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative-Case Release Scenario(s)\n\nReddy Ice LLC has conducted a comprehens"
