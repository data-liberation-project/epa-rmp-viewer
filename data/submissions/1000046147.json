If an emergency were to occur, it is the Facility's policy to contact the Harristown Fire Protection District and the Macon County Emergency Management Agency, as appropriate, through the 911 Service.  Medical emergencies will require notification of Decatur Ambulance. The primary hospital response is provided through Decatur Memorial Hospital.  The Facility currently maintains a trained incipient stage fire response and first responder-operations level hazardous materials response team to respond to the initial stages of an emergency.\r\n\r\nThe Buckeye Terminals, LLC - Harristown Terminal Butane Blending System is a refined product storage and truck distribution facility, including the butane blending system (direct injection into the gasoline load rack and pipeline).  The Risk Management Plan covers the butane blending system including two horizontal storage vessels, the associated piping, two injection skids, sample analyzers along with gasoline fast loops, and two truck offloading points.\r\n\r\nThe Worst Case and Alternate Case release scenarios were evaluated and communicated to the Harristown Fire Protection District.  Additionally, the local Emergency Response Action Plan was updated to reflect the addition of butane.\r\n\r\nThe Buckeye Terminals, LLC - Harristown Terminal Butane Blending System complies with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Accident Prevention Rules (40 CFR Part 68 Subpart D- Program Level 3).

The Facility's Emergency Response Action Plan is coordinated with the Harristown Fire Protection District and the Macon County Emergency Management Agency.  The Harristown Fire Protection District is aware of the Facility's butane blending system, its safety systems, access points, and protective procedures in the event of a significant release.  The Terminal is fully secured with fencing and controlled access in accordance with its site security plan.\r\n\r\nBuckeye continually evaluates the process for opportunities to improve safety.  As such, a global operating procedure and maintenance program is being developed.  Also, Buckeye is implementing a corporate-wide policy to include the local first responders in regular exercises and in all 3 year PSM/RMP training cycles."
