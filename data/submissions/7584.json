Anhydrous ammonia is used by AG as a refrigerant in the facility's perishables warehouse.  The maximum quantity of ammonia that can be stored or handled in the perishables warehouse refrigeration system is 25,000 pounds.\n\nWORST CASE & ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS\nA worst case and alternative release scenario are required under the RMP rule for the ammonia process.  These scenarios are documented below.\n\nWORST CASE RELEASE FOR AMMONIA\nFailure of the control pressure receiver (CPR) on the refrigeration system (the largest vessel in the system) when filled to capacity would release 13,385.5 pounds of ammonia.  The CPR is located inside the perishables warehouse.  Based on the requirements of the RMP rule, it is assumed that the CPR fails catastrophically, releasing its entire contents indoors over a 10-minute period.  The release rate is mitigated by the building, according to the procedures documented in Section 4 of the U.S. EPA's Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration.  The release from the building vent is neutrally buoyant and is modeled using the SCREEN3 dispersion model.  Modeling results showed a distance to the toxic endpoint of 140 mg/m3 to be 0.63 miles (1.02 km).\n\nALTERNATIVE RELEASE FOR AMMONIA\nThe alternative release scenario for the ammonia refrigeration process is based on an actual release that occurred February 12, 1999.  In this release, a break in a vapor line carrying a"

      "SummaryText": "mmonia causes an indoor release of 16.0 lbs/min for the first three minutes, and 5.3 lbs/min thereafter.  The release was modeled using the SCREEN3 dispersion model.  To provide a conservative estimate, however, no mitigation from the building was considered to reduce the release rate.  Even without considering mitigation from the building, the maximum concentration of the release was 43.6 mg/m3, at a distance of 16 meters from the perishables building.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM & CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\nAG has a prevention program in place that complies with the requirements of the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) program for prevention of accidental releases of ammonia.  The release prevention program includes all the required elements for PSM, including a management system, process safety information, a process hazard analysis, operating procedures, an operator training program, a mechanical integrity program, management of change procedures, pre-startup review, internal compliance audits, incident investigations, employee participation, and contractor safety program. \n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nAn accidental release of ammonia occurred at the facility on February 12, 1999.  No one off-site was injured and no off-site damage occurred as a result of the release.  However, a nearby restaurant was evacuated during the release.

The check valve has been replaced.  \n\nA second accidental release occurred on June 4, 1999.  Four persons on-site incurred minor injuries as a result of the release.  The cause of the incident is still under investigation by AG personnel, and recommendations for changes to the process will be forthcoming.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\nAG maintains a written emergency action plan to safely respon"
