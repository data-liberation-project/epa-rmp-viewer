Freeport Harbor Terminal Risk Management Plan information was presented to the community in Nov.1997.\n\nFacility Description:\nThe BASF Corporation Freeport Harbor Terminal stores Anhydrous Ammonia.  Ammonia is a basic building block chemical and is used in the manufacturing of many common products. The largest users of ammonia are the agricultural fertilizer business.  BASF uses ammonia as a basic raw material in the production of chemicals used to produce fertilizers and a variety of nylon plastics.\nAt the Harbor Terminal, the number of employees is determined by the amount of technicians on shift, daily staff, and other personnel needed to perform tasks (e.g., loading, maintenance, etc.) There are two full time employees, per shift with a total of 4 shifts, performing day to day operations at any given time. The rest is a shared resource.\n \nAccidental Release Prevention Program:\nTo prevent accidental releases, this facility is in compliance with the EPA Risk Management Program, and the OSHA Process Safety Management standard, and has fully implemented the American Chemistry Council's Responsible Care Management System.  \n\nThe ammonia harbor terminal vessel is equipped with automatic shut-off and relief devices have been installed to handle fluctuations in temperature and pressure.  Warning alarms, leak detectors, regular equipment inspections, and pressure monitoring in pipes and vessels provide layers of protection for employees and the community.  In addition, the ammonia terminal storage vessel is a double walled \"tank within a tank\".  This greatly reduces potential for leaks.\n\nFive Year Accident History:\nThis facility has had no accidental releases over the past five years which meet the reporting criteria.\n\nEmergency Response Program:\nEmergency response programs are in place for both"

The Freeport Harbor Terminal plan is coordinated with the Brazoria County Local Emergency Planning Committee to ensure community safety.  Drills are coordinated with the community and the community warning sirens are tested weekly.  In the event of an incident, information is transmitted over a local radio station.  BASF participates in the Industrial CAER program (Community Awareness and Emergency Response), which operates a hotline for communication with the community.  Incident commander training is conducted annually.  Information on emergency health care is incorporated into the emergency plan.  BASF also maintains a corporate-wide Emergency Response Team that is expertly trained in emergency mitigation techniques for transportation and off-site incidents.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:\nFacility processes are routinely changed to improve safety as a result of employee suggestions, process hazard analyses, and incident investigations."
