All employees have been properly trained in what to do in case of this situaion.\n(b)Anhydrous Ammonia is the only regulated substance handled.\n(c)The worst-case scenario is that the tank leaks all the anhydrous out.  Since anhydrous is a gas when \nreleased into the air, it will be up to the local fire department to determine wether or not applying water\nwill dissipate the gas escaping from the tank.  As soon as a rupture occurs, the staff knows to contact the \npolice department and inform them of the situation.\n(d)In the case of an accidental release of anhydrous, it is to be determined by the employee what he/she\ncan do to stop the release.  Nurse tanks may be use to unload the tank, or their is an emergency shutoff \nvalve in the case of a hose blowing off.\n(e) N/A\n(f)At this time, we are working with our insurance company to update the emergency responce program\nand the risk managment plan of the facility.  At this time all employees have been properly trained on\nwhat to do in the case an anhydrous leak of any kind.\n(g)We feel at this time we have taken the necessary safety precautions in avoiding these situations."
