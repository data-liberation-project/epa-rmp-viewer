In the event\nan accidental release should occur, we are prepared to work with our Local Fire Company(s), \nEmergency Response Personnel, and other appropriate authorities deemed applicable depending\non the specific incident, to best mitigate any release and to minimize the impact of the release to\npeople and the environment.\n\nFacility Information:\n\nThe primary activity of our company is NAICS code 422510, \"establishments primarily engaged in operating country or terminal grain elevators\", however we are also engaged  in providing \"agricultural inputs\" that include the receiving, storage, and reloading of Anhydrous Ammonia for delivery to farmers in our area.  The NAICS code we feel most applicable for receiving, storing, and reloading is # 493130 \"farm product warehousing and storage\".  We also include all crop protectants in our planning, training, and maintenance programs, however only the Anhydrous Ammonia facilities will be included in this report.    \n\nAnhydrous Ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application to farm fields\nduring the early spring and fall months.  During the balance of the year little if any product transfer\noccurs .  The maximum quantity stored in pressurized permanent storage vessels at the location described\nis    130,000  Lbs.

Total annual hours for these needs do not meet the 2,080 hour\nrequirement to qualify as a \"full time employee\" on site, however there is always one employee\nin the office/shop within close proximity of the anhydrous storage and we have submitted One as\nan answer to item number 1.11. Our facilities have adequate lighting, and are inspected  at various times of day and night throughout the year.   Time expended for these inspections is not included in our staffing calculation.\n\nWorst-case release scenario:\n\nThe \"worst-case release scenario\" is considered to be the release of the total contents of our\nlargest Anhydrous Ammonia tank.  The maximum quantity released would be   130,000   Lbs.  based on\n85 % tank capacity as limited by design standards.   The distance to the endpoint (point of\ndispersion to 200 ppm) is    4.4  miles based on EPA's RMP -Comp Program (Version 1.06).  Possible\npublic and environmental receptors within the area has been provided to the County LEPC (Local\nEmergency Planning Committee) for their consideration.   \n\nAlternative release scenario:\n\nThere has not been an actual release of Anhydrous Ammonia during the last 5-years at the site. \nWe believe the most likely release would be caused by a break in a transfer hose.  Transfer hoses are\nprotected by manual,  self closing excess flow , and \"pull away\" valves so our alternative release\nscenario is based on the loss of contents from the largest hose used (off loading transportation\nequipment).  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is (Urban) 0.06 \nmiles  (317 feet) rounded to 0.1 mile (528 feet) per instructions by EPA guidance.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Program:\n\nOur Anhydrous Ammonia accidental release program is based on guidelines found in the\nAmerican National Standards In"
