The PSM program serves as the RMP Prevention Program at EKAE. All elements of the PSM program contribute to the safe management and use of anhydrous ammonia and denaturant.\n\nEKAE has implemented various training programs and will ensure that all relevant persons are properly trained on the storage and use of regulated substances and the emergency response plans of the facility. EKAE will seek out the latest safe work practices, will provide appropriate personal protective equipment to individuals, and will not hesitate to implement measures to enhance protection systems already in place. \n\nEKAE has not experienced any releases or other incidents related to the anhydrous ammonia or denaturant processes in the last 5 years."

      "SummaryText": "East Kansas Agri-Energy, LLC (EKAE) is a dry-mill ethanol production facility located in Garnett, Anderson County, Kansas. EKAE began operations in June 2005 and is capable of producing up to 35 million gallons of undenatured ethanol per year.\n\nEKAE uses anhydrous ammonia to control pH and provide nutrients to the yeast which produce ethanol. Anhydrous ammonia is delivered to the facility via truck and is stored as a liquid under pressure in an 18,000-gallon tank. The maximum intended inventory is 14,400 gallons, or about 74,000 pounds. \n\nEKAE uses natural gasoline as a denaturant to render the final ethanol product unfit for consumption. Denaturant is delivered to the facility via truck and is stored as a liquid in a 100,000 gallon aboveground storage tank. The maximum intended inventory of denaturant is 90,000 gallons, or approximately 560,000 pounds.  The denaturant used by EKAE at the time of the initial RMP submittal contained up to 40 percent pentane and was therefore reported as a regulated substance present in excess of 10,000 pounds.  EKAE currently uses a denaturant that contains hexane, toluene, benzene, cyclohexane, and hydrogen sulfide (less than 1%), none of which are regulated flammable substances under 40 CFR 68. Due to the highly variable nature of EKAE's denaturant supply, it is likely that EKAE may again receive denaturant that contains pentane or other regulated flammables.  Therefore, EKAE is choosing to use Predictive Filing for the denaturant system.  \n\nEKAE stores no other known substances in quantities that exceed threshold storage amounts, or that are listed under 40 CFR 68.\n\nThe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulates facilities which store anhydrous ammonia and pentane in excess of 10,000 pounds as part of its Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions at 40 CFR 68.  EKAE is capable of storing up to 74,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia and 560,000 pounds of denaturant, which may contain pentane; therefore, the anhydrous ammonia an"

      "SummaryText": "d denaturant processes are subject to 40 CFR 68. The U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) also regulates facilities which store anhydrous ammonia and flammable materials in quantities greater than 10,000 pounds under the Process Safety Management (PSM) rule at 29 CFR 1910.119; therefore, EKAE's anhydrous ammonia and denaturant processes also are regulated under the PSM rule.\n\nEKAE is committed to the protection of its employees, the community, and the environment from a release of anhydrous ammonia or denaturant. It is EKAE policy to comply with all applicable federal, state, and local regulations. Senior management supports the safe operation of the facility and has designated responsibility the development, implementation, and integration of RMP elements to the facility Environmental Specialist. All EKAE employees and contractors are trained on the hazards of regulated chemicals, the safe use of the processes, and emergency response procedures related to a release. EKAE maintains a written emergency response program (Integrated Contingency Plan) which was developed and has been shared with emergency response planning agencies. In the event of a release it is EKAE policy to notify the City of Garnett Police and Fire Departments, evacuate all employees from the facility, and provide all requested information to local emergency response personnel in the event that a community evacuation is required. EKAE has worked with emergency response personnel in the community to assess the hazards at the facility and has developed a working relationship with response agencies to ensure an efficient, effective response in the event of a potential incident. EKAE conducts drills and exercises to test facility and agency response to incidents at the facility.\n\nEKAE has implemented a PSM Program which includes the following elements: an employee participation plan; compiled process safety information; use of process hazard analyses; standard operating procedures"
