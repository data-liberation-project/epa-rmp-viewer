At this facility, we store various food products later distributed to our stores.\r\nLike most cold storage warehouses, we use anhydrous\r\nammonia in our refrigeration system. Ammonia is the best refrigerant \r\navailable for our use.  Because of its moderate toxicity and slight flammability, \r\nammonia is considered a hazardous material.\r\n\r\nGiant Eagle is committed to maintaining a safe operation\r\nfor our employees and the surrounding community. Our refrigeration system \r\nobeys our local building and fire codes, as well as industry-consensus codes\r\nand standards where appropriate.  Finally, to comply with requirements of the\r\nOccupational Safety and Health Administration and the United States\r\nEnvironmental Protection Agency, we have a Process Safety Management \r\nprogram to help us operate and maintain the system safely.\r\n\r\nOur priority is to prevent accidental releases of hazardous materials instead of\r\nmerely responding to problems.  Our Process Safety Management program includes\r\nelements addressing:\r\n- Employee Participation: We involve our employees at all appropriate\r\npoints in our program.\r\n- Process Safety Information: We maintain information relating to the\r\nsafety of ammonia and the refrigeration system design so\r\nthat our employees are fully informed.\r\n- Process Hazards Analysis: We conduct detailed studies of our\r\nrefrigeration system to identify the\r\nimportant hazards and safeguards.\r\n- Operating Procedures: We provide written operating procedures to\r\nhelp our staff stay within the safe operating limits of the\r\nrefrigeration equipment.\r\n- Mechanical Integrity (Maintenance and Quality Control): We have established a\r\ncomprehensive program of inspections and preventive maintenance to\r\nkeep mechanical failures from occurring.\r\n- Training: We train our mechanics in safe operation and maintenance\r\nof the refrigeration system.\r\n- Management of Change: Alterations to the refrigeration system are\r\ns"
