The facility includes compressor engines,amine units, cryo units, oil heaters, various engine oil tanks, condensate tanks, slop oil tanks, water tanks, various chemical tanks, flare, truck loading areas, piping and valves.  The incoming gas enters the plant and and route through the inlet separation.  The liquids from the inlet separator are sent to tanks for eventual shipment offsite via tank truck.  The gas is sent to the amine units for carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulfide removal.  The treated gas is then routed to the cryogenic plant to recover the natural gas liquids and sent to the pressurized bullet tanks for storage.  Section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act applies to North Louisiana Gas Plant because the plant handles and stores a mixture of methane, ethane, propane, butane, isobutane, pentane, and isopentane in excess of threshold quantities. Two requirements of this section specifically apply to operations at the plant: \n\n\n\n1. Purpose and General Duty Clause - The essence of the general duty clause is that an owner/operator that stores and uses hazardous chemicals in any quantity has a fundamental obligation to ensure a safe operation and to have plans in place in the event of an accident to appropriately manage the situation. Black Bear is committed to ensuring the safe operation of the North Louisiana Gas Plant, as well as all of its other operations, to ensure a safe workplace for our employees and a safe location for our neighbors in the community. Black Bear has procedures in place to prevent accidents and is committed to emergency preparedness both for our facility and community-wide by coordinating with the DeSoto Parish Fire Department.\n\n\n\n2. Risk Management Plan - The North Louisiana Gas Plant processes natural gas, recovers natural gas liquids and produces pipeline quality natural gas. This process involves the ha"

Black Bear management has been very aware of the potential hazards posed by the handling and storage of natural gas liquids. Programs have been established to prevent any accidental releases and to train personnel for emergency response in the event of a release.  These programs are documented and described in this Risk Management Plan.\n\n\n\nFor planning purposes, Black Bear has considered the impact of a worst case accident, defined to be the destruction of the a NGL pressurized bullet tank resulting in the instantaneous formation of a vapor cloud which explodes. Using the EPA's OCA Guidance Reference Tables and Equations, a potential radius of impact due to the explosion was calculated. Demographic information indicates that zero residences, one dilapidated barn, one cemetery and ten industrial sites are located within the radius. However, it should be noted that the probability of the worst-case catastrophic event evaluated in this report is extremely remote - far less than natural catastrophes such as tornadoes and floods that could produce much more severe and extensive damage and injury. A consideration of the radius has been incorporated into our notification and emergency response planning.\n\n\n\nBlack Bear also considered the impact of a more likely release. This alternative release is characterized as an accident during loading of liquids from a truck into one of the bullet storage tanks at the site. If the truck driver failed to disconnect the transfer hose prior to departure, upstream piping and equipment could potentially be damaged, resulting in a release of a mixture of natural gas liquids under pressure. The duration of this release is based on the time needed to close the valves. Using EPA's OCA guidance, the impact distance of a potential explosion of the vapor cloud formed after this release was calculated. Zero residences, one dilapidated barn and two industrial sites are located within this rad"

Black Bear has active operating, maintenance, training and inspection procedures. Black Bear provides annual emergency response training to its employees. In addition, Black Bear has coordinated with local emergency responders including the DeSoto Parish Fire Department.\n\n\n\nBlack Bear management is committed to the following:\n\nPreventing accidents;\n\nTraining our employees in correct response procedures in the event of an accident;\n\nParticipating in community emergency preparedness;\n\nAddressing any citizen concerns by fully explaining potential hazards associated with Black Bear operations and all steps being taken to prevent and mitigate accidents; and\n\nBeing a good corporate citizen of DeSoto Parish.\n\n\n\nWith these objectives in mind, the Risk Management Plan has been developed to provide information about our management of the risks associated with the natural gas treatment and liquids recovery process. Most important, we stress our commitment to ensuring a safe operation for our employees, our visitors and our community.\n\n"
