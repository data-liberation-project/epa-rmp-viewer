Vandervoort's Dairy is strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety. This commitment is reflected in a comprehensive accidental release prevention program. This program addresses the design, installation, operation, maintenance, and employee training associated with the ammonia refrigeration equipment at Vandervoort's Dairy. \n\n\n\nIt is Vandervoort's Dairy's policy to ensure that controls are in place to limit the risks of potential ammonia releases.  To accomplish the company's goal in controlling accidental losses, the facility has established safety programs that enable plant personnel to: maximize safety performance, reduce risks of handling ammonia and other potentially hazardous substances, and prepare plant personnel to address emergency situations as they might arise.\n\n\n\nThe Vandervoort's Dairy facility draws from decades of internal experience and expertise, as well as resources of The Kroger Company to ensure that the appropriate mitigation measures have been identified and are implemented.  The commitment to safety shows in the minimal accident history at the facility.\n\n\n\nOne of the activities associated with the Plant Safety Program has been the development and implementation of accidental release prevention and emergency response programs which are designed to comply with OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals, 29 CFR 1910.119), and EPA's Risk Management Program (RM program) regulation (Risk Management Programs for Chemical Accidental Release Prevention, 40 CFR Part 68).

The facility in Fort Worth is part of the Kroger Company.  It is a dairy manufacturing plant that produces fluid milk and cultured products, yogurt, and juices.  An ammonia refrigeration system is used to enable the manufacturing and cold storage of food products.\n\n\n\nThe amount of anhydrous ammonia (CAS #7662-41-7) contained in the system is in excess of the regulatory threshold limit of 10,000 pounds.  The maximum inventory in the system is approximately 27,000 pounds.  Since an ammonia release from the system could pose a risk of offsite public and/or environmental impact and the system is regulated under the OSHA PSM standard (29 CFR 1910.119), the system is subject to the Program 3 requirements of the EPA's Risk Management Program.\n\n\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nThe risk management policies and prevention programs consist of the following elements:\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation:  This program involves the employees in establishing and implementing the program.  Employees are also involved when a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) is conducted.  The program also ensures that all employees have complete access to the PSM and RMP policies and procedures.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information:  Written information has been collected which enables the employees to iden"

Recommendations are made by PHA Teams to improve facility safety and to mitigate deficiencies that are identified.  The recent PHA Studies utilized a three-tier approach (What-If, Industry Checklists, and Facility Site Inspection) to ensure a comprehensive evaluation of hazards was conducted.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures:  Written, detailed procedures have been developed which describe the steps that should be followed to safely operate the ammonia refrigeration system.  These operating procedures include safety and health hazards, appropriate personal protective equipment, detailed steps for operating each ammonia refrigeration component, etc.\n\n\n\nTraining:  A training program has been developed which ensures that employees are trained on all aspects of the system and on the duties which they should perform to ensure the safe operation of the ammonia refrigeration process.  Initial and refresher training is provided to all employees who are assigned responsibilities associated with the ammonia system.\n\n\n\nContractors:  All contractors are screened and evaluated before they perform work on or near the ammonia refrigeration system.  The contractors are also periodically evaluated to ensure that they perform work by following safe work practices.\n\n\n\nPre-Startup Safety Review:  A pre-startup safety review is conducted for all new ammonia projects to verify that all safety programs are in place, training has been performed, and construction has been completed"

Manufacturer's maintenance recommendations, industry standards, and company operating history were referenced in the development of the tasks and frequencies that comprise the maintenance program.\n\n\n\nHot Work Permit:  These procedures ensure that a signed Hot Work Permit is obtained prior to any cutting, welding, or burning that is planned to be conducted on or near ammonia equipment and/or piping.\n\n\n\nManagement of Change:  Procedures are designed to ensure that all changes made to the design of the ammonia refrigeration system are properly reviewed and managed.  Updates are made as needed to the various elements of the facility's PSM/RMP programs such as Process Safety Information, Mechanical Integrity, and Operating Procedures to ensure all elements remain current.\n\n\n\nIncident Investigation:  The procedures to investigate incidents are formalized and require documentation by facility personnel including details of the cause(s) of the ammonia incident / near miss, identification of corrective actions to be taken to prevent similar future occurrences, all of which are backed up by the details of the event.  Recommendations for improvements are tracked to resolution.\n\n\n\nCompliance Audits:  There are procedures to conduct Compliance Audits of the PSM/RMP prevention program elements to ensure that the program is in place and functioning properly.
