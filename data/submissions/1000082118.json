Catlettsburg Refining, LLC's policy is to conduct activities so as to protect and promote the health and safety of its employees, customers, and others who may be affected by these activities, and to limit adverse effects on the physical environment in which its activities are carried out. As part of this policy, Catlettsburg Refining, LLC has established systems to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility. One part of these systems is a Risk Management Program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at Catlettsburg Refining, LLC and that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) rule 40 CFR part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule). One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to resubmit its risk management plan (RMPlan) describing the Risk Management Program at Catlettsburg Refining, LLC every five (5) years, within 6 months of the startup of a unit requiring a revised PHA due to process changes, or prior to introducing a hazardous chemical in a new unit. This document is intended to satisfy the RMPlan Executive Summary requirements of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program at Catlettsburg Refining, LLC.\n\n\n\nOn October 1, 2017, Catlettsburg Refining, LLC transferred ownership of certain logistics assets to a separate operating company, Catlettsburg Refining Logistics LLC.

Key to this commitment is the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances in and around the refinery. Catlettsburg Refining, LLC utilizes engineering controls, inspection programs, and detailed procedures as means to prevent accidental releases. In the event of a release, the refinery has a well-trained emergency response team to contain, mitigate, monitor, and stop the release. The refinery has fully staffed and trained emergency response teams for firefighting (Fire and Rescue Squad), medical emergencies, oil spill response (Oil Spill Response Team), ambient air monitoring (Air Monitoring Team), and ICS (Incident Command) coordination.

These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information. Specific departments within Catlettsburg Refining, LLC are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information. A table summarizing the reference documents and their locations is readily available as part of the written employee participation plan to help employees locate any necessary process safety information. \n\n\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations is provided in safety data sheets (SDSs). This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals. For specific process areas, Catlettsburg Refining, LLC has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, pressure, level, composition) in a Not-To-Exceed Limits Document. Catlettsburg Refining, LLC ensures that the process is maintained within these limits by using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrumentation systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).

Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage those hazards. Catlettsburg Refining, LLC primarily uses the Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations. HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques available. Checklists are utilized to evaluate Human Factors and Facility Siting. The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise and a trained team leader. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes recommendations for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary. The PHA team recommendations are forwarded to local management for resolution. Implementation of safety improvements in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team. They ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive prompt attention. All approved safety improvements being implemented in response to PHA team recommendations are tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each recommendation is documented and retained. To help ensure that the controls put in place originally and those added as a result of the HAZOP do not eventually deviate significantly from the original safety intent, Catlettsburg Refining, LLC periodically updates and revalidates the PHA results.
