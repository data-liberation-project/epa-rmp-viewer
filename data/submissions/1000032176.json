These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\r\n\r\nEmployee Participation\r\nSysco South RDC believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.  Company employees are encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  In addition, our employees have access to all information collected as part of the facility's compliance with the RMP Rule including information resulting from process hazard analyses.\r\n\r\nContractors\r\nOn occasion, our company hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities.

Anhydrous ammonia is the only regulated substance present at the Alachua, Florida facility.  The entire ammonia inventory is attributed to its use as a refrigerant.\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies \r\nSysco South RDC is committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  Our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, and maintenance demonstrates this commitment, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, our highly trained refrigeration personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  We are also completely coordinated with Alachua Fire Department which provides additional emergency response expertise.\r\n\r\nWorst Case Release Scenario and the Alternative Release Scenario\r\nWorst case and alternate release scenarios were developed using the methodology given in the EPA's Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration.  The details of the chosen scenarios are located within the Risk Management Program that is located on site.\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Program\r\nSysco South RDC has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR Part 68 of the EPA.  In addition, our facility is subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119.
