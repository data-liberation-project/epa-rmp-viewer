              "Description": "LBC Houston is a public bulk liquid storage and transfer facility for chemicals, oils, and petroleum products.  Regulated toxics and flammable liquids are stored in atmospheric tanks.  Some products are stored in atmospheric tanks with refrigeration for product quality and vapor pressure requirements.  Storage tanks and associated equipment are constructed to API, ASME, NFPA, and ANSI standards.  Mechanical integrity inspections and other inspections are performed periodically as per the standard(s).  MSDS's are required prior to product arrival and storage for a comprehensive review.  The review includes equipments requirements specific to the product, storage tank availability, permit and emission control requirements, and any product specific handling requirements.  All storage tanks are calibrated and a \"safe fill\" level is determined for maximum inventory.  All electrical equipment meet applicable electrical codes for flammable service, as required.  Basic operating procedures are maintained, although some products have product specific procedures.  A preventive maintenance program is maintained to provide equipment integrity and safe operating conditions.  A comprehensive training program is maintained.  The training includes but is not limited to HAZCOM, DOT, HAZWOPER, Confined Space Entry, PPE, Basic First Aid/CPR, Emergency Response, PPE, etc..",

A mechanical integrity program is maintained and other inspections are performed periodically as per the standard.  MSDS's are required for product storage and a review is performed prior to product arrival and storage.  This review includes equipment specifications, storage tank availability, allowable maximum inventory, product and mechanical compatibility, emission control, PPE, and any product or customer specfic handling requirements.  All storage tanks are calibrated and a \"safe fill\" level is determined as the maximum inventory.  All electrical equipment meet electrical codes for flammable service, as required.  A hazard review is performed for regulated toxics and flammables using the safety information and storage tank equipment.  Basic opertating procedures are maintained, although some products require additional have product specific procedures.  A preventative maintenance program is developed and maintained to maintain equipment integrity.  A comprehensive training program is maintained.

We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees, our neighbors, and protection of the environment.  This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities at LBC Houston, up to and including:\n*  A description of our facility and the storage and transfer of chemicals;\n*  Accidental release prevention program;\n*  Five year accidental release of regulated chemicals;\n*  Emergency Response Program; and\n*  Planned and implemented improvements to help prevent accidental releases of hazardous chemicals.\n \nSTATIONARY SOURCE\n \nLBC Houston is a public bulk liquid storage and transfer facility.  We are not a manufacturing or processing plant.  Chemicals, oils, and petroleum products are stored and transferred via tank trucks, rail cars, barges,pipelines and ships.  There is a number of regulated toxic and flammable chemicals which we are permitted (facility air permit based on health effects) to store but do not presently have on site.  Therefore, we are using predictive filing to include some regulated chemicals that are not currently handled on site but could be in the future.  A majority of the regulated flammable chemicals are covered by OSHA's Process Safety Management regulations.\n \nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n \nOur accidental release prevention program is a systematic, proactive approach to preventing accidental releases of hazardous chemicals.  Our management system addresses each of the key features of successful prevention programs, including:\n\n*  Process safety information.\n*  Process hazard analysis.\n*  Pre-startup review.\n*  Employee participation.\n*  Mechanical integrity.\n*  Operating procedures.\n* "

Our program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting employees, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.  We coordinate our plan with the Southeast Regional LEPC community response plan.\n\n\nPLANNED AND IMPLEMENTED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n \nThe following is a list of planned and implemented improvements to minimize accidental releases, thus improving safety:\n\n*  Maintain current standard operating procedures;\n*  Set minimum standards for equipment used in the storage and transfer of chemicals.\n*  Maintain tank truck and rail car pre-load and post-load inspection criteria.\n*  Improved training programs."
