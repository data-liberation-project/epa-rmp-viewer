The Emergency Action Plan (Plan) is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of the PSM/RMP document which is maintained at the facility.  This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n  1.)  To save lives.\n  2.)  To minimize and avoid injuries.\n  3.)  To protect the environment.\n  4.)  To minimize property damage.\n\nThe operator of the Arctic Glacier facility maintains a safety committee whose members are the designated emergency coordinators for the facility.  The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures, which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year.  This Plan was reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations, as well as to incorporate facility changes. \n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nThe ownership transfer of the ammonia refrigeration system at 2003 South Cherry Avenue in Fresno, California will be completed on December 31, 2007.  The system was constructed in accordance with all applicable federal, state, and local regulations including the Uniform Fire and Mechanical Codes at the time of construction.  The original construction was in 1917, but the refrigeration system was overhauled in 1997 and major modifications are scheduled for early 2008.\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system uses 14,000 pounds of ammonia for ice production and storage. The majority of the system is located in the engine room including vessels and compressors.  The condensers are mounted on the roof, and all of the evaporators are located in their respective cold areas.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe Arctic Glacier ammonia ref"

For example, the facility operates in accordance with Cal/OSHA's Process Safety Management regulation.  The facility conducts preventative maintenance and any necessary minor repairs in house, but an outside contractor is hired for major repairs or maintenance.\n\nThe facility including the ammonia system was designed and constructed in accordance with the Uniform Mechanical Code, which specifically outlines requirements for the safe operation of the ammonia refrigeration system.  These safety features include ammonia sensors in the engine room as well as sensors near the evaporators, and automatic shut down systems.  In addition, the majority of the ammonia is maintained inside the engine room and just outside of the engine room (condensers).  All pressure vessels are equipped with pressure relief valves that are commonly piped to the water diffusion tank.\n\nIn addition to the Uniform Mechanical Code, Arctic Glacier has developed a preventive maintenance program that utilizes the services of a professional refrigeration contractor to complete regularly scheduled inspections and tests of the ammonia refrigeration system as well as repairs as needed to process equipment.  \n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe facility ownership will be complete on December 31, 2007; therefore, there is no accident history to report.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe Arctic Glacier facility has an emergency action plan in effect.

The operator of the facility plans to coordinate emergency response efforts with the fire department on a periodic and ongoing basis.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThe Process Hazards Analysis, including a Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) study and a Facility Inspection, provided mitigation measures to improve safety at the Arctic Glacier facility located at 2003 South Cherry Avenue in Fresno, California.  The Arctic Glacier safety committee is planning to complete several items over the next year, as a continual effort to provide a safe work environment for their employees.  These changes include the following items:\n\n1. Continue to train all employees in the facility Safety Plan/Programs.\n\n2. Continue to have employee involvement in Safety Plan Development.\n\n3. Continue employee involvement through safety team participation.\n\n4. Continue internal and external safety audits/inspections and implement changes as needed."
