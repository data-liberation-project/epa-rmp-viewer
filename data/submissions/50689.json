If a release does occur, however, our trained personnel, in conjunction with trained personnel from the community, will respond to control and contain the release.\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nThe Sinclair Casper Refining Company operates a variety of processes in petroleum refining to product products (gasoline, diesel, kerosene, asphalt, butane, and propane) from raw crude oil.  Most of the processes use heat, catalyst, and pressure to produce the above products from the crude.  \nThe refinery has the following regulated flammables in its processes:\n?    Pentane (C5)\n?    Butane and isomers (C4)\n?    Propane (C3)\n?    Ethane\n?    Methane\nThe refinery also has the following regulated toxics in its processes:\n?    Hydrogen Sulfide (H2S)\n?

Our facility is a petroleum refinery under NAICS code 32411, and must meet the requirements of Program Level 3.\nWe are reporting the following three regulated chemicals in the RMPlan:\n?    Flammable Mixture 1 (Light Gasoline):  This represents the mixture of pentane and lighter hydrocarbons found in the piping and process units, and stored in Natural gasoline tankage.  The volumes of these hydrocarbons vary by day.  The maximum quantity of Flammable Mixture 1 onsite is 14 million pounds.\n?    Flammable Mixture 2 (Mixed Butanes):  This represents a butane/butene mix in storage.  It is listed separately from Flammable Mixture 1 to distinguish the large storage area of the mixed butanes.  The maximum quantity of Flammable Mixture 2 onsite is 5.9 million pounds.\n?    Propane.  The Maximum quantity of propane onsite is 2 million pounds.\nH2S and SO2 in the refinery do not meet threshold levels.  We have four units that process or remove H2S from the processes.  Our total amount does not exceed the RMP threshold quantities for these substances; therefore, we do not trigger RMP.  Prevention and safety programs are in place for all H2S-handling units as part of our Process Safety Management Program.\nIn the past, the Casper Refinery used chlorine to treat water for its boilers and cooling towers.  With the release modeling required under RMP, Sinclair determined that the potential impact of chlorine on the surrounding community was not necessary.  Therefore, we replace chlorine with an alternate, non-gaseous treatment system.  This treatment system is more expensive to operate, yet we felt it was essential to remove chlorine in order to improve the safety of the community and minimize any toxic footprint from our facility.\n5-Year Accident History\nThe Sinclair Casper Refining Company has not had any RMP-defined accide"

For the one RMP process being reported by Sinclair, encompassing the entire refinery, RMP allows us to use OSHA?s PSM standard as our prevention program.  This summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements that are part of the RMP, and describes the system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\nThe elements are as follows:\n?    Employee Participation\n?    Process Safety Information\n?    Process Hazard Analysis\n?    Operating Procedures\n?    Training \n?    Contractors\n?    Pre-Startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\n?    Mechanical Integrity\n?    Safe Work Practices\n?    Management of Change\n?    Incident Investigation\n?    Compliance Audits\n\nEmployee Participation\nThe Sinclair Casper Refining Company encourages and invites employees to participate in every aspect of process safety management and accident prevention.  Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the refinery and addresses each accident prevention program element.\nEmployees have access to all information that is part of the accident prevention program.  Copies of information that is used daily are located in the unit operations buildings for quick access.\nExamples of employee participation include participating in the HAZOP analysis of each unit, updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information for their unit area, and reviewing and being trained on any changes to operational or mechanical inform"

Teams are often comprised of representative from plant management, safety, operations, environmental, maintenance, and engineering.\nProcess Safety Information\nThe Sinclair Casper Refining Company keeps technical and safety documentation for each unit that falls under the PSM standard.  This information helps ensure and maintain safe operation for the processes.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis and configuration information.\nThe Safety, Engineering, and Maintenance departments are assigned responsibility within the plant to keep process safety information updated.  A table summarizing the reference documents and their location is readily available as part of the file in the Technical Manager?s office in the main building.  Duplicate copies of critical information are included onsite in each control room.\nChemical-Specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDSs).  This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  For specific process areas, the refinery has documented safety-related limits for specific parameters (e.g., temperature, pressure, level, flow) used in monitoring and controlling operations.  The refinery ensures that the process its maintained within these parameters using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems.\nThe refinery also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of the equipment.

Each process unit is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage those hazards.\nThe Sinclair Casper Refining Company uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  HAZOP is a very systematic and through evaluation of potential hazards in the process unit.  The refinery conducts a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) with a team formed of knowledgeable, trained personnel from safety, maintenance, operations, environmental, engineering, and plant management.  The team evaluates potential process hazards and identified accident prevention and mitigation measures to ensure safe operating and maintenance of the units.  The team makes recommendations about systems, procedures, or practices to put in place to ensure the hazards are managed and mitigated.\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to local and corporate management for review and resolution.  Implementation of systems, procedures, and practices are based on a determination of risk with the items.  All approved mitigation options being implemented in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are complete.

Our facility is a petroleum refinery under NAICS code 32411, and must meet the requirements of Program Level 3.\n\nWe are reporting the following three regulated chemicals in the RMPlan:\n\n* Flammable Mixture 1 (Light Gasoline):  This represents the mixture of pentane and lighter hydrocarbons found in the piping and process units, and stored in Natural gasoline tankage.  The volumes of these hydrocarbons vary by day.  The maximum quantity of Flammable Mixture 1 onsite is 14 million pounds.\n\n* Flammable Mixture 2 (Mixed Butanes):  This represents a butane/butene mix in storage.  It is listed separately from Flammable Mixture 1 to distinguish the large storage area of the mixed butanes.  The maximum quantity of Flammable Mixture 2 onsite is 5.9 million pounds.\n\n* Propane.  The Maximum quantity of propane onsite is 2 million pounds.\n\nH2S and SO2 in the refinery do not meet threshold levels.  We have four units that process or remove H2S from the processes.  Our total amount does not exceed the RMP threshold quantities for these substances; therefore, we do not trigger RMP.  Prevention and safety programs are in place for all H2S-handling units as part of our Process Safety Management Program.\n\nIn the past, the Casper Refinery used chlorine to treat water for its boilers and cooling towers.  With the release modeling required under RMP, Sinclair determined that the potential impact of chlorine on the surrounding community was not necessary.  Therefore, we replace chlorine with an alternate, non-gaseous treatment system.  This treatment system is more expensive to operate, yet we felt it was essential to remove chlorine in order to improve the safety of the community and minimize any toxic footprint from our facility.\n\n5-Year Accident History\n\nThe Sinclair Casper Refining Company has not had any RMP-defined accidents.

The accident prevention program summarized above is applied to our Program Level 3 RMP-covered process.  The prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human errors.\n\nIn addition to the accident prevention program, Sinclair has safety features on many units to help contain/control releases, detect releases, and reduce the consequences of a release.  The following types of safety features are used in various process units:\n\nRelease detection\n\n* Hydrocarbon detectors with alarms\n\n* H2S detectors with alarms\n\nRelease Containment and Control\n\n* Process relief valves that discharge to a monitored flare system.  The flares capture and incinerate episodic release\n\n* Valves to permit isolation of the process (manual and automated)\n\n* Automated shutdown systems for specific process parameters (e.g., high or low temperature, levels, pressures, etc.)\n\n* Alarms for specific process parameters\n\n* Vessels to remove process inventory in the event or a release (tank storage, bypass systems)\n\n* Concrete curbing to contain liquid release to unit areas only\n\n* Redundant instrumentation and equipment (spare and backup systems)\n\n* Atmospheric relief valves\n\nRelease Mitigation\n\n* Fire suppression and extinguishing systems\n\n* Deluge system for specific equipment\n\n* Trained emergency response personnel (both refinery personnel and local emergency response personnel)\n\n* Personal protective equipment (e.g., protective clothing, self-contained breathing, bunker gear, eye-wash systems, etc.)\n\nIf a release does occur, these release prevention systems help Sinclair Casper Refining Company contain and control the release in a way that minimizes the risk to personnel and the public in the best way possible.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nThe Sinclair Casper Refining Company maintains a written emergency response program to protect wo"
