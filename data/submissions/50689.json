This information helps ensure and maintain safe operation for the processes.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis and configuration information.\nThe Safety, Engineering, and Maintenance departments are assigned responsibility within the plant to keep process safety information updated.

This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  For specific process areas, the refinery has documented safety-related limits for specific parameters (e.g., temperature, pressure, level, flow) used in monitoring and controlling operations.  The refinery ensures that the process its maintained within these parameters using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems.\nThe refinery also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of the equipment.

New operators are paired with senior operators to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  All new operators are tested on what they have learned, both by study and by demonstration.  When operators demonstrate adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they are allowed to work independently.  All operators periodically receive refresher training in operations to ensure that their skills and knowledge are at a proper level.

This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.\nSinclair\u00bfs inspection and testing personnel are certified to the proper standards and have current training certificates on file.  Personnel are certified to API 510, 653, and 570 specifications.\nSafe Work Practices\nThe Sinclair Casper Refining Company has long-standing safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety.  Examples of safe work practices include:\n\u00bf\tControl of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel on refinery property\n\u00bf\tA lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance\n\u00bf\tA procedure for safe removal of hazardous materials before process piping or equipment is opened\n\u00bf\tA permit and procedures to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space\nThese procedures and others, along with training of all affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that our operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\nManagement of Change\nThe Sinclair Casper Refining Company has a comprehensive system to manage changes to processes. This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented.  Changes are reviewed to ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards, and to verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.\nAffected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, equipment information, and procedures are updated to incorporate these changes.  Operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on"

The accident prevention program summarized above is applied to our Program Level 3 RMP-covered process.  The prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human errors.\r\nIn addition to the accident prevention program, Sinclair has safety features on many units to help contain/control releases, detect releases, and reduce the consequences of a release.  The following types of safety features are used in various process units:\r\nRelease detection\r\n* Hydrocarbon detectors with alarms\r\n* H2S detectors with alarms\r\nRelease Containment and Control\r\n* Process relief valves that discharge to a monitored flare system.  The flares capture and incinerate episodic release\r\n* Valves to permit isolation of the process (manual and automated)\r\n* Automated shutdown systems for specific process parameters (e.g., high or low temperature, levels, pressures, etc.)\r\n* Alarms for specific process parameters\r\n* Vessels to remove process inventory in the event or a release (tank storage, bypass systems)\r\n* Concrete curbing to contain liquid release to unit areas only\r\n* Redundant instrumentation and equipment (spare and backup systems)\r\n* Atmospheric relief valves\r\nRelease Mitigation\r\n* Fire suppression and extinguishing systems\r\n* Deluge system for specific equipment\r\n* Trained emergency response personnel (both refinery personnel and local emergency response personnel)\r\n* Personal protective equipment (e.g., protective clothing, self-contained breathing, bunker gear, eye-wash systems, etc.)\r\nIf a release does occur, these release prevention systems help Sinclair Casper Refining Company contain and control the release in a way that minimizes the risk to personnel and the public in the best way possible.\r\nEmergency Response Program\r\nThe Sinclair Casper Refining Company maintains a written emergency response program to protect wo"

The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including:\r\n* Proper first-aid and medical treatment for exposures\r\n* Evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation\r\n* Notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs\r\n* Cleanup and decontamination requirements\r\nIn addition, Sinclair has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment, as well as instructions that address the use of emergency response equipment.  \r\nEmployees receive, as part of their initial and ongoing refinery training, instructions and procedures for carrying out their specific emergency response duties.\r\nThe emergency response program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to refinery processes, changes in legal requirements, or refinery policy.  The emergency response program changes are administered through the MOC process, which includes informing and/or training affected personnel in the changes.\r\nThe overall emergency response program for the Sinclair Casper Refinery is coordinated with the Natrona County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  LEPC members include local emergency response officials, local government officials, and industry representatives.  The Sinclair Casper Refinery has periodic meetings with the LEPC, and has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations, including the fire department.  This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.\r\nIn addition to the periodic meetings, the Sinclair Casper Refinery conducts periodic emergency drills that involve the LEPC and"
