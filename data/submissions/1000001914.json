      "SummaryText": "The Harris County WFCID #84 owns and operates a municipal wastewater treatment plant in the Channelview area.  This wastewater treatment plant is responsible for the treatment of the sanitary waste from several surrounding subdivisions, households and small local businesses.  Harris County WCID #84 contracts the operation of this wastewater treatment plant to Municipal District Services, LLC (MDS).  Both Harris County WCIS # 84 and MDS are committed to the safe operation of the wastewater treatment plant.  The wastewater plant utilizes two substances that are listed on the Environmental Protection Agencies (EPA) hazardous substances list.  These two substances are chlorine and sulfur dioxide.  The chlorine is stored in individual one ton cylinders, and no more than two are ever stored on site at one time. The chlorine is used to disinfect the wastewater prior to release from the treatment plant. Sulfur dioxide is stored in 150-pound cylinders and no more then ten are stored on site at one time.  The sulfur dioxide is used to dechlorinate the water prior to release from the treatment plant.  While the quantity of sulfur dioxide is below the threshold levels, it has been included in this plan pro-actively.   As part of the Risk Management plan, both worst case and alternative release scenarios were modeled using an EPA developed and approved dispersion-modeling program.  The worst case scenarios are a complete loss of inventory in a ten-minute period. Typical alternative release scenarios could include a leaking valve or rupture disk.   Regardless of the type of release, the treatment plant is equipped with monitors to detect both chlorine and sulfur dioxide.  These monitors sound locally on the plant and automatically notify the plant manager and operator 24 hours a day of the specifics of the release so that the proper action may be taken.  The facility has had no history of releases of either chlorine or sulfur dioxide.  Harris County WCID #84 has coordinated with"
