              "Description": "Batesville Cold is a cold storage/warhousing facility.  This facility falls under the NAICS Cods 49312.  Our safety information was last reviewed on April 26, 2000 (safety meetings are also conducted every month).  We are subject to the handling codes of the National Fire Protection Association and the American Society of Mechanical Engineers.  These standards, and all applicable OSHA requirements have been implemented here through written manuals with the assistance of Environmental Data Services, Inc.  The most recent hazard review was conducted on November 15, 2000.  Since this is a new system, there were no major hazards identified during the review.  To aid in the prevention of releases, this facility uses standard operating and maintenance procedures for the refrigeration system, vents, relief valves, check valves, manual shutoffs, alarms and procedures, emergency air supply, and grounding equipment.  The operating and training procedures were last reviewed and updated was January 18, 2000 when the facility was expanding.  The refrigeration technicians of Batesville Cold Storage are trained in the classroom and by on-the-job training.  This training is completed by demonstration and observation of working knowledge of the system.  The training programs were last conducted in January of 1998 when Wayne Stewart completed his Certified Refrigeraiton Technicians Course.  Charlie Grant (Batesville Cold maintenance technician) will also complete this course in September of 2000. Other training information was reviewed during a visit by Environemtnal Data Services, Inc. on April 26, 2000.  This visit promted a review of safety, training, operations, etc. at Batesville Cold.  \nEmployees who are trined in the proper operating procedures of the ammonia refrigeration system are knowledgeable in the Operations and Maintenance (O&M) Manual provided by the manufacturer.  Employees follow the start-up procedures to aid in the prevention of accidental releases of anydrous ammonia.    The last review of maintenance procedures was completed when the refrigeration system was undergoing  expansion in 2000.  However, employees perform daily and weekly visual inspections to check for abnormal operating conditions which may cause the release of ammonia from the system.    Different components of the refrigeration system are checked on a daily basis to ensure performance.  Compressors, accumulators, condesors, receivers, cold rooms, alarms, and purgers of the system are checked by use of a list.  This list has several different aspect of each component of the systm.  For instance, the Compressors are chekced for Suction Pressure, Suction Temperature, Discharge Pressure, Discharge Temperature, Oil Pressure, Oil Temperature, etc.  If any items noted on the checklist are not within the recommended operating zones, the maintenance personnel determine the cause and correct the problem, with the assistance of the O&M Manual.  Also, maintnenance personnel conduct preventative maintenance on the system twice per year with the aid of P&H Refrigeration to help prevent releases of anhydrous ammonia due to equipment failure.  The oil is changed in compressors while P&H Refrigeration technicians pull the side plates off all compressors to inspect for wear.  Any work such as changing valves, seals, etc. are performed as needed.  Certified refrigeration technitian (Wayne Stewart) helps to oversee the any maintenance conducted on the system.  P&H Refrigeration is an outside contractor who also helps to ensure the proper installation of system components if needed.\n\nBatesville Cold contracted Environemtnal Data Services, Inc., which triggered a review of our safety information, operating and maintenance procedures and training.  Batesville Cold is a Level 3 Prevention Program Facility, and is implementing Process Safety Management at this location to help in the prevention of accidental releases from this facility.",

This plant expansion increased the anhydrous ammonia usage above the threshold for RMP.  However, we were not required to submit an RMP by the set deadline of June 21, 1999 because we were not above the threshold of 10,000 pounds.\n\nThe same properties that makes anhydrous ammonia valuable as a cold storage chemical, also makes it necessary to observe certain precautions in handling anhydrous ammonia for refrigeration purposes.  Overall, the prevention of unnecessary human exposures, reducing the threat to our own personal helath as well as our co-workers, and reducing the threat to nearby members of the community is the main goal of incorporating this Risk Management Plan into our daily operations.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal and state rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle and use anhydrous ammonia combined in coordination with the operations and maintenance procedures provided by the manufacturer of the ammonia refrigeration system, as well ass the training of our employees.\n\nThe primary purpose of this facility is cold storage/warehousing by refrigerating storage room via ammonia system.  The refrigeration system supplies cooling  and freezer areas throughout the facility.  Anhydrous ammonia is mostly a gas, but is also liquified under pressure in the storage vessel which is lcoated on the roof of the motor room.  This liquid ammonia is condensed and cooled through the utilization of the refrigeration system.  The maximum amount of anhydrous ammonia in the system at any one time is 25,000 pounds.\n\nOur employee (maintenance) conduct proper start-up procedures as listed in the manufacturer's Opertion & Maintenance manual for the refrigeration system.

The maintenance tasks performed are visual inspections conducted daily, visual inspections conducted weekly, preventative maintenance conducted twice per year, as well as yearly preventative maintenance conducted yearly.  Any actual system maintenance (i.e. valve or seal changes) is completed as needed.  The mechanical integrity of the system is completed by keeping a listing of parts recommended by the manufacturer for change-out if and when needed.  P&H Refrigeration is the local refirgeration contractor who helps to insure that all maintenance and system change-out is completed properly.  The refrigeration technician on staff assists in the mechanical integrity and general maintenance up-keep of the system.  The facility has a Process Safety Management Plan which is being incorporated into the daily routine to comply with the Level 3 Prevention Program Requirements.  They also have a Lock-out/Tag-out program, Hazard Communication program, Confined Space Program (if needed), and an Emergency Action Plan to aid in the prevention of accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  These programs, along with the Process Safety Management Program comprise a huge portion of Batesville Cold's prevention portion.\n\nThe emergency response program was developed with the assistance of Environmental Data Services, Inc.  P&H Refrigeration Hazmat Crew,  Batesville Fire Department and the Independence County LEPC will be requested to assist Batesville Cold if a release occurs from this location.  If an anhydrous ammonia release occurs at the 3054 East Main location, employees will notify Maintenance Supervisor (Wayne Stewart) of a release, and personnel will  get organized for an emergency action/response and possible evacuation of the facility and surrounding affected areas.

If this action does not stop/mitigate the release of ammonia, emergency response and evacuation procedures will begin.  This facility utilizes the buddy system to ensure that personnel working at this location are accounted for if evacuation is necessary.  The 911 call should have been made by this time to notify other emergency response agencies (Batesville Fire Dept., and Independence County LEPC)  to assist in the mitigation and evacuation procedures.\n\nThe worst case scenario is the failure of the refrigeration system (storage vessel failure) for anhydrous ammonia.  This would be a release of 25,000 pounds of ammonia gas/vapor into the atmosphere.  Active mitigation was considered for this release, however, in a worst case scenario, all efforts and devices would fail.  This release would result in a distqance to endpoint of 2.5 miles. The area surrounding the location is considered rural based on the low number of obstructions in the immediate area.  The terrain surrounding the facility is hilly, but in the best interests of the cummunity, the worst case scenario determined the area to be rural terrain.  The worst case scenario would impact approximately 3500 persons.  This information was determined by the use of RMP Comp, and Landview III software.\n\nAn alternate release scenario was completed for this facility based on an estimated release which could occur.  This release would be an equipment failure (anhydrous line).  This would be an 1/4 inch anhydrous line on the roof of the facility.  Because the line leak would be located on the roof, the release would last for 20 minutes at 180 psi and at 100 degrees F, with a total anhydrous release of approxinately 720 pounds of anhydrous.
