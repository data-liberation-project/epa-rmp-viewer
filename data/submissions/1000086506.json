This commitment is integral to the effectiveness of the facility-specific programs and policies developed to prevent an accidental release of hazardous materials. The prevention of accidental releases has been provided for through the development and implementation of design and installation specifications, operating procedures, maintenance programs, employee training, and continuous improvement practices.\n\n\n\nAn accidental release prevention program intends to prevent the occurrence of a highly hazardous chemical incident or to minimize the potential consequences of an accidental release. In the event of a highly hazardous chemical incident or accidental release, employees, visitors, and contractors are trained to act following the facility-specific Emergency Action Plan (\"EAP\").\n\n\n\nThe Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nReddy Ice-Houston (312) located at 6004 North Shepherd Drive, Houston, Texas 77091, is a packaged ice manufacturing and storage facility. For this facility, the Risk Management Program (\"RMP\") regulated substance present is anhydrous ammonia (ammonia), which is utilized as a refrigerant for the closed-circuit mechanical refrigeration system. The closed-circuit ammonia refrigeration system provides process cooling for product manufacturing and refrigerated warehouse storage to maintain product quality. Ammonia, when properly used, has proven to be a safe, reliable, and efficient refrigerant, although, because of moderate toxicity and slight flammability, ammonia is considered a highly hazardous chemical.\n\n\n\nDue to the operating inventories of the ammonia refrigeration system, this facility is covered under Program Level Three [3] requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (\"EPA\") RMP regulation.\n\n\n\nThe Worst-Case "
