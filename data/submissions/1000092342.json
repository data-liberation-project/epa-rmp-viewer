      "SummaryText": "The Barry Steam Electric Generating Facility is a 6-unit electric generating facility, including 4 coal fired units (Units 1-2,4-5, Unit 3 was retired effective 8/24/2015) and 2 natural gas fired combined cycle units (Units 6 and 7).\r\n\r\nThe process at this facility subject to the RMP regulations is the ammonia storage and dilution system.  This system is a part of the Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) systems used to control nitrogen oxide emissions generated from burning fossil fuels.  Units 5, 6, and 7 at Plant Barry are equipped with SCR systems--Unit 5 has 2 associated tanks (205,412 lb each- utilizing administrative controls) and there are two tanks for Units 6/7 (80,379 lb each- utilizing administrative controls).  Ammonia is also used in the treatment of the boiler water used in the facility.\r\n\r\nIt is the policy of the facility to provide and maintain safe and healthful working conditions and to implement and adhere to operating practices that will safeguard all employees and result in safe working conditions, and a safe and environmentally safe operation.  The facility has a safety program designed to ensure that the employees' working environment is safe.  This program includes training and instructions.\r\n\r\nThe accidental release prevention program at the Barry Steam Electric Generating Facility is focused on the safe management of anhydrous ammonia used in the ammonia storage and dilution system.  The first step in the prevention program at the plant was the establishment of a management system to assign overall responsibility and responsibility of the individual program elements.  Additional steps include: ensuring the system is designed and modified safely periodically conducting process hazard analyses; ensuring the system is operated and maintained is a safe manner by developing, maintaining and implementing Standard Operating and Preventive Maintenance Procedures; ensuring contractors are qualified and oriented to the site hazards; and conduction pe"
