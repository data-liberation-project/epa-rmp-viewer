      "SummaryText": "Freezer and Dry Storage has only one process that the potential to cause adverse effects on the community. The process uses a chemical called anhydrous ammonia to refrigerate the warehouse. There is at most 14,000 pounds of ammonia onsite at any one time, which is contained in seven tanks. Freezer and Dry Storage is aware of the hazards associated with using ammonia for refrigeration process. The hazard that poses the greatest threat to the community is an ammonia leak. In order to control the hazard, regular inspections of the facility are performed. The engineer on duty performing the inspection fills out an extensive checklist to ensure that the process is operating properly. The Emergency Preparedness section of the Process Safety Management Program includes instructions for what to do in case of an emergency. The program also includes safe work practices that will help reduce the risk associated with using and performing maintenance on large volumes of ammonia.Emergency phone number are included in the program so that first responders can be informed of an emergency 24 hours a day. Freezer and Dry Storage has implemented a Risk Management Plan, which supplements the Process Safety Management Program. The Risk Management Plan contains a worst case scenario and an alternative scenario. The worst case scenario is used to predict the areas of the community that would be effected if the total volume of ammonia was to escape the storage vessels.The alternative scenario is used to predict which areas of the community would be effected if a one half inch diameter leak was to form in the refrigeration system.By predicting what the outcome of these scenarios would be,Freezer and Dry Storage will be more perpared to protect their community if a leak was to occur. Freezer and Dry Storage cares about the safety of the environment, the community,and their employees.Freezer and Dry Storage plans to continue in their effort of operating safely and working in a proactive manner"
