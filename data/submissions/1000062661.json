Due to the potential for toxic vapors to be released upon a spill or release a chemical specific risk management plan is warranted.  Risk Management of this process is controlled by Cormetech procedure CLE-3028 CLEVELAND AMMONIUM HYDROXIDE ENVIRONMENTAL RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN.  Contained within this document are the following aspects pursuant to management of this risk:\n\n\n\n(a)    Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nPrevention of both liquid and vapor releases of ammonium hydroxide and emergency response thereto are governed by procedures within CLE-3028 CLEVELAND AMMONIUM HYDROXIDE ENVIRONMENTAL RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN and Doc. CLE-3015 Cleveland Preparedness Prevention, & Contingency Plan.  The Primary or Secondary Emergency Coordinator will be the immediate point of contact and incident command in such event.  The timing and level of notification for all off-normal events is governed by the Cleveland Operations Escalation Plan \n\n(b)    Stationary Source and regulated substance(s) handled\n\nThe stationary source is an 8000 gallon above ground storage tank located on the north side of the Cormetech manufacturing facility located at 3300 Old Tasso Rd, Cleveland TN.  This tank can contain up to 60,000 lb of ammonia (conc 20% or greater) which exceeds the threshold quantity (20,000 lbs) for this substance under section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act.\n\n(c)    Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nAccidental releases from this stationary source are prevented via maintenance, monitoring, employee training and supervised material transfers.\n\n(d)    5-Year Accident History\n\nNo accidental spills or releases have occurred with this stationary source in the prior 5 years.\n\n(e)    Emergency Response Program\n\nA trained onsite Hazardous Material Response Team under the direction of the Emergency Coordinator will respond to small "

      "SummaryText": "ammonium hydroxide spills deemed within facility capability by the Emergency Coordinator.  Spills deemed beyond the facility capability or likely affecting public receptors will be assisted by external services as described herein.\n\n(f)    Planned changes to improve safety\n\nAll labels on Ammonium Hydroxide Tank will be changed to read '29% Ammonium Hydroxide'.  The current labels 'Ammonia' and 'Ammonium Hydroxide' increase the risk that the incorrect strength of ammonium hydroxide could be mistakenly loaded into tank.  \n\n(g)    Offsite consequence analysis\n\nThe offsite consequence for worst-case scenario could result in a toxic endpoint distance of 0.7 miles. More likely alternative scenarios would likely result in toxic endpoints less than 528 feet.\n\n"
