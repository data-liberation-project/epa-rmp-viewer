This facility has the equipment, the procedures and the training to ensure that a gas release impacting off-site areas will not occur.  They are described in the Prevention Program section of this Executive Summary.     \n\nDESCRIPTION OF WORST-CASE AND ALTERNATIVE CASE SCENARIOS\n\nWorst-Case Scenario\n\nRemoved\n\nAlternative case scenarios\n\nRemoved                                                                                                                                                                                           \n      \nACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere have been no accidents in the last five years at this site involving RMP regulated processes. \n\nPREVENTION PROGRAM and EMERGENCY RESPONSE\n\nThere are numerous safeguards at this facility.  First and foremost is the construction of the tanks and cylinders.. The National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) Codes and the Compressed Gas Association (CGA) guidelines mandate the way in which these tanks and cylinders are constructed and used. The tanks and cylinders are designed to withstand extremes of operation and overpressure conditions that make either catastrophic failure or routine leaks extremely unlikely.  \n\nThis facility is also equipped with mitigation equipment if a leak should occur.  There are scrubbers to capture emissions from failed, damaged or leaking equipment.   Monitors and shutoffs are also present. \n\nThis facility has procedures in place at this facility to ensure leaks do not occur, or to mitigate a leak if it does occur.  The tank, tank area, lines, valves,  pumps, and storage areas are routinely inspected. There are trained, experienced operators who have the required knowledge, skills and abilities to safely carry out t"

The operators average over 4-25 years of experience at this facility on these processes.\n\nThe Emergency Response Plan at this facility includes notification of local agencies and medical providers.  Employees have been trained and drilled in emergency response.  There is an Emergency Response Team on site that has been trained in accordance with OSHA 29 CFR 1910.120 (Q)(6)(iii).  They have access to the necessary equipment and training to quickly respond to an emergency release.   \n\nPLANNED UPGRADES\n\nThe facility is currently involved in improving the current infrastructure."
