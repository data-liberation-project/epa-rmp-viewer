This is accomplished by developing site specific programs that address EHS issues.  These issues are addressed in management accountabilities to assure their effectiveness.  The environmental department and safety department are examples of this commitment.\n\n\n\nRegulated substances handled.\n\nLa Porte is part of the Specialty Chemicals Strategic Business Unit of PPG Industries, Inc..  La Porte produces alkyl chloroformates, organic acid chlorides, blocked amino acids, both phosgene and non-phosgene based pharmaceutical intermediates and bulk active compounds, and various single use specialty chemicals.  The facility produces or stores chlorine, phosgene, methyl chloroformate, iso-propyl chloroformate, and n-propyl chloroformate.   \n\n\n\nGeneral accidental release prevention program and chemical specific prevention steps.\n\nLa Porte complies with OSHA's Process Safety Management Rule (29 CFR 1910.119), Texas and applicable EPA Regulations, and Department of Transportation Requirements.  The facility is ISO 9000, 2000 certified. \n\n\n\nThe facility has installed multi-point gas release detectors in the various production units and a fenceline gas release detection network. This network has been upgraded and will be operational before the end of the year, 2004.  In addition, the site monitors more than 20,000 connections each quarter to detect fugitive emission sources and the phosgene header is monitored on a monthly basis.\n\n\n\nTrained personnel and environment, health and safety measures are included in all phases of the La Porte operation.  Detailed engineering and design standards are used.  These standards include national codes and standar"

Every individual in the facility receives appropriate training.  Training may consist of an overview of the plant and safety signals that is given to visitors, a process and hazards overview for contractors before they begin working in a unit, or job-related training or testing for an operator or supervisor prior to assuming their duties. Training is an ongoing process that includes periodic retraining, as necessary.  Safety, environmental, operating, and training procedures are subject to periodic reviews and updates, as appropriate.  Additional systems are in place to review proposed changes and assure that any new training requirements are met.  Another system assures a detailed review for hazards in each operating unit on a prescribed frequency.  Training and updating procedures are monitored with multiple systems.  \n\n\n\nThe La Porte facility has an array of maintenance and inspection programs that minimize the possibility of equipment or piping failures.  Routine inspections of equipment are done in the same manner as the initial quality assurance inspections completed prior to installation.  Equipment inspections utilize procedures such as proof testing, where safeguard systems are forced to function in a controlled manner.  This assures that the safeguards will function if they are ever needed.  Preventive and predictive maintenance programs are utilized including, vibration monitoring, infrared images to detect differences in temperature, inspections by insurance specialists, and root-cause analysis procedures.  Piping is inspected and tested with X-rays and hydrostatic tests prior to installation. The piping is monitored by methods such as visual inspections by the operators or maintenance personnel, emissions monitoring using sophisticated instruments, or thickness measurements b"
