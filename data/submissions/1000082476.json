Our commitment is demonstrated in our facility design, training, operating procedures, and maintenance procedures.\n\n\n\nThe MEGlobal Oyster Creek Facility is an ethylene glycol production facility which handles three regulated substances above the EPA RMP threshold values. These substances are Methane, Ethylene, and Ethylene Oxide.\n\n\n\nMEGlobal evaluated worst case scenarios and alternate release scenarios using EPA RMP*Comp. Although MEGlobal has numerous controls and protective measures in place, we did not consider any mitigation in the calculation of the worst case and alternate case scenarios.\n\n\n\nMEGlobal complies with the accidental release prevention requirements set out in 40 CFR part 68. The elements of the release prevention program in place at our facility include:\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information, including hazards of the chemicals found in our facilities, operating parameters and equipment design, is available and maintained. \n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis studies have been conducted for our facility and for interconnection with related facilities to ensure hazards are identified and appropriate control measures are in place. A variety of processes are used on a regular basis to ensure hazards are identified and addressed in a timely manner.\n\n\n\nOperating procedures are in place, utilized, reviewed and updated to ensure the safe operation of our facilities in various modes of operation including startup, normal operation, shutdown and emergency situations.\n\n\n\nTraining is provided to ensure MEGlobal personnel who are operating our processes have the knowledge and competence required. Systems are in place to maintain competency is maintained and refresher training is provided at established intervals and more often if needed.\n\n\n\nMEGlobal has a detailed program to assess and maintain the mechanical integrity of our equipment including vessels, rotating equipment, p"

These reviews ensure that modifications are complete, suitable and ready for use before they are placed in service.\n\n\n\nMEGlobal undertakes regular self-assessments and audits on a regular basis. These audits are used to determine whether the requirements of the RMP rule are in-place.\n\n\n\nMEGlobal investigates any incident which has or reasonably could have resulted in the release of a regulated substance. These investigations are intended to determine the situation which lead to the incident and determine corrective action to prevent re-occurrence. \n\n\n\nMEGlobal personnel are encouraged and expected to participate in process safety management and incident prevention, to voice concerns and share knowledge. \n\n\n\nMEGlobal hires contractor to perform specialized construction and maintenance activities. Contractors safety performance is evaluated prior to selection, contractors are informed of the known hazards related to the activities the will be performing, and they are informed how to respond in case of a release of a regulated substance.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe MEGlobal Oyster Creek facility is new and therefore has no RMP accident history.\n\n\n\nMEGlobal has developed a written emergency response plan to address accidental releases of hazardous materials which includes notification of the community and coordination with additions resources if needed. The emergency response plan is tested to ensure it can function effectively if needed.\n\n\n\nMEGlobal has systems in place to ensure RMP release "
