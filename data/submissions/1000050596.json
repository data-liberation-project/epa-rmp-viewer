The drums are moved by forklift from the trucks to the warehouse storage area of the facility.  The flammable storage area is protected by a fire monitoring and suppression system.  The warehouse is divided by fire walls and doors to segregate the flammable storage areas from the rest of the warehouse.  The site maintains a strict no smoking policy for the drum movement and storage areas.   The drums are moved by forklift out of the warehouse and onto box trucks at the shipping docks.\r\nFor more information, visit our web site at www.nexeosolutions.com or contact the Plant Manager.\r\n\r\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps:\r\nThis facility is operated in strict accordance with the USEPA prevention program requirements.
