Facility Accidental Release Policy:  The owners, management, and employees of Big Valley Ag Services facility at 954 Highway 99, Gridley, CA  95948 are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of aqua ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.  A detailed emergency response plan has been developed and will be implemented in the event of an accidental release.\n2.  Facility Information:  The primary activity at the Big Valley Ag Services facility is the storage and sale of fertilizers, in addition to, the sale of pre-packaged agricultural chemicals to farmers.\n  The regulated substance aqua ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application for crop production nutrients.  All other products do not meet the minimum federal requirements for reporting purposes.\n  Aqua Ammonia is received by tanker truck and stored in one - 10,000 gallon above ground tank at the site.  The maximum quantity of aqua ammonia handled at Big Valley Ag Services is 60,800 pounds.\n3.  Worst-Case Release Scenario and Alternative Release Scenario:  Worse-Case:  Failure of the largest storage tank when filled to the greatest amount would release 60,800 pounds of aqua ammonia solution, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 80 percent capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is .37 miles.\n  Alternative Release Scenario:  The alternate release scenario, based on the five-year accident history (or the most likely potential incident) is a release from a 1300 gallon nurse tank truck filled to 80% capacity.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is .14 miles.\n4.  Accidental Release Prevention Program: Anhydrous Ammonia and Aqua Ammonia:  The facility has implemented the provisions of"

Five-year Accident History:  There have been no accidental releases or near misses of aqua ammonia in the past five years that have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor have resulted in off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n6.  The Emergency Response Program:  The facility's emergency response program was written in accordance with the following regulations:  OSHA 29 CFR 1910.38; OSHA 29 CFR 1910.120; and Section 25503, Division 6.95 of the California Health and Safety Code.\n7.  Planned Changes to Improve Safety:  Safety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no additional specific planned changes to the aqua ammonia processes at the facility."
