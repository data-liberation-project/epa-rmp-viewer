These programs enable our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of toxic substances as well as fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents.   Overall, these programs prevent accidental fatalities, injuries and illnesses and avoid physical property damage.  Our safety programs are applied to any activity involving hazardous chemicals including any use, storage, manufacturing, handling, or the on-site movement of such chemicals, or combination of these activities.  Any group of vessels which are interconnected and separate vessels which are located such that a hazardous chemical could be involved in a potential release shall be considered a single process.  \n\n\n\n    Our safety programs prevent accidents because they focus on the rules, procedures, and practices which govern individual processes, activities, or pieces of equipment.  These rules are detailed and improved as necessary.  They are also communicated to and accepted by all employees at the facility.\n\n\n\n    Universal Cold Storage's South Plant is a cold storage plant located in Lincoln, NE. The facility operates an ammonia refrigeration system to provide cooling and freezing capabilities.   \n\n\n\nThe refrigeration is operated as a high and low stage system.  On the -30?F low stage portion of the system, a low temperature accumulator pumps liquid to supply a liquid header which feeds all the freezer evaporators on the system.    The low temperature"

Air from the fans blows across the coils, changing the liquid to a vapor. The low temperature recirculated suction vapor is sent from the air units coils to the low temperature accumulator via a suction header.\n\nVapor from the low temperature accumulators is fed to booster compressors. The booster compressors compress the low side gas to the high stage portion of the system.\n\nOn the high stage portion of the system, a +15?F high temperature accumulators pump liquid to supply a liquid header which feeds all the cooler, deep chill, and dock evaporators on the system.  The high temperature recirculated liquid flows through the coils in the air units where it picks up heat from the room and product.  Air from the fans blows across the coils, changing the liquid to a vapor. The high temperature recirculated vapor is sent from the air units coils to the intercooler via a suction header.\n\nVapor from the high temperature accumulator is fed to the high stage compressors. During the compression phase in the high stage compressors, the temperature of the ammonia vapor will rise as the pressure of the ammonia vapor is increased to approximately 150-180 psig. \n\nThe high-pressure ammonia vapor flows from the high stage compressors to the evaporative condensers where heat is removed, turning the vapor into a high pressure liquid.  The high-pressure liquid is collected in a high-pressure receiver.  The liquid collected in the high-pressure receiver provides liquid make-up for the low temperature accumulator and high temperature accumulator.\n\n\n\nThe emergency action plan at the South Universal Cold Storage requires all associates to be trained in safe evacuation and notification procedures in cases of actual or drill emergencies. Training shall include escape routes, notification of appropriate response agencies, instructions on activating a building fire alarm system and "

In the case of an emergency, Doug Obermueller is the emergency response coordinator and has overall responsibility for the preparation and implementation of the emergency response plan. The alternate emergency response coordinator is Dan Lynn, HR/Safety Manager.  Arrangements have been made to coordinate Universal Cold Storage's Emergency Action Plan and applicable emergency services with the following local agencies:\n\n\n\nLancaster County LEPC \n\n(402)-441-7441\n\n\n\nLancaster County Sheriff Department\n\n(402)-786-6500\n\n\n\nLincoln Fire Department\n\n(402)-786-3055\n\n\n\nUpon discovering an emergency situation, all employees shall immediately notify their supervisor or the Maintenance Department using the phone, vocally or wireless phones. The supervisor of the affected area should immediately contact the Emergency Response Coordinator to determine if evacuation of the plant is the safest course of action.  If the emergency involves the release of ammonia and a decision is made to evacuate the plant, the Emergency Response Coordinator will sound an evacuation alarm, then determine the assembly area.  The location of the assembly area will be based on the current wind direction and will be upwind of the release area and will be relayed to the Evacuation Coordinators.  If your immediate contact options cannot be reached, dial 911.  In the event of an evacuation, all employees should proceed to the designated assembly area and await further instructions from their evacuation supervisor. Facility map identifying exit doors, evacuation routes and assembly areas are posted at various locations throughout the facility.  Once everyone has evacuated the facility and arrived at their designated meeting area, a head count must be conducted by the evacuation coordinator to account for missing people, including visitors and/or contractors in his/her area.

The critical operations shutdown procedures to be followed by those employees who have been assigned for essential building operations include:\n\n\n\nPlant Engineer: Shutdown the ammonia refrigeration system by using one of the Emergency Stop (E-stop) switches located just inside of the engine room doors.\n\n\n\nIn response to an ammonia release, Universal Cold Storage will not respond to releases of hazardous chemicals in an offensive manner. The facility does not have any employees trained at the HAZMAT Technicians or First Responders Operations Level.  However, in the case of a minor ammonia release, designated maintenance personnel are allowed to isolate or maintain the release.\n\nUniversal Cold Storage has not had any accidental releases to report since the commissioning of the plant.\n\nThe total charge in the system is 18,522 lbs. In the event of a worst case scenario, we will assume the entire charge is released for ten minutes. The high pressure receiver is located outside of the engine room. Under worst-case weather conditions, ammonia could travel 1.67 miles before dispersing enough to no longer pose a hazard to the public.  This scenario is unlikely for the following reasons:    \n\n&#61607;    Worst case weather conditions are uncommon,\n\n&#61607;    The vessel is enclosed in a building that would withstand and help to contain such a release\n\n&#61607;    Industry standards for the manufacture and quality control of pressure vessels\n\n&#61607;    Ammonia is not corrosive in this service\n\n&#61607;    Pressure safety valves limit operating pressure in this vessel\n\n&#61607;    The accident prevention program in place "
