      "SummaryText": "The Geneva Lakes Cold Storage Company is committed to promoting a safe operating environment for the facility, its employees and the surrounding community.  The facility is complying with OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) standard, and EPA Risk Management Program rule.  The purpose of these regulations is to ensure that the covered process (ammonia refrigeration) is designed, operated and maintained safely.  Compliance with these regulations helps prevent ammonia releases from the process.  Additionally, these regulations required development of procedures to minimize releases of ammonia in the event that they do occur, and to outline appropriate emergency response steps to take in the event of a release.\n\nGeneva Lakes Cold Storage Company has implemented a Process Safety Management program for its ammonia refrigeration process operations and maintenance.  This was accomplished through the development of a PSM Team comprised of Operations, Maintenance, Safety and Engineering personnel, augmented by the support of refrigeration contractor personnel.  The PSM Program has been incorporated as both policy, and most importantly, procedure in every day operations and maintenance of the ammonia refrigeration system.\n\nThe Geneva Lakes Cold Storage Company \u00bfEmergency Evacuation and Contingency Plan\u00bf has been developed in concert with the Darien Fire Department and the Walworth County Emergency Response Agency.  The plan addressed fire, explosion, spills or releases of toxics, sever weather and other criteria.  The plan details response actions by the Geneva Lakes Cold Storage Company Emergency Response Team for such emergencies, safety and emergency equipment, communication responsibilities, and coordination with off-site responders.  The plan includes \u00bfEmergency Response to Anhydrous Ammonia,\u00bf specifically addressing incidents involving ammonia refrigeration.\n\nThe Geneva Lakes Cold Storage Company is located at W8766 County Highway X, Darien, Wisconsin.

      "SummaryText": "y is a cold storage facility.  The facility utilizes anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant to maintain the proper temperature of finished products.  Anhydrous ammonia is an effective refrigerant that has been used for many years by most storage facilities.  Anhydrous ammonia is normally a gas at ambient temperatures and atmospheric pressure, but it is utilized in the refrigeration process as a gas liquefied under pressure.\n\nGeneva Lakes Cold Storage Company operates one distinct ammonia refrigeration system within the facility.  The Geneva Lakes Cold Storage Company refrigeration systems are designed to provide the following:\n\n*operating flexibility (through availability of multiple operating equipment combinations);\n\n*economy and efficiency of operations (through the use of operating pressures commensurate with the degree of cooling required)\n\n*optimal safety performance (through the use of ammonia liquid pumps, utilizing instead the pressure differentials established in the system to move liquid refrigerant); and\n\n*consistency of operation, utilizing programmable logic controllers (PLCs) to monitor, record, operate and modulate refrigeration equipment as conditions require.\n\nGeneva Lakes Cold Storage Company has developed its worst case release scenario assuming that the Thermosyphon Receiver, normally operated at 50% capacity, ruptured, releasing 1980 pounds of ammonia within the Compressor Room.  The mitigated release rate of ammonia has been calculated to be approximately 204 pounds per minute.  This release has a toxic end-point of approximately 0.795 miles.  This scenario was developed utilizing EPA\u00bfs \u00bfRisk Management Guidelines\u00bf.  It should be noted that such a release is highly improbable, as all Geneva Lakes Cold Storage Company refrigeration equipment is designed, fabricated, installed and operated consistent with IIAR, ASME and Wisconsin Administrative Code specifications.  Precautions that would make such a scenario unlikely include: the vessels are enclos"

This release has a toxic end-point of .22 miles.\n\nThere have been no releases of ammonia from the refrigeration system during the past five years.\n\nThe Geneva Lakes Cold Storage Company emergency response program is based on the OSHA requirements for Emergency Action Plans (CFR 1910.38 and 1910.119) and HAZWOPER (29 CFR 1910.120). We have trained employees for emergency response and maintain a written response plan.  The plan is coordinated with the Walworth County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and the Darien Fire Department. We conduct periodic drills for the implementation of the emergency response plan at the facility, and anticipated increased participation with the LEPC and the Fire Department."
