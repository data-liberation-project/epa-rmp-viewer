These units have similar prevention program elements and are listed together in Section 7.  The units and their updated PHA dates are as follows:  \n\n\n\nAmmonia Plant- Revalidation April 2011\n\nUrea Ammonium Nitrate Plant #1 - Revalidation March 2013\n\nUrea Ammonium Nitrate Plant #2 - Revalidation May 2014\n\nNitric Acid Plant #1 - Revalidation March 2013\n\nNitric Acid Plant #2 - Revalidation June 2014 \n\nOffsights/Utilities Systems - Revalidation August 2012  \n\nAmmonia Storage and Loading - Revalidation January 2015\n\n",

The release was a result of an overpressure situation in the process (UAN #2 Plant) that casued a pressure relief valve to vent ammonia to the atmosphere.  The release resulted in off-site impact.  A neighbor approximately 1 mile from the plant was forced to shelter in place due to the strong odor of ammonia at his business location.\n\n\n\nOn October 15, 2012 a maintenance technician in our maintenance shop had a solution of approximately 40% ammonia sprayed in his eyes when he opened a ball valve on a pump that had been in prior ammonia solution service.  The ammonia solution that was in the pump had pressured up and was released when he opened the valve.  The technician rinsed his eyes for 15 minutes and was then taken to the eye doctor for an evaluation.  He was prescribed an antibiotic as a precaution to prevent infection.  \n\n\n\nOn December 9, 2013 a maintenance technician was exposed to ammonia vapors while changing a filter from an in-line filter housing device.  The ammonia vapors caused a buring sensation to the employee's throat, lungs, and eyes.  The employee was taken to a doctor for a medical evaluation and was given a prescription inhaler as a precautionary measure.\n\n\n\nOn December 26, 2013 an operations technician was exposed to a solution of ammonia when he was opening a valve and the solution leaked and sprayed from the valve stem packing.  The solution sprayed the employee in the right eye.  After rinsing the eye at the nearest eyewash station the employee was taken to the doctor for a medical evaluation and was given a prescription eye drop as a precaution to prevent infection.  \n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program:\n\nThe Woodward Facility has a comprehensive Emergency Response Program which includes a written plan that"
