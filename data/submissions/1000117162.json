This commitment is inherent to an accidental release prevention program in place that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at LyondellBasell La Porte. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. If such a release does occur, our trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release. We also coordinate with Channel Industries Mutual Aid (CIMA) which provides additional emergency response expertise.\n\nThe stationary source and regulated substances handled [40 CFR 68.155(b)]:\nLyondellBasell La Porte's primary activities encompass olefins, and polymer and resins manufacturing. We have several flammable mixtures that are comprised of RMP regulated substances present at LyondellBasell La Porte as well as vinyl acetate monomer and anhydrous ammonia in quantities greater than or equal to their threshold quantities. \n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps [40 CFR 68.155(c)]:\nLyondellBasell La Porte has taken the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR Part 68. This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-58 Standard, (1967 Edition). A number of processes at LyondellBasell La Porte are subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119. Below is a brief descript"

The methodologies used to carry out these analyses are unit HAZOPs and checklists. The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at least every 5 years. Findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nWritten Operating Procedures [40 CFR Part 68.69]\nLyondellBasell La Porte maintains written operating procedures for the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes. These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround. The information is at least annually reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved with the processes.\n\nEmployee Training [40 CFR Part 68.71]\nLyondellBasell La Porte has a training program in place to ensure employees that are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes. New employees receive basic training in process operations followed by on-the-job supervision until they are deemed competent to work independently. Refresher training is provided at least every three years and more frequently as needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity [40 CFR Part 68.73]\nLyondellBasell La Porte carries out documented maintenance checks"

Examples of process equipment examined by these checks includes pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps. Maintenance operations are carried out by trained and qualified personnel. Equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks or inspections are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nManagement of Change [MOC] [40 CFR Part 68.75]\nThe Management of Change process in place at LyondellBasell La Porte controls changes to process chemicals, equipment, technology, personnel, and procedures. Reviews are conducted prior to implementation to ensure that the change does not have adverse impact on safety, health or the environment. The Management of Change process includes notification or training of affected personnel.\n\nPre-Startup Safety Review [PSSR] [40 CFR Part 68.77]\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at LyondellBasell La Porte. These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits [40 CFR Part 68.79]\nLyondellBasell La Porte conducts compliance audits at least every three years to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented. Corrective actions required as a result of the audits are addressed in a prompt manner. \n\nIncident Investigation [40 CFR Part 68.81]\nLyondellBasell La Porte investigates incidents that have resulted in, or could reasonably result in, an employee injury or a significant release of a regulated substance.

In addition, our employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation to the RMP rule including process safety information and process hazard analyses results. Employees participate on investigation teams, safety teams, and audit teams.\n\nHot Work Permit [40 CFR Part 68.85]\nLyondellBasell La Porte has a hot work permit program that requires issuance of a hot work permit for hot work operations conducted on or near the covered process. \n\nContractor Safety Program [40 CFR Part 68.87] \nOur company hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities. Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is carried out. LyondellBasell La Porte informs the contractors of known potential hazards related the contractor's work and the processes. Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur. Contractor post evaluations are also conducted to ensure compliance with LyondellBasell safety and health procedures.\n\nThe five-year accident history [40 CFR 68.155(d)]:\nThere have been no accidental releases in the past five years that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage. \n\nThe emergency response program [40 CFR 68.155(e)]:\nLyondellBasell La Porte carries a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials.

In addition, the emergency response plan is promptly updated to reflect changes taking place within our processes that would require a modified emergency response. The La Porte Police Department is the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) with which our emergency plan has been coordinated.\n\nLyondellBasell La Porte has gone above and beyond the normal safety requirements to provide employees with a safe working environment. One program that enhances our ability to respond to emergencies is our Emergency Response Program. Members of the Emergency Response Team (ERT) undergo training that includes classroom and on-the-job training as well as regular emergency drills. A highly trained and confident ERT can limit damage during an emergency event, but more importantly prompt emergency response can prevent more serious accidents from occurring. Our teams regularly attend some of the best training programs available, in particular, the programs conducted at Texas A&M University.\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety [40 CFR 68.155(f)]:\nThe plant continuously evaluates hazards and implements action items to address deficiencies identified through the PSM/RMP program such as from PHAs, compliance audits, and MOCs.\n\nLyondellBasell La Porte has completed this report to provide the public with information about our activities at this facility.  We believe that the many controls instituted to maintain a safe operation, and our commitment to continuous improvement, that an incident affecting our employees or the surrounding area is unlikely to occur."
