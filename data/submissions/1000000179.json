Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies \n\n\n\nAgrium U.S. Inc. is strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety. This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, we are also completely coordinated with Borger Fire Department and the Hutchinson County LEPC which provides emergency response expertise. \n\n\n\n2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled \n\n\n\nOur facility's primary activities encompass production of Anhydrous Ammonia and Urea Fertilizers. We have two (2) regulated substances present at our facility. These substances include Ammonia and Chlorine. Ammonia is produced and distributed for use as a nitrogen fertilizer. Chlorine is used for treating the cooling water within the process. The maximum inventory of Ammonia at our facility is 2,447,045.00 lb. while Chlorine is present at our facility in a maximum quantity of 24,000.00 lb. \n\n\n\n3. The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative \n\ncontrols and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario. \n\n\n\nTo evaluate the worst case scenarios, we have used EPA's RMP Comp. For alternative release scenario analyses, we have employed the EPA RMP Comp as well. Marplot was used to calculate population within scenarios. The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios. The worst case release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from the Anhydrous Ammonia Plant. The scenario involves the release of 400,000 lb. of Ammonia in a"

At Class F atmospheric stability and 3.4 mph wind speed, the maximum distance of 11.0 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L, basis ERPG-2.\n\n\n\nOne alternative release scenario has been submitted for each toxic substance present in Program 2 and Program 3 processes cumulatively. The alternative release scenario for Ammonia involves a release from Truck Loading in the Anhydrous Ammonia Plant process. The scenario involves the release of 2,616 lb. of Ammonia in a gaseous form over 2 minutes. The release is also assumed to be controlled by active mitigation measures that include excess flow valves, emergency shutdown systems and loading personnel in the area during all loading operations. The loading personnel have been trained to take quick and appropriate actions, should a release occur. Emergency shutdown systems are also located in other areas throughout the process.  At Class D atmospheric stability and 6.7 mph wind speed, the maximum distance of 0.7 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L, basis ERPG-2, basis ERPG-2\n\n\n\nThe alternative release scenario for Chlorine involves a release from the Chlorine cylinder piping in the Anhydrous Ammonia Plant process. The scenario involves the release of 2000 lb. of Chlorine in a gaseous form over 10.0 minutes. The release is also assumed to be controlled by active mitigation measures that include a Chlorine detection system, operational procedures and visual monitoring. At Class D atmospheric stability and 6.7 mph wind speed, the maximum distance of 0.6 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.0087 mg/L, basis ERPG-2.\n\n\n\n4. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps \n\n\n\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68.
