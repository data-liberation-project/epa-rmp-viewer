The City of Tracy, Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP) relies on the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) 29 CFR 1910.119 Process Safety Management Standard, the OSHA 29 CFR 1910.38 Emergency Action Plans (along with the equivalent Cal OSHA regulations) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) 40 CFR Part 68 Chemical Accident Prevention Program, Risk Management Plan to guide in the establishment of policies for the efforts and commitment to prevent accidental releases of highly hazardous materials through prevention and emergency response.\n\n\n\nFacility and Regulated Substances Handled.  The City of Tracy WWTP handles both chlorine and sulfur dioxide.  The chlorine is stored in a 30 ton storage tank; and the sulfur dioxide is stored in a 20 ton storage tank.  Both storage tanks are inside contained buildings with a caustic scrubber in place along with automatic shutdown valves located on the top of each tank manway and located directly on each tank valve.  System is an electrically powered unit with air as the backup, thus redundancy is in place.\n\n\n\nThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps. The City of Tracy WWTP generally follows the EPA 40 CFR Part 68 and OSHA 29 CFR 1910.119 regulations for conducting process hazard analysis, as well as the OSHA 29 CFR 1910.119 regulations for conducting compliance audits in the efforts of accidental release prevention.\n\n\n\nThe Five-Year Accident History.  The City of Tracy WWTP has had 1 release in 2013 that had no employee or off site consequence.   \n\n\n\nThe Emergency Response Program.  The City of Tracy WWTP has an emergency action plan generally following the regulations in OSHA 29 CFR 1910.38.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety. Both systems receive upgrades of new tank valves, new automatic shutdown valves attached to these new tank valves, tanks were taken out of service to be"
