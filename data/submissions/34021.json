It is ST Services? policy to comply with all federal, state, and local laws as well as accepted industry practice for the storage and handling of butane and other liquefied petroleum gases.  An integral part of our compliance and safety program is employee training.  Employees are trained in the safe handling of all products stored at the facility, including butane, and are trained in appropriate emergency actions required in response to a potential release.\n\nEmployee training includes participation in internal response drills with government agencies, including the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC), U.S. Coast Guard, and the Fire Department.  Employees are trained and must demonstrate an understanding of the required tasks before being allowed to supervise the unloading of butane railcars.\n\nST Services Jacksonville facility is a ?for hire? bulk liquid terminal.  The facility handles butane as a service for a customer.  The butane is delivered to the terminal in railcars.  At our customer direction, the butane is blended into gasoline stored in tanks at the facility.  Once the desired gasoline formulation is achieved, the gasoline is shipped out of the facility by truck.  Butane may be ?stored? at the facility in railcars for a limited amount of time depending on our customers? demand for the product.  The terminal does not currently operate any permanent butane storage.\n\nThe butane handling facility has been designed to meet the requirements of standards set forth in NFPA 58 and is operated in compliance with the OSHA standard for the storage and handling of Liquefied Petroleum Gases (29CFR1910.110).  The facility has also implemented a Process Safety Management Program (PSM) in compliance with the requirements of OSHA 29 CFR1910.119.  The PSM program requires routine training of detailed written operating procedures, and development of an Emergency Ac"

These requirements, and the safety requirements of the referenced standards, provide for the continued sage operation of the facility.\n\nIn addition to the PSM program developed according to OSHA, ST Services has developed a Risk Management Plan (RMP) as required by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) at 40 CFR Part 68.  This program has many of the same elements of the PSM program, with additional requirements to address off-site consequences of a catastrophic failure of the butane system.  As required by this program, ST Services has developed a worst case release scenario (WRS).  The scenario modeled involved the sudden release and ignition of the entire contents of a railcar.  Though an unlikely occurrence, EPA has chosen this scenario to predict the maximum amount of damage that could be caused by a catastrophic failure to the system.\n\n\nIn addition to the prevention programs described above, the facility has a release monitoring system to detect flammable vapors near the butane rail siding and the vapor combustor.  This system will shut down the vapor combustor to prevent the ignition of vapors resulting from a spill or release.  The butane unloading system is equipped with a detection and deluge system, an emergency stop system, and excess flow valves, which prevent the uncontrolled release of butane liquids of vapors while unloading.\n\nST Services has an established relationship with the Jacksonville Fire Department and Local Emergency Planning Committee.  The facility cooperates with the emergency organization and has participated in drills as requested.  There have not been any accidental releases of butane at the facility in the past five years.\n\nAccess to the facility is controlled by security fences and an automated entry security system.  Only qualified contractors (including trained truck drivers and maintenance contractors) and employees are permitted to enter the operating areas of the facility.\n\nThe Process Safety Manageme"
