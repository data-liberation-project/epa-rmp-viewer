The Plan includes an analysis of the potential offsite consequences of an accidental release, a five-year accident history, and a release prevention and emergency response program.  \n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nWilbur-Ellis has implemented release prevention and emergency response procedures to minimize the potential for accidental releases of hazardous materials.  Emergency response procedures including evacuation procedures and notification procedures have been implemented by Wilbur-Ellis.  In addition, Wilbur-Ellis has developed operating procedures and preventative maintenance activities to reduce the likelihood of accidental releases.\n\n\n\nThis Plan and the emergency response procedures document the accidental release prevention, safety, and emergency policies in place at Wilbur-Ellis.\n\n\n\nDescription of Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nWilbur-Ellis is located at 2550 County Road 181 in Littlefield, Texas (the \"facility\").  Wilbur-Ellis is a retailer of fertilizer in the form of anhydrous ammonia stored under pressure.  There is one anhydrous ammonia storage tank located at the facility with a maximum capacity of approximately 30,000 gallons.  The anhydrous ammonia is used by a mobile third party contractor in a reaction process for the production of ammonium polyphosphate. \n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\n  \n\nWilbur-Ellis has developed and implemented this Plan with the objective of complying with the requirements and guidelines set forth by the Federal Risk Management Plan program.  The Plan's purpose is to enhance the facility's existing safety programs implemented at the site to reduce the possibility of accidental releases "

The emergency response program, documented in the emergency response procedures, includes accidental release prevention and chemical specific prevention steps.\n\n\n\nWilbur-Ellis ensures that equipment meets the appropriate industry standards prior to use.  Wilbur-Ellis and the third party contractor implement operating procedures and maintenance procedures, in accordance with manufacturer and industry specifications to prevent accidental releases at the facility.  Chemical specific prevention steps implemented at the site include excess flow valves, pressure relief valves, emergency shut off valves with cables that run along the length of the horizontal storage tanks for quick access, and ammonia training for personnel.\n\n\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\n\n\nThere have been no qualifying accidents involving ammonia in the five-year period prior to the completion of this Plan.\n\n\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\n\n\nThe facility coordinates with the Littlefield Fire Department (\"fire department\") regarding specific actions to be taken in response to an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia.  The facility has established emergency evacuation procedures to evacuate the site and notify the appropriate agencies regarding a release.  The facility's emergency response program is documented in the facility's Emergency Response Procedures.  The emergency procedures contain the following key elements:\n\n\n\n1.    Procedures for informing local agencies responsible for responding to accidental releases.\n\n2.    Information on emergency health care.\n\n3.    Emergency response training for employees.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nPlans to improve safety at the facility were developed based on the results of the compliance audit, process hazard analysis (PHA), and a Risk Management Plan (RMP) site evaluation conducted by an outside contractor.

Document that all maintenance repairs/replacements are compliant with ANSI, ASME, and OSHA standards for ammonia systems.\n\n2.    Consider installation of a fenced perimeter.\n\n3.    Install manifolds on the pressure relief valves for the storage tank for easy replacement if needed which will prevent the need to drain the contents of the tank prior to maintenance.\n\n4.    Ensure that specifications of any equipment used to store or transfer ammonia are on file.\n\n5.    Consider installation of seamless piping.\n\n6.    Consider installation of an emergency shut-down system in a remote location.\n\n7.    Evaluate anchoring tank to saddle/ground.\n\n"
