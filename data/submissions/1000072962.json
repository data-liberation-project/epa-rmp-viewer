As part of this commitment, the company has established a system to help ensure the safe operation of the chemical processes at this facility. One component of this system is a Risk Management Program that helps manage the chemical process risks at the Palatka Mill and addresses compliance with the requirements of the United States Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) Regulation 40 CFR Part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs. One of the requirements of the Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions is to submit a Risk Management Plan (RMP) describing the Risk Management Program at our Palatka Mill. This document is intended to provide the public with a description of the Risk Management Program in use at the Georgia-Pacific Palatka Mill.\n\n\n\nThe Risk Management Program at the Palatka Mill consists of three core elements:\n\n\n\nI. Hazard assessments which serve to help us understand the potential off-site consequences of hypothetical accidental releases.\n\n\n\nII. Prevention programs which serve to help maintain and safely operate the process which contains more than the threshold quantity of Chlorine Dioxide. \n\n\n\nIII. Emergency response program which serves to help respond to accidental releases of Chlorine Dioxide from the covered process. \n\n\n\nAlthough the Risk Management Program at the Palatka Mill helps provide assurance that our mill is maintained and operated in a safe manner, it is only one component of the overall safety program. The Palatka Mill has a comprehensive safety program in place establishing many levels of safeguards that are designed to minimize the potential for the release of any hazardous substances. \n\n\n\nWhen hazardous substances are used at the mill, the equipment is carefully designed, built, and operat"

This Executive Summary is primarily intended to describe those parts of the safety program at the Palatka Mill that are required by the RMP Rule.\n\n\n\n1. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nThe Palatka Mill is committed to the safety of workers and the public, as well as the preservation of the environment through the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances. The Palatka Mill implements reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous substances. These controls include training programs for personnel, programs to help ensure safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the processes, and programs to evaluate the hazards at the Palatka Mill.\n\n\n\nIn the event of an accidental release, the Palatka Mill will control and contain the release in a manner that will be safe for workers and will help prevent injury to the public and/or the environment. The Mill provides response training for upset conditions to facility personnel, designates an Emergency Response Compliance Standard Owner to oversee response activities, and coordinates response efforts with the local emergency response organizations. The Palatka Mill works with the Local Emergency Planning Commission (LEPC) to help ensure that injuries and/or environmental damage will not occur in the event a release does occur.\n\n\n\nIn order to effectively implement these policies, The Palatka Mill has established a management system directed by the Vice President of the Palatka Mill. The Vice President has the overall responsibility for ensuring that the facility operates in a safe and reliable manner. This responsibility includes overseeing the elements of th"

Georgia-Pacific Palatka Mill's Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nGeorgia-Pacific's Palatka Mill is a pulp and paper mill primarily involved in the manufacture of brown/bleached pulp and paper products. As part of this manufacturing process, the mill produces and stores Chlorine Dioxide for the use of bleaching pulp. The Chlorine Dioxide solution system, which includes the generation, storage and distribution of the Chlorine Dioxide, is considered a Program Level 3 RMP covered process.  \n\n\n\n3. Accidental Release Prevention Program \n\n\n\nGeorgia-Pacific's Palatka Mill has always used a prevention program to help prevent accidental releases of hazardous substances. Beginning in 1992, the Palatka Mill formalized this prevention program for the Chlorine Dioxide system to comply with the 14 elements of The United States Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard 29 CFR 1910.119. In 1996, the EPA RMP Rule established that a Program Level 3 prevention program would become a requirement for these processes as well.

For a covered process, a PHA has been performed if the process is new or management of change requirements have been completed if an existing process has been modified.\n\n\n\nA pre-startup safety review is completed as part of the management of change process, is documented, and ensures that the appropriate items have been addressed.\n\n\n\n* Compliance Audits (40 CFR 68.79):   The Palatka Mill or the Georgia-Pacific Global Health and Safety Group audits the covered processes annually to be certain that the mill's prevention program is effectively addressing the safety issues of the operations. The Palatka Mill or the Global Health and Safety Group assembles an audit team that includes personnel knowledgeable in the RMP Rule and in the process.  This team evaluates whether the prevention program satisfies the requirements of the RMP Rule and also whether the prevention program is sufficient to help ensure safe operation of the process. The results of the audit are documented, recommendations are resolved, and appropriate enhancements to the prevention program are implemented.\n\n\n\n* Incident Investigations (40 CFR 68.81):  The Palatka Mill investigates all incidents that could reasonably have resulted in a serious injury to personnel, the public, or the environment so that similar accidents can be prevented. The mill trains employees to identify and report any incident requiring investigation. An incident investigation team is assembled, and the investigation is initiated within 48 hours of the incident. A root cause analysis is performed for all incidents. The results of the inves"

The mill encourages active participation from personnel in the development and maintenance of the prevention program activities of all processes at the mill. Employees are consulted on, and informed about, all aspects of the RMP Rule prevention program, including the development of Process Hazard Analysis and Operating Procedures.\n\n\n\n* Hot Work Permits (40 CFR 68.85):  The Palatka Mill complies with requirements of the Georgia-Pacific Hot Work Compliance Standard to ensure that the site mitigates the risks to personnel and facilities and reduces the chance of incidents while performing work activities.  The vehicle for this risk reduction is a Hot Work permitting system that requires conscious forethought to hazard potential prior to starting this type of work and ensuring that the risks are minimized / eliminated. Personnel who are to perform hot work are required to fill out the Hot Work Permit form. The supervisor reviews the completed form before work can begin.\n\n\n\n* Contractors (40 CFR 68.87): The Palatka Mill has a detailed contractor safety program that applies to contractors performing maintenance or repair, turnaround, major renovation, or specialty work on or adjacent to an RMP covered process. This program does not apply to contractors providing incidental services that do not influence process safety.\n\n\n\nThe Palatka Mill selects contractors based on prior site work history and on information that they are required to provide as part of the bid process. The bid information includes their current safety programs (i.e., safety organization, employee education and training, and accident prevention program) and their prior safety"

Bidders that do not provide all of the requested information, that do not have the desired skills, or that have an unsatisfactory safety record are dropped from further consideration. Contractors that meet the minimum safety requirements are then judged to determine which one can provide a quality job at the lowest cost. If a contractor currently working in the plant is under consideration, the facility reviews recent safety audits and contacts plant personnel on the job site to verify satisfactory job performance before the facility authorizes the purchase order.\n\n\n\nThe Palatka Mill requires all contractors to complete a computer based training program that highlights the most hazardous areas in the mill.  The training includes the mill's safe work practices, and the emergency response procedures for the mill. The mill provides SDSs for the hazardous materials that may affect the contractor work area, copies of plant safe work practices and policies, and emergency response actions associated with the contractor's work. The mill then introduces personnel with whom they will communicate.\n\nThe Palatka Mill requires contractors to perform the following tasks to help ensure process safety:\n\n\n\ni. Train each of their employees in the work practices necessary to safely perform the contracted work.\n\nii. Train each of their employees on the plant's safe work practices.\n\niii. Document that each of their employees has received and understands the training. \n\niv. Ensure that each of their employees follows the plant safety rules and safe work practices.\n\nv. Report to the facility's staff any hazards created or found by their employees at the job site.\n\nvi. Provide access and responses to the facility's personnel who may appear at the job site to evaluate contractor safety performance.\n\nvii. Provide information on contract employee job "

Chlorine dioxide is produced in the chlorine dioxide generator and piped to an absorption tower, where as high as 14 gram-per-liter (1.4% by weight) strength in solution is absorbed. In addition to the required RMP prevention program elements, the Palatka Mill has implemented safety features specific to the Chlorine Dioxide System. The Chlorine Dioxide System in use at the Palatka mill has a series of safety interlocks that ensure the smooth operation of the generator and that it runs smoothly to prevent rapid decomposition.  \n\n\n\n4. Five-Year Accident History\n\n\n\nThere was one incident that met the Five-Year Accidental History at the time of last resubmission.  This incident occurred March 5, 2017.  Short and long term corrective actions were put in place.  All other incident requirements per the United States Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) Regulation 40 CFR Part 68.6 were completed.\n\n\n\n5. Emergency Response Programs\n\n\n\nGeorgia-Pacific Palatka Operations has established a written emergency response program to help safely respond to accidental releases of hazardous substances.
