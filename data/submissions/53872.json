The date of the most recent PHA's are 3/22/04 for No. 7 Pipestill, and 4/17/2000 for SDA.  The major hazards identified in section 7.4.d were addressed during the PHA's conducted for this process.  The vents and rupture disks listed under Process Controls (section 7.4.e) apply only to the No. 7 P/S unit, while the flares and interlocks apply only to the SDA unit.  The deluge system listed under mitigation systems (section 7.4.f) applies only to the SDA unit.  There have been no incidents in this process within the past 5 years involving the release of an RMP regulated substance which resulted in, or could reasonably have resulted in, imminent and substantial offsite impacts.  A narrative description of the facility's prevention program elements can be found in the executive summary.",

The recognition and control of risks are instrumental to the safe, efficient, and environmentally compliant operation of the refinery.  The refinery?s accident prevention and risk management plan is organized to be consistent with the OSHA Process Safety Management regulation, which provided for systematic and comprehensive attention to key elements of process hazard management, addressing issues of technology, personnel, and equipment.  This structure facilitates our overall program which emphasizes accident prevention through safe design, installation, operation, inspection, and maintenance of our processes.  Even though we emphasize the prevention of accidents, we also maintain a highly trained, qualified, and well-equipped emergency response organization to quickly respond to and mitigate an incident should one occur.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe Bayway Refinery, located in Linden, New Jersey, operates a wide variety of operating processes to convert raw crude oil into useable petroleum products for our customers.  The refinery produces many commonly used petroleum products, including gasoline, heating oil, diesel, jet fuel, propane, butane, petrochemical feedstocks and polypropylene.  These products and their production account for numerous regulated flammable substances being present on site, including propane, butane, hydrogen, and mixtures of other regulated flammable substances.  The Bayway Refinery does not exceed the EPA threshold quantity for any RMP regulated toxic materials.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe Bayway Refinery has had an excellent accident record over the history of the facility, and has experienced only four  incidents in the past five years involving the release of a regulated substance which meets the RMP reporting requirements.  The incidents meet the RMP reporting require"

Each of the incidents was investigated and corrective actions were identified and implemented to prevent a similar incident from occurring in the future. \n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM STEPS\n\nThe following is a summary of the general prevention program in place at the Bayway Refinery.  Because processes at the refinery that are regulated by the EPA RMP regulations are also subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accidental release prevention program.  In addition to the OSHA PSM regulation, the refinery is also regulated by the New Jersey Toxic Catastrophe Prevention Act (TCPA) for processes covered by that regulation.\n\nThe following elements represent numerous programs and practices that the Bayway Refinery has institutionalized as Management Systems.  Through the establishment, review, and continuous improvement of these management systems, the Bayway Refinery demonstrates its commitment to operating a safe, healthy, and environmentally sound facility.\n\nEMPLOYEE PARTICIPATION\n\nThe Bayway Refinery encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation include safety committee involvement, developing and reviewing safe operating procedures, and participation in the process hazard analysis program.  Information on the refinery?s prevention program is available to all employees, and they are encouraged to recommend improvements to any of the programs.  Specific ways that employees can be involved in the prevention program are documented in the employee participation plan elements of the PSM Management Systems Documentation.  Copies of this document are maintained at the refinery and address ea"

In addition to this program, the refinery has a strong commitment to following written policies and procedures, and encourages employee?s input to identify when a policy or procedure needs to be changed or improved to cover new tasks, revised regulations, or employee experience.  Through this teamwork, a determination can be made to update the policy or procedure, and then train everyone involved on the revised requirements.\n\nPROCESS SAFETY INFORMATON\n\nThe Bayway Refinery maintains an extensive library of Process Safety Information which includes information related to chemicals in the process, the technology of the process, and equipment in the process.  These documents include detailed information on chemical properties and their associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  The process safety information is available to all employees, either directly on the unit, via the refinery?s intranet, or by contacting their supervisor.\n\nChemical specific information, including hazards, protective measures, symptoms, and first aid procedures is provided via Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS?s).  For specific process areas, the refinery has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g. temperature, pressure, flow, and level).  These are documented in the Operating Conditions and Controls section of the unit Operating Manuals.  The refinery ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using computer process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g. automated shut down systems).\n\nThe refinery also maintains technical documentation that provides information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment"

      "SummaryText": ", etc.  This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides the basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\nPROCESS HAZARD ANALYSIS (PHA)\n\nThe Bayway Refinery has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nThe Bayway Refinery primarily utilizes the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  The analyses are conducted by a team representing operating experience, as well as safety and engineering expertise.  This team systematically identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as existing accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.  \n\nThe PHA team?s recommendations are forwarded to the management of the involved unit or area for resolution.  Implementation of mitigation measures in response to PHA findings is based on the relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps ensure that potential accidents scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.

Once again, any team findings are forwarded to the unit or area management for resolution, with the final resolution of the findings documented and retained.  \n\nOPERATING PROCEDURES\n\nThe Bayway Refinery utilizes written procedures that address various facets of process operations, such as (1) initial startup of a newly constructed process, (2) unit startup, (3) normal operations, (4) temporary operations, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) emergency shutdown.  These procedures are located in an operating manual that is used as a reference by unit operators and provides a basis for consistent initial or refresher training of operators.  The procedures are maintained by the involved area operating personnel, and are updated to reflect changes identified through the Management of Change process, through refresher training, or changes/improvements identified through normal operating experience.  The operating manual is reviewed annually to insure that it is current, updated, and accurate.  The written operating procedures are readily available to all personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job.  \n\nOPERATOR TRAINING\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the Bayway Refinery has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  New refinery operations employees (candidates) must successfully complete up to 8 weeks of basic training in refinery operations before being assigned to a unit-specific training program.  Basic training addresses applied sciences, job fundamentals, process operations, and understanding basic refining processes and operations.  The time necessary to successfully complete unit-specific training varies with the requirements of each job. Typically it requires from 12-18 weeks to qualify as an assistant operator on a specific operating post.  Thr"
