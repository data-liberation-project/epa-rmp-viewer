Planned changes to improve safety:\n\nA process hazard analysis of our anhydrous ammonia system was conducted during 2009.  From this review, the recommendations were:  \n\n\u00c2\u00b7Continued improvement and implementation of standard operating procedures (SOPs), change management process, P&ID's and scheduled maintenance activities.\n\n\u00c2\u00b7Consider adding more interlocks, alarms, and automated controls to minimize system excursions.\n\n\u00c2\u00b7Consider adding autodial system to exterior sensors for quicker notification of potential problems.\n\n\u00c2\u00b7Consider addition of water spray to area or manual water hose to help dissipate vapors.\n\n\u00c2\u00b7Consider routing all hydrostatic devices to static scrubber and winterization of scrubber.\n\n\u00c2\u00b7Consider enhanced lighting and security of area.\n\n\u00c2\u00b7Ensure doors and air intakes are closed to prevent migration of excursion into building.\n\n\u00c2\u00b7Consider adding eyewash/safety shower closer to ammonia unloading area"

We have also provided supporting documentation for the hazard assessment results and population estimates.\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n1. Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies:\n\nBecause our firm has a strong regard for environmental protection, product stewardship and safety concerns, we conduct our activities in such a manner as to protect the physical environment, our employees, customers and the general public.  We comply with environmental, stewardship and safety laws and regulations; and develop and implement programs to insure compliance.  We are both responsible and responsive in our efforts related to environmental protection, product stewardship and employee safety.\n\nWhere our company becomes aware of environmental and product safety risks not covered by existing laws or regulations, we develop our own good faith standards and practices based on comprehensive and relevant scientific data.  We cooperate with the public, government, industry and employees in identifying environmental, product stewardship and safety goals and in developing effective control programs.  Each operating unit of the company is expected to be guided by this policy in forming plans, setting objectives, and conducting their day-to-day activities.\n\nOur emergency response procedures include notification of the local fire department.  In addition, access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, management personnel, and contractors.  The facility is fenced to help keep it secure.\n\nFacility EHS personnel take an active role on our local LEPC.\n\n2. Stationary source and regulated substances handled\n\nThe regulated substance handled at this facility is anhydrous ammonia.\n\nThe primary purpose of this facility is to produce specialty ingredients, nu"

Anhydrous ammonia is received by truck (transports) and is stored in a single tank located in the central portion of the property.  The capacity of the storage tank is 15,000 gallons of anhydrous ammonia.  The tank is designed to store 85% of its capacity; therefore, the maximum amount of anhydrous ammonia that can be stored at our plant is approximately 12, 750 gallons, or approximately 75,000 pounds.\n\n3. The general accidental release prevention program and the specific prevention steps:\n \nThis facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with applicable state codes and regulations including OSHA's Process Safety Management Standard.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with good engineering practices to provide a safe system for our employees as well as our neighbors and environment.  Delivery drivers have been thoroughly trained regarding anhydrous ammonia hazards and emergency response. \n\nOur employees watch the delivery of each truck bringing anhydrous ammonia to our site. We lease our anhydrous ammonia storage vessel from an anhydrous ammonia vendor and require them to periodically inspect our anhydrous ammonia system, and make any necessary adjustments to either equipment or procedures to continue to ensure safe handling and use of anhydrous ammonia.\n \n4. Five-year accident history:\n \nOver the last five years, we have had one release of 12 pounds due to a valve that released and subsequently reset.  Five people north of our property sought medical observation/treatment, but required no hospitilization.  There has been no environmental damage resulting from our anhydrous ammonia system.\n \n5.
