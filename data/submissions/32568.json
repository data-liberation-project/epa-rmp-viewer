Regulated Substance Handled\n\n\n\nThe Clackamas River Water District Water Treatment Plant, hereafter referred to as the Water Treatment Plant, is managed and operated by Clackamas River Water District personnel.  The regulated substance handled is Chlorine, which is considered hazardous by the US EPA.\n\n\n\nGaseous chlorine is stored in the facility chlorine storage room. \n\n\n\n\n\n2. Accidental Release & Emergency Prevention Program\n\n\n\nThe Water Treatment Plant takes a systematic proactive approach to preventing accidental releases of chlorine.  The plant is strictly covered by the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard 29 CFR 1910.119.  The prevention of accidental releases depends on adherence to the procedures used to handle chlorine, the safety equipment systems designed and constructed in the facility, and the training of personnel.  The RMP/PSM and operating procedures manual are kept in both hard copy and electronic form for employee reference.\n\n\n\nEngineering controls have been added as part of the prevention program to limit effects of a chlorine release.  The Water Treatment Plant has installed a chlorine scrubber which is designed to capture and treat a chlorine release.  The system is also under a vacuum regulator that would cut off flow if a leak in the chlorine piping should occur. \n\n\n\n\n\n3. Emergency Response Program\n\n\n\nAlthough an accidental chlorine release is unlikely, the Water Treatment Plant has prepared for such a release as well as other emergencies.  The plant has developed an emergency action plan complies with 29 CFR 1910.38. The written plan incorporates the Clackamas County Office of Emergency Management (CCOEM) as the coordinator of emergency "

In the event of an emergency, key personnel will perform critical tasks to ensure proper containment and/or plant shut down and evacuation, or shelter in place as deemed appropriate by the acting Incident Commander. \n\n\n\nA chemical emergency would involve the Regional Hazardous Material Response Team, which will be summoned by Clackamas County Fire District #1 when necessary.    \n\n\n\n\n\n4. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nThe addition of a comprehensive remote monitoring of the chlorine scrubber unit functions has been designed.  There have been no unresolved process hazards identified in the chlorine system at the Water Treatment Plant. \n\n\n\n\n\n:PSM .exec sum\n\n6/10/04\n\n\n\n"
