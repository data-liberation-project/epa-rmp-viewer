Periodic drills or tabletop exercises are conducted to test the response plan.\r\n\r\nThe overall emergency response program for the Pecos Gas Plant is coordinated with the Reeves County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC). This coordination includes periodic meetings of the committee, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials, and industry representatives.  The Pecos Gas Plant has around-the-clock communications capability.  EMV operators are automatically called in the event of a process upset.  The operator will then call the appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., fire department).  This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.  In addition to periodic LEPC meetings, the EMV conducts periodic emergency drills that involve emergency response organizations, and the Pecos Gas Plant provides annual refresher training to local emergency responders regarding the hazards of regulated substances in the facility.  \r\n\r\nFive - Year Accident History\r\n\r\nAccording to EMV personnel, there have been no reportable incidents in the last 5 years."

The program consists of procedures for responding to the release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post incident cleanup and decontamination requirements.  In addition, the facility has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment, as well as instructions that address the use of emergency response equipment.  Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties.  The emergency response program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to facility processes.  The emergency response program changes are administered through the Management of Change (MOC) process, which"

This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes. EMV's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, facility trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release. \r\n\r\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\r\n\r\nNatural gas is gathered from wells in the surrounding fields and sent to the Pecos Gas Plant for processing prior to being sold for domestic consumption. This gas contains impurities in the form of carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrogen (N2) and water. These impurities must be brought into specification before residue companies will purchase this gas. The Pecos Gas Plant inlet gas contains enough natural gas liquids that extraction is desirable.\r\n\r\nThe process of the compression and dehydration of natural gas and removal of condensate and natural gas liquids occurs in the following way.\r\n\r\nNatural gas from nearby wells is gathered into pipes that extend out into the field in a spider web configuration. The pipes are designed so diameters increase as they grow closer into proximity of the compressor facility and volumes are larger. The gas then enters the compressor station.  Pipeline condensate is removed from the gas stream along the pipeline via slug catchers. Removed condensate is routed to pressurized natural gas liquids storage tanks. The produced water is routed to the salt water disposal tank.\r\n\r\nThe gas then enters compression. The gas enters a high pressure inlet separator that removes oil and free liquids. The gas stream flows through a propane refrigerati"
