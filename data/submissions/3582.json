      "SummaryText": "General Executive Summary for DowAgroSciences Harbor Beach, Michigan Site\n\n1.    Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at DowAgroSciences Harbor Beach, Michigan Site are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, our well trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.\n\n\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities encompass Chemical Manufacturing.  We have 1 regulated substance present at our facility, Ammonia.  The regulated substance at our facility is involved in several uses.   Ammonia is used as a raw material in our process.                                         .\n\nThe maximum inventory of Ammonia at our facility is 70000.00 lb..\n\n3.    The Worst Case Release Scenario and the Alternative Release Scenario\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used the look-up tables and equations provided by the EPA in the RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance. \n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted involves a catastrophic release of Ammonia. The scenario  involves the release of 70000 lb. of Ammonia in a gaseous form over 10 minutes.  At Class F atmospheric stability and 3.4 m/s windspeed, the maximum distance of 4.0 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L.\n\nOne alternate release scenario has also been submitted for Ammonia.  The alternative release scenario for Ammonia involves a release from a pipe at the Ammonia Storage Tank. The scenario involves the release of 10"

Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L of Ammonia (anhydrous) is 0.14 miles.\n\n4.    The General Accidental Release Prevention Program\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 promulgated by EPA.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with generally accepted good design practices and Engineering standards.  A number of processes at our facility are subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119.  Our facility is also subject to EPCRA Section 302 notification requirements.    The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nDowAgroSciences maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes, (MSDS sheets, equipment specifications, etc).\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses is Hazop (Hazard and Operability Studies).  In addition to Hazop, other methodologies used include, Dow Fire and Explosion Index, Dow Chemical Exposure Index and the Reactive Chemicals/Process Hazard Analysis.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of three years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.  \n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, DowAgroSciences maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, n"

The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nTraining\nDowAgroSciences has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Refresher training is provided at least every three years and more frequently as needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nDowAgroSciences carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nManagement of Change\nWritten procedures are in place at DowAgroSciences  to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures. Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification.\n\nPre-startup Reviews\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at DowAgroSciences.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits\nDowAgroSciences conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are"

These audits are carried out at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\nIncident Investigation\nDowAgroSciences promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\n\nEmployee Participation\nDowAgroSciences truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.  Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  In addition, our employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP rule, including information resulting from process hazard analyses in particular.\n\n\nContractors\nOn occasion, our company hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance, construction and other various activities.  Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is carried out.  DowAgroSciences has a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related to the contractor's work and the processes.  Contractors are also required to inform DowAgroSciences of any hazards they may introduce at the site.  Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.\n\n\n5.    Five-year Accident History\nDowAgroSciences has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last 5 years.  Due to our stringent release prevention policies, there has been no accidental release that had off site consequences during this period.\n\n6.    Emergency Response Plan\nDowAgroSciences carries a written"

The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas.\n\nTo ensure proper functioning, our emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced.  In addition, the plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within our processes that would require a modified emergency response.\n\nHuron County LEPC is the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) with which our emergency plan has been coordinated and verified.\n\n7.    Planned Changes to Improve Safety\nSeveral developments and findings have resulted from the implementation of the various elements of our accidental release prevention program.  Behavior based safety is a major step we want to take to improve safety at our facility.  These changes are expected to be implemented by September 30, 1999.\n\n8.
