The Facility supplies potable water to the City of Columbia and some surrounding residents and water districts.   The Facility stores and uses the following Clean Air Act Section 112 (CA-112) regulated substances in the following regulated processes:\n\n\n\nSubstance - Chlorine\n\nProcess - Water treatment (chlorination)\n\n\n\nThe chlorine used at the Facility is stored in 1-ton cylinders and a maximum quantity of approximately 40,000 pounds is present at any one time.   There is one chlorine process at the Facility consisting of up to eight cylinders connected to the water treatment process.  There have been no chlorine releases or accidents at the Facility that have resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage onsite or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damages in the past five years.  There are public receptors and a state park immediately adjacent to the Facility.\n\n\n\nDue to the hazardous nature of chlorine, the City of Columbia Water Treatment Plant has coordinated with the Columbia Fire Department to respond to emergencies.  The Facility has generated the Risk Management Plan (RMP) to minimize the potential risk to plant personnel and surrounding communities.   A complete Program Level 2 Prevention Program is included that is consistent with the Environmental Protection Agency requirements for Risk Management Plans.  Emergency procedures are in place to handle small releases that include shutting off chlorine flow, isolating and venting any releases, investigating, and correcting any releases.  Larger releases are covered by the Emergency Action Plan which includes evacuation of the facility.   The facility will rely on the City of Columbia Fire Department for emergency response.   Water plant employees undergo continuous safety training and the process line is inspecte"

The valves are automated and close all eight on-line cylinders immediately following detection of chlorine in the cylinder room, feed room or in the basement below the cylinder room.\n\n\n\nAs required for the RMP, the Facility has evaluated the chlorination process line to identify possible sources of chlorine releases.  In addition, the off-Site impact of both a worst case and an alternative release scenario has been evaluated using RMP Comp.  Results of the off-Site impact analysis are presented in the submittal.\n\n\n\nIn addition to existing prevention and response efforts, the City of Columbia Water Treatment Plant personnel are also making modification to further insure safe operation.    Emergency lighting has been upgraded.  The facility is currently upgrading the SCADA system.   The facility has upgraded the chlorine detectors, sensors, and alarms.  \n\n\n\n\n\n"
