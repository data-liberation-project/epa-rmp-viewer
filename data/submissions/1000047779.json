      "SummaryText": "Facility Description\n\nBanner Creek LLC operates a pork processing facility near the southeast corner of Holton, Kansas, at 619 East 4th Street.  The facility is located along the south side of 4th Street (Highway 16), and has been at this location since 1969.  The nature of the business involves swine slaughter and processing of pork products for commercial distribution.  \n\n\n\nChemicals Regulated Under EPAs Chemical Accident Prevention Program\n\nThe Holton pork processing facility has very few hazardous or toxic chemicals on site.  The facility refrigeration system uses anhydrous ammonia as refrigerant, which is the only CAPP/RMP regulated chemical on site in excess of applicable thresholds.     \n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention & Emergency Response Policy\n\nBanner Creek LLC is committed to maintaining our ammonia equipment in safe condition, and to providing our personnel with training in safe operating procedures.  This facility has never had an accidental release of ammonia from our facility which resulted in adverse health effects to the public or to our employees, or in property damage.  We have clear lines of authority and responsibility with respect to all aspects of our release prevention program, leading directly to the Plant Coordinator.  We maintain current safety information on ammonia and our ammonia refrigeration equipment, and review any potential hazards that may be associated with the storage and use of ammonia at our facility.  We train both our operating and maintenance personnel in our procedures and safe practices.  New employees are trained before being allowed to work on ammonia equipment without close supervision, and periodic refresher training is provided.  If significant changes occur in equipment or processes which could potentially impact the storage or use of ammonia, affected employees are retrained.  We inspect and audit the ammonia refrigeration system, using both in-house staff and experienced professionals from outside the company.\n\n\n"

      "SummaryText": "\nAccidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\nBanner Creek LLCs Holton facility has developed a written emergency response program/plan and coordinated planned response actions with the Holton Fire Department.  The plan designates specific actions and procedures to be followed in the event of an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia, and designates primary and secondary incident commanders.  It also includes contact information for responsible Banner Creek LLC personnel and emergency response agencies.\n\n\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nWithin the five years previous to the date of this submission, the facility has not had a recordable accident which required inclusion in the 5-year accident history required by Subpart B of the CAPP/RMP regulation.  \n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThe Banner Creek LLC management team is committed to an on-going system of reviewing plant operations; evaluating changes in available technologies; and reviewing previous plant incidents or near-misses to identify opportunities to improve plant safety.  Since the previous PHA (2011), the plant has reduced ammonia inventory, upgraded heat exchangers, installed process controls, increased capacity for air exhaust and make-up, and upgraded security monitors, all with respect to the covered process.  We expect to perform similar routine continuous improvement; however, at the time of this submission, there are no specific planned changes to improve plant safety.\n\n"
