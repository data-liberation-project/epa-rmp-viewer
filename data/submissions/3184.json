We will accomplish this by using the most current design, training, and inspecting processes available.  \n\nEmergency Response Policy (ERP).   The County will respond to any emergency in a manner best suited to protecting our employees, the public, and the environment.  Trained on-site responders will access the emergency, and decide on a coarse of action.  For emergencies within their training level they will respond.  For any emergency not included in their training, off-site emergency response agencies will be called.     \n\nThe Stationary Source.  The stationary source is the chlorine disinfection system.  Chlorine gas (CAS No. 7782-50-5) is the regulated substance handled at this facility.   The chlorination system has a maximum chlorine inventory of 6,000 pounds.  This quantity qualifies the system as a Program 3 process.\n\nThe Worst-case Scenario.  The worst-case scenario for the plant is the rupture of a ton cylinder (the largest vessel holding chlorine).  The volume of the storage tank would allow a maximum of 2,000 pounds of liquid chlorine to be stored.  In the worst case scenario this tank would rupture and spill its entire contents into the chlrine room in ten minutes.  The liquid chlorine would convert quickly to gas, forming a toxic cloud.  Using the EPA look-up tables for this release, the distance to the toxic endpoint is 1.3 miles.    \n\nThe Alternative Release Scenario.  The alternative release scenario is the discharge of chlorine from a broken valve on a one ton cylinder.   Using the EPA look-up tables for this release, the distance to the toxic endpoint is 0.2 miles. \n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program.  The accidental release prevention program includes a combination of design, training, and inspecting.  The chlorination sy"

      "SummaryText": "stem was designed according to current codes and specifications, and adheres to good operating practice.  The operators and contractors who work in and around the chlorination system have been trained in both safety and proper operating procedures.  We have a detailed monitoring and inspection program that maintains the mechanical integrity of the refrigeration equipment.  These programs are described in more detail in the full RMP program\n\nFive Year Accident History.  There were no reportable accidients in the last five years.      \n\nEmergency Response Program.  The County has a written ERP that includes specific actions to be taken in response to an accidental release of chlorine from the system.  On-site responders will respond to small accidental releases.  Any large or uncontrolled release will require assistance from off-site responding agencies.  The ERP plan states the specific procedures for informing the public and local agencies responsible for responding to an accidental release.  The ERP also includes information on emergency health care for exposure to chlorine.  The ERP was last reviewed on April 23, 1999.  The ERP is coordinated with the Mohawk Fire Department.  The contact is the Fire Chief, at telephone (315) 866-3600.  The facility is also subject toOSHA PSM regulations: OSHA 1910.120.    \n\nPlanned Changes to improve Safety.  None outstanding."
