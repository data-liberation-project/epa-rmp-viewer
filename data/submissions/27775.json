      "SummaryText": "Alabama Power Company's Plant Miller, located near Porter, Alabama, is a 4 unit steam electric generating plant.  Plant Miller has two (2) cooling towers to help reduce the temperature of the water that is discharged into the Locust Fork of the Black Warrior River.  In order to treat the water prior to returning to the river, chlorine injected into the cooling tower system.  A 1 ton cylinder of chlorine is attached to a manifold at each cooling tower for this purpose.  Additional cylinders are kept as spares in this location.  Chlorine is also used to treat process water that is used by Plant Miller.  The total quantity of chlorine exceeds the threshold limit of 2500 lbs. Plant Miller also has a Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) System at Units 3 and 4 to control emissions of nitrogen oxides generated from burning coal to produce electricity.  As part of the system, vaporous ammonia is injected in to the flue gas that aids in the chemical reaction to convert NOx to harmless nitrogen and water vapor.  Anhydrous ammonia is stored on the plant site for use in the SCR system.  The total quantity of ammonia exceeds the threshold limit of 10,000 lbs.  A Process Safety Management (PSM) program is in effect under OSHA for Plant Miller,  therefore  Program 3 applies.\n\nThe hazard that would be associated with the chlorine at Plant Miller is a toxic hazard.  The most likely event is a leaking of the manifold attached to the cylinder.  The cylinders are protected from traffic around the plant by open sided steel framed sheds.  When it is necessary to replace empty cylinders, trained personnel remove and connect full cylinders to the manifold.  Therefore, a rupture  that would result in the rapid release of the gas is unlikely.  Due to the sparse population around the plant, even in the worse case scenario exposure would be limited.\n\nThe HGSYSTEM (version 3.0) model was used to determine the worst case and alternate case scenario for the release of chlorine gas.  The model det"

      "SummaryText": "ermined that the toxic endpoint occurred at approximately 1.7 miles from the release point for the worst case scenario and 0.3 miles for the alternate case scenario.  The end point for the worst case scenario did contain some public receptors but did not include any environmental receptors.  The alternate case scenario did not contain any environmental or public receptors.  \n\nIn order to insure that releases of chlorine do not occur, only trained personnel or contractors load or unload this material.  In addition, daily visual inspections are performed by Plant personnel.  Plant Miller also has an outside contractor perform a yearly maintenance inspection on the chlorination system.  We feel this greatly reduces the possibility of an accidental release of chlorine.\n \nThe main hazard that would be associated with ammonia at Plant Miller is a toxic hazard.  The Degadis model was used to determine worst case scenario for the release of anhydrous ammonia.  The worst case scenario is the catastrophic failure of one of the 46,000-gallon ammonia storage tanks.  This would result in the ammonia gas traveling 1.899 miles (3.057 Kilometers) before it reached the toxic endpoint.  However, this type of failure is extremely unlikely due to the safeguards described in the prevention program.  \n\nThe INPUFF model was used to determine the alternative release  sceranio for the release of anhydrous ammonia.  The worst of several alternative release scenarios considered for the release of ammonia was due to a fault in the piping leading to a release.  A failure of this type would result in ammonia gas traveling 0.124 miles (0.2 kilometers) before it reached its endpoint.  There are numerous mechanical and procedural safeguards at the Plant to prevent this from occurring.  However, for emergency response planning purposes, they were not considered in the alternative release scenario.\n\nPlant Miller did not exceed the threshold amount for flammables.\n\nNo chemical spills have occurred at "

      "SummaryText": "this facility in the past 5 years.\n\nThe accidental release prevention program at Plant Miller is focused on the safe management of ammonia used in the ammonia storage and dilution system and the use of chlorine used on the two cooling towers.  The first step in the prevention program was the establishment of a management system to assign overall responsibility of the individual program elements.  Additional steps include:  accessibility, ensuring the system is designed and modified safely by periodically conducting process hazard analyses; ensuring the system is operated and maintained in a safe manner by developing, maintaining and implementing Standard Operating and Preventive Maintenance procedures; ensuring contractors are qualified and oriented to the site hazards; and ensuring periodic Compliance Audits and Incident Investigations are conducted including resolution of recommendations made during these investigations/reviews.\n\nPlant Miller is included in the Birmingham/Jefferson County LEPC emergency response plan.  In addition, the Plant has in place an emergency action plan that includes procedures to be followed in the event of an accidental release of ammonia or chlorine.  The procedures cover the following: evacuation plan; recognizing emergencies; emergency action procedures; coordinating personnel; first aid procedures; notifying the public and local emergency response agencies; emergency response contacts; emergency response equipment; reportable release quantities and documenting releases; emergency alarm system; training; and pre-emergency coordination with the Jefferson County LEPC."
