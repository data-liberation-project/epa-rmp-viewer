This commitment is reflected in the safety and environmental programs that are implemented at the facility.  For example, written procedures have been created for the handling of hazardous chemicals.   Safety programs are geared towards the prevention of an accidental release at the facility.  In addition, these programs incorporate emergency procedures to mitigate the effects of a release if it does occur.  At such an event, emergency coordinators will assess the situation and notify outside responding agencies as necessary.\n\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance\n\nInland Star Distribution Centers, Inc. was founded in 1981 and is a 3rd Party Logistics company providing warehousing and distribution services to packaged chemical, industrial and general commodities sectors. Inland Star Distribution Centers, Inc. opened its Fresno, California facility in 1988. \n\n\n\nThe Chemical Distribution Services operation is one of receiving, storing and shipping of a variety of chemical products in approved DOT/UN containers, including bags, drums, plastic bottles and cardboard boxes. Liquid container sizes range from one-half pints to 250 gallon totes to 1,000 tanks. All containers are DOT/UN approved. Inland Star Distribution Centers, Inc. performs storage and distribution services only. On-site there is no blending, formulating, repackaging or opening of containers. Product is received on pallets the majority of the time. This product is unloaded, placed in storage, and loaded on trucks for shipment to the customer using forklifts. \n\n\n\nAlthough all chemicals are not applicable to OSHA's PSM, EPA's RMP, and OES' CalARP, a PSM/RMP/CalARP Program Level 3 has been developed for all chemicals.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\nInland Star Distribution Centers, Inc. has developed an accidenta"

Training for employees involved with system operations and maintenance;\n\n? Written procedures for managing system changes and startup of a modified process;\n\n? Investigating releases and near misses and implementing measures to prevent recurrence;\n\n? Written procedures for conducting hot work on or near the regulated processes;\n\n? Contractor management policies to ensure contract employee safety while on facility premises; and\n\n? Employee involvement in program development and implementation.  \n\n\n\nInland Star Distribution Centers, Inc. is committed to the prevention and minimization of accidental releases of potentially hazardous chemicals. It is the policy of Inland Star Distribution Centers, Inc. to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local regulations. As such, Inland Star Distribution Centers, Inc. has installed sprinkler and foam extinguishing systems. The facility is also equipped with cameras that can be remotely monitored.\n\n\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nA review of the facility's five year accident history showed that there have been no incidents at the facility that meet the RMP criteria for a reportable accident (onsite deaths, injuries, or significant property damage; or known offsite deaths, injuries, property damage, environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place).  In addition, there have been no incidents at the facility in the last five years that resulted in a release of more than the Federal Reportable Quantity. \n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nInland Star Distribution Centers, Inc. has developed an Emergency Action Plan (EAP) for the purpose of protecting employees and the surrounding community.

Employees are informed of the elements of the EAP initially and annually.  In the event of a chemical release, employees will evacuate or shelter-in-place, depending on the nature of the release, and the facility will contact the fire department for assistance as necessary.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis and Compliance Audits have been performed for the chemical storage, and these studies have resulted in action items to improve safety at the facility.  The recommendations mainly consist of formalizing procedures, implementing practices consistent with industry standards, and performing inspections and tests to maintain the integrity of the equipment.  The facility plans to continue providing employees with a safe work environment through continued training on current policies and procedures, and conducting audits to identify deficiencies and make improvements.\n\n\n\nOur organization's value proposition is to ensure product safety, security and risk mitigation for our community, associates and clients."
