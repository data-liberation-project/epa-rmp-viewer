The Fractionation Plant is located at 15608 Airline Highway (U.S. Highway 61) adjacent to Motiva Enterprises LLC, an oil refinery, and Shell Chemical Company, a SOCMI chemical complex.\n\nThe Fractionation Plant separates and recovers various components in natural gas liquids from nearby gas processing plants. This plant produces ethane, propane, isobutane, n-butane, and natural gasoline. The facility primarily consists of a deethanizer (DeC2), a depropanizer (DeC3), a debutanizer (DeC4), two deisobutanizers (DIB), an ethane treater, and on site storage facilities. Process heat is provided by a closed loop hot oil system using direct fired natur"

We have entered the facility as an RMP Program Level 1 facility.\n\nToxics\n\nThere are no toxic materials contained on site above the threshold limits.\n\nFlammables\n\nThe Norco Fractionation Plant was evaluated to determine if any regulated flammable or toxic material exceeds the threshold quantity set by 40 CFR 68.130. Listed flammable substances which are stored above threshold quantities at the Norco Fractionation Plant are ethane, propane, normal butane, isobutane, normal pentane and isopentane. Most of the inventory of these flammables is contained throughout the process as chemical mixtures that contain one or two of these hydrocarbons as the primary constituent, or as a mixed (Y-Grade) feed, rerun propane and natural gasoline product. \n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis Results\n\nThe offsite consequence analysis will not be reflected in the executive summary but rather is reflected in the data components.  There are flammable substances on site and no toxic substances above the threshold quantity.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe following is a summary of the accidental release prevention program in place at NORCO Fractionation Plant.  The process at the facility is regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) regulation (Program 1).  Release prevention is provided through the use of written operating procedures, employee training in written procedures, including normal operation and emergency release procedures, and in the design of safety and release prevention equipment installed at the terminal site.  In addition, a written safety program designed to comply with all applicable OSHA safety performance regulations is strictly enforced at all Enterprise facilities, including the NORCO Fractionation Plant facility.  As part of the Enterprise safety program, the facility utilizes procedures that are i"

      "SummaryText": "ncluded in the Enterprise program, but may not specifically be required at non-PSM and/or RMP Program 1 facilities (e.g. Safe work practice training; safe work permitting and hot work permitting).\n\nUniversal Prevention Activities\n\nThe accident prevention program summarized previously is applied to all RMP covered processes at NORCO Fractionation Plant.  Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human errors.\n\nSpecialized Safety Features\n\nThe NORCO Fractionation Plant has safety features on many units to help contain/control a release, to quickly detect a release and reduce the consequence of a release.  The following types of safety features are used in the covered processes:\n\nRelease Detection\n\n* Hydrocarbon (hazardous gas) detectors and alarms\n* Fire detectors on gas compression equipment\n* Plant video surveillance system\n\nRelease Containment and Control\n\n* Process relief valves that discharge to a flare to capture and incinerate episodic releases\n* Valves to permit isolation of the process (manual or automated).\n* Automatic shutdown systems for specific process parameters (e.g., high pressure).\n* Secondary containment (curbs and dikes) to contain any release of liquid chemicals\n* Redundant equipment and instrumentation where advisable\n* Dual mechanical seals with seal failure alarms installed on hydrocarbon liquid pumps.\n* Atmospheric relief devices\n\nRelease Mitigation\n\n* Hand-held and wheeled cart fire extinguishers\n* Personnel trained in emergency response and procedures.\n* Personnel protective equipment (e.g., chemical protective clothing, self-contained breathing apparatus, etc.)\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nRecords are kept for all significant accidental chemical releases that occur at our facility.  The following is a brief summary of accidental chemical releases involving materials covered under EPA's RMP rule during the past five years:\n\nThis facility has had"

      "SummaryText": "no accidental releases in the last five years which meets the criteria set forth in 40 CFR 68.10.\n\nEmergency Procedures Information\n\nThe NORCO Fractionation Plant maintains a written emergency procedure, which is in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment.  The procedures are for the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address notification of local emergency response agencies if a release occurs.  Employees receive training in emergency procedures.  The emergency procedure is updated when necessary based on modifications made to the terminal facilities.   \n\nThe overall emergency procedure program for the Norco Fractionation Plant is coordinated with the St. Charles Parish Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC). This coordination includes periodic meetings of the committee, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials and industry representatives.  The Norco Fractionation Plant has around-the- clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., Motiva Refinery Safety Department).  This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThe NORCO Fractionation Plant resolves all findings from PHAs, some of which result in modifications to the process.  Other recommendations for possible changes to improve safety come from periodic accident prevention program audits, incident investigations, or employee suggestions and recommendations.  The following changes are planned for implementation at the NORCO Fractionation Plant.\n\n*New swing gates to be installed on personnel platforms."
