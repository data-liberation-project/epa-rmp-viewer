      "SummaryText": "Niagara National Corporation compounds cleaning materials for the transportation industry. A few of these materials are liquid acid cleaners that contain Hydrofluoric acid. Hydrofluoric acid ( 70 %) is the only regulated substance used at this site. The process that involves the storage and use of this material is the focus of our RMP.\n\nHydrofluoric Acid ( 70%) is delivered to the facility in 550 pound plastic drums. These drums are stored in a containment area. The area is located over a drain system which connects to collection sump, which is itself diked to give further protection from material escaping from the premises in liquid form.\n\nWhen used as a raw material in the manufacture of acid cleaners, the Hydrofluoric Acid is introduced into the mixing tanks as the last ingredient. Only a single drum, at a time, is siphoned pumped into the mixer. The area in which the mixers are located are also in the same containment area as the material is stored.\n\nThis area is equipped with a sprinkler system and surrounding area have deluge hoses available in the event of a spill. In addition, only personnel thoroughly trained in the hazards and handling of this material are allowed to perform any compounding operation involving this material.\n\nThe largest single container(vessel), that we store and use, of 70% Hydrofluoric acid ( a 550 pound drum) could be released in the event of a puncture or container failure. Under our emergency response programs, if this release was deemed to be safe to contain by by plant management, then it would be handled by company personnel, else the local response agencies would be immediately called in to handle the situation.\n\nThere have been no spills involving a regulated substance within the last five years."
