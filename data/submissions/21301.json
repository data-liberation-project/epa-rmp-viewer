A 3 inch pipe would release approximately 170,000 pounds over a total of ten minutes based on the model guidance. This release would have an off site impact. It should be noted that the combined storage capacity on site is only 88,000 pounds. It should also be noted Terra has not had a release of this type from our facility. \n\nTHE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS:\n\nAMMONIA\n\nThe ammonia system is designed, installed and is maintained in accordance with ASTM standards and the ASME codes. This facility complies with the ANSI K 61.1 standards (1989), OSHA (29 CFR 1910.111), EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule as well as all applicable federal, state and local codes and regulations.\n\nOur ammonia system is protected from major releases by internal excess flow valves, check valves, relief valves, manual shutoffs and emergency shutoff valves. The load-out risers used for the purpose of filling the nurse tanks are protected by excess flow valves and fill line breakaways to immediately stop the flow of ammonia if a line or a hose fails. All main storage tank valves and riser load valves are locked when not in use.\n\nOur ammonia system is inspected on a regular basis with maintenance and preventive maintenance scheduled and documented. Liquid and vapor valves, hoses, excess flow valves, gauges, and relief valves are replaced when necessary and/or according to the guidelines in the ANSI standards.\n\nTraining is provided to all employees at least annually, whenever there is a change in the process or whenever competency with the regulations is questioned. The training consists of classroom lecture, current videos, testing and certification and on the job training. \n\nPROPANE\n\nThe propane system is designed, installed and is maintained in accordance with ASTM s"

In preparation for this, we have coordinated with all of the local response agencies by providing information and facility tours to ensure that they are familiar with and properly prepared for an incident at our facility. This will help to ensure that our community has the strategy for responding to and mitigating the threat posed by an ammonia release or prop"

In addition, Terra has an Emergency Response and Contingency Plan for each facility that complies with the requirements of OSHA (29 CFR 1910.38 and 1910.1200).  The plan includes public notification, provisions for initial medical care, evacuations and LEPC coordination.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY:\n\nWe do not plan to make any changes to the physical site. We provide our employees ongoing annual training to ensure that they are current with all of the proper transfer and safe handling procedures for ammonia and propane. Ammonia and propane equipment are regularly inspected and maintained. Our corporate EHS staff review and update training and maintenance procedures routinely to ensure our facility meets or exceeds all applicable regulatory requirements and industry standards."

The field supervisors require a timely written response with the completion date of all recommendations resulting from the audits.\n\n In addition, each location has a Site Safety Coordinator as an extension of the EHS group. These coordinators are trained to monitor the day to day safe work activities, maintain the required regulatory record keeping, conduct monthly safety meetings, conduct employee training and act as the location's contact with the corporate EHS group. The site safety coordinators act as the location emergency contact.\n\nA DESCRIPTION OF OUR FACILITY AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED.\n\n This facility is a wholesale farm supply distribution center. We store and distribute a wide variety of pesticides and fertilizers including anhydrous ammonia.  The facility also sells liquefied petroleum gas (propane) to customers for home winter heating and to farms for grain drying and livestock heating needs. \n\nAnhydrous ammonia is received by truck, is handled and stored on-site and is a regulated toxic substance by the EPA requiring us to comply with the Risk Management Program. We sell anhydrous ammonia to grower customers in 1,000 gallon or 1,450 gallon nurse tanks. The customer applies the ammonia into the soil as a source of nitrogen fertilizer for growing agricultural crops.  \n \nThis facility maintains approximately fourteen 1,000-gallon nurse tanks and eight 1450 gallon nurse tanks for customer delivery.  Our combined storage capacity in nurse tanks is 121,800 pounds. Anhydrous ammonia is stored in one stationary storage tank [18,000 gallon.] on site. The maximum storage capacity of stationary storage tank is 84,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia. Therefore, the total facility anhydrous ammonia storage capacity for our facility is 205,000 pounds.  The largest single storage vessel at our facility contains 84,000 pounds.\n\nPropane is received by truck, is handled and stored on-site. Propane is a regulated flammable substance by the EPA requ"

The storage tanks contain a total of 88,000 pounds of propane.\n\nTHE WORST CASE SCENARIO:\n\nTOXICS - AMMONIA\n\nOur worst case scenario is the loss of the total contents of the 18,000 gallon storage tank, released as a gas over 10 minutes, resulting in total vaporization. The maximum quantity released would be 84,000 pounds. According to DEGADIS modeling, this release (distance to point of dispersion to 200 PPM) would have off site impact. It should be noted that Terra has never had a release of an entire stationary storage tank from any distribution facility.\n\nFLAMMABLES - PROPANE\n\nOur worst case scenario would involve the loss of the entire contents of both 12,000 gallon propane tanks, when filled to the greatest amount allowed (85% AT 60F), resulting in a vapor cloud explosion with a 1 psi end point.  According to the modeling provided in the Risk Management Program Guidance for Propane Storage Facilities October 1998, which uses EPA's Offsite Consequence Analysis, the release would have an off site impact. It should be noted that Terra has never had a release like this from any distribution facility.\n\nALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS:\n\nALTERNATE RELEASE FOR TOXICS - AMMONIA\n\nThe most common alternative release scenario(s) for ammonia from our facility would not reach an end-point off-site. The alternative release scenario modeled for the purposes of this plan is a 2-minute release from a stationary storage tank representing a valve and hose failure requiring a manual shut down.  The total amount of anhydrous ammonia released in this scenario would be12,000 pounds. This release scenario (distance to point of dispersion to 200 PPM) would have off site impact.  It should be noted Terra has not had a release of this type from any distribution facility.\n\nALTERNATE RELEASE FOR FLAMMABLES -PROPANE\n\nOur most common alternate release scena"
