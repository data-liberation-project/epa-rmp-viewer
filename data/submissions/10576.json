Facility Accidental Release Policy\n\nThe owners, management, and employees of Western Farm Service's Modesto facility (herein referred to as the Facility) at 3348 Claus Rd., Modesto, California, 95355 are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia, aqua ammonia, and propane.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.  A detailed emergency response plan has been developed and will be implemented in the event of an accidental release.\n\n2.  Facility Information\n\nThe primary activity at the Facility is the storage, blending, and sale of fertilizers, in addition to, the sale of pre-packaged agricultural chemicals to farmers. \n\nAnhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for both direct application and for blending into mixed grade fertilizers for crop production nutrients.  Anhydrous Ammonia is also used in the production of aqua ammonia.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is stored in one 30,000-gallon storage tank (bullet) at the site.  The maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia handled in this process is 153,000 pounds.\n\nAqua ammonia (upto 30% of ammonia by weight) is produced and stored at the site using an aqua ammonia convertor and stored in two 20,000-gallon above ground tanks at the site. The maximum quantity of aqua ammonia handled is 300,000 pounds.  The total quantity of ammonia present in the aqua ammonia, based on 30% active ingredient by weight, is 90,000 pounds.  \n\nPropane gas is received by tanker truck and stored in two 1,000-gallon and one 500-gallon above ground tanks at the site.\n\n3.

The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 2.54 miles.   The alternative release scenario, based on the PHA scenarios (or the most likely potential incident) and  is a release of 26,638 pounds of anhydrous ammonia from a broken 3-inch diameter pipe.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 1.56 miles.\n\nB.  Aqua Ammonia Alternative Release Scenarios  \nOne alternative scenario is failure of the largest storage tank when filled to the greatest amount would release 150,000 pounds of aqua ammonia solution.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 1.72 miles.  The second alternative release scenario, based on the PHA scenarios (or the most likely potential incident) is a release of 10,000 pounds of aqua ammonia solution from a storage tank modeled with an increased wind speed and \"D\" Stability modeling parameters.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 0.19 miles.\n\nC.  Propane Worst-Case and Alternative Release Scenarios.  \nFailure of the largest storage tank when filled to the greatest amount would release 5,050 pounds of propane.  It is assume that the entire tank contents are released as a vapor which finds an ignition source.  Ten percent of the released quantity is assumed to participate in a resulting explosion.    The distance to the endpoint for the worst-case release scenario is 0.10 miles.  The alternative release scenario, based on the PHA scenarios (or the most likely potential incident) is a  pull-away failure of a 3/4-inch diameter pipe with a subsequent vapor cloud explosion. The distance to the endpoint for the alternative release scenario is 0.04 miles. \n\n4.

In summary, planned changes address the review and development of Standard Operating Procedures for regulated onsite processes."
