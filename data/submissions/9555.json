In service to the\n\ncommunity, the County has a history of adhering to proactive approaches for the prevention and\n\nemergency response of accidental releases of toxic substances.  Current prevention and\n\nemergency response polices adhere to the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Prevention\n\nProgram and Emergency Response requirements as set forth under the 40 CFR 68 regulations.\n\n\n\n     The Facilities are located within Palm City, Florida and utilize chlorine gas in the water\n\nand wastewater treatment process.  The Facilities share a common, enclosed, chlorination area\n\nand chlorination distribution system on-site to feed both plants. A single RMP is being submitted\n\nfor the Facilities due to the fact that they (WTP & WWTP) share \n\na\n\n common chlorine facility. \n\nChlorine is delivered to the central area and stored on-site in cylinders containing 2,000 pounds\n\nof liquefied chlorine under pressure when full. The chlorine facility holds a maximum of ten\n\n(10) 2,000 pound cylinders.\n\n\n\n     The Tropical Farms \n\nFacilities\n\n have an outstanding performance history in conjunction\n\nwith handling, storing, maintaining and operating of chlorine gas.  No accidental releases have\n\noccurred since the system went into service in \n\n1996\n\n\n\n.\n\n  The water \n\ntreatment\n\n \n\nplant\n\n\n\n is\n\n \n\nmanned        \n\n\n\n\n\n16\n\n hours/day, seven (7) \n\nday/week and the wastewater treatment plant is manned 24 hours/day,\n\nseven (7) days/week.

The current emergency response plans are documented and coordinated\n\nwith the community emergency response officials through the Local Emergency Planning\n\nCommittee (LEPC).  Operational staff are trained according to these response plans.\n\n\n\n     The EPA 40 CFR 68 requires offsite consequence analysis of two (2) release scenarios\n\nfor toxic substances identified as \"worst case release\" and \"alternative release.\"  The \"worst case\n\nrelease\" is defined by EPA as \"the owner/operator shall assume that the ... maximum quantity in\n\nthe largest vessel ... is released as a gas over 10 minutes.\"  For the worst case release, EPA\n\nspecifies the parameters to use in calculating the distance the chlorine will travel to achieve its \n\n\"toxic endpoint.\"  The alternative release is defined as \"more likely to occur than the worst case\n\nrelease scenario\", such as a pipe leak. \n\n\n\n\n\n     Utilizing the EPA's RMP* COMP Model, a  distance of 3.5 miles was calculated for the\n\nworst case release toxic endpoint and 0.30 miles for the alternative release.\n\n  As per EPA\n\nregulations, the population is estimated within the circles defined by the radius' corresponding to\n\nthe toxic endpoints.  These population values are 10,125 for the worst case and 127 for the\n\nalternative release.  It is noted that if an actual release did occur according to the alternative\n\nrelease scenario, the population at risk would be substantially less due to the plume of gas being\n\nmore in the form of an elliptical pattern moving down wind of the point source rather than a\n\ncircle centered on the point source.\n\n\n\n     The use of chlorination within water treatment and wastewater treatment has yielded\n\nenormous benefits in this County related to preventing the spread of water borne diseases.  \n\nMartin County, like virtually every modern treatment facility, und"
