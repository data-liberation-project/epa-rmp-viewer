The current emergency response plans are documented and coordinated\r\nwith the community emergency response officials through the Local Emergency Planning\r\nCommittee (LEPC).  Operational staff are trained according to these response plans.\r\n\r\n     The EPA 40 CFR 68 requires offsite consequence analysis of two (2) release scenarios\r\nfor toxic substances identified as worst case release and alternative release.  The worst case\r\nrelease is defined by EPA as the owner/operator shall assume that the ... maximum quantity in\r\nthe largest vessel ... is released as a gas over 10 minutes.  For the worst case release, EPA\r\nspecifies the parameters to use in calculating the distance the chlorine will travel to achieve its \r\ntoxic endpoint.  The alternative release is defined as more likely to occur than the worst case\r\nrelease scenario, such as a pipe leak. \r\n\r\n\r\n     Utilizing the EPA's RMP* COMP Model, a  distance of 3.5 miles was calculated for the\r\nworst case release toxic endpoint and 0.30 miles for the alternative release.\r\n  As per EPA\r\nregulations, the population is estimated within the circles defined by the radius' corresponding to\r\nthe toxic endpoints.  These population values are 10,125 for the worst case and 127 for the\r\nalternative release.  It is noted that if an actual release did occur according to the alternative\r\nrelease scenario, the population at risk would be substantially less due to the plume of gas being\r\nmore in the form of an elliptical pattern moving down wind of the point source rather than a\r\ncircle centered on the point source.\r\n\r\n     The use of chlorination within water treatment and wastewater treatment has yielded\r\nenormous benefits in this County related to preventing the spread of water borne diseases.  \r\nMartin County, like virtually every modern treatment facility, und"
