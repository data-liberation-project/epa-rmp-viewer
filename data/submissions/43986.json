The operating capacity of the system exceeds this threshold.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical \u00bf Specific Prevention Steps:\n\nThis facility complies with the provisions of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration\u00bfs Process Safety Management Program 29 CFR 1910.119 and the Environmental Protection Agency\u00bfs Risk Management Program 40 CFR 68.  The facility\u00bfs PSM program includes provisions for process hazard analyses, management of change, pre-start up safety reviews, safe work, practices, inspections, testing, maintenance, compliance audits, and contractor qualifications.  Qualified outside contractors are used for construction and major repairs or modifications to the system.  The PSM program is reviewed annually and updated as necessary.  All significant changes to the system are reviewed in accordance with the PSM/RMP management of change provisions stated in the facility\u00bfs plan.\n\nThe system is equipped with a series of redundant fail safe devices, sensors, and overides.  In the event a malfunction occurs that could result in an ammonia release, these protective devices shut the system down.  The system can\u00bft be restarted until the cause of the shutdown is identified and corrected.  The system is equipped with ammonia detectors that alarm and start local exhaust ventilation system when the presence of ammonia is sensed above set point levels in the engine room.  The system can be manually shutdown using a kill switch located outside the engine room.\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nThere is no reportable accident history since this is an initial startup.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nThe facility has made arrangements wit"
