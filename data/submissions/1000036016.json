It was determined that the RMP regulations applied since the facility has received an RMP regulated Toxic Chemical since August 19, 1996 in quantities that exceeded the threshold level.  The facility receives, blends, and manages hazardous waste derived fuels (HWDF) which are used to replace fossil fuel consumption in the manufacture of Portland cement at other facilities.  The facility has decided to prepare and submit a RMP Plan to maintain future operational flexibility.\n\n\n\nThe Toxic Chemicals, vinyl acetate monomer, acrylonitrile, allyl alcohol, and propionitrile were selected to be addressed in the RMP Plan preparation based on an applicability determination.  The process involved at the facility includes handling, storage and blending in tanks and transfers to and from containers such as tank trucks and rail cars.  The facility is covered by the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations and thus is subject to Prevention Program Level 3 as a result of the co-located Holcim cement plant's quarry operations being terminated and the site no longer being subject to the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) regulations.  This submission is predictive in nature since the subject chemicals are not always on-site at threshold levels.\n\n\n\nHolcim/Geocycle management is committed to safe operations at the facility.  The company has an Environmental, Health and Safety Policy that clearly commits company resources to maintaining safe operations protective of human health and the environment.  The facility also has an active Community Advisory Committee to provide an avenue for discussing health, safety, and environmental issues with our neighbors.\n\nThe facility has had no incidents involving the release of the subject chemicals in the past 5 years.

The facility meets or exceeds the Prevention Program Level 3 requirements.\n\n\n\nThe facility is regulated under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act as a commercial hazardous waste treatment, storage and disposal facility (TSDF).  The existing Contingency Plan meets and exceeds the RMP regulatory requirements for the written Emergency Plan.  Local emergency planning agencies have been cognizant of the facility activities, reviewed the Contingency Plan and agreed in writing to provide assistance in the event of an emergency.\n\n\n\nThe Holcim/Geocycle management welcomes inquiries into our operations, and looks forward to answering any questions that the public may have.  Please contact the emergency contact identified in this plan if you have any questions.\n\n"
