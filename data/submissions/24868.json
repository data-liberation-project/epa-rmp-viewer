A key requirement of this rule is the preparation and submission of an RMP Plan, contained herein.  The contents of the RMP Plan are prescribed by EPA, including this Executive Summary.\n\nCORPORATE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE APPROACH\n\n1. Prevention Program\n\nProcesses that are subject to OSHA's Process Safety management (PSM) standard AND are regulated under EPA's RMP rule are subject to the Program 3 Prevention program.  VOPAK USA Inc. has documented the Prevention Program in its Process Safety Management Manual.  Briefly, this program includes provisions and requirements for:\n\n* Process Safety Information\n* Process Hazard Analysis\n* Operating Procedures\n* Training\n* Mechanical Integrity\n* Management of Change\n* Pre-Startup Review\n* Compliance Audits\n* Incident Investigation\n* Employee Participation\n* Hot Work permits\n* Contractors\n\n\n\n2. Emergency Response Approach\n\nVOPAK USA Inc. has an Emergency Contingency Plan in place.  This Plan is shared with local emergency responders who have access to VOPAK  facility personnel (and up-to-date phone numbers).

Joint emergency exercises are conducted when possible.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nOur facility's primary activities encompass Chemical Storage & Distribution.  We have four RMP regulated substances present at our facility.  The substances are Aqueous Ammonia 30%, Sulfur Dioxide,Chlorine,and Ethylenediamine. Listed below is the way the RMP regulated substances are stored/handled on site and the maximum inventory present at any one time.\n\n1.Ethylenediamine is received in 55 gal drums which are stored in our warehouse for distribution to end use customers. The estimated maximum inventory of Ethylenediamine onsite at any one time will be 42000  Pounds.\n\n2. Aqueous Ammonia 30% is received in 330 gal portable tanks and 55 gal drums which are stored in our warehouse for distribution to end use customers.The estimated maximum inventory of Aqueous Ammonia 30% at any one time will be 68000 pounds.\n\n3. Chlorine is received in 150  pound cylinders which are stored at the facility for distribution to end use customers. The estimated maximum inventory of Chlorine onsite at any one time will be 6000 pounds.\n\n4. Sulfur Dioxide is received in 150 pound cylinders which are stored at the facility for distribution to end use customers.The estimated maximum inventory of Sulfur Dioxide\nonsite at any one time will be 6000 pounds.\n\n\nWORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO & ALTERNATE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\n(including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario.)\n\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used the look-up, tables and equations provided by the EPA in the RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance.
