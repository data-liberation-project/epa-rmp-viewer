This commitment is demonstrated by an accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as the design of new systems, installation of equipment, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at the refinery.  It is the company policy to implement reasonable controls to prevent the foreseeable releases of regulated chemicals.  However, in the event that an accidental release occurs, an emergency response plan that designates the roles of individuals has been established to mitigate the impact of the release within practical limits.\r\n  \r\n2.0\tThe Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\r\n\r\nThe Lion Oil Company refinery in El Dorado processes sour crude oil at a production rate of approximately 75,000 barrels per day (42 gal/bbl).  The petroleum products include gasoline, diesel, asphalt, coatings, and small quantities of other intermediate products.  The refinery operation produces or uses several regulated substances including propane, butane, hydrogen gas, and hydrogen sulfide. Flammable mixtures make up the majority of these regulated substances.\r\n\r\n2.1  Worst-Case Release Scenario and the Alternative Release Scenarios\r\n\r\nFor Program Level 3 processes such as those at Lion, one worst case flammable release scenario was reported in the Risk Management Plan (RMP) which represents the greatest distance to endpoint for the flammable hazard class.  Two alternate case scenarios were reported for the flammable hazard class.  \r\nSeveral release scenarios were evaluated in order to identify appropriate worst and alternate case flammable scenarios.  Of the scenarios evaluated, a catastrophic failure of Tank 536 was identified as the worst case flammable release scenario as the largest quant"

This release could potentially include approximately 2.9 million pounds of flammable hydrocarbon mixture resulting in a vapor cloud explosion (VCE) causing off-site consequences including an overpressure of greater than 1 psi.  The alternate case flammable release is a failure of the Tank 185 resulting in the release of approximately 340,000 pounds of flammable hydrocarbon mixture; this scenario was selected in accordance with 40 CFR 68.28(b)(1) because it is more likely to occur than the worst case scenario and it results in an offsite impact.  Such a release could result in a VCE and a boiling liquid expanding vapor explosion (BLEVE) resulting in off-site consequences of an overpressure greater than 1 psi and thermal radiation exposure greater than 5 kw/m2 for 40 seconds respectively.  Employee training, PPE, and both fixed and mobile fire suppression equipment are in place to mitigate the results of these releases.  \r\nIt should be noted that the worst case and alternate case flammable release scenarios presented in this hazard assessment are based on very conservative situations which are unlikely to occur.  A detailed Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) explosion consequence study of the refinery was completed by ABS Consulting in November 2012.  This CFD study evaluated a number of potential explosion scenarios within the process units at the refinery based on detailed, site-specific information.  None of the detailed scenarios considered in this study were predicted to result in an off-site overpressure of greater than 1 psi.\r\n  \r\n3.0\tGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program Steps\r\n\r\nThe refinery is regulated by the EPA RMP regulations as well as the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations.  The following summary addresses the necessary steps taken to comply with these regulations.\r\n\r\n3.1  Process Safety Information\r\n\r\nLion has developed the Process Safety Information (PSI) program with the part"

This program requires that all Lion employees contribute to the collection and retention of PSI that is covered under OSHA's PSM Standard, 29 CFR 1910.119 (d) (1-3) and EPA's RMP Standard, 40 CFR 68.65 (a-d).  Several process units at Lion contain a sufficient amount of highly hazardous chemicals to be covered by the OSHA PSM Standard and the EPA RMP Standard.  Lion recognizes the value of the good engineering and management principles promoted by these regulations and has chosen to apply some elements of the PSI Program to units and areas of the refinery that are not covered by the PSM/RMP regulations.  \r\nComplete and accurate written information concerning process chemistry, process technology, and process equipment is essential to an effective PSM Program and to a process hazard analysis (PHA).  The information addressed by this program is an essential resource for conducting PHA's; employee training, contractor safety, mechanical integrity, procedures, pre-startup safety reviews, management of change (MOC), emergency preparedness, and insurance and compliance audits.  Access to PSI information is provided to all employees through Lion's computerized document control system as well as a request through the PSM Department or any refinery management staff.  \r\nPSI information and documents are required for all regulatory covered process units and all capital projects for major overhauls of existing process units or installation of a new process unit.  It is important to recognize that information is generated throughout the life cycle of a process unit and as such, PSI information is often updated through the MOC or PHA revalidation procedures.  Chemical specific information, including exposure hazards, emergency response, and exposure treatment is provided in safety data sheets (SDS).  These documents are available to all employees via a co"

The evaluations are conducted by a team consisting of personnel familiar with the evaluation methods, refinery operations, maintenance, safety, training, and environmental compliance.  PHA documentation is maintained for the life of the process unit and available to all employees on the computerized document management system (OnBase).  The documentation is reviewed every five years and updated as necessary.

All incident reports are retained for five years.\r\n\r\n3.10  Employee Participation\r\n\r\nLion recognizes the valuable knowledge base that long-time employees can contribute to the safe and efficient operation of the processing units.  Employee input is important to the management of the various elements covered in the process safety management system.  Operations and Maintenance employees with working knowledge of the process units and equipment are consulted for input into process hazard analysis, mechanical integrity assurance, and pre-startup reviews.  Operations and Maintenance employees participate in the development and updating of procedures and training materials. Operations and Maintenance employees also participate in the periodic review of procedures and training materials to maintain the accuracy of these documents.  Employees are kept current to the changes within their work area through training, management of changes, pre-startup safety reviews, process hazard analyses, changes in process technology, equipment, emergency procedures, safety procedures, and any other conditions, which could affect their work environment.  This is conducted through the use of training materials, employee meetings, face-to-face communication, and materials available in the facility's computer system.  \r\n\r\n3.11  Contractors\r\n\r\nLion uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Prior to selecting a contractor, an evaluation is conducted on the past safety performance and current safety program of the contractor.

No incidents have occurred in the regulated process, which resulted in offsite or onsite injuries or property damage requiring reporting.\r\n\r\n5.0\tEmergency response Plan\r\n\r\n Lion maintains a written emergency response plan to respond to accidental releases of hazardous substances.  The plan includes the information necessary to respond to emergency situations including first aid, medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, and post-incident decontamination of affected areas.  To ensure readiness, emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced.  The plan is reviewed annually and updated in a timely manner as necessary.  This plan is incorporated into the Union County Emergency Operations Plan as part of the Union County LEPC.\r\n\r\n6.0\tSafe Work Practices\r\n\r\nCritical safe work policies and procedures have been established. These include control of entry and access, lockout/tagout, first break of process equipment, hotwork, and confined space work.  These policies and procedures are in the refinery Safety Manual.  This is an evergreen document and is subject to review and modifications as regulations and circumstances change.  Any changes to the safety manual are documented and distributed by the Management of Change procedure.\r\n\r\nHot work permits must be at the location of the job being performed and must be available to all people performing the work.
