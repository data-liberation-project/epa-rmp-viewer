The facility\u00c2\u00bfs service area is composed of five (5) contributing municipalities, including the Borough of Carlisle, Middlesex Township, North Middleton Township, South Middleton Township, and Silver Spring Township.  The wastewater treatment plant, located at 54 Middleton Road in Middlesex Township, processes up to 7.0 million gallons per day of wastewater and discharges to the Conodoguinet Creek under NPDES Permit No. PA0026077.   Wastewater treatment processes include grit and coarse screenings removal, primary sedimentation, secondary activated sludge treatment, clarification, filtration, and disinfection.  Solid material removed from this process is stabilized using post lime addition, dewatered, and utilized for agricultural purposes through land application.  The plant is operated 24 hours per day, 365 days per year.\n\nThe WWTP includes a disinfection system comprised of a chlorine scale room, which contains three (3) one ton containers of chlorine liquefied under pressure, a chlorinator room containing chlorinators, various safety equipment, and instrumentation consisting of automated chlorine and flow recorders, electrical panels, and a gas detector/alarm unit.  Up to three (3) one ton containers may be on site simultaneously.  The automated chlorinator system extracts chlorine gas from the storage containers through remote vacuum regulators and dissolves this gas in water to form a disinfection solution that is used to kill pathogenic bacteria and micro-organisms in the treated wastewater effluent prior to its discharge into the creek. Treatment plant operators regularly check the rooms and equipment, inventory the rate of chlorine use, and adjust the rate as necessary.  The maximum intended inventory of chlorine gas for planning purposes is 6,000 pounds.\n\nAtmospheric dispersion modeling was performed using the"
