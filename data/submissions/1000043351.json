Description of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\r\n\r\nBMCP handles or manufactures hydrogen, methane, ethane, ethylene, acetylene, propane, propylene, isobutane, 2-methylpropene, butane, butene, crude butadiene, pentane, pentene, and isopentane as materials or RMP-regulated flammable mixtures.  Chlorine is used for water treatment and boron trifluoride is used for synthetic lube processes.  BMCP is organized into four business units: Olefins, Aromatics, Synthetics and Catalyst.  Only Olefins, Aromatics, and Synthetics are RMP-covered processes per the criteria in 40 CFR Part 68.\r\n\r\n\r\n3.  General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\n\r\nTo ensure that our risk management program is appropriately developed and implemented, the BMCP Plant Manager has assigned the role of RMP Coordinator to the Beaumont Complex SHE Manager.  The Beaumont Complex SHE Manager, acting with the authority delegated directly from the BMCP Plant Manager, has the responsibility for the development and implementation of our risk management programs.\r\n\r\nBMCP has developed effective programs to comply with the industry's most stringent environmental, health, and safety standards.  Our plant adheres to the American Chemistry Council's mandatory Responsible Care Program.  This site was the first in the nation to have all of its facilities certified as STAR facilities in OSHA's VPP.  Facilities in the STAR program are required to demonstrate exemplary safety performance and agree to work cooperatively with OSHA to serve as an example for the industry as a whole.  They are audited by OSHA for compliance every few years.  Heritage sites in BMCP were among the first facilities in the nation to earn the prestigious STAR recognition and have maintained it through nine OSHA inspections over a twenty-nine year period.\r\n\r\nBMCP takes a systematic, proactive approach to preventing accidental releases of hazardous chemicals."

In addition to our industry-leading management programs, we have designed state-of-the-art systems and equipment to control, prevent, detect, and mitigate potential accidental releases.  An important tool for managing changes, for example, is our Safe Operations Committee (SOC), which is a review body to ensure that high quality, cost effective facilities, procedures, techniques, and maintenance reduce to the minimum practical level the likelihood of personnel injury, fire or explosion, thereby ensuring a safe and reliable operation.\r\n\r\nBMCP employs extensive mechanical integrity and preventive maintenance programs to ensure the integrity of our equipment and safety systems.  Our mechanical integrity program uses equipment surveillance and preventive maintenance activities to identify equipment that may be in need of repair or replacement, before failure occurs.  This program also specifies the repairs (or parts replacement) needed to maintain equipment in acceptable operating condition.\r\n\r\nWe train our employees to safely perform their assigned tasks.

We conduct ongoing training and preplanning for emergencies.  We steward progress of process safety and RMP prevention program elements as key performance indicators.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn addition to these actions, the Chemical Plant is working to implement new systems to assist in improving safety performance in the site.
