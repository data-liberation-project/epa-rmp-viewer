If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with local emergency response personnel to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n\nFACILITY INFORMATION\n* Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for sale to farmers.\n* The maximum quantity stored would be 162,000 pounds.\n\n\nWORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE CASE SCENARIO\nThe worst case release of anhydrous ammonia would be the release from the largest vessel identified as holding 97,200 pounds and the second vessel holding 64,800 pounds of anhydrous ammonia liquified under pressure by design standards.  By using RMP* Comp it was determined that a release of this would meet the endpoint of 2 miles.  The impact would be on residents of about 60 people.\n\nThe alternatvie case release of anhydrous ammonia was to demonstrate an overfilled tank while off loading.  The case would show a release of 100 pounds of ammonia over a 10 minute period with an effect of a reading of .1 miles to the the toxic endpoint.  Estimated receptors would be 20 people.\n\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT\nIt was found that there has been no accidents or reportable off-premises release at the facility.  The emergency response program is on file with the Local Emergency Planning Coordinator.  Safety improvement is an ongoing process at this faciltiy.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions."
