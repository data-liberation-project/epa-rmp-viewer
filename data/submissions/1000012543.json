Arclin Toledo is also committed to preserving the natural environment and conducting our operations without adverse impact to the surrounding community.  These commitments require adherance to applicable laws, regulations and standards.  \n\n\n\nSafety, health and environmental protection considerations are intrinsic to all work at Arclin Toledo and are essential to the overall progress, productivity and cost effectiveness of the facility.  Each individual employee possesses knowledge and control of the hazards and consequences of all work for which he or she is responsible.  In addition, every employee has the right and responsibility to remedy or to report - without fear of reprisal - any practice, situation or action which endangers people or the environment.  These tenets are key ingredients of acceptable individual behavior and responsible management.  No activity is so urgent or important that our standards for safety, health and environmental protection may be compromised.\n\n\n\nThis policy shall be communicated to all employees and made available to the public.\n\n\n\nFacility Information\n\n\n\nThe primary activities at Arclin are the manufacture of formaldehyde and the production of specialty resins.  Formaldehyde is produced from the processing of methanol delivered to the plant via rail car and tank truck.  The maximum quantity of formaldehyde in storage in one vessel is 50,000 gallons at a concentration of 53.5% by weight. \n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\n\n\nAll covered processes at Arclin are in Program 3 and meet the requirements of the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) program.  The existing OSHA PSM program meets nearly all RMP requirements.  Where the programs d"

      "SummaryText": "iffer, the Arclin's program elements have been expanded to incorporate RMP issues.  An example would be that the compliance audit procedures required as part of Arclin's PSM program have been modified to include evaluations of the RMP implementation.  Another example would be that pre-startup review procedures have been modified to incorporate reevaluation of the facility accident scenarios to determine whether the worst case and alternate case scenarios for releases are still consistent with the design and operation of the process being started.\n\n\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\n\n\n6/24/2009: Arclin Toledo had a suspected formaldehyde vapor release that was reported to the City of Toledo by a third party which resulted in evacuations and sheltering in place. Incident responders accessed the site and found no measurable formaldehyde in the area. There were no deaths/injuries on or off site as a result of this event, nor was there off-site property or environmental damage.  \n\n\n\n3/11/2010: Arclin experienced a leak of formaldehyde inside of a containment dike that came from a storage tank. The quantity of material released was determined to be below the reportable quantity; however, as a precaution courtesy notifications were made to regulatory agencies pending quantification immediately after the release was discovered. There were no deaths/injuries on or off site as a result of this event, nor was there off-site property or environmental damage.  \n\n\n\n12/21/2012: The rupture disk on one of the resin reactors vented causing a quantity of in-process resin material to be released from the reactor. The resin deposited on trees, structures, vehicles, roadways and vegetation on Arclin property and neighboring properties. There were no deaths/injuries on or off site as a result of this event.\n\n\n\n \n\nEmergency Response Program\n\n\n\nArclin Toledo has established a facility emergency response plan that meets the requirements of both the OSHA PSM program and the EPA RMP program.

Local emergency response and medical treatment personnel have worked with Arclin to provide for the safe control and treatment of releases of formaldehyde.  Arclin employees receive mandatory training on emergency response procedures and emergency response equipment use, inspection, testing, and maintenance.  Emergency response procedures are reevaluated as part of the management of change and pre-startup review requirements of the PSM and RMP programs.\n\n"
