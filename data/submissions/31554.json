      "SummaryText": "Penreco is a manufacturer of high purity specialty oils often used in food, cosmetic, and pharmaceutical applications.  This Risk Management Plan (RMP) is a required re-submission of the plan originally submitted in June 1999.\n\nA review of the RMP regulation has indicated that 20% oleum is the only chemical used in a process at the site, at any one time, in quantities above the RMP threshold applicability level.  Therefore, a worst case scenario review was performed for oleum.  This chemical is used in the white oil oleum process.  The results indicated that a potential release of oleum could not affect offsite receptors under release conditions mandated by the EPA.  The area potentially impacted does not contain any \u00bfsensitive receptors\u00bf.  Therefore, the facility qualifies for Program Level 1 compliance in accordance with the RMP regulation.  No offsite population or sensitive receptors are within the zone of influence as defined by the EPA.\n\nPenreco is committed to maintaining comprehensive accident prevention and emergency response programs which meet and/or exceed all federal and state requirements.  Injury and Incident Free is Penreco\u00bfs safety and environmental principle.   The company\u00bfs environmental, safety and health policy is as follows.\n\nProtecting the environment and the safety and health of employees, customers, contractors, communities, and the public is fundamental to the way Penreco conducts its business. To integrate environmental, safety, and health management into business activities, Penreco will:\n\n1.\tPursue excellence in the design, construction, operation, and restoration of all properties and facilities;\n2.\tBe a responsible steward of all products and services;\n3.\tTrain and prepare employees for emergencies and other contingencies;\n4.\tCommunicate openly regarding business activities;\n5.\tAssign clear responsibilities to all employees and contractors;\n6.\tProvide employees with resources and training to meet assigned responsibilities;\n7.\tAssess th"

Specifically, oleum is stored in an aboveground storage tank above the threshold quantity.\n\nThe worst-case scenario is determined to be a failure of the oleum aboveground storage tank.  Since the facility is only an RMP Program Level 1, an alternate release scenario was not required or developed.  Mitigation measures to control the release include a concrete dike six feet in height that would be capable of containing > 100% of the volume of the storage tank.  Further, the tank is located approximately in the geographic center of the Penreco facility (not at the property border).  Penreco is prepared to handle a worst-case release by training its emergency responders in Hazwoper Level 3, 40 CFR, Section 1910.120.\n\nPrevention steps include a strict inspection schedule, the implementation of numerous procedures, and carefully observing Process Safety Management guidelines.\n\nThere have been no accidents at Penreco in the past five years involving the regulated substance that meet the criteria outlined in 40 CFR, Part 68.42.\n\nA comprehensive emergency response program/plan has been developed and is regularly used to train both in-house and local area responders."
