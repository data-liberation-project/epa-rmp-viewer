It is in compliance with all EPA Prevention Program and OSHA Process Safety Management Program requirements.  The responsibility of the RMP has been assigned to the WWTP operator who will review the program at least on an annual basis.\n\nProcess Safety Information A? The Shasta Lake WWTP has developed and maintains written safety information about the chlorination and de-chlorination process and the technology of process equipment used.  The operation of this facility adheres to the guidelines of the Chlorine Institute and to the OSHA regulations regarding Process Safety Management.  Process Safety Information is readily available to all personnel and is updated when changes are made.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA) A? A PHA review was conducted in June 2009 appropriate to the complexity of the chlorination process that identified, evaluated, and controlled potential hazards using the A?What-If ChecklistA? and A?Hazard Review ChecklistsA? processes.  These processes include the analysis of hazards due to equipment malfunction and human error.  It describes steps used to detect and monitor releases.  This PHA will be updated every five years (next PHA in June 2014) and the Shasta Lake WWTP and WTP will conduct reviews whenever major changes occur to the process.\n\nOperating Procedures A? The WWTP and WTP plant operators have prepared written standard operating procedures specific to their operations that provide clear instructions for the safe operational activities associated with the process.  These procedures are included in the facility operations manual and the Process Safety Management manual.  The manual includes procedures for operation of all phases of the processes, and normal and emergency s"

Training documentation is maintained on all applicable employees, refresher training is provided quarterly.  The training documentation will be reviewed at least annual to ensure trainings have been completed.\n\nMechanical Integrity A? Both the WWTP and WTP have a preventive maintenance program (Maintain It) that insures the mechanical integrity of its chlorination / de-chlorination processing equipment, which includes periodic inspection, testing and an annual overhaul of critical processing equipment.  Maintenance procedures are written for each step of the maintenance process and assigned to appropriate personnel.\n\nManagement of Change (MOC) A? The WWTP and WTP have implemented written MOC procedures to manage changes (except changes in-kind) to process chemical technology, equipment and procedures.  Employees affected by a change in a process are informed of and trained in the change prior to start up of the process or affected part of the process.  Safety information and operation procedures are updated accordingly.\n\nPre-Startup Review A? Written standard operational procedures have been developed to allow operators to perform a pre-startup safety review for new and modified chlorination equipment, or where modification to the process is significant enough to require a change in the process safety information.\n\nCompliance Audits A? A PSM compliance audit was performed in June 2009 and will be performed every three years (next June 2012) to verify that the procedures and practices are adequate and are being followed.  The WWTP and WTP operators and additional qualified resources will perform the audit.  A report will be developed t"

The Shasta Lake WWTP and WTP operators will investigate any incident involving the chemical system which could result or does result in a release of chlorine or sulfur dioxide gas.  The investigation will be conducted within 48 hours of the incident.  All key factors will be addressed and recommendations for correction will result.  Affected personnel will review the findings of the investigation.  The report will be kept for 5 years.\n\nEmployee Participation A? The managers and operators of the Shasta Lake WWTP and WTP participated in the process hazard analysis conducted in June 2009.  The PHA will be made available to all affected employees and is kept at the facilities in the RMP - Process Safety Management binder.\n\nHot Work Permit A? A hot work permit process has been developed and implemented for hot work operations conducted on or near the chlorination and de-chlorination process.  The permit documents the fire and accident prevention requirements and is implemented prior to beginning any hot work operations.  The permit is kept at the work site until the completion of any hot work.  All completed hot work permits will be retained for at least one year following completion of work.\n\nContractors A? Contractors working on or near the water treatment plant are required to comply with the regulatory provisions of the OSHA process safety management standard.  A form has been developed to address the following: contractor safety program; informing contractor employees of the hazards on the site; review of the emergency evacuation plans; record contractor meetings of the plans; and require contractors to train their employees on the hazards of the process.
