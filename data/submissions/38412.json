As required, worst case scenarios are presented in\n\nthe RMP for one toxic substance and one flammable substance.  Alternative scenarios were\n\nprepared for each of the toxic substances with worst case endpoints located offsite and for one\n\nflammable substance.  The endpoint represents the distance at which a released substance must\n\ntravel before it disperses sufficiently to no longer pose a hazard to the public.  \n\n\n\nFor the worst case scenario, EPA has defined a worst-case release as the release of the largest\n\nquantity of a regulated substance from a vessel or process line failure that results in the greatest\n\ndistance to a specified endpoint.  For the worst-case analysis, the possible causes of the\n\nworst-case release or the probability that such a release might occur are not considered.

The release\n\n     rate according to OCA Guidance was calculated to be 0.012 pounds per minute. \n\n     However, a release rate of 0.2 pounds per minute was entered into the RMP Submit\n\n     document since this is the lowest value that can be entered int"

For formaldehyde the release was assumed to occur as a result of the uncoupling or\n\nrupture of a  transfer hose during unloading operations.  For flammable materials, the alternative\n\nrelease scenario assumed that dimethylamine was released as a result of the uncoupling or\n\nrupture of a hose during unloading operations. The durations for releasing these materials from a\n\nvessel/pipe for the alternative release scenarios were assumed to occur over a 45-second time\n\nperiod since the unloading operations are supervised.
