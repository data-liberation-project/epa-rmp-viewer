              "Description": "ammonia refrigeration system\n\n\n\nAmericold Logistics Services\n\nPrevention Program Description\n\n\n\nThe Americold logistics Services Prevention Program is built on the OSHA Process Safety Management Standard for ammonia refrigeration systems. The first element in the safe function of ammonia refrigeration equipment is in the design itself. All components in the system were designed and installed in compliance with ANSI, ASHRAE, ASME, pressure vessel codes and all other applicable design safety standards in effect at the time of construction. In order for this system to function safely and effectively over a long period of time, it must be properly maintained and monitored for system integrity and functional efficiency. Maintenance and monitoring is accomplished by employees trained to follow safe procedures when operating the equipment from normal start up to running and emergency shut down. Also built into the system are automated and manual safeguards that monitor and maintain pressures, temperatures, liquid levels and warning systems that alert operators to respond early to operational deviations before they become emergencies.\n\n\n\nOperator training also includes participation in hazard analysis studies and emergency response procedures that permit hands-on practice in the use of personal protective equipment in an emergency scenario. The hazard analysis (what-if) checklist helps operators and emergency responders understand how to evaluate and manage an emergency situation safely and effectively in order to mitigate the potential releases. Lockout/tagout and the line opening procedures are very important for preventing further hazards around malfunctioning equipment or when making even minor repairs on the system.\n\n\n\nGeneral employee training involves knowledge of ammonia hazards, warning system and evacuation procedures. Coordinated emergency response planning is established with the Brown County LEPC and a written offsite emergency response plan is reviewed annually. \n\n",

Americold Logistics Services is a company that has grown with a guiding principle that we do what's right.   This principle implies a commitment to provide a safe work environment above and beyond general regulatory requirements.   Reducing the risks and affects of ammonia releases is a primary consideration of the safety programs and planning that goes on during routine operations.  The company employee activities, including safety are subject to key performance indicators.  The organization measures results to constantly improve risk exposure.  The balance of productivity, minimized risk, safety compliance, environmental stewardship and profitability are all part of the measure of success. \n\nProcess safety program elements are built to overlap with employee health and safety training programs.  An employee emergency action and fire prevention plan is in place to provide safe egress and procedures for employees to follow during emergency situations, whether an evacuation or shelter in place.  Refrigeration employees and facility managers undergo at a minimum awareness level first responder training.  An emergency response plan and emergency response personnel are in place at the facility.  Emergency response is provided by Green Bay Fire Department & Brown County HazMat Team in the event of an emergency situation requiring outside assistance.\n\n\n\nEfforts to minimize the risk of an accidental ammonia release are achieved by adhering to and exceeding compliance requirements with attention focused on employee training and the integrity of the ammonia process equipment.
