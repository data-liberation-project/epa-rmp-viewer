THE CITY UTILIZES CHLORINE GAS AND SULFUR DIOXIDE GAS IN ITS TREATMENT PROCESS. THE 1 TON CONTAINERS THESE GASES ARE CONTAINED IN ARE ASME CODED VESSELS. DURING THE DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION OF THIS PLANT, THE ENGINEERS USED GUIDELINES SET FORTH BY THE NATIONAL CHLORINE INSTITUTE. ALL EXTERNAL PIPING IS PROTECTED FROM ACCIDENTAL DAMAGE BY CHANNEL IRON. THE FEED EQUIPMENT IS DESIGNED TO AUTOMATICALLY SHUT DOWN IF A MAJOR LEAK OCCURS IN TNE PIPING. ALL EQUIPMENT IS INSPECTED DAILY. ALL PERSONEL THAT WORK INSIDE THE PLANT HAVE RECEIVED INSTRUCTIONS AND TRAINING IN THE SAFE HANDLING OF CHLORINE AND SULFUR DIOXIDE AS WELL AS THE USE OF A SELF CONTAINED BREATHING APPARATUS. EACH EMPOLYEE IS REQUIRED TO ATTEND A CLASS ON HOW TO READ AND INTERPRET A MSDS SHEET WITHIN HIS OR HERS FIRST 6 MONTHS OF SERVICE. AS A FIRST RESPONDER EACH HAS BEEN TRAINED IN THE PROPER PROCEDURES, AND COORDINATES ALL EMERGENCY RESPONSES. A COPY OF THE CITIES EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM HAS BEEN FILED WITH THE HENDERSON COUNTY EMERGENCY RESPONSE COORDINATORS OFFICE. ALL THOUGH A PORTION OF TOWN WOULD BE AFFECTED IF THE WORSE CASE SCENARIO AS DESCRIBED BY THE EPA WERE TO OCCUR, THE PROBABILITY OF SUCH AN OCCURRENCE IS HIGHLY IMPROBABLE.
