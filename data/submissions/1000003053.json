Both a worst case scenario and an alternative case scenario were developed.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system is designed and constructed in accordance with ANSI/IIAR 2-1992 Standard for Equipment, Design, and Installation of Ammonia Mechanical Refrigeration Systems.  To prevent and mitigate accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia, Sara Lee Corporation - Newbern, TN has implemented several precautionary measures.\n\nSara Lee Corporation - Newbern, TN has developed and implemented a PSM program pursuant to OSHA regulations and as such, has evaluated the system for potential anhydrous ammonia releases.  Some of the controls installed to prevent catastrophic releases of ammonia are process equipment (vents, pressure relief valves, backup pumps, and manual shutoffs) and automated controls (automatic shut-off), ammonia leak detection system, and electrical distribution system grounding.  In addition, Sara Lee Corporation - Newbern, TN has trained personnel to respond to potential ammonia releases (Emergency Response/Hazardous Materials team).\n\nSara Lee Corporation - Newbern, TN has developed standard operating procedures for all employees and contractors that have contact with the ammonia refrigeration system that incorporate safety measures into the procedures.  These safety procedures were developed by refrigeration system operators and are reviewed at a frequency sufficient to assure that they reflect current operating practice, including changes that result from changes in the process chemicals, technology, and equipment, and cha"

Pursuant to written management of change procedures established by Sara Lee Corporation - Newbern, TN, any changes to the operating procedures are to be communicated to affected employees.\n\nSara Lee Corporation - Newbern, TN understands that maintaining the refrigeration system in good working order is essential to preventing accidental releases; therefore Sara Lee Corporation - Newbern, TN has implemented a preventative maintenance program.  The preventative maintenance program is scheduled, documented and managed using log sheets to ensure that regular maintenance occurs on the system.  These log sheets are maintained in the Refrigeration office for three years.  Also, to ensure the mechanical integrity of critical refrigeration system components, equipment tests are performed.  Specifically, the equipment is tested to detect corrosion.  This equipment consists of pressure vessels, headers, and piping.\n\nTo ensure that Sara Lee Corporation - Newbern, TN\u00c2\u00bfs control measures are effective in maintaining the safe operation of the plant, regularly scheduled audits are performed on the ammonia refrigeration system:\n\n- In accordance with the PSM program, Sara Lee Corporation - Newbern, TN conducts detailed PSM compliance audits every three years.  Each audit incorporates review of process safety information, process hazard analysis, operating procedures, training programs, system mechanical integrity, management of change, pre-start up review procedures, compliance audit procedures, incident investigation procedures, employee participation programs, hot work permit procedures, and contractor safety procedures.\n\n- In addition, the local fire department participates in an emergency response drill at the facility on an annual basis.\n\n- The USDA maintains a daily presence for"
