Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies.\nThis facility processes the covered chemical, which is listed in Section 302 of the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act. The same properties that make the covered chemical valuable for protection of health and living standard also make it necessary to observe safety precautions to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to all stakeholders.  Vertex has implemented and maintains the elements of the Vertex Risk Management Program for all operating facilities.  Vertex senior management leadership implements through policy, participation, communications and resource commitments continuous improvement of performance to control risks of any sort to the community that could be controlled by Vertex.  It is Vertex policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and State rules and regulations.  Vertex is committed to a secure and safe environment, which depends upon the manner in which we handle the covered chemical, the safety devices inherent in the design of this facility, the safe handling procedures that we use, and the training of our personnel.\n\nVertex emergency response program is based upon published industry standards, the American Chemistry Council Responsible Care? Management Systems, and applicable regulations.  The emergency response plan includes procedures for notification of all required Federal, State and Local authorities and notification of any potentially affected neighbors.\n\n2. Vertex facility and regulated substances handled. \nThe primary purpose of this facility is to provide sodium hypochlorite for bi-state area customers.  This site is remote from neighbors and protected with natural obstacles.  Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel and authorized contractors.  Inventory is maintained at lowest amounts practical to insure continued supply to the water purification and commercial needs of customers."
