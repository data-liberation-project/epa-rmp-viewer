The facility stores and distributes fresh and frozen foods using anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant in a closed-loop system.  Ammonia is the safest refrigerant available and has excellent warning properties; it is extremely pungent at levels far below dangerous concentrations.  In calculating worst-case and alternative scenarios, efforts were made in all cases to overestimate rather than underestimate the effects of a release.  The plant has been operating safely since 1995. \n\nWorst-Case Scenario\nA worst case scenario is required to be documented in the RMP.  Based on the requirements of the RMP rule, it is assumed that the largest vessel in the system fails catastrophically, releasing its entire contents over a 10-minute period.  The release is modeled using RMP*Comp? software. \n\nAlternative Release Scenario\nThe alternative release scenario for the ammonia refrigeration process is based on a potential hazard identified during the Process Hazard Analysis conducted during documentation of the facility prevention plan.  In this scenario, a condenser tube develops a crack, releasing ammonia gas to the atmosphere.  No mitigation is considered in the scenario calculations as the release occurs outdoors.  The release is evaluated according to the procedures documented in General Risk Management Program Guidance, Appendix E, Supplemental Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration Facilities, May 2004 and verified with RMP*Comp? software.\n\nRelease Prevention Program \nFred Meyer implements a prevention program to comply with the requirements of the Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (WAC 2"

      "SummaryText": "96-67-017), which is designed to prevent accidental releases of all chemicals held in quantities over given thresholds.  The PSM program addresses all required elements including employee participation, process safety information and system drawings, operating procedures, hot work permits, management of change, mechanical integrity, training, pre-startup review, compliance audits, process hazard analysis, contractor safety, incident investigation and emergency response.  The system has many safety features built in including high and low level controls and alarms, pressure relief valves, automatic and manually controlled valves and shutoffs, check valves, detectors and programmable control logic capabilities.\n\nFive Year Accident History\nPer the requirements of 40 CFR 68.42, facilities must include a five-year accident history for all accidental releases from covered processes that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.  There have been no such accidents at this facility in the past five years.\n\nEmergency Response\nThe Fred Meyer Puyallup Distribution Center maintains a written emergency response plan per WAC 296-62-3112 to facilitate safe response to accidental ammonia releases.  The plan identifies personnel designated and trained to conduct the necessary duties during a response.  Responsibilities include notification of and communication with local responders and authorities, coordinating and conducting responses, as well as maintenance of emergency equipment and trained personnel."
