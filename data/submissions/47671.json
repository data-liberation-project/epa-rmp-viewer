The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from the South Casting Department Chlorine Storage and Delivery System.  The scenario involves the release of 8000 pounds of Chlorine in a gaseous form over 10 minutes.  Passive mitigation controls such as enclosures are also taken into account to calculate the scenario.  At Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 meters per second (m/s) wind speed, the maximum distance of 9.9 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.0087 milligrams per liter (mg/l).\n\nOne alternative release scenario has been submitted for each toxic substance present in Program 2 and Program 3 processes cumulatively.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for Chlorine involves a release from the Chlorine Storage and Delivery System of the South Cast House.  The scenario involves the release of 450.00 pounds of Chlorine in a gaseous form over a period of thirty minutes.  Passive  mitigation controls such as enclosures are taken into account to calculate the scenario.  In addition, the release is assumed to be controlled by an active mitigation measure, which include sprinkler system(s).  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.0087 mg/L of Chlorine is 0.38 miles.\n\n4.

Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nCommonwealth Aluminum Lewisport, LLC.,is committed to employee, public, and environmental safety.  This commitment is illustrated through the implemetation of a accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  Commonwealth Aluminum Lewisport, LLC. is continually establishing and revising policies to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances into the surrounding communities and natural environments.  Trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.\n\n2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nCommonwealth Aluminum Lewisport, LLC. is classified as a secondary aluminum processor whose primary activities encompass the melting and refining of scrap aluminum to produce aluminum ingot via direct chill methods; rolling ingots into aluminum rolls/products, and; performing coil coating processes on aluminum rolls.  This facility has one (1) regulated substance, chlorine, present above the specified threshold quantities as stipulated in 40 CFR 68.  This regulated substance is utilized in the degassing and refining processes of molten aluminum in the Casting Departments.\n\nThe maximum inventory of Chlorine (ten - 750 pound cylinders - 7500 pounds) that can be effected at Commonwealth Aluminum Lewisport, LLC. resides in a remote location found in the South Casting Department.\n\n3. The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including\nadministrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\n\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used the look-up tables and equations provided by the EPA in the RMP Offsite"
