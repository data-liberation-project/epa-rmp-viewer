The Risk Management program and Process Safety Program formalizes and documents these activities.  Johns Manville is committed to conducting its operation in a safe, responsible manner and to reducing risks to health and the environment.\r\n\r\nA description of your facility and the regulated substance handled:\r\n  This facility manufacturers Polyisocyanurate insulation panels for the construction industry.  A flammable mixture containing two related substances, n-Pentane and Isopentane is used in the manufacturing process.\r\n\r\nThe worst case and alternative release scenarios:\r\n  The hypothetical worst case scenario is a failure of the 30,000 gallon storage tank when filled to the greatest amount allowed (90%) resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  According to hazard modeling software, using the worst case assumptions, impacts from this explosion could cause injuries and damage property located in an area between the storage tank and the hazard endpoint.  The hazard endpoint in this case corresponds to an overpressure of 1 pound per square inch (psi) and is estimated to extend .4 miles from the storage tank.\r\n  The alternative release scenario involves a hose rupture caused by a truck that pulls away while the hose is still connected to the Pentane tank.  This would result in a spill of approximately 7 gallons (this amount is the maximum quantity of pentane that could be in the hose.)  If a spark were to ignite the spilled liquid and vapors, of the resulting explosion could impact persons or property located within 150 feet of the unloading area.\r\n\r\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical specific prevention steps:\r\n  A prevention program is in place to minimize the risk of a Pentane release in accordance with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Managem"

Some of the specific activities in the prevention program are described below.\r\n  An in-depth Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) of the system was conducted prior to start up and numerous risk reduction measures have been implemented.  Qualified personnel will revalidate the PHA every five years.\r\n  The Pentane system was designed in accordance with all applicable codes and standards (NFPA, ANSI, ASME, ect.)  A Pre start up safety review confirmed that the construction and equipment comply with design specifications.\r\n  Written operating procedures are used for training and directing the work of operators, who will receive refresher training at least every three years.\r\n  Critical equipment is maintained, tested and inspected on a planned periodic basis to ensure proper operating conditions.\r\n\r\nFive year accident history:\r\n  An employee report that he collected approximately 2 gallons pentane in a catch bucket that came from the Nitrogen line, when he was disconnecting the lines immediately after an unload.  During the investigation we verified that all operating procedures were followed.  We were not able to identify what the root cause was, this was the first and only time an event like this has taken place.  This event took place on January 6, 2009.\r\n\r\nThe emergency response program:\r\n  A written emergency response plan is maintained at the facility, and our personnel are trained in proper notification and evacuation procedures.  In the event of an emergency, this facility would request immediate assistance from the Jacksonville Fire and Rescue Department.\r\n\r\nPlanned changes to improve safety:\r\n Safety has been a part of the working culture at Johns Manville.  The Pentane process is current state of the art and is designed to be as safe as feasibly possible.  At this time, no further improvements are planned."
