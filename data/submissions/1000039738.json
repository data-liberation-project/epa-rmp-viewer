      "SummaryText": "The Ute Water Treatment Plant is a 34 MGD conventional water treatment plant located outside of Palisade, Colorado. The Ute Water Conservancy District provides water throughout the Grand Valley. The plant has been producing potable water disinfected with gas chlorine since 1964. A maximum of 20,000 lbs of chlorine gas is stored on-site.  \n\n\n\nUte water has taken many steps to ensure safety of its employees and neighboring residents. We recently hosted a tour and training with local emergency response personnel including Grand Junction Fire Department Hazmat, Palisade Police and Fire, Sherriff's office representatives, State Highway Patrol, the Mesa County Emergency Manager, and the Regional Dispatch Center. The Ute Water Treatment Plant Superintendent has been active with the Mesa County Local Emergency Planning Committee for 5 years. Numerous staff are certified in NIMS ICS and have their 40 hour Hazwoper certification. Ute Water feels that it has done everything possible to limit a chlorine gas release and to ensure a quick and effective response in the case of a release.\n\n\n\nThe Ute Water Conservancy District utilized the following elements to prevent chemical releases:\n\n\n\n1.  Clearly written Standard Operating Procedures for chlorine container change-over and receiving of ton containers. These procedures are strictly adhered to.\n\n\n\n2.  Annual chlorine safety training, respiratory-wearer training, fit testing and medical qualification exams for all individuals involved in chlorine container change-overs and maintenance.\n\n\n\n3.  Preventative maintenance is performed on all chlorine feed equipment, the chlorine container hoist, scales, chlorine monitors, and the exhaust fan.\n\n\n\n4.  The water treatment plant is a secure facility with barbed wire fence around the perimeter and a camera at the main entrance gate. Intruder alarms on doors and tank hatches are tied into SCADA and the auto-dialer. The chlorine room is secured at all times and has a warning sign reading \"Poi"

In the event of a chlorine gas leak, audible and visual alarms (outside of the chlorine room and at the exhaust vent) would activate. The plant's SCADA system and auto-dialer would go into alarm. In the event of a major chlorine gas leak, the emergency siren could be activated.\n\n\n\n6.  A recently revised and practiced Emergency Response Plan explains actions to be taken in the case of a minor or major chlorine gas leak including evacuation of the facility and the neighboring residences.\n\n\n\nUte Water has used chlorine for disinfections since the facility was built. There has never been an accidental release of chlorine.  \n\n\n\nThere are no future plans for upgrades to our chlorine feed or storage equipment. \n\n"
