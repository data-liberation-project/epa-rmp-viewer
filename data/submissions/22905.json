      "SummaryText": "The Athens Utility Board (AUB) owns and operates the Vernon Wade Water Treatment Plant (WTP) which is located in Athens, Tennessee having a population of approximately 14,000 individuals.  The Vernon Wade WTP has a design throughput capacity of approximately 4.0 million gallons per day and utilizes chlorine as a disinfection agent prior to introduction into the Athens Water Distribution System.  Current chlorine management practices involve the use of (1) 2,000 pound cylinder, not requiring submission under the threshold quantity requirements for risk management plan submission.  However, because of the operational flexibility and reduction in personnel handling risks associated with the delivery of multiple 2,000 pound cylinders of chlorine, AUB has prepared this risk management plan for submission and approval by EPA.  It is anticipated that no more than (2) full 2,000 pound cylinders will be co-located at the Oostanaula Creek WWTP at any one time.  Chlorine is the only regulated chemical above 40 CFR 68 threshold quantities.  There are no flammable chemicals or substances stored at the Vernon Wade WTP."
