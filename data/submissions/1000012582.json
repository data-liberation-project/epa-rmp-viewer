Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:\n\n\n\nWe at National Frozen Foods Corporation are committed to employee, public, and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. If such a release does occur, our highly trained emergency response personnel are on hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  We are also completely coordinated with the Albany Fire Department who provides additional emergency response expertise for our facility.\n\n\n\n2.  The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled:\n\n\n\nWe have 1 regulated substance present at our facility, which is Ammonia (anhydrous).  The maximum inventory of Ammonia (anhydrous) that is expected to be present in this facility, based on process/operational requirements, is 76,809 pounds.\n\n\n\n3.  The Worst-Case Release Scenario and the Alternative Release Scenario, including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario:\n\n\n\nTo perform the required off-site consequence analysis for our facility, we have used the EPA's RMP Comp program.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios:\n\n\n\nToxic Worst-Case Analysis:\n\n\n\nThe Worst-Case scenario involves a catastrophic release from National Frozen Foods Corporation's main plant ammonia refrigeration system.  The scenario involves the release of 8,038 lb. Of Ammonia (anhydrous) in a liquid form over 10 minutes.  The release rate (lbs/min) is calculated to be 804.  A distance to endpoint of 1.5 miles is obtained which affects a residential population of 8,449 within this distance.\n\n\n\nToxic Alternative-C"

The scenario involves the release of 1,700 lb. Of Ammonia (anhydrous) in a gaseous form over 10 minutes.  The release rate (lbs/min) is calculated to be 170 and a distance to endpoint of .30 miles is obtained which affects a residential population of 177.\n\n\n\nThere are no Flammables Worst-Case or Alternative-Case scenarios for this process.\n\n\n\n4.  The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps:\n\n\n\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR Part 68 of the EPA.  One process at our facility is subject to the OSHA PSM Standard under 29 CFR 1910.119.  Our facility is also subject to EPCRA Section 302 notification requirements.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our facility.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information:\n\n\n\nNational Frozen Foods Corporation maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes at the facility.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis:\n\n\n\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analysis is the What-If Checklist.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are re-validated at  a regular interval of every three years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures:\n\n\n\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, National Frozen Foods Corporation maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures addr"

The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the process.\n\n\n\nTraining:\n\n\n\nNational Frozen Foods Corporation has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  New employees receive basic classroom training in process operations followed by on-the-job supervision until they are deemed competent to work independently.  Operators are also required to complete and pass the RETA (Refrigeration Engineers Technicians Association) CIRO certification in order to operate our system.  Refresher training is provided at least annually and more frequently as needed.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity:\n\n\n\nNational Frozen Foods Corporation carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes: pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are given specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\n\n\nManagement of Change:\n\n\n\nWritten procedures are in place at National Frozen Foods Corporation to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures.  Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification.\n\n\n\nPre-Startup Reviews:\n\n\n\nPre-startup safety reviews related to ne"

These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for a safe start up prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\n\n\nCompliance Audits:\n\n\n\nNational Frozen Foods Corporation conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP Rule are being implemented.  These audits are carried out at least every three years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\n\n\nIncident Investigation:\n\n\n\nNational Frozen Foods Corporation promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation:\n\n\n\nNational Frozen Foods Corporation truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.  Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  In addition, our employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP Rule, including information resulting from process hazard analysis in particular.\n\n\n\nContractors:\n\n\n\nOn occasions, National Frozen Foods Corporation hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities.
