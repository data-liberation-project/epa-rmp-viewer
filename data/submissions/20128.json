Bryan\nPhone:     660-886-5566\n\n\n1. The Facility Policy\n\n    Acme Supply Company, and the employees of the Acme Supply Company\nfacility south of Marshall are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of\nanhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work\nwith the Marshall Fire Department, and other authorities, to mitigate any release and\nminimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information\n\n    The activity at the facility is the receiving, storage and distribution of anhydrous\nammonia for direct application as a crop nutrient. The facility also is receiving, has\nstorage and distribution of bulk propane fuel.\n  \n    The facility does not have the capability to receive via rail, thus, the maximum\nquantity stored and handled would be approximately 76,500 pounds in a 18,000 gallon\nstorage tank.\n\n3. The worst-case and alternative release scenario.\n\n    a. The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of the\nlargest storage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes. The maximum quantity released\nwould be 76,500 pounds, which represents the volume of the storage tank at 85 percent\ncapacity as limited by design standards. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion\nto 200 PPM) is 1.8 miles.\n\n    b. The alternative release scenario based on the most likely potential incident is a\nrelease from a break in a 3 transfer hose during receiving operations. This release is\nassumed to last approximately 2 minutes before automatic or manual shut-off stops the\nflow. The maximum quantity release would be 26,640 pounds. The distance to the\nendpoint (point of dispersion to 200 PPM) is 1.2 miles.\n\n4. The Accidental Release Prevention Program.\n\n    The facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the\nStorage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammo"

The Five-year Accident History\n\n    There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five\nyears that: have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility;\nnor to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in\nplace, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n6. The Emergency Response Program.\n\n    The facility has;\n\n    a. a written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA\n       Standard, 29 CFR 1910.38;\n\n    b. provided State and Local authorities with the emergency\n       planning and community right-to-know information as\n       required under SARA Title III (EPCRA);\n\n    c. a written emergency response program, in accordance with\n       OSHA Standard, 29 CFR 1910.120, including pre-emergency\n       planning and employee training.\n\n7. Planned changes to improve safety.\n\n    Safety improvement is an on-going process at the facility. Periodic evaluations are\nperformed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions. There are no additional specific\nanhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
