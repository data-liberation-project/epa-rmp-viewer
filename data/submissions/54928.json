The Facility Policy:  The owners, management and employees of Consumers Cooperative Society facility are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia by utilization of proper equipment, regular inspections and maintenance, and training of all persons that work with the material.  Should an accidental release occur, the facility has oriented the local fire department and the local emergency planning committee so they can plan for response to any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2.  Facility Information:  The primary activity at the facility is the storage of anhydrous ammonia for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient.  \n\n3.  The worst case release scenario is not listed in the executive summary for security reasons.  The alternate case release scenario is not listed in the executive summary for security reasons.\n\n4.  The Accidental Release Program:   Consumers Cooperative Society complies with the Rules and Regulations relating to the Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, Equipment and Storage Facilities.  These regulations administered by the Department of Agriculture or State Agency are consistent with ANSI K61.1 and OSHA 29 CFR 1910.111 regarding storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia.\n\n5.  The Five Year Accident History: An incident occured on 6/12/2009 at Consumer Cooperative anhydrous plant.  Consumers Cooperative was testing the underground piping.  Our contractor was finishing up when a wrench was dropped on the 3 inch liquid line.  The vibration of metal on metal caused the supply valve on the tank to unseat allowing product to flow out.  This is when the release occurred.  The welding was not complete so product mo"

      "SummaryText": "ved out of the tank and into the air.  Prior to the incident, the storage tank had been blown down and vented so that new pressure relief valves could be installed.  The tank was then purged with 500 gallons of NH3 for testing; therefore, the release could not have exceeded 500 gallons (2,600 lbs)  It was not possible to determine if the RQ had been met until after the release was controlled.  It was then estimated that at least 100 gallons of NH3 still remained in the tank.  This equates to a 2060 lb release.  The NRC was then notified as soon as it was determined the RQ had been exceeded.\n\n6.  The Emergency Response Program: Consumers Cooperative Society has a written emergency action plan in accordance with OSHA Standard 29 CFR 1910.38 and provides state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III of EPCRA.  Our emergency response action plan has been reviewed with the local fire department and provided to the local emergency planning committee for coordination in the community response planning.\n\n7.  Planned Changes to Improve Safety:  Safety improvements are an on-going process at Consumers Cooperative Society  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe practices and operations.  There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementatin at this time.\n"
