The corporate core values championed by our President, embraced by our Senior Leadership Team, encouraged by our Managers/Supervisors and pledged to our associates are: a) Caring Relationships, b) Entrepreneurial Spirit, c) Strategic Foresight, and d) High Performance. These 4 core values support our Safety and Health philosophy and management efforts. Interpersonal communications, problem solving, planning and safety achievement have a direct relationship with the core values when applied to safety training, hazard assessment/investigation, post-accident/incident recovery and generating solutions to potential risk exposures. U.S. Venture integrates Safety expectations as a part of Manager/Supervisors' responsibilities in order to create a meaningful daily presence during all work activity. All departments at the corporate level including Risk Management, Legal, People Resources, Finance and Operations reinforce strategic safety planning and solid operation level decision-making that will reduce risk exposures. \n\nThe facility is located on a 28-acre site in Green Bay, Wisconsin near the east shore of the Fox River . The property is located in an industrial/commercial portion of the City of Green Bay. Petroleum products including gasoline and diesel are received, stored and shipped out by truck. In addition, propane is delivered to the facility by railcar to thirteen 30,000 gallon pressure tanks, which is then transferred via piping and associated equipment onsite to truck transports. The quantity of propane that is stored onsite exceeds the 10,000 pound threshold quantity, thus subjecting the facility to RMP requirements.\n\nThe U.S. Energy North Quincy Terminal's regulated propane process complies with National Fire \nProtection Association (NFPA) 58 for"

If an emergency were to occur, it is the facility's policy to notify the Green Bay Metro Fire Department by calling 911, which may trigger involvement by Brown County Emergency Management as necessary. All personnel at this facility are 24 or 40-hour HAZWOPER certified and receive annual refresher hazardous materials training. \n\nU.S. Energy has an outstanding safety record, and to date, has not had an accident involving propane that has resulted in death, injury, property/environmental damage, evacuations or sheltering in place.\n\nIn the event of an accidental release of propane at the U.S. Energy North Quincy Terminal, \nEmergency Response Personnel have been trained to immediately activate an emergency shutdown device (ESD) at one of several locations depending on location of the release and is the policy of the terminal to initially contact the Green Bay Metro Fire Department and request their assistance (via 911). The facility emergency response plans are coordinated with the Green Bay Metro Fire Department and Brown County Emergency Management.\n\nWhen an ESD is activated and the alarm is not acknowledged by Terminal staff, the Terminal's\nSecurity Company will be notified and a representative will call the terminal on-call phone number in response to confirm whether there is an actual emergency. If there is no answer at the on-call phone number to confirm whether help is needed, the alarm company will than contact the next terminal employee in line to receive a call.
