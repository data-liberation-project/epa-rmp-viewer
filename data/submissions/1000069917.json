At this site, Grace produces sample quantities (1 kg level) to commercial quantities of various specialty catalysts.\n\n\n\nCurrently Grace Baton Rouge has on site RMP covered levels of one flammable chemical (diethyl ether) handled above RMP threshold quantity and no toxic materials above RMP threshold quantities.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies - In its operations, Grace is committed to the safety of the surrounding community, as well as protection of the environment.  With a strong Process Safety Management program in place, Grace combines both passive and active mitigation systems to prevent offsite consequences in the event of a spill of any hazardous material.  In addition, our highly trained Emergency Response team is always available to respond to any incident, and bring it quickly under control.  Emergency responders are trained annually, and a trained Incident Commander is on site at all times to coordinate emergency response procedures.\n\n\n\nFive Year Accident History - There have been no offsite accidents at this location that had any adverse effects to neighboring industry or the community.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety - Grace is committed to an ever improving safety program to maintain its rating in the top 5% in the chemical industry.  We conduct Process Hazards Analyses (PHA) of all chemical operations including lab safety audits for all bench scale processes for new projects.  We conduct Layer of Protection Analysis (LOPA) to improve the quality of PHA studies to ensure thoroughness and effectiveness.  We also conduct reactive hazard evaluations on all processes, with the goal of identifying reactive hazards which might occur during normal or upset conditions.\n\n"

Process documentation for covered processes are in compliance with OSHA 1910.119 requirements for Process Safety Management (PSM).  Equipment inspections are scheduled and documented to ensure vessel mechanical integrity.  Hydrocarbon detectors are strategically located to detect the release of flammable materials."
