      "SummaryText": "ly RMP-regulated material at this facility is anhydrous ammonia.  One 30,000 and one 18,000 gallon tank are used for bulk storage of  the material and are located in the center of the facility.  This material is a gas at ambient temperature and pressure.  It is a liquid when stored under pressure inside the tanks.\n\n\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is not a poison, but it is an inhalation / respiratory hazard.  Ammonia is a toxic material but it has no cumulative toxic effects on the human body.  However, it is acutely corrosive when it comes in contact with mucous membranes, in particular.  Anhydrous ammonia is a non-flammable gas.\n\n\n\nSummary of Major Hazards\n\nThe principal causes of ammonia emergencies are ruptured hoses and defective valves. The most probable time for an exposure or release to occur will be during a transfer from a delivery truck to the bulk storage tank or a transfer from the loading station to the small application tanks (aka \"nurse wagons\").  Flexible hoses and fixed piping must be connected properly.  Hoses are date-stamped and replaced in advance of the expiration date or when defects are observed.  All transfers of ammonia are observed by Agri-Service personnel.\n\n\n\nTransfers from the bulk storage tanks to the nurse wagon loading station occur inside fixed steel pipes and are manually controlled.  Flexible hoses are used to connect from the loading station to the nurse wagons. \n\n\n\nWith elevated temperatures that occur during mid-to-late summer, the ammonia gas inside the bulk storage tank can expand, and possibly cause one or more relief valves to open in order to equalize the pressure inside the tank(s).  The relief valve will reseal itself when pressure is relieved.  These \"events\" are very short in duration - a few seconds at the most.\n\n\n\nA complete failure or burst tank is highly unlikely.  The bulk storage tank was built under strict guidelines established in the ASME pressure vessel code.  The tank is protected by concrete traffic barriers.  All wel"

      "SummaryText": "ding and structural work done on the tanks  are performed by certified welders.  \n\n\n\n\n\nConsequences of Failure to Control the Hazards\n\nThe worst case scenario for this facility was created using EPA's RMP Comp software.  A complete release of the tank's contents (approximately 120,000 pounds -- creating a gas / vapor cloud) in a 10 minute period, using worst case atmospheric conditions, results in a distance to endpoint of 5.60 miles.  The estimated exposed population is 1,500 people.  This distance would encompass the village of Stryker, it's residences,  schools and government offices.  No hospitals, prisons or sensitive environmental receptors would be affected.  There are no passive mitigation systems available for this type of scenario.\n\n\n\nIt is our belief that the risk of a complete release of the tank contents is infinitesimally small.  Active mitigation systems in place at this facility were designed to prevent or mitigate any attempts to empty the tank.  The tanks are in a protected location, and all transfer appendages are protected by concrete barriers.\n\n\n\nA more probable release situation is expressed by the alternative release scenario.  We believe that a more likely release could occur from a transfer hose failure.  Prior to the excess flow valve being activated, we estimate that the maximum amount of ammonia that could escape to the atmosphere is approximately 2575 pounds. A release of this nature would likely last for about five minutes.  Utilizing an average wind speed of 3.0 m/sec and atmospheric stability class D,  the resulting distance to endpoint would be  0.60 miles.   In this more realistic scenario, the only potential exposed receptors would be the few residences near the facility - no more than 50 people.\n\n\n\nActive mitigation systems were included in the alternative case scenario.  They are listed in the next section.\n\n\n\n\n\nExplanation of How Hazard Releases are Prevented.\n\nPassive mitigation refers to equipment, devices, or technologies tha"

Bulkhead breakaway unit located on the connection point to the storage tank. If a delivery truck or nurse wagon were to move before properly disconnecting from the tank, the concrete structure would cause the hose to break at a safe connection point.  At this point, active mitigation would take effect and an excess flow valve, just to the inside of the breakaway would prevent the tank from emptying to the atmosphere.\n\n \n\n Active mitigation refers to equipment, devices or technologies that require human, mechanical or other energy input to function.  Active mitigation systems in place at the Pulaski Farm Center are:\n\n? Excess flow valves are located on all outgoing liquid and vapor valves on the storage tank.  They close automatically if the volume of gas or liquid flowing through the line exceeds the normal flow rate.  They won't reopen until the downstream shutoff valve is closed and the pressure equalizes on both sides of the valve seat.  Two principal causes of the excess valve closing are a ruptured hose or a broken pipe or shutoff valve downstream that is opened too quickly.\n\n? Back check valves are located on the truck unloading riser and are designed to ensure that the flow goes in one direction only.  This prevents anhydrous ammonia from flowing to the truck from the storage tank.\n\n? Pressure-relief valves are located on the top of the bulk storage tank and fixed steel piping to relieve pressure that is too great.  This can be caused by elevated temperatures in the summer or overfilling.  They open directly to the atmosphere at 250 psig and close when the pressure inside the tank drops below this pressure.\n\n? Emergency shutoff cord, located along the side of the 30,000 gallon bulk storage tank activates the emergency shutoff valves on the discharge side of the ammonia pump.  This stops the flow of ammonia by remote acti"
