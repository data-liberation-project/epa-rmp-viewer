The purpose of acknowledging these changes is to provide a more accurate Risk Management Plan for use by the City of Lewisville for the five-year renewal commencing June 18, 2014, and for the following five-year period.\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\nThe United States Environmental Protection Agency (U.S.EPA) finalized the Accidental Release Prevention Program (ARPP) under Section 112(r) of the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments and subsequently finalized the Accidental Release Prevention Risk Management Program rule (40 CFR Part 68).  This rule established the criteria of the Risk Management Plans (RMPs) required under the ARPP. 40 CFR Part 68 is similar to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's Process Safety Management Program, which is designed to protect workers from accidental releases of hazardous substances. In compliance with the Risk Management Program requirements, Lewisville submitted Risk Management Plans (RMP's) to USEPA in June 1999, 2004 and 2009 for its water and wastewater treatment facilities.\r\nEffective April 9, 2004, EPA issued Changes to the Chemical Accident Prevention Rule (Risk Management Program) in 2004  as amendments to the original RMP regulations which require the following changes to be made to RMP programs, prior to submission of the five year renewals of RMPs by June 21, 2004:\r\n1.\tChanges in the practices for RMPs requiring submission of information on reportable chemical accidents within six months following the event of that accident\r\n2.\tChanges in the practices for RMPs requiring the updating of emergency contacts information within 30 days of a change in that information\r\n3.\tRemoval of the reporting of worst case and alternative release scenarios in the Executive Summary\r\n4.\tThe addition of three additional pieces of information (data elements).\r\n\r\nThese changes have been incorporated into this Risk Managem"

The amount of Chlorine and Sulfur Dioxide stored exceeds the threshold limit specified by the U.S.EPA, thereby making the facility subject to compliance with the regulation.  The Prairie Creek WWTP personnel have complied with the U.S. EPA Risk Management Program rule and have completed a RMP that contains the following required information:\r\n\u00bf\tA management system (40 CFR Part 68 Subpart A);\r\n\u00bf\tA hazard assessment that establishes the worst-case and alternative release scenarios and their impacts on the population and the environment (40 CFR Part 68 Subpart B);\r\n\u00bf\tA prevention program that includes safety information, a hazard review, operating procedures, training, maintenance, compliance audits, and incident investigations (40 CFR Part 68 Subpart C); and\r\n\u00bf\tAn emergency response plan (40 CFR Part 68 Subpart E).\r\nThe following subsections discuss details of the plan that has been implemented at the Prairie Creek WWTP.\r\nRELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\r\nThe Prairie Creek WWTP facility located in Lewisville Texas has an excellent record in preventing and minimizing releases of Chlorine.  The emergency response policies at this facility ensure that there is emergency response coverage 24 hours per day, 7 days per week.  Adequate provisions have been implemented to coordinate response activities with outside agencies, such as the City of Lewisville Fire Department in case of an emergency. The plant staff has received training to enable an on-site staff response prior to the arrival of either the City of Irving HAZMAT Team or the City of Lewisville HAZMAT Team.  The City of Irving HAZMAT Team will respond to a major release while the City of Lewisville HAZMAT Team will respond to a minor release.\r\n\r\nREGULATED SUBSTANCE\r\nThe Prairie"

      "SummaryText": "Creek WWTP uses Chlorine as a disinfectant in the wastewater treatment process.  The Prairie Creek WWTP uses Sulfur Dioxide to dechlorinate the treated wastewater prior to discharge.  \r\n\r\nPROCESS DESCRIPTION\r\nThe Prairie Creek WWTP is located at 897 Treatment Plant Road in Lewisville, Texas.  The wastewater is treated at the plant, dechlorinated by using sulfur dioxide, and subsequently discharged.  \r\n\r\nThe existing Chlorine feed facility at the Prairie Creek WWTP consists of partially enclosed storage, two vacuum regulators mounted to an automatic switchover module with gas piping and miscellaneous valves drip lines and filters to each, four chlorinators, and gas piping and ejectors.  Chlorine has a potential to generate a gaseous release in the Chlorine storage area. Chlorine is stored as a pressurized liquid and removed as a gas from the individual containers. The Halogen valve system provides automatic shut-off of the Chlorine supply at the container valve in response to detected Chlorine release. The majority of the Chlorine feed process operates through a water injection induced vacuum, making the system extremely safe and minimizing potential pressurized leaks along the feed lines.  \r\n\r\nThe existing Sulfur Dioxide feed facility at the Prairie Creek WWTP consists of four one-ton Sulfur Dioxide containers, two vacuum regulators mounted to an automatic switchover module with gas piping and miscellaneous valves drip lines and filters to each, three flow proportionate feed sulfunators, gas piping and ejectors.  Sulfur Dioxide has a potential to generate a gaseous release is the Sulfur Dioxide storage area.  Sulfur Dioxide is stored as a pressurized liquid but is pressure fed as a gas from the containers.

The U.S.EPA requires that a single worst-case release scenario for the facility and one alternative release scenario for each regulated chemical be reported. \r\n\r\nWorst-Case Release Scenario\r\nA worst case release scenario was developed for this update.  However, in accordance with guidance from EPA's April 9, 2004 regulation modification to 2004 RMP updates, this information is intentionally omitted from this Executive Summary.\r\n\r\nAlternative Release Scenario\r\nAn alternative release scenario was developed for this update.

New Operating Procedures were developed as a result.\r\n\r\nDuring this period of time, no accidental releases of Sulfur Dioxide occurred.\r\n\r\nPolicies were developed by the City of Lewisville that will cause a resubmission of the RMP within six months of the occurrence of a reportable Chlorine release.\r\n\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\r\nThe City of Lewisville has developed an Emergency Response Pro"

Back-up personnel are available in the event that the primary response personnel cannot be contacted. \r\n\r\nThe Emergency Response Plan includes: (1) procedures to follow in the event of a Chlorine or Sulfur Dioxide emergency, (2) information about frequency of employee emergency response training, and (3) a detailed description of the emergency response training underway. Emergency responders and equipment will be provided by either the City of Irving HAZMAT Team or the City of Lewisville HAZMAT Team, the HAZMAT Team will assume Incident Command upon arrival to the plant. \r\n\r\nNew policies have been developed by the City of Lewisville that will cause a correction submission for the RMP for any emergency contact information changes within 30 days of the change.\r\n\r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\nBased on the hazard review and prevention evaluation completed for Chlorine and Sulfur Dioxide in 2014, a list of action items was developed and is planned to be considered over the next five years in conjunction with anticipated improvements to be made at the Prairie Creek  WWTP."
