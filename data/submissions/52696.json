Executive Summary\n\nFacility: National Cold Storage, Inc. \nLocation: 12755 Loring Drive, Bonner Springs, KS  66012\nContact: Joe Becker\nPhone: (913) 422-4050\n\n1.  The Facility Policy\n\nNational Cold Storage, Inc., and the employees of National Cold Storage, Inc. are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of ammonia or any other chemicals which are stored on site. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with local emergency response personnel, and other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2.  Facility Information\n\nThe facility is an underground cold storage facility, which utilizes ammonia as a refrigerant.\n\nThe primary activity at the facility is the receiving, storage and distribution of dry, chilled and frozen goods. \n\nThe maximum quantity of ammonia stored on site is 11,550 pounds. This is the total amount of ammonia in the refrigeration system.\n\n3.  The Worst-Case and Alternative Release Scenario\n\na. The worst-case release scenario would be the release from a broken line or valve on chiller #3, released as a gas over 10 minutes. The maximum quantity released would be 1,848 pounds. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200ppm) is 0.31 miles.\n\nB. The alternative release scenario would be a release from the receiver, released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 1,578 pounds. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200ppm) is 0.06 miles.\n\n\n4.  The Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe facility has implemented the provisions of ?Safety Requirements for Storage and Handling of Ammonia, K-61.1, 1989?, published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc., the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, ?Storage and Handling of Ammonia? and the standards as outlined by the EPA CEPPO (Chemical E"

Year Accident History\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of ammonia in the past five years that: have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n6.  The Emergency Response Program\n\nThe facility has:\n\na. A written emergency evacuation plan, in accordance with OSHA Standard, 29 CFR 1910. 38;\n\nb. Provided State and Local Authorities with the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA);\n\nc. A written emergency response program, in accordance with OSHA Standard, 29 CFR 1910.120, including pre-emergency planning and employee training.\n\n7.  Planned changes to improve safety\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility. Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions. There are no additional specific ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time. The facility conducts annual reviews of all policies and procedures for proper handling and storage of ammonia and makes any adjustments or adds new policies to improve the safe handling of ammonia."
