      "SummaryText": "The City of Bogalusa is committed to a continuous effort to improve safety at Well Site #5 at 1710 Avenue G.  Ongoing equipment improvement and maintenance upgrades have been implemented.  A preventive maintenance contract is in place and operators check the equipment daily.\n\nThe Water Well Site #5 is in a populated area.  There are residences, churches, schools an commercial buildings in the vicinity.  Chlorine is stored in one ton and 150 pound cylinders.  The normal amount stored on site is one ton cylinder in use and another available.  There are two to three 150 pound cylinders as back up.\n\nThe Risk Management Program requires that two scenarios be developed to demonstrate the results of any accidental release of any regulated substances used in a process.  The first is a worst-case scenario.  This scenario assumes that the entire contents of the largest vessel containing chlorine is released in a 10 minute period.  Since the well-site's largest vessel is a one ton cylinder, it is estimated that 200 pounds of chlorine would be released per minute.  The model used for determining the toxic endpoint is EPA's RMP guidance for Waste Water Treatment Plants Reference Tables or Equations.  Using this model, the calculated distance to the toxic endpoint, with a wind speed of 1.5 meters per second, an atmospheric stability class of F, and a topography description of rural, is 3.0 miles.  Public receptors within that distance include private residences, churches, schools, recreation areas, hospitals, businesses and other public and commercial buildings.\n\nThe second scenario is an alternative release.  This is a more realistic scenario for an accidental release.  The same model was used for determining the toxic endpoint as was used in the worst case scenario.  In this case we said a faulty valve on a 150 pound cylinder releases the entire contents in a 10 minute period.  The model for this scenario uses a wind speed of 3 meters per second, an atmospheric stability class "

Public receptors within that distance include private residences, a church and part of the industrial park.  There are no mitigating measures in place except that the vessels are covered, but exposed to outside air.\n\nThe City of Bogalusa has a combined Safety, Prevention and Emergency Response Plan.  Daily visual inspection of all vessels is made by operators and periodic inspection and maintenance by an outside contractor.  The fire department conducts quarterly safety inspections.  Signs, identifying hazardous chemicals are in place and the area is fenced and locked.  All facility employees have been trained in the proper handling of chlorine and have completed the 24 hour HAZMAT Technician course in accordance with 29CFR1910.120.  Well Site #5 has had no accidental releases of any EPA regulated chemicals in the last five years.\n\nWell Site #5 is included in the City of Bogalusa Fire Department's Emergency Response Program and has written emergency response procedures.  The Fire Department and the operators keep repair kits for chlorine cylinders.  A major release would be handled by the fire department.  Small accidental releases would be handled by employees of the facility.  Repair kits, PPE including SCBA are available on the operators' vehicle. The Fire Department conducts quarterly safety audits."
