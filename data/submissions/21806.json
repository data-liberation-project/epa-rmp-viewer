Delta Chemical Corporation manufactures Aluminum Sulfate, Sodium Aluminate, Polyaluminum Chloride, Polymer and Sodium Hypochlorite (bleach).  The raw materials in Polymer that exceed the reporting threshold are Formaldehyde and Dimethylamine.  Formaldehyde is in an aqueous solution and stored in an 8,000-gallon tank at the facility.  The Dimethylamine is also in an aqueous solution and stored in an 8,000-gallon tank on site, although administrative controls limit the storage to 7,000 gallons.  Delta Chemical Corporation uses a 54 step truck unloading process to ensure the safe unloading/delivery of the Formaldehyde and Dimethylamine to our facility.  Dimethylamine and Formaldehyde storage tanks have secondary containment to prevent the spread of the material if a leak would develop in the storage tank area.  During the unloading/delivery of these chemicals to our facility, a Delta Chemical Corporation employee is stationed at the truck with the truck driver to quickly engage the emergency-shutoff valve if a leak should occur.  The tanker truck unloading area is sloped toward a containment sump to stop the spread of a leak outside the secondary containment wall.  Dimethylamine is our worst case flammable and alternate case flammable.  Formaldehyde is an alternate case toxic.\n\nDelta Chemical Corporation repackages chlorine into 1 ton, 150 lb. cylinders and 100 lb. cylinders directly from a 90-ton railcar.  Chlorine is also used in the manufacture of Sodium Hypochlorite (bleach).  During the transfer of chlorine from the railcar, an automatic railcar shut off device is used as well as automatic chlorine pipeline pneumaticially operated closure valves.  This equipment is tied into the alarm system and if the chlorine limit is exceeded in the atmophere or a panic button is pushed, the chlorine alarm sets off an audible alarm to warn plan"

At Delta Chemical Corporation we believe that all jobs can be accomplished without injury to employees or harm to the environment.

The model used for this scenario was the EPA's RMP COMP.  This scenario is based on one railcar releasing the chlorine at a rate of 18,000 lbs./min. for a total of 10 minutes.  The following assumptions were made:\n\n- The surface roughness was urban.\n- Meteorological conditions:\n     Stability Class                          F\n     Wind Speed                            1.5 m/s\n     Atmospheric Temperature      77 degrees F\n\n\nWorst Case Flammable - Dimethylamine 60% (DMA)\n\nDelta Chemical Corporation has one listed flammable onsite: Dimethylamine (DMA).

The storage tank has secondary containment and a nitrogen blanket is placed on the storage tank, but these mitigation measures are not relevant to a vapor cloud explosion release scenario.  The model used was the EPA's RMP COMP for this scenario.  The following assumptions were made:\n\n- The DMA tank has a catastrosphic failure.\n- Although the DMA is an aqueous solution, only the DMA portion, 32,769 lbs. was considered to take part in the vapor cloud explosion.  It is assumed that the water would have an insignificant effect on the consequences.\n- The surface roughness was urban.\n- Explosion overpressure level 1 = 1 psi\n- Meteorolgical conditions:\n     Stability Class                         F\n     Wind Speed                            1.5 m/s\n     Atmospheric Temperature      77%\n\n\nAlternate Case Toxic Scenario - Chlorine\n\nDelta Chemical Corporation's alternate case toxic scenario involves the catastrosphic failure of a 1-inch monell unloading hose connecting a 90-ton railcar of chlorine to our process.

PSM has enhanced Delta Chemical Corporation's commitment to safety and conducting our operations in an environmentally friendly manner.  Employees are required to help with Process Hazard Analysis of PSM processes and participate in PSM Audits of covered processes in accordance with the Employee Participation Program.  Standard Operating Procedures are used to provide clear instructions and training in PSM covered processes.  Our Mechanical Integrity Program ensures that process equipment remains in a safe and reliable condition.  All contractors are required to attend safety orientation in accordance with our Contractor Safety Program.  All welding and cutting in regulated areas must be accompanied by a \"Hot Work\" permit in accordance with our \"Hot Work\" Permit Program.  This ensures that personnel take the time to survey the area to make sure all potential sources of ignition and fuel are eliminated/removed from the area prior to starting work.\n\nThe Chlori"
