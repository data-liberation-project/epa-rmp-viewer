      "SummaryText": "Delta Chemical Corporation manufactures chemicals and repackages chlorine used in water and wastewater treatment and general industry.  Delta Chemical Corporation manufactures Aluminum Sulfate, Sodium Aluminate, Polyaluminum Chloride, Polymer and Sodium Hypochlorite (bleach).  The raw materials in Polymer that exceed the reporting threshold are Formaldehyde and Dimethylamine.  Formaldehyde is in an aqueous solution and stored in an 8,000-gallon tank at the facility.  The Dimethylamine is also in an aqueous solution and stored in an 8,000-gallon tank on site, although administrative controls limit the storage to 7,000 gallons.  Delta Chemical Corporation uses a 54 step truck unloading process to ensure the safe unloading/delivery of the Formaldehyde and Dimethylamine to our facility.  Dimethylamine and Formaldehyde storage tanks have secondary containment to prevent the spread of the material if a leak would develop in the storage tank area.  During the unloading/delivery of these chemicals to our facility, a Delta Chemical Corporation employee is stationed at the truck with the truck driver to quickly engage the emergency-shutoff valve if a leak should occur.  The tanker truck unloading area is sloped toward a containment sump to stop the spread of a leak outside the secondary containment wall.  Dimethylamine is our worst case flammable and alternate case flammable.  Formaldehyde is an alternate case toxic.\n\nDelta Chemical Corporation repackages chlorine into 1 ton, 150 lb. cylinders and 100 lb. cylinders directly from a 90-ton railcar.  Chlorine is also used in the manufacture of Sodium Hypochlorite (bleach).  During the transfer of chlorine from the railcar, an automatic railcar shut off device is used as well as automatic chlorine pipeline pneumaticially operated closure valves.  This equipment is tied into the alarm system and if the chlorine limit is exceeded in the atmophere or a panic button is pushed, the chlorine alarm sets off an audible alarm to warn plan"

Chlorine is also an alternate case toxic with the failure of a chlorine railcar unloading hose being the alternate case toxic scenario.\n\nDelta Chemical Corporation is committed to handling chemicals responsibly and through various associations subscribes to the principles of the Responsible Care (R) program.  This includes continual environmental, health and safety training for plant employees as well as training our customers in the safe use of our products.  At Delta Chemical Corporation we believe that all jobs can be accomplished without injury to employees or harm to the environment.
