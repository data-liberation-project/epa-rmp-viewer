We will make every effort to provide a working environment that is free from any recognized or potential hazards.  The Robstown Wastewater Plant is a three million gallon per day activated sludge process. It uses chlorine for disinfection and sulfur dioxide for dechlorination prior to discharge.  Only chlorine is within the Threshold limits.  The worst-case scenario for discharge of 2000 lbs chlorine within ten minutes, will cover approximately 6.7 miles radius at a temperature estimated at 78 degrees Fahrenheit and a wind speed of 3.4 miles per hour. Emergency response plan would be activated into action. This will include notifying local fire, police, LEPC, Chemtrec, and isolating areas according to maps. The public will by notified through necessary public address. The alternative scenario for the discharge of 2000 lbs of chlorine within ten minutes will cover an estimated area of 0.5 mile radius at a temperature estimated at 78 degrees Fahrenheit and a wind speed of 10 miles per hour. Emergency plan would be activated into action. This will include notifying all local fire, police, LEPC, Chemtrec, and isolating areas according to maps. The public will by notified through necessary public address. Preventative Program: Training of plant personnel on Chlorine Kits A&B, training on emergency plan with local police and fire departments. Revision of alternative plans and the emergency plans will be on going. Five Year History:  The Robstown Wastewater Treatment Plant has had no reportable accidents in the last five years. The Risk Management Plan Response: Includes but not limited to notifying the Director of Utilities, Fire Chief, Police Chief, Local Director of designee of LEPC, Chemtrec(AOC supplier of chlorine), plant"
