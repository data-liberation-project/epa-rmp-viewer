They are transported on roads, water, and railways. The Metropolitan Council's Blue Lake Wastewater Treatment Plant (Blue Lake Plant) stores chemicals that it uses in its daily operations. The facility currently stores chlorine stored in up to eight 1ton containers and sulfur dioxide in up to six 1ton containers. Chlorine is used to disinfect the treated wastewater and the sulfur dioxide is used to remove residual chlorine, or dechlorinate the treated wastewater to protect organisms in the river when it is discharged.\n\n\n\nChlorine and sulfur dioxide are nonexplosive and nonflammable. However, they can support combustion under some circumstances. They are both respiratory irritants, and if accidentally released into the environment, exposure through inhalation or through eye or skin contact can pose a health risk. As a precaution, the Blue Lake Plant has special safety systems that are an integral part of the chlorine and sulfur dioxide systems.\n\n\n\nThe Metropolitan Council takes our safety obligations in storing and using chemicals as seriously as we do providing the environment with safe disinfected water. The following document describes the steps we take every day to ensure a safely operating plant, what could happen if there was an accidental release of a chemical stored on site, and what to do in event of an emergency.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nThis document complies with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) Risk Management Program, appearing in Section 112 (r) of the Clean Air Act (CAA) Amendments of 1990, and codified in 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 68 (commonly cited as 40 CFR Part 68), as amended on April 9, 2004.

This plan is referred to as the Risk Management Plan (RMP).\n\n\n\nChlorine and sulfur dioxide are stored in quantities at the Blue Lake Plant above the regulatory thresholds at which an RMP is required. This RMP document summarizes the existing safety systems, policies, procedures, and ongoing actions that are designed to prevent or minimize impacts of accidental releases of chlorine or sulfur dioxide to the environment. The Blue Lake Plant has a detailed and comprehensive emergency response plan to handle any potential accidental release. To date, the plant has had an excellent record in preventing accidents from occurring. No chlorine or sulfur dioxide releases causing a safety or health hazard affecting the surrounding community have occurred at the Blue Lake Plant since the use of these chemicals began.\n\n\n\nUnderstanding the Chemicals Used at the Blue Lake Plant\n\n\n\nThe Blue Lake Plant, operating since 1971, is located at 6957 County Road 101 East in Shakopee, Minnesota. Wastewater from Shakopee, Eden Prairie, Minnetonka, Chaska, and several surrounding communities is treated at the Blue Lake Plant and discharged into the Minnesota River. The wastewater treatment process includes preliminary screening, primary settling and treatment, secondary treatment and clarification, chlorination and dechlorination and cascade aeration before final discharge. The Blue Lake Plant treats approximately 27 million gallons of wastewater per day. The Blue Lake Plant has a chlorination system that uses chlorine gas fed from 1ton chlorine containers and a dechlorination system that uses sulfur dioxide gas fed from 1ton sulfur dioxide containers\n\n\n\nThe chemical vendor delivers 1ton chlorine and sulfur dioxide containers to the plant.

Similarly, gaseous sulfur dioxide is withdrawn from the 1ton containers and delivered to the wastewater dechlorination process. The Blue Lake Plant uses stateoftheart process equipment to maximize the safety for plant staff and the community at large. Some of the specific features are described in the following narrative. \n\n\n\nChlorine and sulfur dioxide leak detectors continuously monitor for leaks in the bulk storage areas and in the chlorination and dechlorination rooms.  Leak alarms activate an audible alarm throughout the plant as well as a red flashing warning light on the storage building. The alarms also sound at the central and local control panels. The leak alarms are tested weekly.\n\n\n\nOther system alarms include low vacuum at the chlorinator or sulfonator, and low injector water pressure. These alarms sound at the chlorine andsulfur dioxide central and local control panels. Vacuum regulators are used on the gas piping so that chlorine and sulfur dioxide gas is delivered under vacuum. If a leak were to occur on this piping, outside air would be drawn into the piping rather than chlorine or sulfur dioxide gas being forced out of the piping.\n\n\n\nThe chlorination and dechlorination rooms are enclosed in a building. The rooms are equipped with an automatic ventilation system that operates when either the chlorine or sulfur dioxide leak detector detects chlorine or sulfur dioxide in the room. Emergency showers and eye wash stations are provided at the building along with smoke alarms.\n\n\n\nThe Blue Lake Plant's water discharge permit issued by the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA) only requires disinfection from April 1 through October 31. During the rest of the year chlorine usage is significantly reduced, all sulfur dioxide is removed from the plant, and a complete preventative maintenance program is administered on all chlorine and sulfur dioxide p"

The Hazard Assessment is done to determine the potential effects that a release of a regulated substance could have on the public surrounding the facility. The second part is a Prevention Program that consists of 12 elements designed to improve the system safety and decrease the likelihood of a release. The third part is the Emergency Response Program, which develops a plan for dealing with a release in the unlikely event that one would occur. Because the regulations are very similar, the Prevention Program and the Emergency Response Program also serves as the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) plan, and this document is therefore is referred to as the RMP/PSM plan.\n\n\n\nHazard Assessment/Release Scenarios\n\n\n\nA Hazard Assessment was performed to determine the effects a release would have on the public surrounding the facility. For chlorine and sulfur dioxide, the distance a set endpoint concentration of the gas would travel must be determined. In addition, an estimate of the population that could be affected by a release of chlorine or sulfur dioxide was determined and sensitive receptors such as hospitals, schools, and nursing homes were identified. The Hazard Assessment considers two release scenarios a \"worst case\" and an \"alternative case.\" As required by the rules, the two scenarios were used to determine the possible affected area from chlorine or sulfur dioxide release incidents at the plant. \n\n\n\nPrevention Program\n\n\n\nThe Prevention Program consists of 12 elements designed to improve the system safety and decrease the likelihood of a release.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\n\n\nThe participation of the Blue Lake Plant staff in preparing the RMP/PSM program was critical to the program's successful implementation.

Staff who operate and maintain the RMP/PSM processes are trained in how to safely maintain and operate the processes.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\n\n\nThe RMP/PSM regulations require that information concerning process chemicals, technology, and equipment is compiled as part of the RMP program. Emergency response planners can use such information to develop training programs and procedures, or as a general resource. The information is also supplied to contractors who will work in the chlorine and sulfur dioxide process areas as part of the requirements outlined in the Contractors element of this program.

Written operating procedures assure continuous, efficient, and safe operation of the facility. The goal of the operating procedures is to provide clear instructions to safely operate the process. Operating procedures are also used to train new employees and to provide refresher training for existing staff.\n\n\n\nThe detailed operating procedures include chlorine and sulfur dioxide loading and unloading, startup, shutdown and normal operating procedures.

This includes all process safety information, process hazard analysis, operating procedures, employee training and mechanical integrity. A prestartup safety review team completes a prestartup checklist. The prestartup safety review team should complete and sign a Prestartup Safety Review Form. This form documents the process, and helps ensure that the review has been properly performed. The Prestartup Safety Review Form must be authorized before startup.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\n\n\nAn effective mechanical integrity program is imperative in preventing an accidental release. The mechanical integrity program also addresses equipment testing and inspection, preventative maintenance schedules, and personnel training. The intent is to ensure that equipment used to process, store, or handle chlorine and sulfur dioxide is maintained and installed to minimize the risk of releases.

To ensure that hot work is done safely, a Hot Work Permit Program has been developed that requires a permit to be issued before hot work is performed. Hot work is defined as the use of oxyacetylene torches, welding equipment, grinders, cutting, brazing, or similar flame- or spark-producing operations.\n\n\n\nThe process of completing the hot work permit makes it necessary to identify the hazard, recognize what safeguards are appropriate, and then initiate the safeguards necessary to ensure a firesafe workplace. The internal Hot Work Permit policy and guidance to assure compliance with the OSHA Hot Work Regulations (29 CFR 1910.252(a)) was revised in March 2004, and is available to employees on the Metropolitan Council?s intranet site, as well as at the plant.\n\n\n\nManagement of Change\n\n\n\nA system for the proper management of changes and modifications to equipment, procedures, chemicals, and processing conditions is required under the RMP/PSM programs.
