(\"Unified Grocers\") to prevent accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia that could cause harm to the public and the environment from short-term exposures.  The Plan includes an analysis of the potential offsite consequences of an accidental release, a five-year accident history, and a release prevention and emergency response program.\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe Plan identifies current operating procedures and policies in effect at Unified Grocers to minimize the potential for accidental releases of hazardous materials.  Emergency preparedness procedures including spill mitigation, evacuation procedures, alarms, and emergency phone numbers have been implemented by Unified Grocers and are summarized in this Plan and the facility's Process Safety Management Manual and Emergency Evacuation Plan.  \n\nThis Plan, the Emergency Evacuation Plan, and Process Safety Management Manual document the accidental release prevention, safety, and emergency policies in place at Unified Grocers.\n\n\nDescription of Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nUnified Grocers is located at 3301 South Norfolk Street in Seattle, Washington (the \"facility\").  The facility is situated within an industrial area and occupies approximately fifty-seven acres of land.  The facility utilizes an ammonia refrigeration system to provide refrigeration for processed foods.  The freezer and cooler areas are equipped with evaporators to keep desired areas cold.  Liquid ammonia is transferred from a control pressure receiver to evaporator units.  The low pressure liquid is directed to evaporating units, or coils, to provide refrigeration for cold storage areas.  The ammonia system contains a maximum quantity of approximately 24,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\nUnified Grocers has developed an"

The Plan's purpose is to enhance the facility's existing safety programs implemented at the site to reduce the possibility of accidental releases of regulated substances that could cause harm to employees, the public, and the environment.  The emergency response program includes accidental release prevention and chemical specific prevention steps.\n\nThe facility has safely operated in the City of Seattle since 1955.  Key elements of the facility's safety program include written environmental health and safety procedures, employee training, and emergency response procedures.\n\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nAn accidental release reportable under the program occurred at Unified Grocers in the five year period preceding this Plan.  On 18 April 2011, maintenance employees at Unified Grocers, Inc. located at 3301 South Norfolk in Seattle reported a leak that occurred during routine maintenance associated with the ammonia refrigeration system serving the refrigerated warehouses at the facility.  The leak resulted in a release of approximately 3,662 pounds of anhydrous ammonia to the atmosphere.   Upon discovering the leak immediate action was taken to notify local emergency responders, secure the area and stop the leak.  In response to the release the king valve was immediately closed and residual ammonia in the line was vented to the ammonia engine room.  The release was isolated to the ammonia engine room only.  The ammonia was then vented to atmosphere. Once the leak had stopped the area was inspected and cleared for re-entry.  After thorough inspection, the system was returned to full operational status and normal operations were resumed.\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nThe facility coordinates emergency response activities with the Tukwila Fire District and King County Emergency Management.

Install hydrostatic valves in areas of ammonia liquid piping in engine room and between isolation valves (evaporators).\n11.    Provide emergency back-up power for ventilation fans in event of power failure.\n12.    Inspect and test insulated vessels over 30 years in age for corrosion and metal thinning. \n13.
