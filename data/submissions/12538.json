This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of substances. However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nThe Fort Hill Plant manufactures and processes sulfuric acid in Hamilton County, Ohio.  Raw material, intermediate and process storage tanks are in use at the site.\n\nThe Fort Hill Plant was evaluated to determine if any regulated flammable or toxic substances exceeded the threshold quantity.  Based on process knowledge, DuPont identified the regulated substances and quantities kept on site. The facility uses two regulated substances, oleum and sulfur trioxide, in the sulfuric acid process (Process 1). In addition, railcars contining sulfur trioxide and oleum are occasionally on-site for a short period of time prior to shipping without active shipping papers  (Process 2). \n\nBased on worst-case analyses, the distances to endpoints [i.e. Emergency Response Planning Guideline Level 2 (ERPG-2) developed for each substance by the American Industrial Hygiene Association] exceed the distances to public receptors (i.e., off-site residences, institutions, industrial and commercial office buildings, parks, or recreational areas inhabited or occupied by the public).  In addition, DuPont is subject to Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) and is classified under a listed SIC Code 2819.  Therefore, the sulfuric acid process and railcar storage are classified as Program 3 under the Accidental Release Prevention (ARP) Program.\n\nOff-Site Conseq"

DuPont Fort Hill Plant does not store any flammable substances listed in the rule in the threshold quantities required by the regulation; therefore, DuPont does not have a worst-case scenario for flammable substances.\n\nToxic Substances\n\nEndpoints for toxic substances are based on the ERPG-2.  Toxic endpoints are listed in Appendix A to 40 CFR Part 68 (Table of Toxic Endpoints). Each of the regulated toxic substances at the Fort Hill Plant was reviewed to determine the substance with the greatest distance to an endpoint.\n\nFor the sulfur trioxide storage vessel, an administrative control exists in which the tank is filled to 80% of capacity.  Alarms are in place to ensure that the tank is never filled past the 80% capacity.\n \nThe distance to the toxic endpoint resulting from the instantaneous release of the contents of the sulfur trioxide tank and an oleum railcar would have off-site impacts based on the U.S. EPA lookup tables contained in the OCA Guidance Document.\n\nEndpoints for toxic substances are based on the ERPG-2.  Toxic endpoints are listed in Appendix A to 40 CFR Part 68 (Table of Toxic Endpoints).  Each of the regulated toxic substances at the Fort Hill Plant was reviewed to determine the substance with the greatest distance to an endpoint.\n\nAlternative Releases\n\nAlternative release scenarios are those that are more likely to occur than the worst-case release scenario.  Alternative release scenarios for toxic substances should be those that lead to concentrations above the endpoint beyond the facility's fenceline.  The following conditions are considered for alternative release scenarios:\n\nRelease rate dependent upon scenario;\nUse of typical meteorological conditions at the stationary source; and\nConsideration of active and passive mitigation systems.\n\nToxic Sub"

Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team.  Both operators and mechanics are involved in all incident investigations.  Employees have access to all information created as part of the Fort Hill Plant's accident prevention program. One way that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program is our Safety, Health, and Environmental (SHE) Committee.   In addition,  Fort Hill has a number of initiatives under way that address process safety and employee safety issues. These initiatives include forming teams to promote both process and personal safety. The teams have members from all areas of the plant, including operations, maintenance, engineering, and plant management.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nThe Fort Hill Plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information. Specific departments within the plant are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information. \n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/ exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs). This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  For the sulfuric acid process area, Fort Hill has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g."

The plant ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using state-of-the-art process controls and monitoring instruments, emergency relief systems, redundant power supply and safety systems, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\n\nThe plant also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment.  This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis  (PHA)   \n                                                                                                                                  \nFort Hill has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure the adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nFort Hill primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\nThe PHA team fi"

Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, Fort Hill periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are currently conducted at least every 5 years.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.  Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nFort Hill maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process.  These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.  The procedures are kept current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.\n\nThis information is readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\nTraining\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, Fort Hill has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process.

After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years.  All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\nContractors\n\nFort Hill uses contractors to supplement its workforce.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform plant personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.  This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work.  In addition, Fort Hill evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor.  Plant personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\nPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs) \n\nFort Hill conducts a PSSR for any facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information.

A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nFort Hill has well-established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition. The basic aspects of this program include:  (1) conducting training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting identified deficiencies, and (5) applying quality assurance measures. In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process.\n\nMaintenance personnel receive training on (1) an overview of the process, (2) safety and health hazards, (3) applicable maintenance procedures, (4) emergency response plans, and (5) applicable safe work practices to help ensure that they can perform their jobs in a safe manner.

This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.\n\nSafe Work Practices\n\nFort Hill has long-standing safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety.  Examples of these include (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous substances before process piping or equipment is opened, (4) a permit and procedure to control spark-producing activities (i.e., hot work), (5) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space, and (6) a pre-start-up safety review on each unit.  These procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\n\nManagement of Change\n\nFort Hill has a comprehensive system to manage changes to all covered processes.  This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented. Changes are reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.  Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures, are updated to incorporate these changes.  In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on the change.\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nFort Hill will promptly investigate all inciden"

The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to plant management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings.  Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years so that the reports can be reviewed during future PHAs and PHA revalidations.\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, Fort Hill periodically conducts an audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented. Compliance audits are conducted at least every 3 years.  Both hourly and staff personnel participate as audit team members.  The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to plant management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are retained.\n\nChemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe process at Fort Hill has hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation.  The following is a description of existing safety features applicable to prevention of accidental releases of regulated substances in the facility.\n\nUniversal Prevention Activities\n\nThe accident prevention program summarized previously is applied to "

Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human errors.\n\nSpecialized Safety Features\n\nFort Hill has safety features on units to help (1) contain/control a release, (2) quickly detect a release, and (3) reduce the consequences of (mitigate) a release.  The following types of safety features are used in the covered process:\n\nRelease Containment/Control\n\nAutomatic shut-off devices and relief valves\nCurbing or diking to contain liquid releases\nRedundant equipment and instrumentation (e.g., uninterruptible power supply for process control system, backup firewater pump)\nAdministrative controls to minimize toxic chemical inventories.\n\nRelease Mitigation\n\nTrained emergency response personnel\nPersonal protective equipment (e.g., chemical protective clothing, self-contained breathing apparatus)\nContinuous pressure monitoring of vessels and pipes\nAudible warning alarms\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nDuPont Fort Hill Plant has not had any accidental releases during the past five years which meet the criteria for an accidental release per 40 CFR 68.42.\n\nEmergency Response Program Information\n\nFort Hill maintains a written incident response plan, which is in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment during an emergency.  The plan consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance. The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post-incident cleanup and decontamination requirements.  In addition, the plant has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment, as well as instructions that address the use of emergency response "
