Oregon, Pasco, Washington are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of aqueous ammonia (20% concentration).  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.  A detailed emergency response plan has been developed and will be implemented in the event of an accidental release.\n\n2.     Facility Information\n\nThe primary activity at the Pasco facility is the storage, and sale of liquid and dry fertilizers to our customers.\n\nThe regulated substance, aqueous ammonia is received, stored, sold to customers, as well as used is liquid fertilizer processes.\n\nAqueous ammonia is stored at the site.  The maximum quantity of aqueos ammonia handled at Pasco is 45,000 pounds.\n\n3.     The Worst-Case Scenario and Alternative Release Scenario\n\nThe Worst-Case Scenario.       Failure of the largest storage tank when filled to the greatest amount would release 45,000 pounds of aqueous ammonia, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 0.27 miles.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario.       The alternate release scenario, based on the five-year accident history (or the most likely potential incident) is a release from the storage vessel.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 0.10 miles.\n\n4.     Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nAqueous Ammonia:    The facility has implemented an annual inspection program which includes a visual inspection and third party ultra-sound thickness testing of the tank wall to Steel Tank Manufacturer's specifications.\n\n5.     Five-Year Accident History\n\nThere has been one accidental releases or near misses of aqueous ammonia in the past five years that have"

The plan addresses the regulations concerning emergency plans as mandated under; OSHA 29 CFR - 1910.38,1910.119 and 1910.120, EPA 40 CFR - part 264, subpart D, and part 68 and 279.52, DOT/RSPA - FRP - 40 CFR part 194.  Elements within this plan include employee training, SARA Title III reporting requirements and Community Right-To-Know, pre emergency planning and emergency response information.\n\n7.     Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to asses the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no additional specific planned changes to the anhydrous ammonia storage or processes at the facility."
