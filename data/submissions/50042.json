In compliance with applicable Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) RMP requirements, the City of Pueblo RMP document describes the following components of an RMP:\n\n?A hazard assessment program that identifies and analyzes the potential onsite and off-site impacts of worst-case and alternate accidental release scenarios of regulated substances, and includes documentation of five-year accident histories involving regulated substances.\n\n?A prevention program that covers operating procedures, maintenance, training, management of change, process safety information, and other similar information involving regulated substances.\n\n?An emergency action plan to mitigate any accidental releases that occur.\n\n?An overall system to manage the development and implementation of a risk management program.\n\nThe plan is submitted in accordance with regulations cited at 40 CFR 68.155 through 68.185 for the on-site disinfection and de-chlorination processes covered by RMP regulations.  \n\nThe primary activity at the wastewater treatment plant is the treatment of wastewater for the City of Pueblo, Colorado.  Regulated chemicals used, stored, or handled on-site in amounts greater than the threshold quantities of the RMP rule are described below:\n\nCHEMICAL:Chlorine\nPROCESS:Disinfection\nLOCATION:Chlorine-Sulfur Dioxide Building\nSTORAGE VESSEL(S) and QUANTITY (LBS):\nFour 1-ton cylinders stored outside\nFour 1-ton cylinders stored inside in service\nFour 1-ton cylinders stored inside on standby    \nRMP PROGRAM:2\n \nCHEMICAL:Sulfur Dioxide\nPROCESS:De-Chlorination\nLOCATION:Chlorine-Sulfur Dioxide Building\nSTORAGE VESSEL(S) and QUANTITY (LBS):\nFour 1-ton cylinders stored outside \nTwo 1-ton"

Both worst case and alternate case scenarios were modeled.  Modeling was performed using the EPA software program RMP*Comp version 1.07\n\nThe worst case scenario is based on a catastrophic failure of the chlorine or sulfur dioxide holding tank due to corrosion, impacts, or structural failure.  The entire 2,000 pound tank capacity is assumed to disperse at a rate of 200 pounds per minute for a period of 10 minutes.\n\nThe modeled distance to the toxic endpoint for chlorine and sulfur dioxide under the worst case scenario are calculated as follows:\n\nChlorine - 1.3 miles\nSulfur dioxide - 1.3 miles\n\nThe modeled distance to the toxic endpoint for chlorine and sulfur dioxide under the alternate case scenario are calculated as follows:\n\nChlorine - 0.1 miles\nSulfur dioxide - 0.1 miles\n\nThe Wastewater Treatment Plant Superintendent, John Lindstrom, is a qualified individual with overall responsibility for overseeing the implementation of the RMP.  He has the authority to commit resources required to implement the Risk Management Program.\n\nThe City of Pueblo Wastewater Treatment Plant has developed an RMP accident prevention program (including HAZOP studies for chlorine and sulfur dioxide) from the existing maintenance program and is in compliance with the RMP requirements for Program 2. \n\nThe City of Pueblo Wastewater Treatment Plant is a ?non-responding facility? and emergency responses permissible by City of Pueblo Waste Water Treatment Plant personnel are responses to incidental releases of hazardous substances where the substance can be absorbed, neutralized, or otherwise controlled at the time of release.  This emergency action plan has been made available to, and coordinated with the City of Pueblo and the Local Emergency Planning Commission.\n\nThere have been no"
