The facility maintains a freezer storage area of nearly 3.5 million cubic ft. which is used to store perishable products.  Blast and room freezing at the facility operate at 0?F or below.  The facility has approximately ten truck unloading/loading spots and four railcar spots, as well as four railcar private siding to aid in the transportation of products.  In order to maintain desired temperatures, a mechanical refrigeration system using anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant is employed.  The refrigeration system is a closed loop system.  The ammonia is not used or mixed in any manner with other chemical processes.\n\nFACILITY CONSTRUCTION: The facility was designed and constructed in accordance with various Mechanical and Building Codes in effect at the time of construction.  These codes and guidelines outline requirements for the safe operation of ammonia refrigeration systems\n\nSAFETY FEATURES:  The ammonia refrigeration system has many safety features.  Safeties include but are not limited to pressure relief valves, stop valves, ammonia detectors, a computerized refrigeration monitoring and control system, as well as trained and experienced operators.  Much of the safety associated with the system, is also inherent in the policies and procedures that govern the operation of the system.  For example, the facility operates in accordance with OSHA?s Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals, 29 CFR 1910.119) and EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP, 40 CFR Part 68). \n\nMANAGEMENT?S COMMITMENT TO SAFETY:  Management takes safety very seriously and mandates that the facility maintain a safe working environment for employees, visitors, neighbors, and products at all times.  Employees are trained on all safety issues relative to their duties and tasks and are made aware "

The Committee also may conduct a safety walk-through at various times to look for possible unsafe conditions or procedures that may exist in and around the facility.  \n\nManagement is committed to providing the necessary resources to ensure that all elements within the regulations are adhered to.\n\nMANAGEMENT SYSTEM:  A Management System has been developed and implemented to ensure that each element within PSM and RMP regulations are properly addressed.  Each person outlined in the ?Responsibilities? section of the Management System is assigned various tasks and/or components of the regulations and is expected to aid in the development and implementation of the components as a whole.  \nThe group works as a team to ensure that not only all elements are met but also to ensure that:  (1) Employees participate in the development and implementation of the programs (2) Employees aid in gathering Process Safety Information, (3) Operating procedures are developed, implemented and certified annually pertaining to the refrigeration system. (4) Safe Work practices are enforced, (5) Proper personnel serve as members of the Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) team and that all recommendations from the PHA are addressed in a timely manner. (6)  Affected employees are properly trained as well as those whose jobs working on or near the refrigeration system are appropriately trained, (7) Contractors are qualified to work on or near the refrigeration system and are informed on potential health and safety risks associated with the system,  (8) Hot Work Permits are properly filled out and all persons affected by the hot work are aware of potential hazards, (9) Compliance Audits are performed and recommendations from the audi"

All deficiencies are noted and addressed in a timely manner.  (13) Incident Investigations are performed on accidental ammonia releases as well as near-misses.  Investigations are utilized to improve employee actions during an emergency. \n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:  There have been no reportable ammonia related accidents, incidents or releases at the facility during 2002 - 2007.  \n\nEMERGENCY ACTION PROGRAM:  The facility has established an Emergency Action Plan. The Plan explains what actions employees, contractor employees, and visitors are to take in the event of an emergency which include steps to take in the event of a fire, earthquake, tornado, etc. \nThe Emergency Action Plan states that all employees shall: \n1)    Notify a supervisor or main office personnel to begin the facility evacuation by activating the public announcement (PA) system.\n2)    Notify the appropriate emergency responders. \n3)    Notify on-site contractors or visitors to evacuate the building. \n4)    Assist in a safe and orderly evacuation. \n5)    Gather at the designated assembly area(s) for a head count.  \n\nIn the event of an ammonia release, employees are instructed to follow the steps as noted above.  Maintenance employees that have been properly trained on the usage of the hand-held ammonia detector may use it, along with the proper PPE, and the ?buddy system? in an attempt to locate the ammonia leak.

Employees aid in gathering Process Safety Information, development and implementation of Operating Procedures, are members of the Process Hazard Analysis (PHA), aiding in the completion of recommendations from both PHA and Compliance Audits, screening process for hiring Contractors, \n\n2. Process Safety Information: Piping and Instrumentation Diagrams (P&ID) have been developed where all piping and major components of the ammonia refrigeration system have been noted and assigned an identifier. Information has been gathered to enable employees to identify and understand the potential hazards of the system. The process safety information includes the Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) for anhydrous ammonia.  An ammonia inventory is collected and retained in the PSI Library.  Relief Valves are identified and labeled.  Equipment within the system is operated within the good engineering practices.  \n\n3. Process Hazard Analysis: A formal study of the ammonia refrigeration system with Management, Safety, and Maintenance personnel was conducted using the HAZOP method to evaluate the potential hazards of the system.  A recommendation summary is used to track completion of all recommendations. \n\n4.
