The ammonia refrigeration process at Blue Harvest Foods (process) has been designed and operates in compliance with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule, and applicable State and local codes and regulations. Blue Harvest Foods has qualified engineering, operations, and maintenance personnel knowledgeable in the safe operation of ammonia refrigeration systems in direct responsibility of the process.  The process is also designed and operated in compliance with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's Process Safety Management (OSHA-PSM) rule. \r\n\r\nThrough its Emergency Action Plan (i.e., Contingency Plan) as required under OSHA PSM, APS has emergency response procedures in place that comply with the Accidental Release Prevention Program (ARPP).\r\n\r\nA DESCRIPTION OF YOUR FACILITY AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\r\nBlue Harvest Foods is a food processing facility primarily engaged in the preparation and packaging of seafood products.  The facility is situated on 7.2 acres, and is a 213,000 sq. ft. Industrially zoned facility with a maximum inventory capacity of 26,332 pounds of anhydrous ammonia within the process.  The ARPP applicability threshold for anhydrous ammonia is 10,000 pounds.  As Blue Harvest Foods anhydrous ammonia storage capacity exceeds this threshold, the facility is subject to the program and is required to prepare a RMP for this process.  The anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system at Blue Harvest is the only process that stores a substance in greater quantities than the ARPP applicability threshold.\r\n\r\nThe process is subject to Risk Management Program 3 because it is subject to OSHA-PSM provisions and it is not eligible for Program 1.\r\n\r\nTHE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\nThe process i"

Process verification takes place through design audits by trained personnel and/or certified consultants.  The schedule of such verifications is at least once every three years.\r\n\r\nAn off-site consequences analysis has been completed for the worst-case release scenario and an alternative release scenario to document the radius of impact (i.e., distance to toxic endpoint) for each scenario and the potential population, public receptors and environmental receptors that fall within the radius of impact for each scenario. \r\n\r\nPreventative maintenance (PM) is an active part of Blue Harvest's daily operations.  PM is performed in accordance with OSHA-PSM and, in many cases; the process safety equipment PM schedule prescribed by Blue Harvest Foods exceeds recommended equipment maintenance schedules.  Ammonia detection sensors are present at twenty four locations and are tested semi-annually.  Relief valves are replaced by an ASME certified agent on a five-year schedule. \r\n\r\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\nIn the last five years there have been no federal reportable releases that caused death, injury, hospitalization or property damage.  \r\n\r\nTHE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\r\nA process release would be detected by ammonia sensors located in process and perimeter locations.  A process release would also be detected by the employees through odor.  The ammonia sensors are tested semi-annually.  An alarm signal is triggered and would sound throughout the facility.  An alarm system auto-dialer is also activated if ammonia is detected.\r\n\r\nIn the event of a process release, the alarm system auto-dialer calls the facility maintenance department, which would in turn contact the New Bedford Fire Department if any of the following conditions are presen"

The 2016 MI Audit and the 2017 PHA Update identified several areas where process improvements could improve the safety of the facility, including repair of damaged insulation, performance of non-destructive testing, replacement of system piping, updating of the existing preventative maintenance plan, which were completed in 2017."
