Equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner. In late 2002, Equistar formed a Reliability Department to focus on improving overall plant reliability and better forecast equipment lifespan in effort to prevent catastrophic failure of certain equipment.\r\n\r\nManagement of Change\r\nWritten procedures are in place at Equistar to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures. Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a process modification are trained in proper operation and maintenance of the modified process prior to the modified equipment being placed in service.\r\n\r\nPre-startup Reviews\r\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at Equistar. These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\r\n\r\nCompliance Audits\r\nEquistar conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented. As an OSHA VPP worksite, Equistar conducts annual audits. Corporate auditing standards, which covers numerous business aspects (maintenance, operations, safety, health & environmental, PSM, etc.) are audited annually. All corrective actions required as a result of the audits are inputted into an electronic corporate-wide tracking system to ensure adequate and timely completion.\r\n\r\nIncident Investigation\r\nEquistar investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in, an employee injury or a catastrophic release of a hazardous material. These investigations, using Apollo Root Cause Analysis are conducted to identify the specific causes, as well as list correcti"

These safeguards also further reduce the potential for catastrophic failures during periods of excursions outside parameters.\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis\r\nEquistar conducts studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently. The methodology used to carry out these analyses is referred to as a unit PHA. The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated on an as needed basis. Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\r\n\r\nOperating Procedures\r\nFor the purposes of safely conducting operations activities, Equistar maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown, and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved with the processes.\r\n\r\nTraining\r\nEquistar has a training program in place to ensure that employees that are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes. New employees receive basic training in process operations followed by on-the-job supervision until they are deemed competent to work independently. Refresher training is provided at least every three years and more frequently as needed.\r\n\r\nMechanical Integrity\r\nEquistar carries out documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper functions.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps. Maintenance is carried out by qualified personnel with previous traini"

Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\nEquistar is committed to employee, public and environmental safety. This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program in place that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at Equistar. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\r\n\r\nThe Corpus Christi Complex maintains a full time, dedicated emergency response team. If a release occurs, Refinery Terminal Fire Company (RTFC) and Equistar personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release. The site also utilizes an electronic card reader access system, LENEL, which improves the accountability process for site personnel during an event. Equistar continues to take community concerns seriously, the site deploys instruments for continuous real-time ambient air monitoring around the facility when needed.\r\n\r\n2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\r\nThe Equistar Corpus Christi Complex uses liquefied petroleum gas and raw materials to produce ethylene plus principal co-products of propylene, benzene, and butadiene. The Corpus Christi Complex is situated on a 1,600 acre site located 12 miles west of downtown Corpus Christi.\r\n\r\n3. The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario Methodology given in the RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance by the EPA has been employed by Equistar to perform worst and alternative case release scenarios. The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\r\n\r\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 3 flammable substances as a class involves a catastrophic"

      "SummaryText": "release from mixed C4 gas storage in the 1,3-butadiene manufacturing process. The scenario involves the release of 6,509,999 pounds of mixed C4 gasses. It is assumed that the entire quantity is released as a vapor, which finds an ignition source, with 10 percent of the released quantity participating in a vapor cloud explosion. Under worst case weather conditions, the maximum distance of approximately 1.5 miles is obtained corresponding to an endpoint of 1 psi overpressure.\r\n\r\nThe alternative release scenario, which is the most likely to occur between the two scenario's, submitted for Program 3 flammable substances involves a release from mixed C4 gas storage in the 1,3-butadiene manufacturing process. The release is assumed to result from a failed pressure relief valve on a storage sphere. The scenario involves the release of approximately 17,000 pounds of mixed C4 gasses in 5 minutes. It is assumed that the entire quantity is released as a vapor, which finds an ignition source, with 10 percent of the released quantity participating in a vapor cloud explosion.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance of approximately 0.2 miles is obtained corresponding to an endpoint of 1 psi overpressure. These calculations were done using RMP*Comp provided online.\r\n\r\n4. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\nEquistar has taken the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR Part 68. This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-58 Standard. A number of processes at Equistar are subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119.\r\n\r\nThe following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program in place at Equistar.\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\nEquistar maintains a record of written safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all process"

Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements. In addition, our employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation to the RMP rule in particular information resulting from process hazard analyses.\r\n\r\nEquistar is a member of the OSHA Voluntary Protection Program. As a VPP Star Work Site, this facility has gone above and beyond the normal safety requirements to provide employees with a safe working environment.\r\n\r\nContractors\r\nEquistar utilizes contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities. Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is carried out. Equistar has a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related to the contractor's work and processes. Resident contractors are trained and must comply with our procedures at a minimum. All site contractors, including non-resident contractors are informed of the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.\r\n\r\n5. Five-year Accident History\r\nThe Corpus Christi Complex has an excellent operating history. During the preceding five years, there have been no fires, explosions or releases, which have significantly impacted plant employees, surrounding public or the environment.\r\n\r\n6. Emergency Response Plan\r\nEquistar's written emergency response plan deals with accidental releases of hazardous materials which includes many aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affe"
