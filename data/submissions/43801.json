      "SummaryText": "Release Prevention and Response Policy\n\n In compliance with the provisions of Title 40  of the Code of General Regulation Part 68, the Queen Anne's County Sanitary District has prepared an integrated Process Safety and Risk Management Plan for the Kent Narrows-Stevensville-Grasonville (KNSG) Wastewater Treatment Plant in Stevensville, Maryland. It is the policy of the Sanitary District to operate all of the water and wastewater treatment facilities within its jurisdiction in the safest and most efficient manner possible, with due regard for the health and safety of the Sanitary District employees, the public, and our environment.\n\nStationary Source and Chemicals\n\n The Kent Narrows-Stevensville-Grasonville (KNSG) Wastewater Treatment Plant in Stevensville employs gaseous chlorine for the disinfection of treated effluent. Sulfur dioxide is used to dechlorinate the disinfected effluent prior to discharge to the environment. This is considered to be a single, continuous process. The gasses are delivered , stored, and drawn from one-ton containers. The Emergency Response Plan has been in existence since 1991 and is coordinated with the local emergency response organizations.\n\nRelease Scenarios\n \n The worst scenario assumes the Environmental Protection Agency mandated elements as defined in 40 CFR 68. The basis for the calculation is the release of one ton (2000 pounds) of chlorine or sulfur dioxide (greatest quantity held in a single vessel) at 0 feet elevation, 100 degrees Fahrenheit, 10 minutes duration, with an atmospheric stability class F.\n\n The alternative scenario assumes the same quantity, a break in the gas withdrawal tubing at the tank connection, a temperature of 77.33 degrees F (the mean monthly maximum, at the closest reporting station, for 5 years 1992-1996), and an atmospheric stability of D. This simulates a spring or summer day that may occur with children occupying neighboring schools.\n\nRelease Prevention\n\n The general release prevention program is base"

The operating personnel are trained in the proper operation, maintenance, connection-disconnection, and emergency response for the chemicals employed at the Kent Narrows-Stevensville-Grasonville (KNSG) Wastewater Treatment Plant. The two chemicals are similar enough that the operations are essentially the same.\n\n All gas-containing tubing and control devices are selected for specific material compatibility and Code and Standard  compliance.The systems are regularly and routinely inspected and maintenance performed as appropriate. The two gas handling systems have been completely rebuilt since the original construction.\n\nThe KNSG Wastewater Treatment Plant will be undergoing an expansion which will include the replacement of the gaseous chlorine disinfection system with ultraviolet light disinfection.This will also eliminate the need for sulfur dioxide dechlorination. It is expected that all the listed chemicals will be removed by March 2007.\n\nAccident History\n\n To date, there have been no accidental releases resulting in either employee injury on-site, or with off-site consequences.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\n The Emergency Response Program is based on the use of the KNSG WWTP employees trained to respond to, and control, an accidental release of either chlorine or sulfur dioxide. The employees are trained in the use of Personal Protective Equipment and specialized ton-container patch kits. There is no chemical emergency or hazardous material response organization, either public or commercial, off-site within a reasonable distance or response time."
