The property is located in a predominantly rural area, on the northern\noutskirts of Kiel. Adjacent properties to the northwest, north, northeast, east, and southeast are\nfarmland or undeveloped. Commercial-type properties are located to the south, southwest, and\nwest. Residential properties are located to the southwest beyond the commercial properties. \n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system was designed and installed in accordance with Wisconsin\nAdministrative Code COMM Chapter 43 and ATM standards. The system is a basic two stage\nmechanical refrigeration system utilizing ammonia as the refrigerant. The total maximum\nintended inventory of ammonia within the refrigeration system at any time is approximately\n20,000 pounds. The facility is equipped with sophisticated alarm and ammonia detection\nsystems, as well as a computerized ammonia monitoring system. \n\nThe worst case release scenario for this stationary source is the total quantity of ammonia\ncontained within the refrigeration system. For this scenario to occur, several pressurized vessels,\nthe piping system, and the engineering controls would all have to fail. The ammonia detection\nsystem is equipped to detect even minor ammonia releases and regulate system operation to\nprevent the release of the entire contents of ammonia. In the unlikely event of the release of all\n20,000 pounds of ammonia, the distance to the toxic end point could be up to 2.52 miles. This is\nbased on the RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis and worst case parameters identified under the\nRMP rule. \n\nSeveral more likely alternate release scenarios were also evaluated for this ammonia system. The\nscenario resulting in the greatest offsite impact is the rupture of a 1/2-inch diameter pipe, causing\nammonia to release under "

The release could have a toxic endpoint distance of up to\n2,350 feet. \n\nSargento Foods is committed to protecting the health and well-being of their employees, the\nenvironment, and the community. Employee training programs are in place, including ammonia\nawareness training for all employees, emergency response training for the response teams and\nammonia system training for the maintenance personnel. The facility has a chemical labeling\nprogram and a spill prevention plan. Outside contractors must follow written contractor policies.\nHot work permits are required. \n\nSargento Foods has never had an accident involving the ammonia system that caused deaths,\ninjuries, property damage, environmental damage or sheltering in place. If an emergency were to\noccur, the local fire and hazardous response team would be notified and the emergency response\nprocedure would be followed. The facility has an Emergency Action Plan, and employees have\nbeen instructed how to use the plan. Emergency drills are carried out several times each year. The\nLocal Emergency Planning Committee has developed an offsite plan for the ammonia system and\nis aware of the procedures in case of a release or emergency situation. The local response teams\nare invited to participate in the annual Emergency Response refresher training, which is\nconducted each year at the Sargento facility. Qualified trainers are retained from Lakeshore\nTechnical College. \n\nThe ammonia system at Sargento Foods--Kiel facility is covered by the Occupational Safety and\nHealth Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management Plan (PSM) which requires the\nfacility to manage system operations and develop emergency response and accident prevention\nprograms. Sargento Foods has developed and implemented a PSM program for the Kiel facility.\nThe PSM was audited in September of 1997. In response to the audit, a Process Hazard Analysis\n(PHA) was conducted in April 1998. The PHA resulted in improved tracking and documentation\nfor trai"
