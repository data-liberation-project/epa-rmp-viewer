The Facility Policy\n\n\n\n     The owners, management, and employees of Lac Qui Parle Co-op Oil Co. are commited to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work the local fire company, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n\n\n2.  Facility Information\n\n\n\n     The primary activity at the facility is the storage of anhydrous ammonia for sale to farmers.\n\n     Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application.  Anhydrous ammonia is used for crop production nutrients.  The facility is manned during the spring and fall anhydrous ammonia seasons.  \n\n     The maximum quantity of ammonia stored would be 473,000 pounds in our 30,000 gallon storage tanks and 1000 and 1450 gallon nurse tanks.  The maximum quantity handled would be the unloading of a truck holding 40,000 pounds.\n\n\n\n3.  The worst case release scenario and the alternative release scenario.\n\n\n\n     A. The worst case release scenario for anhydrous ammonia would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released as a gas over ten minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 138,200 pounds, which represents the volumn of the storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200ppm) is 1.09 miles.\n\n\n\n     B. The alternative release scenario for anhydrous ammonia based on the hazard review is a two minute release from a break in a three inch pipe.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200ppm) is .78 miles.\n\n\n\n4.  The accidental release prevention program.\n\n\n\n     The facility has i"

In addition, MN Department of Agricultural Ammonia rules.\n\n\n\n5.  The five year accident history.\n\n\n\n     There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that: have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place,property damage or environmental damage.\n\n\n\n6.  The emergency response program.\n\n\n\n     The facility has:\n\n     a. A written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.38;\n\n     b. Provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).\n\n     C. Coordinated with local emergency responders.\n\n\n\n7.  Planned changes to improve safety.\n\n\n\n     Safety improvement is an ongoing process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time.\n\n"
