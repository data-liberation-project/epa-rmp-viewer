The plant primarily manufactures the anhydrous ammonia and UAN that provide Farmlands half million producer-members with high-quality, cost effective nutrients for the crops they grow to feed families around the world. As a nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing facility, producing anhydrous ammonia and other fertilizer products utilizing ammonia as a feed stock; this facility is subject to the Environmental Protection Agencies Risk Management Program rules under the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990.\n\nThe Risk Management Program rules require for facilities handling threshold amounts of certain chemical substances to submit Risk Management Plans for the prevention of accidental releases of these substances.  The plan requirements include submission of the risk management plan to include hazard assessments defining possible offsite impacts of certain regulated substance release scenarios, a five-year accident history, description of the facilities accidental release prevention program, and an emergency response program. \n\nThe following is the Executive Summary of the Risk Management Plan for Farmland Industries, Inc., Dodge City Nitrogen Plant at Dodge City, Kansas.\n\nFacility snapshot\nThe Dodge City facility has an ammonia and a UAN plant.  The ammonia plant, in production for 30 years, produces 310,000 tons of anhydrous ammonia annually.  The UAN plant, in production for 23 years, produces 257,000 tons of UAN annually.\n\nImpact on the community\n*Farmland employs 54 Kansas residents at a combined annual salary of nearly $3.2 mi"

These products are primarily used as agricultural fertilizers.\n\nInitial operation began in 1968 with the ammonia unit. The UAN unit was added in 1974.\n\nThe facility produces, handles, and stores large quantities of anhydrous ammonia in its operations.  The ammonia unit uses natural gas, air, and water for the production of ammonia.  Ammonia is used along with by-product carbon dioxide to produce liquid urea in the UAN plant.  Ammonia and air in the same plant are used to produce nitric acid which is subsequently neutralized with ammonia to produce ammonium nitrate. The liquid urea and ammonium nitrate are mixed forming the urea-ammonium nitrate solution product.\n\nEach of these production units along with product ammonia storage and handling constitute the processes covered by the EPA Risk Management Program rule.  Regulated substances include the primary product of the plant, anhydrous ammonia, which is also the main feed stock for urea-ammonium nitrate production.  In addition, flammable substances as a class, and methane (natural gas) and hydrogen produced as an intermediate in ammonia production specifically, are regulated under Risk Management.  Finally, chlorine is also present in regulated threshold quantities on the site.  It is used as a biological control agent in the cooling water systems associated with the production units.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policy\n\nThe management and employees of this facility are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases from this facility.  It is this facilities policy to eliminate significant accidental releases of any substance and, in particular, hazardous and regulated substances; and to minimize an"

It is used as a gas from one ton chlorine cylinders through an injection system to the circulating cooling water.\n\nThe alternate release scenario assumed is failure of the connecting tubing from the cylinder and release of gaseous chlorine.  This release was modeled using the DEGADIS dispersion program.\n\nFlammables\n\nLarge volumes of flammable gases are handled throughout the plant, even though actual physical inventory is relatively low.  More likely flammable release events include failures of smaller pipes and lines in comparison to the large release contemplated in the worst case analysis.\n\nThe alternative scenario assumed the synthesis loop relief valve has lifted for three minutes.  The impact distance of this event utilized the EPA Offsite Consequence Analysis Look Up Tables.  Most more reasonable and likely events result in minimal impact distances.\n\nPlanned Changes for Safety Improvements\n\nSafety improvements are a continual and ongoing process at the facility which is facilitated by the Prevention Program/Process Safety Management Program.  Formal process hazard analysis is conducted at least every five years, but review is constant through management of change procedures, operator training, incident investigation, and mechanical integrity programs.

For this facility, the regulated substances include anhydrous ammonia and chlorine as regulated toxics, and flammables as a class which include methane and hydrogen.  The rule requires an analysis of the worst case toxic as that scenario affecting the greatest distance and a worst case flammable accident as a vapor cloud explosion.  Alternate scenarios, which are more reasonably likely events, for each regulated toxic and flammables in general must also be presented.\n\nWorst Case Toxic Release-Anhydrous Ammonia\n\nBecause of the seasonal nature of fertilizer use and application in agriculture, large quantities of the ammonia produced at this facility must be stored until needed by the ultimate consumer.  The RMP rule requires that the largest amount in a single vessel be considered the release quantity for the worst case event unless smaller quantities handled at different conditions result in a greater distance to the regulated endpoint of consideration.  This is a requirement of the rule regardless of whether the event is likely, or, could even reasonably occur.\n\nFor this facility, the largest single quantity of anhydrous ammonia is held in either of the two atmospheric storage tanks.  The quantity for one tank is 30,000 tons.  However, the worst case release pertains to the 200 ton anhydrous ammonia high pressure non-diked bullet tank.  The worst case release assumes, as required by the rule, that this entire amount is released as a result of a catastrophic fa"

This unlikely event was modeled by a publicly available model (DEGADIS) which is known to provide reasonable estimates of concentrations and distances associated with release events.  Details of the results of this modeling are provided elsewhere in the Risk Management Plan Submittal. \n\nTo assure that the event indicated above was, in fact, the worst case as the rule defines it; failure of other ammonia storage tanks present at the site were also modeled.  In addition, a worst case failure of chlorine containers was similarly modeled.  Neither of these resulted in a distance greater than the circumstance noted above.\n\nIt should be emphasized that the possibility of such an event as described by the worst case is so low as to be non-existent.  Analysis of this scenario was completed as required by the rule.  Facility maintenance and inspection programs address the integrity of process and storage vessels, and preclude such massive and improbable failures.\n\nWorst Case Flammable\n\nAs the rule requires, the largest quantity flammable release and a subsequent vapor cloud explosion must be analyzed as the worst case for these substances.  In this facility, a failure releasing the entire contents of the ammonia conversion loop constitutes the largest flammable release.  This quantity is assumed to result in a vapor cloud explosion with impact distance determined by the EPA Offsite Consequence Analysis Look up Tables. Although large volumes of flammable gases are handled daily by the plant, actual in-process inventory is relatively small.  Impact distance is relatively limited as a result.\n\nAlternate Case Toxics \n\nAmmonia\n\nMore reasonably likely release events tend to concentrate in areas where the ammonia product is handled such as loading and other transport activities.  Significantly lower quantities are involved, various shutdown safeguards are present as they are through out the plant, and operator intervention all tend to mitigate and limit the conse"
