The unified Risk & Process Safety Management Plan sets forth rules, procedures and practices that will help our employees protect themselves and our neighbors.\r\n\r\n2.  DESCRIPTION OF AMMONIA SYSTEM\r\nThe KY Packing Plant facility is a commercial cold storage facility for tree fruit and citrus.  The facility has an ammonia system that provides refrigeration capacity to multiple cold rooms equipped with forced air tunnels for cooling fruit.  Two rooms are designated as precooling rooms, two are designated as cold storage rooms and two others are designated as bin rooms.  All of the rooms are equipped with bunker style evaporator coils that contain chilled liquid ammonia.  There are cooled loading dock and hall areas as well as a hydrocooler.  A computer system provides substantial control, monitoring, and alarm capability.\r\n\r\nHigh pressure liquid from a high pressure receiver is piped to a series of a liquid feed solenoid valves.  From there, high pressure liquid is piped to each cold room or refrigerated zone, where it passes through an expansion valve into a low pressure accumulator vessel mounted in the room bunker.  Low temperature liquid circulates by thermal convection through the evaporator coils located behind bunker walls in the cold rooms.  Low pressure and temperatures gas collects in the accumulator vessel, and passes through a pressure regulator into a suction line.  The suction line returns the vapor to the primary accumulator vessel located in the engine room, which separates any residual liquid from the gas.  The only exception is the hydro-cooler suction line which bypasses the main suction accumulator and connects directly with a dedicated compressor.  In this case the Hydro-cooler accumulator is overd and acts as a suction accumulator.  The gas is piped to refrigeration compressors which elevate the temperature and pressure of the gas.  The high pressure discharge from the compressors is sent to water coo"

Liquid separated from the suction return gas in the primary accumulator vessel is pumped into a liquid transfer vessel.  Operation of a float switch activated solenoid valve raises the pressure in the liquid transfer vessel to the point the liquid can be drained into the high pressure receiver.\r\n\r\nThe facility was built by professional refrigeration engineers in accordance with industry standards at the time.  It was also built in compliance with the Uniform Mechanical Code and Uniform Building Code applicable at the time of construction.  The system contains numerous safety devices including sensors which stop the compressors if temperatures or pressures exceed or drop below established limits, and safety relief valves which vent ammonia gas to the atmosphere if the pressure is the system exceeds their set point.  In addition, ammonia detectors are located throughout the facility, and will shut down equipment if ammonia is detected.  Lastly, emergency switches are located near the mechanical room that will turn off equipment and vent ammonia if necessary.\r\n\r\nThe ammonia system at this facility consists of vessels which are interconnected, or which are co-located such that a release of ammonia could impact the ability to operate vessels that are not directly connected.  Therefore, the facility is treated as a single process.\r\n\r\n3.  GENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE & AMMONIA SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  This facility was designed and constructed in 1977 and met all applicable building codes (1973 UBC) and industry standard practices.  It has had several upgrades to the system, controls and safety systems since the original construction.  It has had periodic inspections and hazard reviews to prevent accidental"

The order of elements within this organization is not the same as they are listed in the regulations, and in some cases portions of elements may be found in more than one location.\r\n\r\n1.  THE KY PACKING, RISK & PROCESS SAFETY MANAGEMENT PROGRAM\r\nThis is to inform interested persons, including employees, that KY Packing recently purchased the closed Ballantine Produce Facility in Reedley CA.  All of the anhydrous ammonia was removed from the facility several years ago before it was idled.  The facility is being refurbished and we have completed a new unified Risk & Process Safety Management Program.  The program is in compliance with California's Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program (in California CCR Title 19, Chapter 4.5 Program Level 3 Elements.  At the Federal Level, Title 40 CFR Prt 68), and California OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) of Acutely Hazardous Materials standard (in California CCR Title 8, Section 5189, Process Safety Management of Acutely Hazardous Materials, and Federally Title 29 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 1910.119).  This program has been prepared to address the risks involved with the presence of anhydrous ammonia in an amount in excess of 10,000 lbs.\r\n\r\nOur program promotes overall plant, worker, and public safety.  The program enables our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of anhydrous ammonia.  Overall, the program is designed to prevent accidental fatalities, injuries and illnesses and avoid physical property damage.\r\n\r\nOur company has an exemplary safety record, one that we are quite proud of.  Our company has many policies and procedures in place to promote overall, worker and public safety.  We have : (1) prepared a unified program based on the PSM plan to meet CalAPR obligations as well; (2) reorganized the program so that it meshes more closely with general KY Packing business practices; and (3) reviewed plan docu"

Federally, Title 29 CFR 1910.38 and 1910.119), HAZWOPER (standard in California CCR Title 8, Section 5192, hazardous Waste Operation and Emergency Response, and Title 29 CFR 1910.120).\r\n\r\nStrategically, we will respond defensively to a release.  Under this plan our ammonia refrigeration personnel will take whatever steps are necessary to bring a release under control withou"

To better prepare for this type of action, initial training to the defensive level (First Responder, Operations Level) as defined in the Hazwoper regulations will take place within the next year.  All response activities would be done in coordination with the local fire department and Hazardous Materials Response Team.\r\n\r\nEvery year at the beginning of the season we review with our employees our evacuation procedures in the event of an emergency, including an ammonia release.\r\n\r\n6.  PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\n  Many policies and procedures have been implemented to promote overall plant, worker and public safety.  Nevertheless, KY Packing continually strives to improve in all areas, including safety.  Preparation of this Risk & Process Safety Management Program, replacing corroded piping & valves, completing seismic walkdown recommendations of bolting down equipment, calibration of detection systems and testing of all safety controls has been the primary recent improvement, and implementation of the program is our plan for improved safety in the near future.\r\n\r\nThe Risk & Process Safety Management Program has been written so that program elements are aligned with KY Packing business practices rather than the order presented in the law.  Thus, Safe Operating Procedures are grouped together for the benefit of our system operator.  Safe Operating Policies are grouped together so that appropriate office staff may administer them.  The Emergency Action Plan is now separated out and distributed widely through the plant for easy reference.\r\n\r\nThe Risk & Process Safety Management Program documentation forms and company policy forms pertaining to employee, contractor, and community safety have been carefully reviewed so as to prevent unnecessary complexity and redundancy.  Our operator assisted in"

      "SummaryText": "the writing of Standard Operating Procedures and they are presented in a format that is easy to use.\r\n\r\nFor the future, KY Packing now thinks of the Risk & Process Safety Management Program as a living document.  It is an interactive framework that guides safe action for KY Packing employees, but allows for feedback and continual improvement.  Through the Risk & Process Safety Management Program KY Packing will continue to profit while maintaining overall plant, worker and public safety."
