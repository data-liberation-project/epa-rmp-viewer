Training plans are specifically developed for various employee groups. The frequency of the training varies within a three-year cycle depending upon the employee group and the topic.\r\n\r\n(3) The auditing activities include both internal and external audits.  Internal audits are completed using a wide range of plant resources.  Plant personnel conduct routine general inspections of plant facilities on a regular basis (e.g. daily/weekly/monthly).  Facility personnel conduct extended plant-wide audits at a minimum three-year frequency.   These audits include safety, housekeeping, transportation, ergonomics, emergency systems, industrial hygiene, process safety management and mechanical integrity inspections.  Corporate and Division staff, state and federal agencies, insurance companies, etc. conduct external audits.\r\n\r\n(4) Process Hazard Analyses are completed for each manufacturing and related support facilities on a 5-year cycle in accordance with applicable OSHA Process Safety Management regulations. Selected management of change activities also requires a hazard analysis. The analyses evaluate the impact of unexpected events to both in-plant and off-plant receptors.\r\n\r\nFive-year accident history: The plant maintains records of all chemical releases. Our records document that we have had no accidental releases of the RMP-listed substances meeting the RMP rule criteria for the past five years.\r\n\r\nThe plant also has a well-established emergency response plan. Its primary purpose is to guide plant personnel during emergency situations. The secondary purpose is to communicate to the surrounding communities and area response agencies how the facility intends to respond to potential emergency situations.

This total includes the maximum allowable bromine in the storage tank and the amount in the chemical process.\r\n\r\nChlorine\r\n\r\nChlorine is shipped to the plant in one ton cylinders. One ton cylinders are widely available and are used in a variety of industries. Upon receipt, the cylinders are placed into specially designed cradles and transported to a cylinder storage shed for weather protection. When needed, the cylinders are moved to a separate building which houses a chlorine dispensing system which vaporizes the chlorine and conveys it to the chemical manufacturing process where it is consumed. One cylinder is connected to the dispensing system at a time. A maximum of eight cylinders is allowed in the dispensing building including the one being used. The maximum number of cylinders allowed on the plant site is twenty.

The various teams are equipped to respond to plant emergencies.  The plant recognizes the potential need to utilize community emergency response agencies during some emergency situations. Therefore, plant emergency response teams work closely with members of the Palmyra, Hannibal, Quincy and Hannibal Rural Fire Departments sharing plant response information, conducting joint training exercises, providing emergency response support to communities for incidents not related to plant activities, and in many areas participating in local voluntary response agencies.\r\n\r\nThe Hannibal Plant has an effective safety program as indicated by its excellent safety performance record.  The plant has implemented effective programs to minimize the potential for off-site releases. At this time, there are no specific changes planned for the safety program related to the RMP activities. The Plant's Central EHS Committee meets on a regular basis to evaluate performance and to modify and improve the Safety and Environmental program as needed."

It is our policy to not only to comply with all applicable federal, state, and local rules and regulations but also to voluntarily go beyond these requirements to ensure our continued successful and safe operations.  We have developed and implemented the following to help achieve our goals:\r\n\r\n* State of the art process equipment and process control design incorporating safety devices and systems needed to properly handle, store or use materials in our processes\r\n* Well-defined and documented operating procedures and control systems\r\n* An extensive safety, health and process safety management system\r\n* Well-trained production employees coupled to a trained technical staff\r\n* An extensive preventive maintenance and equipment inspection program\r\n* Plant site access is restricted to authorized employees, management personnel, and authorized contractors\r\n\r\nIn addition to these preventative programs, it is the plant's policy to maintain an up-to-date emergency response plan and trained personnel and response equipment to be prepared to respond to potential emergencies involving fire, releases of hazardous material, medical emergencies, and confined space rescue. The plant works closely with area, community, emergency-response agencies providing them with information on plant operations and response programs in addition to conducting periodic training with members of the local emergency response agencies.\r\n\r\nBASF's Hannibal facility has seven substances that exceed the RMP threshold quantities.
