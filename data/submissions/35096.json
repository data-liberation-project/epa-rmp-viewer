As a result, accidental release prevention and emergency responsibilities have been instituted which include: operating and maintenance procedures,training and incident investigation programs for handling sulfur dioxide,notification of trained personnel,an on-site emergency response plan and procedures for notification of local emergency planning individuals in the event that local emergency response is needed.\n\nThe Worst Case Release Scenario as described in this program is the release of the entire contents of a one-ton liquid sulfur dioxide container in ten minutes, or 200 lb/min.. All of the on-site sulfur dioxide containers are enclosed in a building, therefore, the release rate has been reduced to 110 lbs/min. For the worst case release scenario, a wind speed of 1.5 meters/sec. And an atmospheric stability class F was used. Using a combination of local data and an approved modeling program, the distance to the toxic endpoint was determined to be 2.0 miles.\n\nThe Alternative Release Scenario as described in this program was based on a sulfur dioxide container isolation valve stem failure. A release rate of 6 lb/min., a wind speed of 3.0 meters/sec., and an atmospheric stability class D was used. This data when modeled, produced no off-site impacts.\n\nThe dispersion modeling for both scenarios was conducted using the SLABVIEW program, version 1.5 and site specific information.\n\nThe sulfur dioxide-specific accidental release prevention program in place at the facility provides written procedures that incorporated operational and maintenance data and training procedures for dependable use of relief valves, leak detection systems and alarms.\n\nNo accidents have occurred at this site in the past five years. Procedures are in place to identify and record any future accidents or incidents.\n\nAn on-site Emergency Response Program, including an evaluation plan, assembly areas,"
