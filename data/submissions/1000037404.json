INEOS views safety, health and the environment as the top priority of all INEOS companies.\r\n\r\n2.  FACILITY DESCRIPTION AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\r\n\r\nThe facility manufactures plastics and resins.  The plastic pellet products are sold to molders for end use in refrigerator and automobile interiors, medical uses, computer housings, health spas, tools, and much more. The resins are used to coat circuit boards and coat aluminum cans to allow printing on the can.\r\n\r\nTwo RMP chemicals are used in the facility, acrylonitrile and butadiene.  These make up two of the three main chemicals used to make the plastic products.  (The third being styrene a non-RMP chemical).  Acrylonitrile is a liquid and stored in two tanks prior to being used in smaller tanks and in several plastic manufacturing processes.  Butadiene is stored under pressure in a tank.  All storage tanks have concrete dike floors and walls capable of holding more than the quantity of the material being stored.  Multiple processes use these chemicals in various quantities in a process at one time.   Acrylonitrile is the only toxic RMP chemical and represents the worst case scenario for toxic chemicals.  Butadiene is the only flammable RMP chemical and thus represents the worst case flammable scenario.\r\n \r\n3A. WORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIOS\r\n\r\nThe worst case scenario for acrylonitrile assumes the following:\r\n&#61607;\tGreatest quantity of acrylonitrile is released from the largest storage tank over a 10 minute per"
