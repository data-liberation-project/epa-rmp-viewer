They are transported on roads, water, and railways.\n\nThe Metropolitan Council's Metropolitan Wastewater Treatment Plant\n\n(Metro Plant) stores chemicals that it uses in its daily\n\noperations. The facility currently uses chlorine stored in up to\n\ntwo 90-ton railroad tank cars and sulfur dioxide in stored in two\n\n50,000-pound bulk storage tanks. Chlorine is used to disinfect the\n\ntreated wastewater and the sulfur dioxide is used to remove\n\nresidual chlorine, or dechlorinate the treated wastewater to\n\nprotect organisms in the river when it is discharged.\n\n\n\nChlorine and sulfur dioxide are non-explosive and non-flammable.\n\nHowever, they support combustion under some circumstances. They\n\nare both respiratory irritants, and if accidentally released into\n\nthe environment, exposure through inhalation or through eye or\n\nskin contact can pose a health risk. As a precaution, the Metro\n\nPlant has special safety systems that are an integral part of the\n\nchlorine and sulfur dioxide systems.\n\n\n\nThe Metropolitan Council takes its safety obligations in storing\n\nand using chemicals as seriously as providing the environment with\n\nsafe disinfected water. The following document describes the steps\n\nwe take every day to ensure a safely operating plant, what could\n\nhappen if there was an accidental release of a chemical stored on\n\nsite, and what to do in event of an emergency.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\n\n\nThis document complies with the U.S. Environmental Protection\n\nAgency's (EPA's) Risk Management Program, appearing in Se"

The Risk\n\nManagement Program requires facilities that use certain substances\n\nabove certain quantity thresholds to develop a plan to reduce the\n\nlikelihood of an accidental release of the substances to the\n\natmosphere and reduce the likelihood of serious harm to the public\n\nand the environment. This plan is referred to the Risk Management\n\nPlan (RMP).\n\n\n\nChlorine and sulfur dioxide are stored at the Metro Plant in\n\nquantities above the regulatory thresholds at which a RMP is\n\nrequired. This RMP document summarizes the existing safety\n\nsystems, policies, procedures, and on-going actions that are\n\ndesigned to prevent or minimize impacts of accidental releases of\n\nchlorine or sulfur dioxide to the environment.

To date, the plant has\n\nhad an excellent record in preventing accidents from occurring.\n\nNo chlorine or sulfur dioxide releases causing a safety or health\n\nhazard affecting the surrounding community have occurred at the\n\nMetro Plant since the use of these chemicals began (chlorine in\n\n1969 and sulfur dioxide in 1986).\n\n\n\nUnderstanding the Chemicals Used at the Metro Plant\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Metro Plant, operating since the 1930's, is located at 2400\n\nChilds Road in St. Paul, Minnesota. Wastewater from St. Paul,\n\nMinneapolis, and sixty other surrounding communities is treated\n\nat the Metro Plant and discharged into the Mississippi River.\n\nThe wastewater treatment process includes preliminary screening,\n\nprimary settling and treatment, advanced secondary treatment and\n\nclarification, and chlorination and dechlorination before final\n\ndischarge. The Metro Plant treats approximately 225 million\n\ngallons of wastewater per day. The Metro Plant has a\n\nchlorination system"

Liquid chlorine is withdrawn directly from the\n\nrail car and delivered to the wastewater chlorination process.\n\nLiquid sulfur dioxide is brought to the plant by tank trucks and\n\nis transferred to the bulk storage tanks. Liquid sulfur dioxide\n\nis withdrawn from the bulk storage tanks and delivered to the\n\nwastewater dechlorination process. The Metro Plant uses\n\nstate-of-the-art process equipment to maximize the safety for\n\nplant staff and the community at large. Some of the specific\n\nfeatures are as follows. Chlorine and sulfur dioxide leak\n\ndetectors continuously monitor for leaks in the bulk storage\n\nareas and in the chlorination and dechlorination rooms. Leak\n\nalarms activate an audible alarm throughout the plant as well as\n\na red flashing warning light in the storage areas and in the\n\nplant tunnels. The alarms also sound at the central and local\n\ncontrol panels. Leaks are detected at three detection levels\n\n(1,2, and 5 parts per million) at 15 locations within the plant.\n\nThe leak detection alarms are tested weekly.\n\n\n\nOther system alarms include high pressure in liquid piping,\n\nevaporator malfunction, low vacuum at the chlorinator or\n\nsulfonator, and low injector water pressure. These alarms sound\n\nat the chlorine and sulfur dioxide central and local control\n\npanels. In addition, evaporator shut-off and pressure reducing\n\nvalves are designed to close if low evaporator gas temperature is\n\ndetected; thus preventing liquid chlorine or sulfur dioxide from\n\nreaching the gas piping system. Vacuum regulators are used on the\n\ngas piping so that chlorine and sulfur dioxide gas is delivered\n\nunder vacuum. If a leak were to occur on this piping, outside air\n\nwould be drawn into the piping rather than chlorine or sulfur\n\ndioxide gas b"

To ensure that hot work\n\nis done safely, a Hot Work Permit Program has been developed that\n\nrequires a permit to be issued before hot work is performed. Hot\n\nwork is defined as the use of oxyacetylene torch, welding\n\nequipment, grinders, cutting, brazing, or similar flame-or spark-\n\nproducing operations.\n\n\n\nThe process of completing the hot work permit makes it necessary to\n\nidentify the hazard, recognize what safeguards are appropriate, and\n\nthen initiate the safeguards necessary to ensure a fire-safe\n\nworkplace.

Modifications to the chlorine or\n\nsulfur dioxide systems will be reviewed before they are\n\nimplemented to determine if the modification would compromise\n\nsystem safety. An effective change management system will help\n\nminimize the chance for an accidental release.\n\n\n\nIf a modification covered under RMP/PSM is made, its effects must\n\nbe addressed, employees must be informed, and the written\n\noperating procedures must be updated. The intent is to require\n\nthat all modifications to equipment, procedures, and processing\n\nconditions other than \"replacement in kind\" be managed by\n\nidentifying and reviewing them before implementation. A\n\nManagement of Change Committee that consists of plant\n\nengineering, operations, and/or maintenance staff is formed to\n\nevaluate any modifications that are covered under the RMP/PSM.\n\nThe committee will complete a Management of Change Form that must\n\nbe reviewed and authorized prior to initiation of a covered\n\nchange.\n\n\n\nIncident Investigation\n\n\n\nEach incident that resulted in or could reasonably have resulted\n\nin a catastrophic release of chlorine or sulfur dioxide must be\n\ninvestigated. A process to identify the underlying causes of\n\nincidents and to implement procedures for preventing similar\n\nevents has been developed. To investigate an incident, facility\n\nmanagement will establish an investigation team. As part of the\n\ninvestigation, the investigation team will prepare an incident\n\nreport to recommend system changes.\n\n\n\nThe investigation team should ask questions such as what\n\nequipment failed, which behavior failed, and which material\n\nleaked, reacted, or explode"

A determination will be made as to whether it is\n\nnecessary to institute additional training for the employees to\n\nprevent the incident from occurring in the future. On the\n\nincident report form, the plant management identifies which of\n\nthe recommended system changes are approved for implementation.\n\nThe incident investigation report and any changes resulting from\n\nthe report will be reviewed with all staff members who operate\n\nand maintain the applicable system.\n\n\n\nCompliance Audit\n\n\n\nThe Metro Plant is required to complete a triennial compliance\n\naudit of the chlorine and sulfur dioxide processes for the\n\nRMP/PSM program. The primary goals of conducting an internal\n\ncompliance audit are to gather sufficient data to verify\n\ncompliance with RMP/PSM requirements and good process safety\n\npractices, identify process safety deficiencies and develop\n\ncorrective actions, and to increase safety awareness among plant\n\nstaff.\n\n\n\nThe compliance audit methodology is modeled after OSHA's\n\nguidelines for conducting regulatory PSM compliance audits:\n\nCompliance Guidelines and Enforcement Procedures, OSHA\n\nInstruction CPL 2-2.45A (September 28, 1995). A team that\n\nincludes at least one person knowledgeable in the covered\n\nprocesses and an audit leader knowledgeable in RMP/PSM\n\nrequirements and audit techniques will conduct the audits.
