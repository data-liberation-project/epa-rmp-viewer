All applicable procedures of the Iowa Department of Natural Resources and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) are adhered to.  The Des Moines Water Works emergency response policy involves the preparation of a response plan tailored to our facility and to the emergency response services available from the community, and is in compliance with the EPA Emergency Response Plan.\n\nThe Des Moines Water Works treatment facility has been in service for over 75 years.  The hazardous substances stored and used on this site allow us to disinfect and purify the water we provide to our customers.  The covered process involves a chlorine room, chlorinators, monitoring and detection equipment, instrument panels and additional safety equipment.  The amount of chlorine handled in the chlorine room has decreased to four one-ton cylinders.  We have reduced the amount of chlorine stored on site and have a goal to use zero amounts of chlorine gas in the near future.  This facility has added a sodium hypochlorite production facility, the equipment is installed and in use.  The system is being tested for reliability at this time.  The sodium hypochlorite will disinfect the treated water the same way chlorine gas does but with minimal risk to employees and off-site receptors.  \n\nThe offsite consequence analysis for worst case scenarios have been omitted from this update as suggested in the legislation dated April 9, 2004.\n\nThe Des Moines Water Works accidental release prevention program is based on the following:\n\n1.  High level of training of the operators.\n\n2.  Preventative maintenance program.\n\n3.  Use of accurate and effective operating procedures, written with the participation of operators.\n\n4.  Performance of hazard review of equipment and procedures.\n\n5.  Implemenation of an auditing and inspection program.\n\nChem"

The facility has also coordinated with the Des Moines Fire Department HazMat Team.  The Des Moines Water Works is an active member of the Polk County Local Emergency Planning Committee, which has a public notification program."
