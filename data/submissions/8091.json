Our mission includes a commitment to act as responsible neighbors in our communities. We will accomplish our mission by adhering with all applicable federal, state, and local laws. The facility has developed an emergency response plan and has coordinated response activities with the Marshall Fire Department.\n\nThis facility slaughters and processes pork for market distribution and ultimately for public consumption. Ammonia refrigeration is used throughout the plant for all areas that require cooling. The system includes receiving tanks, compressors, chillers, freezers, condensers, and associated piping, valves, and other equipment. \n\nOur worst-case scenario for the ammonia refrigeration system is a failure of an accumulator tank, resulting in a release of ammonia. Written operating procedures limit the maximum quantity of ammonia in the tank to 80% of its capacity (29,000 pounds). This quantity of ammonia would rarely be present in the accumulator. During normal operations, the vessel inventory is approximately 12,000 pounds of ammonia. The distance to endpoint for this scenario is 3.1 miles according to look-up tables in EPA's guidance document for Ammonia Refrigeration Systems. Public receptors were identified within this distance to endpoint. Environmental receptors were not found within the distance to endpoint. An alternative release scenario was also analyzed. The alternative release scenario examined a release of 5,000 pounds of ammonia resulting from a condenser fan blade cutting several condenser coils. The distance to endpoint for the alternative release scenario is 0.4 miles. Within this distance to endpoint, several public receptors were identified, including residences. No environmental receptors were found.\n\nThis facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule and all applicable state and local codes and regulations. In addition, the fa"

Our prevention program includes written operating and mechanical integrity procedures, safe work practices, a contractor safety program, management of change, and pre-startup safety reviews. In addition, we have implemented a training program to ensure that our employees are knowledgeable in the hazards of the process and in their specific job functions. If an incident does occur, it is thoroughly investigated and the findings of the investigation are communicated to all affected employees. We believe our prevention program is key to minimizing the risk to our employees, the public, and the environment.\n\nIn the past five years, we have not had an accident involving ammonia that resulted in any on-site deaths, injuries, or significant property damage; or resulted in any offsite deaths, injuries, property damage, environmental damage, evacuations, or shelterings in place.\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving ammonia, we will implement our emergency response plan. If necessary, we will also notify the Marshall Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency. Our emergency response plan has been coordinated with the fire department and they have inspected our facility.\n\nAlthough we do not have any active projects to further improve the safety of our systems, it is our policy to continuously work towards better and safer systems."
