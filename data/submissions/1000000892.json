We pledge to continue to make our community one that our \nresidents are proud to call home.\n\nThis process is one of dozens of regulatory requirements that our managers \nand employees are committed to meeting so that we can ensure the ready \navailability of safe, healthy drinking water for our residents.  These \nrequirements include, among the many others, specialized training, \neducation, and experience, the following of carefully prescribed procedures, \nthe performance of laboratory tests, and ensuring that the water systems \nmeets stringent requirements for safety, quality, purity, and mechanical \nintegrity.\n\nWithout the active support of our employees we could not meet, let alone \nexceed, these requirements.  We are indebted to their commitment to our \nprecious natural resources, to the environment, and to the communities they \ncall home.\n\nAs part of our commitment to the safety and well-being of our employees and \nto the members of the community we serve, we are pleased to describe our \nefforts to not only meet, but to exceed, the requirements set by the Ohio \nEnvironmental Protection Agency.\n\nOur water treatment facility presently uses chlorine to disinfect our water \nand to make it suitable for consumption.   We routinely test our water to \nmake sure it meets the EPA's tough criteria .\n\nWe receive our chlorine in one ton containers.  In general, we maintain \napproximately six containers on site at any one time in order to ensure that \nwe do not run out of chlorine.  This redundancy is required by the EPA to \nprotect the public's drinking water from possible contamination.\n\nOnce the chlorine comes onto our property we follow carefully considered \nprocedures to ensure "

This room is used only for storing and using our chlorine.  \nIt is constructed of fire resistant materials and is designed to contain the \ncontents of our containers in the event of a leak.  This room has special \nalarms designed to immediately alert us to the smallest leak.  Because of \nthe possibility for a leak in this area, only trained employees handle or \nmove the chlorine.\n\nThe process of getting chlorine out of the storage container and into the \nwater is a simple procedure for our employees.  Once a container is empty \nour specially trained employees shut off the supply, disconnect the hose \nfrom the empty container, and reconnect to a new container that is full of \nchlorine.  They check to make sure the container has no leaks (using \nammonia) and turn the system back on.  If a leak occurs, the most common way \nto fix it is to shut off the supply.  Our trained employees know how to \nperform this shut-off procedure and others like it, just in case. They \nmaintain the specialized equipment they might need to use for such an event \nin a near-by area.\n\nOnce the chlorine supply is turned back on, the chlorine is sent to the \nwater supply through specially manufactured and purchased equipment that \nautomatically ensures that the right amount is provided to our water, and \nultimately to our community.  This equipment is inspected and maintained by \nour trained maintenance people.  For more complicated repairs we have the \nmanufacturer or other specialists come in to help us.\n\nAs part of our responsibility in this process, we have carefully examined \nour method of handling the chlorine and other chemicals, including reviewing \nand revising what we can, or must, do in an emergency.

We have sought the aid of our \nlocal community fire department and emergency responders, as well as our \nlocal emergency planning committee, to help devise plans to ensure that the \npeople of our community are protected in the event that the unlikely does \noccur.\n\nOne step that we have taken to ensure adequate response is to predict (using \nmodels provided by the EPA) what the worst possible event might be, so that \nwe can make sure that we, as a community, can respond effectively.   The \nplanning model that we used says that we should be prepared for an event \nthat could spread up to one mile from our plant.

If an unexpected leak occurs our \nventilation system will route the gas from our storage room to this area \nwhere it can safely be controlled.\n\nWe have cooperated fully with our local fire department and other responders \nto ensure that they are aware of this possible event and we have \nco-developed, and will continue to cooperatively refine, a plan for making \nsure that people and the environment in our community are protected.\n\nIn the future we may consider other ways to ensure the safety of the \ndrinking water of our community.
