Upon the completion of a compliance audit, NCP prioritizes the audit findings and commences corrective action to remediate any deficiencies noted during the audit. \r\n\r\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nThe facility had a reportable release of denatured ethanol in March of 2014. In total 2,458 gallons of product were released into the containment berm and some was released through a faulty valve in the containment berm. The cause of the incident was a failed level indicator in the tank. The facility responded immediately and was able to contain and clean up the release without any environmental contamination taking place. Soil samples confirmed the soil was clean after response. \r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE INFORMATION\r\n\r\nNCP has developed an Emergency Action Plan. Emergency response activities are coordinated with local personnel and contractors. NCP routinely conducts training and drills to ensure the effectiveness of its emergency response program."

      "SummaryText": "n. The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment prepared for startup prior to the addition of hazardous chemicals. \r\n-\tMechanical Integrity - NCP utilizes a computerized maintenance management system called MAPCON to manage its mechanical integrity program.  MAPCON generates preventative maintenance work orders in accordance with manufacturer's recommendations and applicable codes and standards. The MAPCON system is used to maintain records of all maintenance activity including emergency repairs and non routine maintenance activity. The records contained in MAPCON include, among other things, the identification of the equipment, the details of the procedure or test being performed, the results of any inspections or tests, the name of the person performing the work and the date the work was performed. \r\n-\tManagement of Change - NCP has a comprehensive process to manage changes that are not replacement in kind. NCP employees are trained on when MOC is required and how to complete the documentation required to support the MOC process. The MOC process is completed prior to the implementation of the change. \r\n-\tIncident Investigation - NCP investigates all incidents that occur at the facility including personal injury incidents, near misses and incidents which resulted in or could have resulted in a catastrophic release of a hazardous chemical. Incident investigations are led by a person trained in investigation techniques and all incident investigations are documented. Documentation includes the date and time of the incident, a description of the incident, contributing factors to the incident, any recommendations resulting from the investigation, the names of the parties involved in the investigation and the date and time the investigation began\r\n-\tCompliance Audits - NCP performs compliance audits of their PSM process and RMP Program at least once every three years. The most recent compliance audit was conducted in May"

      "SummaryText": "FACILITY BACKGROUND\r\n\r\nThis RMP serves as a resubmission for the Nebraska Corn Processing, LLC facility located in Furnas County, Cambridge, Nebraska. An RMP was most recently submitted in August of 2012. That RMP was submitted based upon changes in the process. This resubmission serves as the 5 year resubmittal \r\n\r\nREGULATED SUBSTANCES\r\n\r\nThe facility processes grain to produce fuel grade ethanol and high protein cattle feed. The facility is currently subject to RMP due to its use of flammable liquids in excess of threshold quantities. The facility uses natural gasoline (denaturant) as an additive to the ethanol prior to shipment to make the ethanol unfit for human consumption. The denaturant contains pentane in excess of the threshold quantity.  \r\n\r\nCHANGES SINCE PREVIOUS SUBMISSION\r\n\r\nThere have been no significant changes in the process since the last resubmission.\r\n\r\nPREVENTION PROGRAM STEPS\r\n\r\nNCP complies with all applicable OSHA and EPA regulations including OSHA's PSM standard, 29 CFR 1910.119. Compliance with the PSM standard is an integral portion of NCP's RMP prevention program. The following specific elements are incorporated into the prevention program for the NCP facility.\r\n\r\n-\tEmployee Participation - NCP encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention. Employee involvement examples include employees participating in compiling and updating technical documents, safety information and SOPs; employees participating in PHA's and employees being actively involved in the MOC process. In addition NCP employees are largely responsible for maintaining process equipment.\r\n-\tProcess Safety Information - NCP maintains all process safety information required by the PSM standard and ensures that this information is current and accurate. Information is maintained related to the hazards of the chemicals used in the process, the technology of the process and the process design.  Specifically, NCP maintains, among"

NCP has reviewed that PHA and has ensured that all recommendations from that PHA were implemented and documented. Subsequent PHAs will be conducted no less frequently than every 5 years and will utilize a HAZOP methodology and checklists or some other acceptable form of analysis. NCP will compile a team of employees including operations personnel and maintenance personnel to participate in the PHAs. Recommendations from all PHAs will be assessed and prioritized and the action taken to address recommendations will be documented. \r\n-\tOperating Procedures - NCP maintains standard operating procedures for their operations. NCP operators review these SOPs and certify them annually. SOPs are an essential tool utilized in facility operations training. \r\n-\tTraining - NCP has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating and maintaining the process. Training includes classroom training, hands on training and job shadowing. Refresher training is conducted routinely, and in no case will longer than three years lapse between training sessions. \r\n-\tContractors - NCP requests and reviews contractor safety information annually. Information is obtained pertaining to contractor safety performance and training of contractor employees. NCP ensures that all contractors and visitors are aware of the hazards associated with the process and the chemicals utilized on site. Contractors working on site are observed routinely to ensure compliance with all safety programs and policies. \r\n-\tPre-Start up Safety Review - NCP conducts a PSSR for any facility modification that requires a change in the process safety informatio"
