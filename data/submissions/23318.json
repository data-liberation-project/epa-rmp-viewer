We have three regulated substances present at our facility.  The substances are Formaldehyde 37% Solution, Ammonia Aqueous 30%, Hydrogen Fluoride/Hydrofluoric Acid (Hydrofluoric) 70%. \n\nListed below are the way the three RMP regulated substances are stored/handled on site and the maximum inventories present at any one time.\n\n1. Formaldehyde 37% is received in 55 gal drums and stored in our warehouse for distribution to end use customers. The estimated maximum inventory of Formaldehyde onsite at anyone time will be  41,660 lbs container storage.\n\n2. Ammonia Aqueous 30% is received in bulk by tank truck and off loaded into a 6,000gal storage tank. The Ammonia Aqueous is then repackaged into 55 gal and 330 gal containers and moved into storage for distribution to our end use customers. In addition to the repackaging of smaller containers we also load tank trucks from our 6,000 gal storage tank for distribution to our end use customers. The estimated maximum inventory of Ammonia Aqueous 30% onsite at any one time will be  143,640 lbs for bulk storage tank and container storage.   \n\n\n\n3. Hydrogen Fluoride/Hydrofluoric Acid (Hydrofluoric) 70% is received in 55 gal drums which are stored in our warehouse for distribution to end use customers.

The methodology used to carry out these analyses is the \"What-If\" technique. The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of five years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Van Waters & Rogers Inc maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\nVopak USA Inc has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.
