The reviews identify the opportunity for equipment\n     malfunctions or human errors that could cause an accidental release, the safeguards used to\n     control hazards and prevent releases, and the steps used to detect or monitor releases.

Facility Policy.\n\n     The owners, management and employees of Farmers Coop Association (Richland) are\n     committed to providing a safe workplace free of accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.\n     Health, safety, and evironmental compliance are a fundamental part of every employee's\n     job.  It is facility protocol to adhere to applicable Federal, State, and local laws and to implement\n     appropriate controls to prevent accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental\n     release were to occur, the facility would respond in accordance with its Emergency Action\n     Plan and is prepared to work with local fire department, the Local Emergency Planning Committee\n     and other authorities to control and mitigate the release and minimize the impact of the release\n     to employees, the environment, and general public.\n\n2.  Facility Information.\n\n     The primary activity at the facility is the storage and handling of fertilizers for direct sale to\n     farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application.\n     Anhydrous ammonia is stored at the facility in two 18,000 gallon storage tanks that are located\n     directly East of the office.  Anhydrous ammonia is also stored in thirty-five - 1000 gallon wagons\n     that are stored next to the storage tanks. The maximum amount stored would be 330,000 pounds.\n\n\n3.  Worst-Case Scenario and Alternate Release Scenario.\n\n     a.     Worst-case scenerio would be the release of the total contents of a storage\n             tank released as gas over a period of 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released\n             would be 78,030 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank\n             at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards.

Corrective actions required as a result\n     of each compliance audit will be performed and documented.\n\n     7) Incident Investigation: Facility management will investigate each incident that results, or could have\n     reasonably resulted in a catastropic release of anhydrous ammonia.  The investigation will be\n     performed to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as corrective actions to prevent\n     the release from reoccuring.
