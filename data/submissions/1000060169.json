To strive for a coordinated and affective program particular persons have been identified and assigned responsibility for carrying out the requirements of each element.  There is however a single person identified who has overall responsibility for the PSM and RMP.  Most all of the program elements are reviewed annually to keep the program current with personnel training and system requirements.  The entire program is scheduled to be reviewed at least every 3 years in a complete documentation compliance audit review.  A follow-up report of the audit would be created to address any recommendation to improve any program elements.  A process hazard analysis has been done for the entire system, and the hazard analysis will be repeated every five years.  A follow-up report is also generated and all recommendations from the hazard analysis will be addressed to further improve the safety and integrity of the ammonia refrigeration system.  It is Stemilt Growers intent that the PSM/RMP for the Southern Storage CA Complex facility be a living document that is used, reviewed, and improved as needed to assure the safety of the employees, the public, and the environment.  It is expected that by following the work practices that are implemented at the facility only incidental released of ammonia will occurred due to routine maintenance procedures, or normal equipment wear and tear, however trained personnel with proper equipment can respond to more significant releases should they occur. \r\n\r\nRelease Considerations\r\nFollowing program guidelines a \"Worse Case\" release of ammonia was analyzed.  Also, several alternative (much more likely to occur) releases were considered.  Both the worse and alternate cases were documented in a report.  The alternative releases were in most cases releases that were of potential concern as determined in t"

The information generated from the consideration of the worse and alternative releases is used in developing the emergency response plan for the facility, and for coordination with local emergency responders.  \r\n\r\nFive year release history - No Releases\r\nThis system has not had any reportable releases of ammonia in the last five year period.  If any actual release occurs or even a near miss, an incident investigation would be done to determine the cause, and to find means or methods to reduce the possibility of a similar future occurrence.\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Plan\r\nStemilt Growers has a written \"Emergency Response Plan\" that will be followed in the event of any type of emergency, including an ammonia release.  Many of the operating personnel have been trained to the Hazmat Technician level, and do receive annual refresher training.  Stemilt Growers also has the proper personnel protective equipment for the emergency team to use in dealing with an ammonia release. Where and when possible \"defensive\" actions will be used to control and contain an ammonia release, but when circumstances required Stemilt Growers can take an \"offensive\" response to a release.  Stemilt Growers trains with the local emergency responders on an annual basis to assure good coordination between on-site and off-site resource for an ammonia release as well as other emergency.\r\n\r\nPlanned Safety Improvement\r\n This facility holds monthly safety meetings with all Management Staff, Lead Personnel and other team members where all aspects of safety are discussed in regards to improving and maintaining a safe work environment.  Engineering staff meetings are held bi-weekly.  Minutes of these meetings are kept and used to monitor progress toward safety and operational improvement of any items discussed and agreed upon.
