(ONS) is committed to managing all operations in a manner that protects the environment and the health and safety of employees, customers, contractors and the public while fully complying with applicable laws and regulations. ONS management philosophy goals are achieved through the implementation of the Environmental Health and Safety Management Systems, by the personal commitments of employees and contractors, and by open communication with employees, customers, neighbors, and regulators.  \n\nThe purpose of this Risk Management Plan (RMP) is to provide information about operations at the facility, programs to prevent accidental chemical releases, emergency response plans in the event an accidental release should occur, the five-year accident history of the facility, and planned changes to improve safety at the facility.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe Rockford Terminal is owned and operated by ONS. At the facility, propane is received via pipeline and stored in above ground storage tanks until it is loaded on trucks for distribution to customers. Ethyl mercaptan, which is a Risk Management Program (RMP) flammable, is stored at the facility and used as an odorant for propane. However, it is stored in amounts less than threshold quantity. Propane is the only flammable RMP substance stored at the facility in amounts greater than threshold quantity. No RMP toxic substances are present at the facility. The facility is classified as Program Level 3 under the regulation. \n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response programs in place at the facility are part of the high standards striven for by ONS. These high standards include:\n?\tOperating in compliance with required environmental permits and regulations.\n?\tOperating and maintaining the assets in such a mann"

Ongoing analysis of the potential hazards of the process, detailed training of employees, and emphasis on safety have helped avoid any serious chemical release accidents over the last 5 years. Part of this program has also involved identifying and taking steps to avoid potential accidental chemical releases. A few examples of the prevention features implemented at this facility include:\n?\tHazardous atmosphere monitors (HAM) have been installed at the facility, which will shut down power to the loading facility upon a positive reading.\n?\tManual emergency shutdown (ESD) buttons have been installed at the facility to shut down the entire facility during emergency situations.\n?\tFire eyes have been installed which will alarm to warn of a fire at the facility.\n?\tThe Tulsa Control Center, which is operated 24 hours per day, can detect high and low pressure on the pipeline and storage vessels as well as levels on storage vessels, and remotely close inlet and outlet valves, if necessary.\n?\tAll drivers are provided with driver-loading safety training and a driver-loading handbook.\n?\tSecurity cameras are installed for monitoring security and operational surveillance.\n?\tKey card access is installed to limit access to the facility.\n\t\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\t\nNo incident resulting in onsite injuries, death or property damage or offsite impacts from a hydrocarbon release has occurred at the Rockford Terminal within the last five years. \n\t\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\t\nThe facility will continue to conduct emergency respons"

The Operations Supervisor is responsible for coordinating emergency actions.  A specific Emergency Response Plan for the facility is in place and that plan has been coordinated with local officials, along with evacuation procedures, periodic drilling, and training. The Emergency Response Program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.\n\t\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\t\nCompliance with the RMP Prevention Program, coupled with the Environmental Health and Safety Management Systems, forms the framework for continuous safety improvement. Some of the key components of the safety program are:\n?\tThe Management of Change provisions ensure that the potential safety and health impacts of any change made to process chemicals, technology, equipment, or procedures are considered.\n?\tThe Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) methods used to perform Hazard Reviews serve as a tool to ensure timely evaluation of potential hazards, thereby leading to continual improvements in safety standards.\n?\tThe Process Safety Information and Maintenance provisions ensure that process equipment and instrumentation are designed, constructed, installed, and maintained in such a manner as to minimize the risk of hazardous releases, thereby serving as an integral part of the safety program.\n\nSpecific actions that will be taken in the future to improve the level of safety at the facility include:\n?\tInternal and third-party compliance audits will ensure that the level of safety protection at the facility is periodically evaluated for improvements.\n?\tAn ongoing dialogue with the Winnebago County Emergency Management Director or his designate will ensure a constant state of readiness to respond to any potential emergencies, as well as Implement improvement"
