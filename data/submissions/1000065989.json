      "SummaryText": "Tungsten Risk Management Plan\n\nExecutive Summary\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nIt is Ormat Nevada, Inc.'s (Ormat's) policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws. The Tungsten facility actively manages all operational permits and safety programs such as Nevada Division of Environmental Protection's Air Quality, Chemical Accident Prevention Program, Underground Injection Control programs as well as OSHA's Process Safety Management program. In addition, Ormat is ISO 14000 and 9001 certified and undergoes several audit processes to ensure all facilities are aggressively pursuing the highest quality, safety and environmental standards. Ormat is committed to handling the n-butane systems in a safe manner to protect the environment. Copies of emergency response, process hazard analyses, Chemical Accident Prevention and process safety management plans and all technical drawings (P&IDS) for process equipment are maintained onsite for reference.\n\n\n\nFacility Description\n\n\n\nTungsten is a geothermal electric power generation facility with one, Integrated Two Level Unit (ITLU) air-cooled Ormat Energy Converter (OEC).  The OEC incorporates one double-ended shaft generator driven by two, 1800 RPM direct coupled special organic fluid turbines, and associated facilities. Geothermal fluid is supplied from four production wells.  Spent geothermal fluid is injected back into the subsurface reservoir via three injection wells.\n\n\n\nThe physical address is:     Tungsten Geothermal Power Plant\n\n17017 Alpine Road West\n\nFallon, NV 89406\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Tungsten facility is operated by Ormat Technology Inc.'s Eastern Nevada Operations Group (NVE). ENOP is comprised of management, administration, maintenance, engineering and operations personnel.  They operate six eastern Nevada power generation facilities owned by Ormat in addition to Tungsten.\n\n\n\nThe Tungsten facility operates continuously, 24 hours per day and 365 days per year (excluding sched"

During the initial startup phase, the facility is staffed full time, but will eventually be operated remotely from the McGinness Hills Geothermal Power Plant Control Room, which is central to all NVE-operated facilities.  During remote operation, two full time employees will be dedicated to provide routine field monitoring and preventative maintenance on the day shift.  12 additional part time employees will provide the equivalent of four more full time employees to bring the total number of full time employees to six.\n\n\n\nRegulated Substance Handled\n\nTungsten utilizes n-butane (CAS # 106-97-8) as the motive fluid in both OEC units. In addition to the inventory present in the OEC, the facility has three n-butane storage tanks.  Each tank has a nominal capacity of 49,000 gallons each (maximum fill capacity of 44,100 gallons).  The tanks are typically operated near empty, leaving room to fully evacuate the content of the OEC during major plant maintenance activity.  \n\n\n\nThe maximum total projected amount of n-butane to be stored within the Tungsten process is 603,400 pounds (reflects the inventory in the operational OEC and one storage tank containing two, full truck-loads of n-butane which is approximately 18,000 gallons).  The use of n-butane in a process in a quantity greater than 10,000 lbs requires compliance with PSM (29CFR1910.119), RMP (40CFR68) and CAPP (Nevada Administrative Code 459.952 to 459.95528).  \n\n\n\nWorst Case Scenario: Worst case scenario assessment has been made and potential off-site consequence\n\nanalysis (OCA) was undertaken. However, in conformance with Office of Emergency Management guidance, the OCA for worst-case and/or alternative release scenario(s) has not been included in this Executive Summary because of security concerns.\n\n\n\nSafe Work Practices: Safe work practices have been developed and implemented to provide for the control of hazards during work activities such as lock out/tag-out, confine"

These safe work practices apply to both employees and contractors.\n\n\n\nMaintenance Procedures: A Mechanical Integrity Program (MIP) has been initiated at the Tungsten\n\nfacility. The MIP adopted a maintenance concept for periodic preventative and corrective maintenance of the OEC systems. The preventative maintenance tasks include visual inspection, lubrication of rotating parts, system cleaning, replacing liquids and filters, and periodic tests to verify that the system is in proper operating condition. Preventative maintenance tasks and procedures are scheduled to be undertaken over a series of maintenance intervals.\n\n\n\nAlarm system maintenance is determined using a combination of regulatory requirements, manufacturer's recommendations, plant operating experience and best practices. The Standard Maintenance Procedures (SMP's) will identify system maintenance procedures, frequencies and recommended spare parts.\n\n\n\nTraining: Initial training for personnel is given before that employee is allowed to either handle n-butane, operate a process, or work in the facility's process area or on process equipment.  The emergency action plan is coordinated with Emergency Services Personnel and a tour of the site, gas and fire detection system operations, and familiarization with the motive fluid characteristics is provided.\n\n\n\nRefresher training is conducted on an annual basis, at a minimum, and when review of the chemicals or\n\nprocess reveals a need for additional training.

Refresher training for all personnel shall be conducted annually at a minimum.\n\n\n\nSafety Training: Some equipment at the Tungsten facility poses potential fire, explosion, and electrical hazards that could cause serious personal injuries and costly property damage if safety procedures are not followed correctly. Safety training, conducted monthly and required of all employees, identifies the different hazards to be found on the sites. These subjects include Emergency Action Plan (EAP), motive fluid hazards, fire prevention and hot work, lock out and tag out procedures, hazard communication, confined space, hearing conservation, personal protective equipment, accident, injury and incident reporting. Safety training is supplemented by the use of the Standard Safety Procedures.\n\n\n\nOEC Unit: The OEC unit is controlled and monitored by its own dedicated Programmable Logic\n\nController (PLC). The PLC receives all discrete (logic) and analog signals from the input devices (e.g. switches and measuring sensors), processes the signals according to pre-loaded Ormat software, and then outputs logic and analog command signals to local and field devices. All parameters needed for proper operation of the OEC units, such as pressure, temperature, voltage, current, power, speed, etc. are measured by the proper measuring instruments. Deviation from the operating parameters will immediately be detected by the PLC and the PLC will initiate correction or automatic shutdown of the related OEC unit. Under normal circumstances, no releases or other dangerous situations are expected to result from these automatic actions. Appropriate manual override is provided.\n\n\n\nRelief system design: Relief valves are located on the n-b"

Individual relief valve locations are equipped with \"telltale\" gauges in between the relief valve and its rupture disk to allow easy identification of leaking or blown rupture disks. \n\n\n\nVentilation System Design: All components of the n-butane transfer and storage systems and the OEC units are located outdoors.\n\n\n\nSafety Systems: Beyond the pressure relief systems, the OEC units have extensive fire protection, gas and flame detection, and alarm systems.  These protective systems, in conjunction with the administrative control system, ensure the focus is upon fire prevention.\n\n\n\nThe fire detection systems include gas monitors which continuously monitor the area surrounding the OECs, and multi-spectrum infrared flame detectors throughout the plant. The facility has a fire water system installed in a continuous loop around the generating units and within reach of the n-butane storage tanks and major process equipment. The fire water systems consist of fire monitor/hydrant units which are supplied from a single diesel-driven fire pump that draws from a 285,000 gallon fire water tank (nominal capacity).
