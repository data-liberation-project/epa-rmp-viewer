It is assumed that the entire contents of the ammonia refrigeration system are released. \n\nThe distance to the endpoint for this worst-case release is 1.3 miles.\n\nThere are offsite consequences indicated which affect schools, residences, hospitals, nursing homes, jails, recreation areas, office/commercial/industrial areas, shopping centers, scout camps, and a national/county park.\n\n\nALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\nThe alternative scenario is one of from the 5-year release history. Equipment failure causes liquid ammonia to be contained in a section of pipe, which then warms and  causes an overpressure situation.  The anhydrous ammonia then is released through the pressure relief valve through the vent  stack.  2,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia are released in 10 minutes.  Unconfined vapor travels 0.1\nmiles using typical Cleveland meteorology of 3 meters/second wind speed and D stability class.\n\nThere are offsite consequences predicted  affecting residences and commercial/industrial areas.\n\nPREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nTOPS Market, Inc. has in place a prevention program encompassing elements consistent Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Pro"

An Employee Participation policy has been instituted to  regularly consult with employees regarding the development and implementation of PSM/RMP elements and hazard assessments.\n\n2. A comprehensive Process Safety Information program which insures complete and accurate written information concerning process chemicals, process technology and process equipment.

NEO warehouse has had one reportable anhydrous ammonial release.  This release did not create an emergency situation outside the plant boundaries nor did it result in any deaths, injuries, nor significant property damage onsite nor known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage nor environmental damage.\n\nJuly 17, 1998: 2,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia was released to the atmosphere when a process control computer failed.  A pressure relief valve opened due to ammonia trapped in a section of\npiping as a result of the process control computer failing.  As a result of the investigation new equipment was installed, new sensors were installed, new process controls and revised operating procedures were implemented.\n\nWhile the above mentioned release had no offsite consequences other than odor, the local emergency responders were notified as required under USEPA CERCLA notification requirements  (40 CFR part 302.6)."
