The elements in place are the 14 elements outlined in the OSHA Process Safety Management regulation 1910.119. Details of each of the PSM elements are outlined here in this executive summary.\n\nIndividual elements of our prevention program work in unison to prevent accidental chemical releases. Our company and our employees are committed to the standard that these management systems set for the way we do business, and we have specific accountabilities and controls to ensure that we are meeting our own high standards for accident prevention. \n\n\n1. Employee Participation\n\nIn accordance with Section 68.83 of the RMP rule, our employee participation plan helps ensure that all employees have appropriate involvement in developing and implementing RMP.\n\nWe have a written employee participation program that meets PSM requirements. In this document, we describe in detail the many different ways that employees participate in each element of the PSM regulations. This document has been made available to all employees for review, comment and use. We considered all comments and, where appropriate, revised the draft. We periodically update this document as changes occur.\n\nEmployee participation is based on the principle that employee involvement in various areas of PSM is key to maintaining a Process Safety System that has input from all levels of employees.

Additionally, employee involvement in incident investigation is needed to ensure that fact finding is complete, as these employees will normally be familiar with the process or area being investigated. Employees are consulted and participation is encouraged in PSM and in the RMP. \n\n\n2. Process Safety Information\n\nIn accordance with Section 68.65 of the RMP rule, we systematically control the creation, updating, and retention of written documentation associated with our process chemicals, process technology, and process equipment. This information is essential for supporting all of the other elements of our risk management program. We also use this information to ensure that our equipment is suitable for its intended use.\n\nWe maintain the following chemical process information for each regulated substance in a covered process as well as for other hazardous materials in both covered and noncovered processes:\n\n* Toxicity information\n* Permissible exposure limits\n* Physical data\n* Reactivity data\n* Corrosivity data\n* Thermal and chemical stability data\n* Hazardous effects of inadvertent mixing of different materials that could foreseeably occur\n\nWe use material safety data sheets (MSDSs) to provide most of the process chemical information.

Additionally, operating limits, maximum intended inventories, and consequences of deviations not available from engineering design documentation were developed as part of PHAs.\n\nWe also maintain the following information pertaining to equipment in our regulated processes (as well as for many of our nonregulated processes):\n\n* Materials of construction\n* Piping and instrument diagrams (P&IDs)\n* Electrical classification information\n* Relief system design and design basis\n* Ventilation system design\n* Design codes and standards employed\n* Material and energy balances for processes built after 5/26/1992\n* Safety systems (interlocks, detection, or suppression systems)\n   \nOther information contained in the PSI are process descriptions, PFDs and process safety information cards that are widely used throughout the refinery to inform all personnel of the location of equipment, fire systems, escape routes, means of communication and the chemicals found in the area.\n\nAgain, most of this information comes from the engineering design documents for the processes as well as from our own maintenance files.

Process Hazard Analysis\n\nIn accordance with Section 68.67 of the RMP rule, we use Process Hazards Analyses (PHAs) to systematically identify, evaluate, and control process hazards. The most important results of our PHAs are findings that address the reduction of risks associated with accidental chemical releases. We ensure that all findings from our PHAs are resolved appropriately, and we ensure that information from our PHAs is communicated to all potentially affected employees.\n\nWe conduct systematic PHAs of our regulated processes and other hazardous processes at our facility according to an established schedule. Each PHA is updated/revalidated at least every five years (or more often if necessary because of process changes).

Contractor safety regulations are sent with all bid packages. These regulations are discussed at all pre-job meetings through the use of a checklist that the contractor signs upon completion of the meeting (copies are kept in the job file). The program"
