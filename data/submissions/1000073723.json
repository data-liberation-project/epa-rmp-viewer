Box 889, Perryton, TX 79070\r\n\r\nRisk Management Plan - Executive Summary Facility Policy:\r\nThe management and employees operating each of our facilities are committed to the prevention of \r\nany\r\naccidental release of hazardous material at our locations. In the event an accidental release \r\nshould occur, we are prepared to work with our Local Fire Department(s), Emergency Response \r\nPersonnel, and other appropriate authorities deemed applicable depending on the specific incident, \r\nto best mitigate any release and to minimize the impact of the release to people and the \r\nenvironment.\r\n\r\nFacility Information:\r\nThe primary activity of our company is  NAICS code 323514, \"Fertilizer ( Mixing Only) Manufacturing\r\n\" however we also receive anhydrous ammonia in railcars or truck transports for use by \r\nan outside contractor to produce liquid fertilizer. The NAICS code we feel most applicable for this \r\nactivity is NAICS code 325314, \"Fertilizer (Mixing Only) Manufacturing.\" Anhydrous ammonia is the \r\nonly product at this facility subject to EPA Risk Management Planning at this time.\r\n\r\nAnhydrous Ammonia is received and temporarily stored in railcars or truck transports for use by an \r\noutside contractor to produce liquid fertilizer through a mobile pipe reactor (MPR). The MPR is \r\ntypically on site for less than a week 1 to 2 times per year. During the balance of the year there is \r\nno anhydrous ammonia on site. The maximum quantity handled at a given time would be 20 tons in a transport load.\r\n\r\nThe facility is operated on an \"as needed\" basis with only the contractor's employees present \r\nduring the transfer and reacting process. Our employees are present only when the railcars or \r\ntransports arrive to visually inspect the DOT specification cargo tanks for compliance.

Time \r\nexpended for these inspections is not included in our staffing calculation.\r\n\r\nWorst case release scenario:\r\nThe \"worst case release scenario\" is considered to be the release of the total contents of the \r\nlargest railcar received. The maximum quantity released based on 85 % tank capacity as limited by \r\ndesign standards, the distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) miles based on \r\nEPA's RMP &#8208;Comp Program (Version 1.06), as well as possible public and environmental receptors \r\nwithin the area have been provided to the County LEPC (Local Emergency Planning Committee) to \r\nassist them in their planning.\r\n\r\nAlternative release scenario:\r\nThere has not been an actual release of Anhydrous Ammonia during the last 5 years at the site. We \r\nbelieve the most likely release would be caused by damage to, or catastrophic failure of a transfer \r\nhose connected from a mobile storage vessel to the MPR. This could lead to the total loss of \r\nproduct in the hose. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is determined \r\nper instructions by EPA guidance.\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Program:\r\nOur Anhydrous Ammonia accidental release program is based on guidelines found in the American \r\nNational Standards Institute, Inc. (ANSI) standard K61.1&#8208;1999 \"Safety Requirements for the Storage \r\nand Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia; and the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration \r\n(OSHA) standard 29CFR\r\n1910.111 \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\".  We conduct annual employee training on the \r\nsafe handling of anhydrous ammonia, performing visual inspections of DOT specification railcars and \r\ntransports, review of contractor policies and procedures, and how to contact emergency responders \r\nin the event there is a release.
