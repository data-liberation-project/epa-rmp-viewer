This commitment is demonstrated by our efforts in accident prevention such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of our processes.  As of May 1999, employees headquartered at the Paradis Gas Processing Plant have worked almost 3 million work-hours without a lost time accident.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, trained facility personnel will evaluate the situation, take actions within the capabilities of the facility, and/or notify the necessary outside agencies.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\t \n\nThe Paradis Gas Processing Plant is located near Paradis, Louisiana at 15849 Old Spanish Trail (LA Hwy. 631).  The processes operated at the Paradis Gas Processing Plant include: cyrogenic natural gas processing  (currently out of service with no immediate plans for commencement of service); a natural gas liquid fractionating process; and product storage and shipping.  Product shipping is either by truck, rail or pipeline.  Operations at the Paradis Gas Processing Plant consist of the following:  (1) Raw natural gas from producers is dehydrated to remove moisture.  (2) Raw natural gas is cryogenically processed to separate the lighter hydrocarbons (primarily methane gas) from the heavier hydrocarbons (ethane, propane, normal butane, iso-butane, and pentane plus products) by liquefying the heavier hydrocarbons into a combined stream (natural gas liquids).  Note: The cryogenic processes at the Paradis Gas Processing Plant are currently out of service with no immediate plans for commencement of service. (3) Natural gas liquids from either"

      "SummaryText": "the on-site cryogenic processes (currently out of service) or other off-site sources are fractionated into individual hydrocarbon products  (ethane, propane, normal butane, iso-butane and pentane pluses).  (4) The individual hydrocarbon products, with the exception of ethane, are temporarily stored on-site in pressurized vessels prior to shipping.  (5) Ethane is delivered directly into a pipeline.  Other individual hydrocarbon products can be transferred to trucks for shipping at a truck rack, transferred to railcars for shipping at a rail rack, or delivered into pipelines.\n\nThe Paradis Gas Processing Plant routinely handles quantities of natural gas, ethane, propane, normal butane and iso-butane, all of which are regulated substances and above the threshold limits listed in EPA's Risk Management Program rule. \n\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS RESULTS    \n\nThe worst-case scenario (WCS) for the Paradis Gas Processing Plant is a vapor cloud explosion involving the largest inventory of a flammable mixture (predominately consisting of normal butane) contained in a single pressurized storage vessel.  The maximum quantity possible contained within this storage vessel is 1,780,720 pounds.  Although administrative controls are in place to limit this quantity, those controls were not considered in calculating this maximum quantity determination.  The entire inventory of the storage tank is assumed to release, form a vapor cloud, ignite and explode - creating a Vapor Cloud Explosion (VCE).  Using RMP*CompTM, the maximum distance to the 1-psig overpressure endpoint is 1.0 mile. Although we have numerous controls to prevent such releases, and to manage their consequences, no credit for passive mitigation measures was taken into account in evaluating this WCS.\n\nThe alternative release scenario (ARS) that is used as a planning case at the Paradis Gas Processing Plant is an overfill of Propane Storage Vessel No. 18, causing a relief valve to operate as designed and release propane t"

The released propane is ignited causing a vapor cloud fire (VCF).  Using RMP*CompTM, the maximum distance to the lower flammability limit endpoint for this scenario is 0.1 mile. This event was selected as being a practical scenario for use in emergency planning and response.\n\n GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM \n \n The following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the Paradis Gas Processing Plant.  Because processes at the facility that are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) Risk Management Program (RMP) rule are also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements, and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n \n  Employee Participation\n \nThe Paradis Gas Processing Plant has a written Employee Participation Plan that encourages participation in process safety management and accident prevention. The purpose of this Employee Participation Plan is to provide facility employees and affected contractors with information and instructions that encourage them to participate in the Paradis Gas Processing Plant's process safety management and risk management practices and procedures.  The intent of those practices and procedures is to identify, evaluate and mitigate, or prevent unwanted and potentially hazardous releases of highly hazardous chemicals (flammables).  Employees and affected contractors working in and around the Paradis Gas Processing Plant's hazardous processes are entitled, and encouraged, to participate in the development, implementation and improvement of process safety management and risk management program compliance efforts.\n\nParticipation in the development of the Paradis"

Employees and affected contractors have access to information developed as part of the facility's PSM and accident prevention program. \n \n Process Safety Information\n \nThe Paradis Gas Processing Plant has a variety of technical documents on site which are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.  These documents define the process chemicals, technology and equipment that are utilized at the facility and address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  The facility maintains documents for process streams and products which provide fire and explosion characteristics, reactivity hazards, and safety and health hazards to workers; process chemistry information addressing the thermal and chemical stability of the hazardous chemicals, including over-pressure hazards; and block flow diagrams defining the process technology.\n \n Chemical-specific information including exposure hazards, emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, and corrosivity/reactivity data is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDS's).  For specific process areas, information concerning safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) is provided in operating procedures.  The facility maintains the process within these limits by using process controls and monitoring instruments, trained personnel and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\n \n The facility also maintains technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment.

Within this program, each process is examined to identify potential hazards, determine if adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards, and recommend additional controls, as appropriate.\n \n The Paradis Gas Processing Plant uses a variety and combination of applicable methodologies to conduct PHAs.  These PHAs address: facility siting; human factors; qualitative evaluation of a range of the possible safety and health effects of failure of controls on personnel; and one or more of the following methodologies appropriate to determine and evaluate the hazards of the process: What-if; Checklist; Hazard and Operability (HAZOP); Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA); Fault Tree Analysis; or an appropriate equivalent methodology. PHAs are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates potential hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures. \n \n The PHA team recommendations are forwarded to management for resolution.  Implementation of recommendations is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  The approved recommendations are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each recommendation is documented and retained.\n \n The facility revalidates PHAs at least every 5 years.  PHA revalidations will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating and do not contain over the threshold quantities of hazardous substances.

This information is available to operators and other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n \n Training \n \n The Paradis Gas Processing Plant has implemented a training program for employees involved in operating a process.  New operations employees are provided operating procedures, P&ID's and other process safety information for their review and reference.  A new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After new operators demonstrate adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  Operators receive periodic refresher training on the operating procedures or receiving training upon request.  Training records for each operator, including the means used to demonstrate that the operator understood the training, are maintained on site. Process maintenance personnel are trained in their perspective duties for maintaining the mechanical integrity of critical process equipment and systems.  Operational and maintenance personnel also receive training on the procedures for conducting hot work permitting; management of change; and other appropriate safe work practices.  \n \n Contractors\n \n The Paradis Gas Processing Plant uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.

Other aspects of this contractor safety management program that apply to contractors working on or near process equipment include procedures to enable contractors to: (1) Perform their work in a safe manner;  (2) Be aware of the hazards in their workplace;  (3) Understand what to do in the event of an emergency;  (4) Understand and follow site safety rules; and  (5) Inform facility personnel of any hazards that are found during their work.  This is accomplished by providing contractors with a process overview, information about safety and health hazards, emergency procedure requirements, and applicable safe work practices.  The Paradis Gas Processing Plant evaluates contractor safety programs and facility personnel periodically monitor contractor performance with regard to their safety obligations.\n \n Pre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\n \n The Paradis Gas Processing Plant conducts a PSSR for new facilities or facility modifications as part of the PSM program.  The purpose of the PSSR is to determine that safety-features, procedures, personnel and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides an additional check that construction is in accordance with the design specifications and which process systems are operationally ready.  A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function.  PSSRs also verify that appropriate safety, operational, maintenance and emergency procedures are in place, and adequate training has been completed.  When new facilities are commissioned, a PHA is included as part of the PSSR.\n \n Mechanical Integrity\n \n The Paradis Gas Processing Plant has established practices and procedures to maintain critical process equipment in a safe operating condition.  The basic aspects of this program include developing maintenance and i"

The Paradis Gas Processing Plant considers quality assurance measures when developing maintenance and inspection criteria and when purchasing new equipment.\n \n Safe Work Practices\n \n The Paradis Gas Processing Plant has developed safe work practices and procedures to foster worker and process safety.  Examples include procedures for controlling the entry/presence/exit of personnel, lockout/tagout, hot and safe work permitting, and confined space entry.\n \n Management of Change (MOC)\n \n The Paradis Gas Processing Plant has developed an MOC procedure to manage changes to covered processes.  This system includes a description of proposed changes; management review and acceptance of proposed changes; a safety, health and environmental review of the impact on operation and maintenance activities; updating or implementing required process safety elements; and authorization to place the changes in service. \n \n   Incident Investigation\n \n In accordance with its PSM program, the Paradis Gas Processing Plant investigates incidents related to a covered process that results or reasonably could have resulted in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance (flammables).  The goal of the investigation is to determine the factors leading up to the incident and to develop recommendations to prevent recurrence of the incident or a similar incident. The Incident Investigation team findings and recommendations are forwarded to management for resolution.   The approved recommendations are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained for at least five (5) years.  The investigation results are reviewed with employees and affected contractors. \n  \n Compliance Audits\n \n Compliance audits are conducted at the Paradis Gas Processing Plant ever"
