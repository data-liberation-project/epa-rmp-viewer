The worst case would be a\ncomplete rupture of a tank that would result in a release of\nthe entire tank (if it was full) in 10 minutes.  This would\nproduce a cloud that would not reach the residence or\nschools in Deer Park, but would reach the neighboring sites,\nas well as the San Jacinto Battleground/Monument State Park.\nIt would also reach the Houston Ship Channel.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario(s) - Regulated Toxic Chemical\n\nVinyl"

The accident scenarios found\n   in HAZOP's form the basis of additional analyses which allow\n   us to ensure that the integrity levels of all protective\n   systems are high enough to protect both our employees and\n   our neighbors.
