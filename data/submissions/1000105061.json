It establishes processes to ensure that records are kept up to date and that out of date and superseded PSM related documents are archived and not available for day-to-day access by site personnel, that PSM information required for persons to carry out their role shall be readily accessible and current, and a process to ensure that people, including newly assigned persons requiring access to process safety related documentation know where and how to access it.\n\nElement 14: Management Review and Metrics. The intent of this element is to ensure a clear line of sight of relevant performance indicators at appropriate levels in the organization. These are used to identify system improvement opportunities and to provide early indication of pending failures of systems designed to prevent a major incident event from occurring. Leading and lagging metrics are established at appropriate levels of the organization to measure PSM system effectiveness and impact and executive and management forums at appropriate levels of the organization regularly receive and review reports regarding effectiveness and impact of PSM systems, and act on system and performance improvement opportunities and react to emerging or existing system deficiencies.\n\nElement 15: Audit and Continuous Improvement.

The overarching principle to apply is that the hazard assessment methodology, layers of risk controls and documentation shall be appropriate to and commensurate with the complexity, type, likelihood of occurrence and potential consequence of the hazard. The facility has implemented a formal, documented hazard analysis, risk assessment and control process using appropriate qualitative and quantitative process hazard analysis (PHA) methodologies.\n\nElement 4: Facility Design & Construction. The intent of this element is to ensure that management of PSM risk and improvement objectives is an integral part of all projects through design, approval, procurement, construction, commissioning and decommissioning. This element addresses technical standards of design, construction and commissioning requirements and includes Pre-Startup Safety Reviews for newly installed and modified process areas and equipment to confirm that construction is in accordance with design codes and standards, actions identified through the HIRAC (PHA) process, and that all required verifications are complete.\n\nElement 5: Operations Safety. The intent of this element is to ensure that all PSM Assets are operated according to the risk control requirements arising from the HIRAC for that plant. This includes written procedures for operating PSM Assets and that the procedures include risk control aspects identified through the HIRAC process that address the operating phases of the equipment (e.g., normal start-up, normal operation, normal shutdown, etc.), and potential consequences of deviation from operating limits, and control measures to keep within operating limits and steps to manage and correct deviations from those limits.
