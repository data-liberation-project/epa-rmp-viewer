This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program in place that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, we are completely coordinated with HEBRON FIRE DEPARTMENT which provides highly trained emergency response personnel to control and mitigate the effects of the release.\r\n\r\n\r\n2.\tThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\r\n\r\nOur facility's primary activities encompass Distribution of chemical products.  We have two regulated substances present at our facility.  These substances include Chlorine and Sulfur Dioxide (anhydrous).  The Sulfur Dioxide and Chlorine are received prepackaged in different  containers for resell to our customers.\r\n\r\n3.\tThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\n\r\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.
