Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at Hampshire Chemical Corporation (HCC) Deer Park, Texas are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of all substances.\n\n\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled                                                                                   HCC - Deer Park primary activities encompass Chemical Manufacturing.  We have three regulated substances present at our facility.  These substances include Ammonia (anhydrous), Formaldehyde (44.5 % solution) and Hydrocyanic Acid.  The primary businesses are the manufacturing of a surfactant called DAXAD and Glycine. The DAXAD manufacturing process regulated raw material is Formaldehyde.  The Glycine manufacturing process regulated raw materials are Anhydrous Ammonia, Formaldehyde, and Hydrocyanic Acid.\n\nThe maximum inventory of Formaldehyde (44.5 % solution) at our facility is 408,276 lb. while Ammonia (anhydrous), and Hydrocyanic Acid, and  are present at our facility in quantities of 284,438 lb., and 262,219 lb., respectively.\n\n3.    The Worst Case Release Scenario and the Alternative Release Scenarios, including administrative controls and mitigation measures\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used the EPA's OCA Guidance Reference Tables or Equations.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 3 toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from Hydrocyanic Acid Storage System.

      "SummaryText": " In this scenario 106140 lb. of Hydrocyanic Acid is released from a railcar.  The toxic gas is assumed to be released within 10 minutes. The released quantity is 100 % of the maximum capacity of the source.  At Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s windspeed, the maximum distance of 15 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.011 mg/L.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for Hydrocyanic Acid involves a release from Hydrocyanic Acid Storage System.  The scenario involves the release of 5487 lb. of Hydrocyanic Acid.  Toxic liquid is assumed to be released to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to have evaporated after 10 minutes.  The release is also assumed to be controlled by an emergency shutdown system and water monitor.  These active mitigation systems have the effect of reducing the liquid release and vapor suppression.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.011 mg/L of Hydrocyanic Acid is 1.4 miles.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for Formaldehyde (44.5 % solution) involves a release from the Formaldehyde Storage System.  The scenario involves the release of 19180 lb. of 44.5 % Formaldehyde solution.  Toxic liquid is assumed to be released to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to have evaporated after 1918 minutes.  The release is also assumed to be controlled by  an emergency shutdown system and water monitor.  These active mitigation systems have the effect of reducing the liquid release and vapor suppression.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.012 mg/L of Formaldehyde (44.5 % solution) is 0.43 miles.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for Ammonia (anhydrous) involves a release from the Anhydrous Ammonia Storage System.  The scenario involves the release of 158 lb. of Anhydrous Ammonia.  The Toxic gas is assumed to be released within 10 minutes.  "

Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L of Ammonia (anhydrous) is 0.38 miles.\n\n4.    The General Accidental Release Prevention Program\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with industry accepted design practices and engineering standards.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nHampshire Chemical Corporation maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.  For example, this information can be found in our Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS), process design files, equipment specification files and process safety information files.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodologies used to carry out these analyses are  Dow Risk Review Process, Dow Fire and Explosion Index, Dow Chemical Exposure Index and Dow Reactive Chemical Process Hazard Analysis.
