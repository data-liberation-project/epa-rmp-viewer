This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology and procedures be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented. Changes are reviewed to:\n\n1.\tDetermine that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards\n2.\tVerify that existing controls have not been compromised by the proposed change\n\nAffected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information and procedures are updated to incorporate these changes. In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are trained on the changes.\n\nEPIC and operations promptly investigate all incidents related to a covered process that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in a fire/explosion, property damage, environmental loss or personal injury. The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective action to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident. The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent future occurrences and forwards these results to facility management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until they are complete.

These technical documents address the following:\n\n1.\tChemical properties and associated hazards\n2.\tNecessary Block Flow Diagrams of the process\n3.\tMaximum intended inventories\n4.\tUpper and Lower limits of process fixed and rotating equipment\n5.\tEquipment design basis and configuration information\n6.\tIdentification of all necessary Regulatory equipment design documents\n7.\tSufficient information to assure good engineering practices\n\nThe location of the technical documents referenced above is listed in the Process Safety Information portion of the PSM.\n\nChemical -specific information, including hazard and emergency response/exposure considerations, is provided in safety data sheet (SDS). For specific process areas, the facility has documented safety- related limits for specific process parameters such as temperatures, level and composition in the operators' procedures manual. The facility maintains the process within these limits by using process controls and monitoring instruments, trained personnel and protective instrument systems such as automated shutdown systems.\n\nThe facility also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of the process equipment. This information includes materials of construction, design pressures, temperature and electrical ratings. This information, in combination with procedures and equipment operating history, provides a basis for inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to safety features in the process to ensure they are not compromised.\n\nC.\tProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\nEPIC has a comprehensive program to identify and control hazards associated with the RMP covered process. This program systematically examines for potential hazards and puts controls in place to manage hazards. Process Hazard Analysis is conducted using checklists wit"

      "SummaryText": "ACCIDENT RELEASE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nEPIC Y-Grade Logistics, LP (EPIC) owns a natural gas fractionation facility, the Robstown Fractionator in Nueces County, Texas. The facility is contract operated by Lyondell and is designed to process natural gas liquids by fractionation into end products that will be delivered to end markets.\n\nEPIC has a long-standing commitment to workers and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by our efforts in accident prevention, such as training personnel, quality assurance, and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our process. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, facility trained personnel will evaluate the situation, take actions within the capabilities of the facility, and notify the necessary outside agencies.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nThe Robstown Fractionator is located near Robstown, Texas. Y Grade is received by the facility and is used to produce the following NGL products:\n\n1.\tEthane\n2.\tPropane\n3.\tIso Butane\n4.\tNormal Butane \n5.\tNatural Gasoline (C5+)\n\nThe received Y Grade and produced products can contain the following components:\n\na.\tMethane\nb.\tEthane\nc.\tPropane\nd.\tButane\ne.\tIsobutane\nf.\tPentane\ng.\tIsopentane\nh.\tHexane\ni.\tCarbon Dioxide\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nA.\tEmployee Participation\n\nEPIC and operations encourage employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention  as follows:\n\n1.\tUpdating and compiling technical documents and chemical information\n2.\tPerforming necessary calculations for PSM and RMP\n3.\tMaintaining good engineering practices\n4.\tParticipating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team\n\nEmployees have access to all information pertaining to the accident prevention program.\n\nB.\tProcess Safety Information\n\nEPIC and operations maintain a variety"
