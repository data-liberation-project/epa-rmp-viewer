Five Year Accident History\r\nThere have been no accidental releases in the past five years that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage.\r\n\r\n5. Emergency Response Plan\r\nLyondellBasell Acetyls has developed a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials.  The plan includes emergency response activities such as providing adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas.  To ensure proper functioning, our emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced.  In addition, the emergency response plan is promptly updated to reflect changes taking place within our processes that would require a modified emergency response.  The La Porte Police Department is the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) with which our emergency plan has been coordinated.\r\n\r\n6. Emergency Response Team\r\nLyondellBasell Acetyls has gone above and beyond the normal safety requirements to provide employees with a safe working environment.  One program that enhances our ability to respond to emergencies is our Emergency Response Program. Members of the Emergency Response Team (ERT) undergo training that includes classroom and on-the-job training as well as regular emergency drills.  A highly trained and confident ERT can limit damage during an emergency event, but more importantly prompt emergency response can prevent more serious accidents from occurring.  Our teams regularly attend some of the best training programs available, in particular, the programs conducted at Texas A&M University.\r\n\r\nPlanned changes to improve safety\r\nThe plant has planned improvements to alarm systems, safety interlocks systems, and level cont"
