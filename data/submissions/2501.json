      "SummaryText": "Boar's Head Provisions Co. Inc. operates a meat processing facility located at 2530 West Broadway Street Forrest City Arkansas, the plant employs 450 production and maintenance personnel distributed on three shifts. The facility uses Anhydrous Ammonia (NH3) as a heat transfer media. Most of the facility is cooled to 35 to 40 degrees F in order to preserve the meat and meat products. The ammonia refrigeration system is computer controlled and the facility is manned 24 hours a day 7 days a week. The materials used in the covered process are of the highest quality and standards available to the refrigeration industry and the Boar's Head management and engineering team maintains that the contractors used to install and maintain the the ammonia refrigeration system meet the highest qualifications dictated by the P.S.M. standard. The facility has ammonia detectors located in strategic locations throughout the refrigeration system. The facility is operated under the P.S.M. standard and complyswith all O.S.H.A. and federal as well as state and local codes and ordinances.\n\nPROCESS TECHINICAL DESCRIPTION:\nThe refrigeration operates as a single stage ammonia refrigeration system @ 3:1 recirculation rate.\nDefrost is achieved by utilizing hot gas taken from the compressor discharge header.\nIn the compressor room there are nine (9) Frick rotary screw compressors which service the various air cooling evaporators throughout the facility as well as the glycol and water chillers. The ammonia is cooled utilizing nine (9) evapco evaporative condensers.\n\nCONTINGENCY PLAN:\nSee the attached documentTHE ONE PLAN ARKANSAS\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nWORST CASE AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS:\n#1 Worst case scenario, coil leak at one of the evaporative condensers due to impact by crop dusting airplane, the plant is adjacent to wheat and rice feilds which utilize crop dusters to spray the"
