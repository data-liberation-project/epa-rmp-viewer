Executive Summary\n\n\n\nThis program is intended to meet the spirit and intent of the following regulations:\n\n\n\n- California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program - Title 19 CCR, Chapter 4.5\n\n- Federal EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) - Title 40 CFR ?68\n\n- California Process Safety Management (PSM) Program, Title 8 CCR ?5189\n\n- Federal Process Safety Management (PSM) Program, Title 29 CFR ?1910.119\n\n\n\nHereafter this program will be referred to as the RMP-PSM program.\n\n\n\nThis program is intended to be a \"living document\". As such, the information, procedures, policies, and documentation that make up this program must be made easily accessible and updated as necessary. To accomplish this, Sun Valley Packing has elected to use PSMWriter, software developed and distributed by Resource Compliance, Inc. This software will assist us with updating, maintaining, scheduling, and tracking RMP-PSM related activities. \n\n\n\n1.1 Sun Valley Packing, Risk and Process Safety Management Program\n\n\n\nThis is to inform all interested persons, including employees, that Sun Valley Packing has updated/developed their unified RMP-PSM Program. This program has been prepared to address the risks involved in operating and maintaining the following process which have the presence of hazardous chemicals above threshold quantities: \n\n\n\nProcess                       Name Process Chemical          Process Quantity(lbs.)\n\nAmmonia Refrigeration         Anhydrous Ammonia              25,000\n\n\n\nOur RMP-PSM program promotes overall plant, worker, and public safety. The program enables our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of hazardous chemicals. Overall, the program is designed to prevent accidental fatalities, injuries, illnesses and physical property damage.\n\n\n\nOur company has many policies and procedures in place to promote overall plant, worker and public safety.

Utilized PSMWriter software to ensure that all necessary employees have access to relevant information (SOPs, PHAs, audits, etc.)\n\n\n\nThe RMP-PSM program sets forth rules, procedures and practices that will help our employees and neighbors protect themselves.\n\n\n\n1.2 Process Description\n\n\n\nSun Valley Packing operates a commercial cold storage for fresh fruit. The facility has an ammonia system that provides refrigerating capacity to three (3) precool rooms, six (6) cold storage rooms, two (2) packing areas, a hydrocooler, the hallway, and the shipping dock. The rooms use a combination of \"bunker style\" coils and ceiling suspended evaporator coils that contain chilled liquid ammonia. Some of the ceiling suspended coils operate under flooded conditions and some under direct expansion. A computer system provides substantial control and alarm capability. \n\n\n\nThe system operates as follows: high pressure liquid from the high pressure receiver is piped through the king valve. From there it is piped to each zone of refrigeration, where it passes through a solenoid valve, an expansion valve, and into a low temperature & pressure accumulator vessel. From the accumulators, cold liquid ammonia is circulated through evaporator coils. As heat is absorbed, the liquid ammonia vaporizes to form low temperature & pressure gas which is returned to the accumulator vessels. The ammonia vapor is returned from the accumulator vessels through a suction return line to our main suction accumulator in the engine room. From there, it passes through the compressors. The high pressure discharge from thecompressors is sent to our water cooled evaporative condensers where the high pressure gas ammonia is cooled, liquefied and returned to our high pressure receiver. Liquid separated from the suction return gas in the main suction accumulator drains into a liquid transfer vessel. "

      "SummaryText": "Operation of a float switch activated solenoid valve raises the pressure in the liquid transfer vessels to the point the liquid can be drained into the high pressure receiver. The coils in the packing areas are direct expansion coils. In those coils, high pressure ammonia liquid is piped directly to each coil where it passes through a solenoid valve, a hand expansion valve, and directly into the coil. As heat is absorbed, the liquid ammonia vaporizes to form low temperature & pressure gas which is returned directly to the main suction accumulator via the suction main.\n\n\n\nThe facility was originally called Mundo de Sol and then later changed to Sun Valley Packing. The facility was built in 1977 and has had several additions/modifications since then. More recently the following projects have occurred:\n\n\n\n- 2000 - The Stellar Group installed the hydrocooler\n\n- 2001 - Cold Storage Technologies installed the refrigeration equipment for Precool #3, Storage #4, and an additional hallway unit\n\n- 2010 - California Controlled Atmosphere installed a computer control system for the entire refrigeration system\n\n- 2010 - California Controlled Atmosphere added the refrigeration equipment for Storage #5 and Storage #6\n\n\n\nThe system contain numerous safety devices including sensors which stop the compressors if temperatures or pressures exceed or drop below established limits, and safety relief valves which vent ammonia gas to the atmosphere if the pressure in the system exceeds their set point. In addition, ammonia detectors are located in selected areas of the facility, and will shut down equipment if ammonia is detected.\n\n\n\nThe ammonia system at our facility consists of vessels which are interconnected, or which are co-located such that a release of ammonia could impact the ability to operate vessels that are not directly connected. Therefore, we are treating the each system as a single process.\n\n\n\n1.3 General Accident Release & Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\n1.3.1 General"

During these meeting we also discuss preventative measures, such as evacuation, in order to be prepared for a release. \n\n\n\nSun Valley Packing has also conducted an off-site consequence analysis of worst-case and alternative release scenarios for the ammonia refrigeration process. These are for the purposes of informing the public in the event of an accidental release. The results of the analyses are reported in PSMWriter and hard copy binders. \n\n\n\n1.3.2 Anhydrous Ammonia\n\n\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration process at the Sun Valley Packing facility is an integral part of the overall business and operates most of the year. It is extremely important that this process is maintained and operated in a safe and efficient manner. Management is committed to making sure that employees are made aware of the potential danger of an ammonia leak.\n\n\n\nOur refrigeration personnel monitor the ammonia refrigeration process and keep an active log book of all procedures and transactions that pertain to ammonia. In addition, the process is checked frequently by one of the outside refrigeration contractors that we use. These contractors also assist in performing the annual mechanical integrity inspection of our ammonia equipment. \n\n\n\n1.4 Five Year Accident History\n\n\n\nSun Valley Packing has had no accidental release within the last five (5) years.\n\n\n\n1.5 Emergency Action and Response Plan\n\n\n\nSun Valley Packing's emergency action and response program has been developed to satisfy the following requirements:\n\n\n\n- California \"Emergency Action Plan\" - Title 8 CCR ?3220\n\n- Federal \"Emergency Action Plan\" - Title 29 CFR ?1910.38 \n\n- California \"Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response\" (HAZWOPER) - Title 8 CCR Title 8 ?5192(q)\n\n- Federal \"Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response\" (HAZWOPER) - Title 29 CFR ?1910.120(q)\n\n\n\nStrategically, we "

Nevertheless, Sun Valley Packing continually strives to improve in all areas, including safety.\n\n\n\nBy utilizing PSMWriter software, all necessary employees have access to every aspect of the RMP-PSM program. This has improved Sun Valley Packing's ability to communicate hazardous situations to employees and contractors. In addition, PSMWriter tracks all RMP-PSM related events so that Sun Valley Packing's management team can ensure that the RMP-PSM program is being implemented.\n\n\n\nSun Valley Packing has implemented all aspects of the RMP-PSM program. When a RMP-PSM program requirement is completed (i.e. mechanical integrity inspection, process hazard analysis, compliance audit, etc.) any specific action items related to that event are entered into PSMWriter, assigned a responsible person, and given a due date. Once the action item has been completed, the resolution can be documented using PSMWriter as well. A list of current or past due action items can be accessed at any time by those with access to PSMWriter.\n\n\n\nIn addition to utilizing PSMWriter to create, schedule, track, and document events, Sun Valley Packing has also entered into a contract with Resource Compliance to obtain help with RMP-PSM program implementation.\n\n\n\nFor the future, Sun Valley Packing now thinks of the RMP-PSM program as a \"living document\".
