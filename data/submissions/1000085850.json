These analyses generate additional prevention and mitigation recommendations that result in ongoing modifications to the facility.  The goal of the Marcus Hook Facility is to demonstrate continuous improvement in our health, environmental and safety performance.  In addition, we will work cooperatively with the community to address any concerns.  \r\n\r\nF. SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION ON OUR RMP DATA ELEMENTS\r\n\r\nThe following information would not fit into the appropriate fields in RMP*eSubmit and is therefore included in this executive summary:\r\n\r\nSection 1.12.c CAA Title V Air Operating Permit ID. Since the Marcus Hook Facility is located in two States, Delaware and Pennsylvania, we have two Air Operating Permit IDs. For the State of Delaware, our ID is AQM-003/00021. For the State of Pennsylvania, our ID is TVOP-23-00001.  \r\n\r\nSection 9.7.a-b Local agency with which facility's ER plan or response activities are coordinated. We coordinate with four agencies: the Borough of Marcus Hook (610-485-1341), the Delaware County LEPC (610-565-8700), Lower Chichester Township (610-485-1472), and New Castle County LEPC (302-573-2856)."

      "SummaryText": "ed interior and exterior firefighting techniques, hazardous material response, confined space and high angle rescue, emergency medical response, the Emergency Response Plan and implementation of the Incident Command System.  \r\n\r\nThe facility also maintains its own dedicated emergency response equipment.  This equipment includes portable fire extinguishers, breathing apparatus, encapsulated chemical protective suits, rescue and medical equipment, spill response boats and fire fighting apparatus capable of delivering high volumes of water and fire fighting foam.  An inspection, testing and maintenance program is in place for emergency response equipment.  Examples of equipment and systems included in the program are as follows:\r\n\r\n* Fire extinguishers - Inspected monthly and receive annual maintenance per the fire code,\r\n* Class A chemical suits - Inspected before and after each use, pressure tested annually,\r\n* Fire hoses - Inspected and pressure tested each year per the fire code,\r\n* Stationary fire water pumps - Inspected weekly and performance tested each year per the fire code,\r\n* Fire apparatus - Inspected weekly and performance tested each year,\r\n* Water spray systems - Inspected and flow tested annually per the fire code.\r\n\r\nWhile we rely on the Fire Brigade to respond to both minor and significant events in the facility, we also maintain a close relationship with neighboring municipal fire departments.  Tours and drills with members of these emergency response organizations are held routinely.

Compliance Audits\r\nA formal evaluation and certification of the PSM system is conducted at least every three years by an audit team. The compliance audit team seeks to confirm that PSM and RMP practices are consistent with written programs; the programs adequately address all requirements of the PSM/RMP regulations, and that management systems are in place to ensure continued compliance. Facility management promptly reviews the audit findings, determines an appropriate response for each finding, assigns responsibility for implementation of a corrective action, and tracks all findings until they are resolved.\r\n\r\n     10. Incident Investigation\r\nAn experienced team promptly investigates incidents that result in, or could reasonably have caused, a catastrophic release, fire or injury.  A systematic investigation process is used to determine the root cause of an event, analyze them and develop solutions to correct the situation and prevent it from recurring.  The investigation team then recommends and implements additional controls in order to mitigate hazards associated with the incident.  \r\n\r\n     11.

Mechanical Integrity\r\nThe Mechanical Integrity of process equipment is maintained to ensure that the potential for spills and releases is minimized. Programs include an inspection and testing program, a preventive maintenance program, and a quality assurance program.  Procedures describe the methods used to perform inspections, tests, and preventive maintenance tasks of existing process equipment, to verify the proper fabrication and installation of new process equipment, and to properly document all activities. The procedures follow generally accepted engineering practices that employ both industry and company standards. Personnel performing MI activities are trained on the procedures and in the hazards of the process to ensure that job tasks are performed safely. \r\n\r\n     7. Management of Change\r\nPermanent or temporary changes can inadvertently introduce new hazards or compromise safeguards built into the original design of a process. A written Management of Change procedure has been established and implemented to manage changes to process chemicals, technology, and equipment.  The procedure provides guidance, designates responsibilities and establishes steps to implement changes in the facility. This program helps ensure that inadvertent or unintended changes are prevented, that any safety and health impacts are addressed, that affected procedures are updated, and that employees are informed of and trained in the approved changes. The Marcus Hook Facility uses a computer-based software program to assist in tracking and processing change requests. Results of the Management of Change process are documented and maintained in the software program, and made available to all personnel.         \r\n\r\n     8.
