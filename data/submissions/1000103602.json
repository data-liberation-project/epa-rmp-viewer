All applicable procedures of the U.S. Environmental protection Agency (EPA) Prevention Program are adhered to.  The HWWS emergency response policy involves the preparation of response plans, which are tailored to each facility and to the emergency response services available in the community and is in compliance with the EPA Emergency Response Program Requirements.\n     The Dixieland Water Treatment Plant has been installed to disinfect the water flow from the Dixieland Reservoir. This water serves the City of Harlingen. The facility is located at 2525 Dixieland.  The plant utilizes a chlorinating station, liquid chlorine containers, a chlorinator, various safety equipment, an instrument room containing flow recorders, various electrical panels and additional safety equipment.  The amount of chlorine on site is twenty-four one-ton containers with eight on-line and sixteen as standbys.  Water treatment operators are at the facility daily and respond to any trouble alarms that may occur.\n     The general HWWS accidental release prevention program is based on the following key elements:\n      *     High level of training of the operators\n      *     Preventive maintenance programs\n      *     Use of state-of-the-art process and safety equipment\n      *     Use of accurate and effective operating procedures, written with the participation of the operators\n      *     Performance of a hazard review of equipment and procedures\n      *     Implementation of an auditing and inspection program\n    Chemical specific prevention steps include availability of Self-Contained Breathing Apparatus (SCBA) or Supplied Air Respirator (SAR) worn during connection and disconnection, awareness of the hazardous and toxic properties of Chlorine and the presence of detectors.\n     No accidental releases of chlori"
