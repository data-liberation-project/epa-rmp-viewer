The ammonia refrigeration system is a utility system supporting the plant by providing space conditioning and product cooling for meat processing, raw and finished products.  \n\n\n\nAmmonia contained within the refrigeration system is a regulated substance under both the EPA and OSHA regulations.  At Surlean Foods the maximum inventory of ammonia exceeds the regulatory threshold of 10,000 pounds.\n\n\n\nSurlean Foods is committed to protecting the public, its employees, and the environment from any accidental releases of hazardous materials used at its facilities.  We have implemented safety, environmental protection, and risk management programs to prevent hazardous materials releases. \n\n\n\nIf there is an accidental release, we will immediately call for emergency response to minimize the effect of the release and notify the public of any actions necessary to ensure public protection via the Dallas Fire Department.\n\n\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario\n\n\n\nSurlean Foods has conducted an offsite consequence analysis as required by the EPA regulations, including an extremely unlikely, worst-case release scenario (i.e., total release from the single largest container over a ten minute period, assuming worst case meteorological conditions).  Results of this worst-case event indicate that offsite receptors would be affected. \n\n\n\nThis type of release is not considered credible from the standpoint that an event of this nature would require the catastrophic failure of the container, resulting in a sudden release of the entire contents over a ten-minute period.  The ammonia system components are designed to withstand pressures well in excess of normal operating conditions and Surlean Foods maintains a very rigorous maintenance and prevention program for all ammonia process equipment.\n\n\n\nIn fact, EPA release reporting databases and industry experience suggest that the worst-case release scenario as defined in the"

A more reasonable potential release scenario for emergency planning is presented in \"The alternative release scenario(s)\" section below.\n\n\n\nAlternative Release Scenario\n\n\n\nA \"credible worst-case\" scenario, formulated in accordance with USEPA guidance, was selected as the Surlean Foods alternative release scenario. This scenario involves a one-inch diameter hole from a break in the high pressure liquid ammonia piping on the roof of the facility.   Results of this credible worst-case event indicate that there are some offsite receptors that would be affected.  \n\n\n\nThe results of the process hazard analysis (PHA) and the facility's operating history suggest that even this credible worst-case is extremely unlikely to occur, but it can serve as the basis for emergency planning. \n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nSurlean Foods is committed to public safety, personnel safety, continued reliable operation and regulatory compliance.  Based on this commitment, the Corporate Director of Engineering and Technical Support has assumed overall responsibility for the development and implementation of the Risk Management Program and has clearly defined accountability and responsibility for each of the prevention program elements to meet both EPA and OSHA Process Safety Management requirements.\n\n\n\nTo ensure that a worst-case or alternative release scenario does not occur, Surlean Foods maintains a release prevention program with the primary focus of protecting the public and plant employees from the hazards associated with an accident or release involving anhydrous ammonia.  The multifaceted program includes the use of:\n\n\n\nSystem instruments and alarms to rapidly alert operators to any problems;\n\n\n\nProcess safety information to document the safe process design;\n\n\n\nProcess hazards analyses to evaluate the chemical and process hazards;\n\n\n\nOperating procedures to ensure that the syst"
