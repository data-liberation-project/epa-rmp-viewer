Based on the PSM coverage of the Race Fuels Blend unit, the unit has a Program 3 RMP.  \n\n\n\nB. GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe centerpiece of the accidental release prevention program is the unit Process Safety Management (PSM) program.  The fourteen   (14) elements of PSM constitute the framework by which process safety and accident prevention are managed in the unit.  These fourteen (14) individual elements of our prevention program work together to prevent accidental chemical releases. Our company and our employees are committed to the standards required by these management systems.  In addition to the above prevention program elements, we also have specific prevention measures that are employed as part of our operating procedures and engineering and administrative controls to help contain/control a release, quickly detect a release, and reduce the consequences of a release.  These measures are briefly summarized as follows:\n\n\n\nGeneral Risk Reduction and Safety Measures:\n\n\n\n?    Engineering and construction in accordance with recognized Industry and company standards.\n\n?    Equipment properly designed with protection from overpressure (pressure safety relief valves, etc.).\n\n?    Updated technical drawings, piping & instrument diagrams and process flow diagrams.\n\n?    Operating systems monitored and controlled 24 hrs a day by trained operators.\n\n?    Computerized monitoring and control of process operation.\n\n?    Automatic and manual shutdown devices for critical systems.\n\n?    Scheduled inspection and testing of process equipment.\n\n?    Limited facility access and 24 hr security force.\n\n?    Radio communication system.\n\n?    Closed circuit television surveillance capabilities.\n\n?    Frequent unit surveillance by operators.\n\n?    Dikes and curbing to minimize the spread of released material.\n\n?    Automatic and remotely operated shut-offs t"

FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nAlthough there have been no accidents related to the isopentane storage regulated by this RMP, there have been two releases within the past 5 years that were reported to the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection.\n\n\n\n(1) On February 10, 2017 a release of toluene was identified within the Blend Plant. The release was discovered during routine security rounds at approximately 0400 am at the Blend Plant pump BLP-14. Upon notification, Sunoco Race Fuels was able to instruct security to close the valve leading to the pump. The release was stopped at approximately 0445 am. The exact time at which the release began is unknown. It is estimated that 50-100 gallons of toluene were released to a concrete pump pad and to a surrounding icy area. Vacuum truc"

It appears that the root cause of the release was a mechanical failure in a Swagelok fitting. During the pump inspection, the fitting was lose and tubing within it was easily removed. Sunoco Race Fuels intends to add a line item to check the tightness of these fittings during pump preventative maintenance. In addition, Sunoco Race Fuels plans to add gas detectors at several pump pads to alert the 24/7 manned control room of a release when the Blend Plant in unmanned. During the incident the boundaries of the facility were monitored and levels never exceeded an actionable respiratory protection level.    \n\n\n\n(2) On September 4, 2014 just before noon race fuel (gasoline) was being blended in tank F-4 (022A). The operator was not in the immediate vicinity of the Blend Plant and was not aware of the high level and high high level alarms that went off at 1157 am and 1159 am, respectively.  The alarms were noted by the Control Room Operators who began to make phone calls to personnel at the Blend Plant.  An Operator was contacted and they were sent to shut down the pump.  It is believed that the overfill began around 1203 pm and the pump was shut off by 1215 pm, so the duration is believed to be less than 15 minutes.  The inhouse Fire Department was on the scene around 1210 pm and began to water mist the product that had collected in the secondary containment until the foam could be applied.  By 1230 pm the foam had been applied and the vapors from the gasoline in the secondary containment was blocked.  After the foam was in effect an inhouse vac truck was used to pump out the product from the secondary containment and put into process tanks owned by Sunoco Logistics (property owners).  Based on the three vac truck events, it is believed that approximately 5,200 gallons of fuel was overfilled from the tank into the secondary containment.  It should be noted that product did not leav"

During the incident the boundaries of the facility were monitored and levels never exceeded an actionable respiratory protection level. \n\n\n\nD. EMERGENCY RESPONSE ROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe Facility maintains compliance with local, state and federal regulations including OSHA CFR 1910.120, Oil Pollution Act of 1990, and SARA Title III.  Our emergency response program is reviewed and updated on an annual basis, or more often if required.  Our program provides the essential planning and training for protecting employees, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.  The program includes written procedures that outline the actions to be taken for various types of emergencies that could occur in the facility. These emergencies include: airborne releases of chemical substances, spills to the water or ground, fires, explosions, personnel rescue incidents and medical emergencies. The programs address all aspects of emergency response including:\n\n\n\n?    Information on the plant emergency organization (Incident Command System).\n\n?    Information on the roles and responsibilities of personnel responding to the incident.\n\n?    Procedures for notifying employees that a release has occurred.\n\n?    Procedures for plant evacuation and accounting of personnel.\n\n?    Procedures to notify local emergency response organizations and other appropriate authorities that a release has occurred.\n\n?    Guidance on proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures.\n\n?    Procedures for post incident cleanup and decontamination.\n\n\n\nAn important part of the plant emergency organization is the Emergency Response Team (ERT).
