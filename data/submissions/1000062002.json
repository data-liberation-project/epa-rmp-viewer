It appears that the root cause of the release was a mechanical failure in a Swagelok fitting. During the pump inspection, the fitting was lose and tubing within it was easily removed. Sunoco Race Fuels intends to add a line item to check the tightness of these fittings during pump preventative maintenance. In addition, Sunoco Race Fuels plans to add gas detectors at several pump pads to alert the 24/7 manned control room of a release when the Blend Plant in unmanned. During the incident the boundaries of the facility were monitored and levels never exceeded an actionable respiratory protection level.    \r\n\r\n(2) On September 4, 2014 just before noon race fuel (gasoline) was being blended in tank F-4 (022A). The operator was not in the immediate vicinity of the Blend Plant and was not aware of the high level and high high level alarms that went off at 1157 am and 1159 am, respectively.  The alarms were noted by the Control Room Operators who began to make phone calls to personnel at the Blend Plant.  An Operator was contacted and they were sent to shut down the pump.  It is believed that the overfill began around 1203 pm and the pump was shut off by 1215 pm, so the duration is believed to be less than 15 minutes.  The inhouse Fire Department was on the scene around 1210 pm and began to water mist the product that had collected in the secondary containment until the foam could be applied.  By 1230 pm the foam had been applied and the vapors from the gasoline in the secondary containment was blocked.  After the foam was in effect an inhouse vac truck was used to pump out the product from the secondary containment and put into process tanks owned by Sunoco Logistics (property owners).  Based on the three vac truck events, it is believed that approximately 5,200 gallons of fuel was overfilled from the tank into the secondary containment.  It should be noted that product did not leav"

We promote health, safety, and the environment through programs of awareness, compliance, prevention and protection.  These programs include a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs.  This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including:\r\n\r\nA. Description of our facility and the use of substances regulated by EPA's RMP rule\r\nB. Overview of our accidental release prevention programs\r\nC. Five-year accident history for accidental releases\r\nD. Overview of our emergency response program\r\nE. Overview of planned changes to improve safety\r\nF. Supplemental information regarding our RMP data elements\r\n\r\nThis RMP is being submitted to 1) establish an RMP for the Race Fuels Blend unit alone - it was previously included in the Marcus Hook refinery RMP, and 2) to add the inventory represented by a new isopentane storage tank which is being installed in the unit and which needs to be included in the unit RMP program.\r\n\r\nA. STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\r\n\r\nThe Sunoco Race Fuels Blend unit is located on a portion of the Sunoco's Marcus Hook refinery which has been closed.  The unit is located in Marcus Hook, Pennsylvania.  The Race Fuels Blend unit blends various hydrocarbons to produce motor fuels with the necessary octane levels and other properties specified by various racing car associations.  In our processes, we use the following chemicals that EPA has identified as having the potential to cause significant offsite consequences in the event of a major accidental release:\r\n\r\nToxics\r\n\r\nThe Race Fuels Blend unit does not use, store, or handle any toxic materials covered by the RMP regulation."

Based on the PSM coverage of the Race Fuels Blend unit, the unit has a Program 3 RMP.  \r\n\r\nB. GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\r\n\r\nThe centerpiece of the accidental release prevention program is the unit Process Safety Management (PSM) program.  The fourteen   (14) elements of PSM constitute the framework by which process safety and accident prevention are managed in the unit.  These fourteen (14) individual elements of our prevention program work together to prevent accidental chemical releases. Our company and our employees are committed to the standards required by these management systems.  In addition to the above prevention program elements, we also have specific prevention measures that are employed as part of our operating procedures and engineering and administrative controls to help contain/control a release, quickly detect a release, and reduce the consequences of a release.  These measures are briefly summarized as follows:\r\n\r\nGeneral Risk Reduction and Safety Measures:\r\n\r\n\u00bf\tEngineering and construction in accordance with recognized Industry and company standards.\r\n\u00bf\tEquipment properly designed with protection from overpressure (pressure safety relief valves, etc.).\r\n\u00bf\tUpdated technical drawings, piping & instrument diagrams and process flow diagrams.\r\n\u00bf\tOperating systems monitored and controlled 24 hrs a day by trained operators.\r\n\u00bf\tComputerized monitoring and control of process operation.\r\n\u00bf\tAutomatic and manual shutdown devices for critical systems.\r\n\u00bf\tScheduled inspection and testing of process equipment.\r\n\u00bf\tLimited facility access and 24 hr security force.\r\n\u00bf\tRadio communication system.\r\n\u00bf\tClosed circuit television surveillance capabilities.\r\n\u00bf\tFrequent unit surveillance by operators.\r\n\u00bf\tDikes and curbing to minimize the spread of released material.\r\n\u00bf\tAutomatic and remotely operated shut-offs t"

During the incident the boundaries of the facility were monitored and levels never exceeded an actionable respiratory protection level. \r\n\r\nD. EMERGENCY RESPONSE ROGRAM\r\n\r\nThe Facility maintains compliance with local, state and federal regulations including OSHA CFR 1910.120, Oil Pollution Act of 1990, and SARA Title III.  Our emergency response program is reviewed and updated on an annual basis, or more often if required.  Our program provides the essential planning and training for protecting employees, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.  The program includes written procedures that outline the actions to be taken for various types of emergencies that could occur in the facility. These emergencies include: airborne releases of chemical substances, spills to the water or ground, fires, explosions, personnel rescue incidents and medical emergencies. The programs address all aspects of emergency response including:\r\n\r\n\u00bf\tInformation on the plant emergency organization (Incident Command System).\r\n\u00bf\tInformation on the roles and responsibilities of personnel responding to the incident.\r\n\u00bf\tProcedures for notifying employees that a release has occurred.\r\n\u00bf\tProcedures for plant evacuation and accounting of personnel.\r\n\u00bf\tProcedures to notify local emergency response organizations and other appropriate authorities that a release has occurred.\r\n\u00bf\tGuidance on proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures.\r\n\u00bf\tProcedures for post incident cleanup and decontamination.\r\n\r\nAn important part of the plant emergency organization is the Emergency Response Team (ERT).

The Emergency Response Plan and its implementation follow the NIMS Incident Command System.\r\n\r\nThe facility also maintains its own dedicated emergency response equipment.  This equipment includes portable fire extinguishers, breathing apparatus, encapsulated chemical protective suits, rescue and medical equipment, spill response boats and firefighting apparatus capable of delivering high volumes of water and firefighting foam.  An inspection, testing and preventive maintenance program is in place for emergency response equipment.\r\n\r\nE. PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\n\r\nWe are continually striving to make the Marcus Hook Race Fuels Blend unit a safe workplace for our employees, our neighbors and our community.  Our focus is safe, reliable, and environmentally sound operations, and proactive management of these issues.  A PHA has been performed for the unit, including the new isopentane storage tank and the recommendations for that PHA are being resolved.  \r\n\r\nF.
