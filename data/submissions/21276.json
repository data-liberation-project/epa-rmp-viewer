The training consists of viewing a video from the supplier and discussing safe cylinder handling procedures.  \n\u00a7 Contractors who work on or near a process that presents known potential fire, explosive, toxic release or other hazard are informed of such hazards and are required to train their employees to work safely at the facility.

Plant 4 handles the following substance that is subject to the RMP requirements:\nSubstance\tUse\tMaximum Quantity Onsite\nSulfur dioxide\tBrine processing\t14,000 pounds\nSulfur dioxide gas is received in 2,000 lb. cylinders, with a maximum inventory of 7 cylinders.  A cylinder is placed on a scale-type rack for dispensing through a hose into a batch tank where it is mixed with lime, calcium chloride and water to make cherry brine solution.  Sulfur dioxide represents approximately 1% of the solution once it is added to the other ingredients in that tank.\nOnce in batch form, the ingredients levels are tested by titration prior to release into the processing system.  Sulfur dioxide ceases to be an acutely hazardous material upon its introduction into the batch tank.  The RMP is therefore restricted to the portion of the process up to the batch tank.\n1.3\tWorst-Case Release Scenarios / Alternative Release Scenarios and Administrative Controls and Mitigation Measures\n1.3.1\tWorst-Case Release Scenarios\nThe Worst-Case Release Scenario originally developed in the Risk Management Prevention Program in 1995 was re-evaluated and is used in this RMP.  The release is through a \u00bc\" diameter valve orifice resulting in a 2,000 lb. release, 10-minute duration, 1.5 meters per second wind speed, and F stability class.  Use of the look-up tables provided in the USEPA Guidance Document for the worst-case scenario assuming a rural environment, indicate a toxic endpoint distance of 3.1 miles.  Based on the ALOHA model, the sulfur dioxide release resulted in off-site consequences.\n1.3.2\tAlternative Release Scenarios and Administrative Contr"

      "SummaryText": "ols and Mitigation Measures\nIn the implementation of the PSM for this facility, TVG has performed \"What If\" analyses using the ARCHIE air dispersion model and evaluated the following scenarios:\n\u00a7 Human error\n\u00a7 Vandalism/sabotage\n\u00a7 Mechanical / electrical failure\n\u00a7 Physical damage\n\u00a7 Natural disaster\n\u00a7 Fire / explosion.\nAdditionally, as part of this RMP TVG performed a \"What If\" Analysis to identify an Alternative Release Scenario (ARS).  The ARS is the release of sulfur dioxide at a leaky hose coupling with a 1/16 inch orifice.  The quantities of sulfur dioxide associated with this ARS  extend beyond the property boundaries given the ARS meteorological conditions recommended in the USEPA Model Risk Management Program and Plan for sulfur dioxide. \n1.4\tGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nPlant 4 is in compliance with the OSHA PSM and RMP rules.  Specific steps that are key to the TVG prevention program include:\n\u00a7 Developing and maintaining written Process Safety Information identifying workplace chemical and process hazards, equipment used in the process, and technology used in the processes.\n\u00a7 Developing and maintaining Process Hazard Analysis used to identify potential failure scenarios and conditions of the process and facility that could result in the release of sulfur dioxide.\n\u00a7 Developing and maintaining Operating Procedures that are specifically designed to address the handling and maintenance of materials and equipment associated with direct or indirect use of sulfur dioxide.\n\u00a7 Providing and maintaining Training Programs that are specifically designed to address all operations, maintenance, and emergency aspects of processes associated with the sulfur dioxide systems.\n\u00a7 Developing and maintaining a program that ensures the Mechanical Integrity of equipment associated with the sulfur dioxide systems.\n\u00a7 Establishing and maintaining a Management of Change program to address any equipment or process changes associate"
