      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\n\nProChem International, Inc. (ProChem) is a manufacturer of specialty inorganic and organic chemicals. The specialty organic chemicals include biochemical detergents, cryoprotectants and reagents for amino acid derivitization and detection, biotinylation, cross-linking, iodination, and for chromatography derivitization. In addition, ProChem has an ever-expanding repertoire of custom inorganic and organic chemicals and research biochemicals. Orders for standard and \"custom\" chemicals are of a highly variable nature. Sales typically involve milligram and gram quantities of chemicals, with typical production lot sizes of 5 to 10 grams being most common. However, kilogram batch quantities of some compounds are prepared, including acetate, fluoride, sulfate, nitrate, oxalate, and phosphate salts of cadmium, calcium, iron, lead, and potassium, and salts of various rare earths.\n\nOn October 30, 1997, the facility experienced a catastrophic fire that was determined to be electrical in origin.  This incident was not reportable under 40 CFR 68.168.\n\nProChem continues a long-standing commitment to employee safety and to mitigating risks to human health and the environment outside the facility. The facility has implemented a Contingency Plan, along with other appropriate safety measures, to minimize the potential hazards associated with a spill, fire, explosion, or other event that could result in a release which may involve hazardous materials or hazardous waste constituents."
