(Zillah) accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates technologies, procedures, and management practices.  It is the policy of Inland-Joseph Fruit Co. (Zillah) to adhere to all applicable federal and state safety and environmental regulations.\n\nInland-Joseph Fruit Co. (Zillah) emergency response policy involves the preparation of response plans and training of employees in evacuation and the handling of ammonia releases.\n\nInland-Joseph Fruit Co. (Zillah)  emergency response policy involves the preparation of response plans and training of employees. We have trained the refrigeration personnel in hazardous materials response (24 hours).  This training includes emphasis on anhydrous ammonia, in addition to other requirements set forth in 29 CFR 1910.120(q) and WAC 296-62, Part P (HAZWOPER).\n\nAt Inland-Joseph Fruit Co. (Zillah) anhydrous ammonia is used on-site. Ammonia is considered hazardous by EPA and is listed on the Extremely Hazardous Substance (EHS) list.  Chemical properties of ammonia make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling ammonia in order to:\n?    Prevent unnecessary human exposure\n?    Reduce the threat to our personnel\n?    Reduce the threat to the community\n\nB.    Facility and Regulated Substance Handled\n\nInland-Joseph Fruit Co. (Zillah) is a fruit processing and cold storage facility, located at 1151 Cutler Way Zillah, WA  98953.  The facility is located in Yakima County.\n\nThe regulated substance used at Inland-Joseph Fruit Co. (Zillah) is anhydrous ammonia (CAS# 7664-41-7). The use of anhydrous ammonia is as a refrigerant.\n\nThere is 14,728 pounds of anhydrous ammonia in the refrigeration system.\n\nInland-Joseph Fruit Co. (Zillah) uses other hazardous substances on-site, however they do not meet or exceed the threshold limits established in 40 CFR 68.130"

(Zillah) has established policies, procedures and training to reduce the risk of an accidental hazardous substance release for the safety of its employees and surrounding areas.\n\n \n \nD.    General Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nInland-Joseph Fruit Co. (Zillah) accidental release prevent program is based on the following key elements:\n?    High level of training of personnel\n?    Preventative maintenance program\n?    Written safety procedures and safety equipment\n?    Use of accurate and effective written operating procedures\n\nInland-Joseph Fruit Co. (Zillah) also complies with: \n?    OSHA?s and Washington State?s process safety management rule.\n?    Washington State?s safety regulations (WAC?s 296-24 and 296-62), which are equal to, or more restrictive than OSHA regulations.\n?    IIAR (International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration) standards for good work practices.\n?    The Uniform Fire Code for handling of hazardous materials.\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system was installed to codes and good practices at the time of installation.  Piping is elevated to prevent accidental damage to the system from moving vehicles.  Engine room doors are tight fitting and open outwards.  Other safety devices Inland-Joseph Fruit Co. (Zillah) utilizes include:\n?    Computerized controls, which can be operated remotely\n?    Suction trap hi-level float\n?    High discharge pressure shut down\n?    Low suction pressure shut down\n?    High discharge temperature shut down\n?    Oil pressure failure shut down\n?    High amperes shut down\n?    Automatic timer to prevent short cycling\n?    Oil filters plugged shut down\n?    250 psi relief valves on high pressure side, to prevent overpressure situations\n?    150 psi relief valves on low pressure side, to prevent overpressure situations\n?

(Zillah) has established Emergency Response Guidelines for releases involving ammonia.  These procedures are part of the ongoing training.\n\nSafety orientation includes making all employees aware of the evacuation plan and/or the shelter in place plan.  The supervisors are provided with the contact numbers for our own emergency responders James Schibig and Mario Gallegos to coordinate either the evacuation or the shelter-in-place program.   \n\nRefrigeration personnel have received 24-hour Emergency responder training and the 8 hr. Emergency response team refresher in accordance with 1910.120.  The refrigeration specialists James Schibig and Mario Gallegos have been through the Ammonia Emergency response training conducted by PM Hazmat and Doubl-Kold.  \nDale Dougherty, HR and John Hunsaker, Facilities have also been through the same ammonia response training\n\nWe have two windsocks located at either end of the plant on top of the building and are visible from indoor refrigeration office and also visible outdoors upwind of any potential release.  \n\nG.    Planned Safety Improvements\n\nInland-Joseph Fruit Co.
