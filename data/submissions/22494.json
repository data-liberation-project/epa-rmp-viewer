The owner, management, and employees of Cropmate Company, Odebolt, IA. are commited to the prevention of any accidental release of Anhydrous Ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local Fire Department, LEPC, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and to minimize the impact of the release on people and the environment.\n\nII. FACILITY INFORMATION.\nA. The primary activity at the facility is the storage and handling of Anhydrous Ammonia for sale to farmers.\nB. Anhydrous Ammonia is received, stored and distributed for application on crops as a fertilizer nutrient.\nC. The maximum quanity stored at this location would be 79000 pounds, in a 18000 gallon storage tank. \n(Note, maximum quantity allowed to be stored is 85% of the storage tank size)\n\nIII. THE WORST CASE AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO'S.\nA. The worst case release would be the release of the entire contents of the storage tank over ten minutes. The maximum quantity released would be 79000 pounds, which represents the volume of the tank at 85% capacity as limited by design standards. The distance to the toxic endpoint (point of dispersion to 200ppm) is .83 miles.\nB. The alternative release scenario is based on a release from  a break in a transfer hose. The quantity released would be 26000 pounds. The toxic endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is .59 miles.\n\nIV. THE ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM.\nA. The facility has implemented the provisions of the safety requirements for the storage and handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1, published by the American National Standards Institute Inc.\nB. The facility has implemented the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) 29-CFR 1910.111, storage and handling of Anhydrous Ammonia.\n\nV. THE FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY. \nA. There have been no ac"
