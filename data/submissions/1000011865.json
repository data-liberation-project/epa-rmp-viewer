The primary products produced at St. Gabriel are chlorine and sodium hydroxide (caustic).  Chlorine is used in the purification and sanitation of drinking water, hospital sanitation, swimming pool treatment, and laundry bleach.  Chlorine is a basic building block for the production of industrial chemical and in the construction industry.  In addition, more than 85% of pharmaceuticals are derived from chlorine derivatives.  Sodium hydroxide is used in the production of product as diverse as soap, latex paint, rayon and nylon clothing. \n\nOlin's environmental, safety and health policies emphasis the importance of safeguarding our employees, contractors, the environment and the community from potential exposures to chemical materials, by-products and end products.  Olin has implemented programs to ensure compliance with regulations and continuing improvement of environmental, health and safety performance over the years.  Facility personnel are trained extensively in safe operation and maintenance of the facility to assure compliance with all applicable regulations.\n\nOlin is the only chemical that the RMP regulation pertains to in Olin facility.  Olin believes we comply with the regulation and in addition has implemented several elements of the RMP in non-RMP process areas.  Olin was the first OSHA VPP (Voluntary Protection Program) Star site in Louisiana, and has maintained that rating since 1985.  This entails a complete audit by OSHA of our entire Safety and Health programs every 3-4 years. Olin employees have gone 4 years without a lost-time injury.  In addition, Olin has twice received the EPA's Environmental Excellence Award from the State of Louisiana.  Facility personnel participate in monthly communications meeting with the local Community Advisor Pan"

Summarized below are brief descriptions of each of the elements:\n\nProcess Safety Information\nCritical information on chlorine properties, chlorine production techniques, and chlorine handling is made readily available to facility personnel through Material Safety Data Sheets, current drawings, and comprehensive operations procedures.  Equipment specifications and vendor manufacturing information is used for equipment and system designs.  Additionally, the Chlorine Institute provides information and guidelines in the form of regularly updated technical pamphlets.  This information is used while conducting PHA's and PSSR's and is the basis for developing our operating procedures and chemical process systems.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nThe facility performs Process Hazard Analyses on an established schedule for RMP/PSM processes.  A trained team with a certified PHA Leader performs PHA's on the RMP process and other process nodes not regulated by the standard.  The recommendations are then prioritized and implemented accordingly.  A system is in place to assure recommendations are followed through completion.\n\nOperating Procedures\nOperating instructions have been developed by teams of experienced personnel for all RMP operations.  The operating instructions are maintained and annually reviewed and signed as being up-to-date.  Changes to Operating procedures are tracked through the Management of Change process.\n\nTraining\nOlin's training program is designed to train operations and maintenance personnel on the technical aspects of the processes as well"

      "SummaryText": "th incidents at the facility are fully investigated and documented by teams to determine root causes and to put in place action plans designed to prevent recurrence.  The findings are documented and communicated to facility personnel.  The plant embraces the Total Incident Reporting System to assure that all potential incidents are captured and addressed in a timely manner.\n\nEmployee Participation\nEmployee participation is the cornerstone of the Voluntary Protection Program.  Plant operators, maintenance technicians, and engineers, as well as supervisors and managers participate fully in Hazard and Operability Studies, procedure development, training and incident investigations.  A broad range of facility personnel also make up the safety committee and participate in a wide range of safety related activities.\n\n\nHot Work & Work Permits\nThe facility's Hot Work procedure requires that detailed permitting activities take place before, during, and after any job that has the potential to provide a source of ignition.  The permit is followed through to completion of the work and those permits are maintained in the EHS department.  The plant has implemented other work permits to assure safe work conditions are communicated to maintenance and contract personnel. \n\nContractor Safety\nThe contractor safety program places stringent qualification requirements on contracting firms before entering into the plant to perform work.  Contractors  provide training documentation of their employees that meet or exceed the requirement of the job scope.  Contactors participate in an industry supported 24-hour safety certification and then site specific orientation before being permitted to work in the facility.  Contractor safety performance and compliance with facility safety requirement are monitored during all contract projects.  Contractor performance evaluations can be found in purchasing files.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\nThe St. Gabriel Olin facility has in place a comprehensive writ"

The plant responders are trained and qualified on the proper response techniques for the chemicals associated with the facility and are equipped with the necessary equipment to perform critical response procedures.\n\nAs part of the ongoing training program for responders, routine drills are conducted.  These include both tabletop planning sessions as well as full field responses to simulated incidents in the plant.  Additionally, Olin conducts joint drills with the Iberville Parish Office of Emergency Preparedness and works closely with that office to coordinate emergency response actions.  Olin is also an active member of the Geismar Area Mutual Aid group, which provides equipment resources for emergency response from other area facilities.\n\nThe plant is equipped with a facility-wide alarm system.  When the alarm system is activated, response teams assemble immediately; including those assigned the task of making critical notifications.  Current emergency phone numbers are maintained in the control room of the facility and in the Emergency Action Plan, which is immediately available in several critical areas of the plant so that timely notifications can be made.\n\nThe facility-wide chlorine-monitoring network has monitors stationed at key locations though out the facility. These monitors can detect chlorine at low concentrations.  Operations personnel monitor the real-time readings from the chlorine sensors and will respond immediately to any detection.  Additionally, the facility utilizes a computer modeling system that can help to plan potential scenarios and develop appropriate responses.\n\nHYPOTHETICAL MODELS\nThe Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has defined the worst-case scenario as the hypothetical rupture and full release of all contents of the facility's largest storage tank, assuming all safeguards have failed, during extremely stable weather conditions."

      "SummaryText": "While the probability of this scenario is extremely low, it does provide a template for emergency response planning.  The computer-generated model for our largest chlorine tank results in a planning zone of 25 miles.\n\nFacilities must prepare an alternate scenario that could have an off-site impact, based on plant operations.  The Alternate Scenario may take into account emergency response control measures and actual storage and weather conditions.  The Alternate Scenario for this facility is the rupture of a loading line while actively loading a chlorine rail car.  For planning purposes only, it is assumed that the safety check valve on the rail car does not engage.  The computer-generated model for this release results in a possible impact of up to 1.3 miles.\n\nFIVE-YEAR HISTORY\nIn the past five years, there have been no incidents at the plant as defined in the plant's RMP/PSM program.  If an incident would occur, as per the procedure, a thorough investigation would be initiated to determine the causes of the incident.  In addition, the incidents would be reported to the appropriate agencies.  See the incidents listed in section 6.5 of the RMP ESubmit document.\n\nSAFETY IMPROVEMENTS\nOlin believes that continuous improvement is the key to success in the future.  This is especially true in the safety, health, and environmental areas.  Olin continuously looks for opportunities to improve our abilities in protecting our people and our community.  We actively solicit and implement safety and process improvement suggestions through our safety committee, our employee suggestion program, and our Total Quality Improvement program, to solve problems and implement solutions.\n\nExamples of our ongoing safety improvement efforts include:\n* Installation of a pipeline to several area customers, reducing rail car loading and transportation of a Highly Hazardous Chemicals\n* Upgrade of wastewater treatment system to recover mercury and return it to the process rather than going off-sit"
