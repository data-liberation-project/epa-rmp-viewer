The accidental release prevention policy at the Greenville\n\nSanitary Authority, Borough of Greenville treatment facility involves\n\na combined effort between management, operating and local emergency\n\npersonnel.  The facility has an ongoing effort to identify hazards,\n\nreview safety techniques, and implement employee training through\n\noperation, maintenance and inspection procedures to manage the risk of\n\na chlorine gas release.\n\n\n\nB.    The Greenville Sanitary Authority?s, Borough of Greenville\n\ntreatment facility was originally placed into operation in 1956.  The\n\nfacility was expanded in 1994.  The facility currently has the capacity\n\nof treating 11.25 million gallons per day of wastewater.  Gaseous\n\nchlorine, which is stored in a separate room, is utilized to disinfect\n\nthe effluent prior to discharging to the receiving water.  The amount\n\nof chlorine handled is three one-ton containers for a total of 6,000\n\npounds.  The chlorine gas feeders are cylinder-mounted and are designed\n\nfor conveying the gas under vacuum.  The chlorine system is inspected\n\ndaily by the wastewater treatment plant operating personnel.  The\n\nfacility is manned approximately 8 hours per day.\n\n\n\nC.    In general, the Borough of Greenville Treatment Facility?s\n\naccidental release prevention program is based on the following:\n\n\n\n    - Compilation of safety information for chlorine storage\n\n    - Review of potential on-site hazards of the chlorine process\n\n    - Preparation of written operating procedures for safely\n\n      conducting any activity involving the chlorination process\n\n    - Implementation of employee training program\n\n    - Preparation of written maintenance and inspection techniques\n\n      and schedule for safe operation of the chlorine system\n\n\n\nAs an integral part of the prevention program, the Greenville Sanitary\n\nAuthority will perform a compliance audit at least once eve"

      "SummaryText": "ry 3 years.\n\nThe compliance audit will include a review of all aspects of the risk\n\nmanagement program in conjunction with corrective actions if any\n\ndeficiencies exist.  Written documentation of the audit will be\n\nmaintained on-site.\n\n\n\nAny incident that results in, or could have resulted in, a catastrophic\n\nrelease of chlorine will be investigated immediately.  A summary of the\n\ninvestigation and corrective actions will be documented and maintained\n\nat the treatment facility.\n\n\n\nChemical-specific prevention measures include the facility having the\n\nappropriate safety equipment on-site including a chlorine detection\n\ndevice, self-contained breathing apparatuses, and a ton-cylinder repair\n\nkit.  The facility promotes training and educating the employees\n\nrelative to acceptable operating and handling techniques of chlorine\n\ngas.\n\n\n\nD.    No accidental releases of chlorine have occurred at this facility\n\nin the past five years.\n\n\n\nE.    The facility is included under the Local Emergency Planning\n\nCommittee (LEPC) of Mercer County?s written emergency response plan.\n\nRelease response procedures by all involved parties, evacuation\n\nprocedures and training exercises are included within the plan.  The\n\npublic is to be notified by the County Emergency Management Agency as\n\nsoon as a release occurs.  Evacuation route has been mapped within the\n\nplan.  The plan is reviewed/updated annually by the facility\n\nemergency coordinator.\n\n\n\nThe Borough of Greenville WWTP employees will not respond to accidental\n\nreleases of chlorine gas.  Emergency responders will include the local\n\nfire department, police department, emergency medical service\n\nand HAZMAT team.\n\n\n\nF.    There are no actions planned to improve safety regarding the\n\nchlorine system at this time.\n\n"
