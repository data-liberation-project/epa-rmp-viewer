Due to the necessity of a timely response \nassociated with a propylene release, FHR has committed the resources necessary to respond defensively to \nemergencies at the Longview,TX facility.  The primary responders to emergencies at the facility will be the \nLongview Fire Dept.  FHR has trained operators that are able to assess and mitigate a propylene release \nin minutes.  In addition, our facility regularly meets with outside responders, local fire departments, and \nlocal emergency planning committees in order to establish emergency response procedures necessary to protect \nour surrounding public and the environment.\n\nOur facility and the regulated substances handled:\n\nThe FHR facility produces polypropylene and is a Program 3 covered process due to the onsite storage and \nuse of propylene, which is used at the facility to manufacture polypropylene.\n\nThe production facility is addressed as a process in a joint RMPlan with Eastman Chemical Company, Texas Operation.\n  The process addressed in this plan is the feeding and storage of propylene.  \n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps:\n\nThis facility is covered by both USEPA's Risk Management Program rule, as well as, OSHA's Process Safety \nManagement Rule for the propylene covered process.  The facility maintains a  program consisting of a written \nmanagement system that complies with both USEPA's and OSHA's requirements.  The backbone of the program is the \nManagement of Change Procedure.

This \nfacility has an active preventative maintenance, testing and inspection program of the propylene system.  \nThe mechanical integrity program provides ongoing assurance that the propylene system is maintained in safe \noperating condition.\n\nThe five year accident history:\n\nThis facility has not experienced a threshold release of propylene over the last five years.\n \nThe emergency response program:\n\nOur employees are trained and equipped to respond quickly to releases of propylene in a defensive manner.  \nThe operators routinely undergo training and participate in drills with the local fire department.  The plant \nhas coordinated emergency response procedures with emergency response agencies in the community.  In case of a \nrelease that could result in an offsite impact, the Gregg County Sheriff's Office would be immediately notified, \nwho in turn notifies the City of Longview and Harrison County Sheriff's Office.  These agencies would notify the \npublic.\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety:\n\nThis facility strives to continuously improve safety through the analysis of and treatment of potential hazards,\n thorough investigation of accidents and near misses and active participation in trade associations and safety \norganizations."
