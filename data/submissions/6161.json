The Wastewater Treatment Plant at 401 Grant Lane in Paragould, Arkansas houses a maximum of 8000 pounds of chlorine and 6000 pounds of sulfur dioxide, and is described in this Risk Management Plan (RMP).  The Water Treatment Plant at 320 North 5th Avenue in Paragould, Arkansas houses a maximum of 4000 pounds of chlorine.  The Risk Management Plan for the Water Treatment Plant site will be submitted under a separate cover.\n\n     The Management System section of the RMP describes the personnel position, primary responsibilities, and responsibilities in regard to revisions of the RMP, subsequent training of employees in regard to these revisions, and submittal of the revised RMP To EPA and other Emergency Response Agencies.\n\n     The accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at the Waste Water Treatment Plant were implemented to ensure the adequate training of personnel in safety, hazard review, operating procedures including preventive maintenance, personnel training and response to releases.\n\n     The worst case and alternative release scenarios were modeled using RMP*COMP.  The worst case scenario of 2000 pounds of chlorine released during 10 minutes at a rate of 200 pounds per minute shows an estimated distance to toxic endpoint radius of 5.4 miles from the Waste Water Treatment Pant, affecting a population of 19,364 people.  The alternate release scenario using a melted fusable plug resulting in a 1/4 inch hole, due to the high temperature of a structural fire resulted in a leak duration of 120 minutes.\n\n     With an excellent Prevention Program and Emergency Response Program in pla"

In case of a catastrophic release, public notification will be aired on our cable television emergency notification system and local radios.\n\n     This Risk Management Plan will be a valuable tool in informing and training our employees and emergency services on the hazards located in these two areas and how to respond to them quickly, safely, and efficiently."
