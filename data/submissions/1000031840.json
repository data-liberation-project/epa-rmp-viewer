The ultimate objective is to minimize the risk of an accidental ammonia release.  The facility management has developed an Emergency Response Plan along with training to ensure a fast and efficient response in the event of an accidental hazardous material release, fire or other emergency situation.\n\n\n\nIn order to prevent a potential accidental ammonia release at any americold facilities, the Company has an ongoing review process for design and operating procedures.  This assists in ensuring the refrigeration systems comply with OSHA, EPA and other local, state and federal regulatory agency safety standards, as well as its own internal standards.\n\n\n\nAmericold has a rigorous emergency training program that follows the guidelines of federal, state and local regulatory agencies.  The management believes that cooperative emergency response with outside cgencues must include company employees, local emergency responders and regulatory agency people in order to provide a safe workplace and a safe environment.  In an emergency, all personnel are trained to cooperate and assist as directed by the Emergency Response Incident Commander.\n\n\n\nAmericold East Point is a refrigerated warehousing facility.  The large majority of products stored are refrigerated foods for human consumption and inherently pose no known environmental or safety risks.  Ammonia, a regulated substance, is the commonly used refrigerant in industrial refrigeration systems that maintain low storage temperature and can be safely managed by trained operators.  The ammonia refrigeration process functions within a closed piping network serving the facility operations.  The refrig"

Should any accidental release occur, all maintenance employees are certified Emergency Hazardous Material Responders and are required to observe safe emergency response procedures.  \n\nThey are trained to work in conjunction with the local Emergency Planning Commission to minimize the impact of any accidental release.\n\n\n\nAs part of Americold's safety program, we have adopted the OSHA Process Safety Management Plan as an integral part of our base safety manual.  The OSHA PSM Program has been implemented and covers the entire scope of safe operation procedures of the ammonia refrigeration system from start-up and normal operations to potential emergency response operations and subsequent clean-up and restoration of systems.
