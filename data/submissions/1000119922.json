(Roquette) is committed to employee, public and environmental safety. This commitment is demonstrated by our accidental release prevention program that encompasses design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training. Engineering controls are in place to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. The Keokuk, IA facility is a responding facility for releases of the RMP-listed chemicals, so the site utilizes an Emergency Response Plan.\n\nThe stationary source and regulated substances handled [40 CFR 68.155(b)]:\n\nRoquette has four covered processes at the Keokuk facility. Three of the processes contain anhydrous ammonia above the threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds. The fourth process is a hydrogen production and storage system.\n\nAmmonia is delivered to the site by truck and unloaded into the storage tanks located in Refinery C, the Co-gen building, and the CFB building. The tanks are arranged in a way that prevents a release from one vessel from affecting any other vessels, making each tank and its associated equipment a distinct process within the facility. The anhydrous ammonia in these tanks is liquefied under pressure, and the tanks are administratively controlled to prevent overfilling.\n\nRoquette owns, operates, and controls hydrogen handling equipment (piping, valves, etc.) that is interconnected with a hydrogen storage system with a capacity greater than 10,000 pounds. The hydrogen storage system is owned, operated, and controlled by Praxair, Inc. (Praxair) and Roquette has no access to the storage system. More speci"

Piping from the hydrogen storage system passes across the chain link fence and into Roquette's process.\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps [40 CFR 68.155(c)]:\n\nRoquette has a program in place to comply with the provisions of the accidental release prevention regulations under 40 CFR Part 68 for a program level 3 site. The following sections briefly describe the elements of the existing release prevention program.\n\nProcess Safety Information [40 CFR Part 68.65]\nRoquette maintains a detailed record of process safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis [40 CFR Part 68.67]\nComprehensive analyses ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently. The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of 5 years. Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nWritten Operating Procedures [40 CFR Part 68.69]\nTo ensure safe operations, Roquette maintains written operating procedures. These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations and normal shutdown. The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nEmployee Training [40 CFR Part 68.71]\nRoquette has a training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating plant processes are competent in the applicable operating procedures. Refresher training is provided at least every three years and more frequently as needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity [40 CFR Part 68.73]\nRoquette carries out documen"
