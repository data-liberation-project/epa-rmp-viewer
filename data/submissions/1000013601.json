We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public, as well as protection of the environment.\n\nThe Enterprise Propane Terminals and Storage Lexington Terminal is owned by Enterprise Propane Terminals and Storage, LLC and is operated by Enterprise Products Operating, LLC. The Lexington Terminal is a LPG propane terminal connected to the Dixie Pipeline interstate LPG pipeline system.    The process is regulated by the OSHA Process Safety Management Standard for highly hazardous chemicals.\n\nWe use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help provide for the safety of our employees and the public, as well as protection of the environment.  This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including:\n\n*  A description of our facility and use of substances required by EPA's RMP regulation and the processes involved\n*  A summary of results from our assessment of the potential offsite consequences from accidental chemical releases\n*  Emergency Response Programs\n*  General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n*  A five-year accident history for accidental releases of chemicals at the Lexington Terminal that are regulated by EPA's RMP rule.  \n\nFacility Description\n\nThe Lexington Terminal engages in the pipeline receipt and storage of liquefied propane under pressure, and the loading of propane tank trucks.

We have registered the facility as an RMP Program Level 3 facility.\n\nThe facility receives, stores and distributes LPG.  There are four tanks dministratively controlled to hold and not exceed 80% of their capacity.  The facility consists of pressure storage tanks, propane dehydrators, a truck loading dock, associated piping, valves and other miscellaneous equipment.  \n\nIn our process we use the following chemicals that the EPA has identified as having the potential to cause significant offsite consequence in the event of a substantial accidental release:\n\nToxics\n\nThere are no toxic materials contained on site above the threshold limits.\n\nFlammables\n\nPropane is a finished product which is received into four storage tanks.  This material is routed from these tanks to the loading docks for  distribution.  Ethyl mercaptan is stored on site for use as a propane tank truck odorant.  The amount of ethyl mercaptan stored at Lexington Terminal is below the threshold quantity specified in the RMP rule.\n\nKey Offsite Consequence Analysis Scenarios\n\nThe EPA's RMP rule requires that we provide information about the worst-case scenario(s) and alternative release scenario(s) for our facility.  The following are brief summaries of these scenarios, including information about the key administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the exposure distances for each scenario.\n\nWorst Case Release Scenario - Regulated Toxic Chemical\n\nNo toxic material above the threshold quantity on site.\n\nAlternate Release Scenario(s) - Regulated Toxic Chemical\n\nNo toxic material above the threshold quantity on site.\n\nWorse Case Scenario - Regulated Flammable Chemicals\n\nThis simulation involves the rupture or failure of the propane storage tanks resulting in a simulated vapor cloud explosion that affects all of the storage tanks.  The entire inventory of all four tanks is simulated due to the proximity of the tanks relative to m"

All emergency response and early warning procedures to inform employees and the community would be exercised immediately if this were to occur.  The quantity and endpoint of the simulation, plus other information on the simulation, are available in the specified reporting of the Risk Management Plan\n\nAlternate Case Scenario - Regulated Flammable Chemicals\n\nThe alternate release scenario is a simulated rupture of the supply hose at the loading docks resulting in a three minute release and simulated vapor cloud explosion.  This scenario assumed the pump continued to operate at its normal flow rate for 3 minutes after the hose break.  Mitigation measures were taken into account when selecting the alternative release scenario.  These measures consisted of reviewing the use of relief valves, check valves, manual shutoff valves, automatic shutoffs, startup and operating procedures, grounding equipment, and excess flow devices.  Activation of the Emergency Shutdown devices would isolate the source of the material and secure the facility.  All emergency response and early warning procedures to inform employees and the community would be exercised immediately if this were to occur.  The quantity and endpoint of the simulation is contained in the data elements.\n\nWe are using this information to help us ensure that our emergency response plan and the community emergency response plan address all reasonable contingency cases.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nEnterprise maintains an integrated contingency plan, which consolidates all of the various federal, state, and local regulatory requirements for emergency response planning and reporting.
