This scenario assumed the pump continued to operate at its normal flow rate for 3 minutes after the hose break.  Mitigation measures were taken into account when selecting the alternative release scenario.  These measures consisted of reviewing the use of relief valves, check valves, manual shutoff valves, automatic shutoffs, startup and operating procedures, grounding equipment, and excess flow devices.  Activation of the Emergency Shutdown devices would isolate the source of the material and secure the facility.  All emergency response and early warning procedures to inform employees and the community would be exercised immediately if this were to occur.

The 9-1-1 system is used to notify the local Police and Fire Departments.  \n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nEnterprise takes a systematic, proactive approach to preventing accidental release of hazardous chemicals.  Our Process Safety Management systems address each of the key features of a successful prevention program, including:\n\n*  Process safety information\n*  Process hazard analysis\n*  Operating procedures\n*  Training\n*  Mechanical integrity\n*  Management of change\n*  Pre-Startup Safety Review - PSSR\n*  Compliance audits\n*  Incident investigation\n*  Employee participation\n*  Hot work permit\n*  Contractors\n\nOperations personnel make regular inspections of the equipment and processes they operate.  If something out of the ordinary is found, it is reported to management in order to expediently resolve any problems.\n\nThe engineering and administrative controls in place have been established to reduce the risk of an accidental release of identified hazardous materials.  Enterprise is committed to operations that are safe for employees and the surrounding community.\n\nAccident History\n\nRecords are kept for all significant accidental chemical releases that occur at our facility.
