This facility has mechanisms in-place as identified in the Mountaire Farms Emergency Release Notification/Procedures and Process Safety Management, Ammonia Refrigeration Systems to address releases of ammonia.  Designated facility personnel have received required OSHA training to respond to an ammonia release.  If an emergency release were to occur (i.e. a reportable quantity release), it is our policy to notify applicable agencies and request that they provide additional response resources as needed.\r\n\r\n\r\nA description of your facility and the regulated substances handled:\r\n\r\n\r\nThis facility is a poultry processing facility used to slaughter, cut-up, package, refrigerate and ship fresh poultry.  The facility receives live chickens which are slaughtered, processed and refrigerated for shipping to destinations in the region.  We use ammonia as a refrigerant in four (4) separate systems to provide refrigeration capacity to process equipment including coolers, spiral freezers, evaporator units, water chillers, and ice makers.  The systems are identified as systems No. 1 through No. 4 and have maximum intended ammonia inventories of 17,152 pounds, 2,700 pounds, 9,139 pounds, and 10,068 pounds, respectively.  Thus, the total plant capacity is 39,059 pounds of ammonia.  \r\n\r\n\r\nThe general accident release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps: \r\n\r\n\r\nThis facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule, applicable state and local codes and regulations.  The ammonia refrigeration systems are designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with IIAR codes and standards.\r\n\r\n\r\nFive-year accident history:\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have not had an accident involving ammonia that"
