Most of the 300 employees at the McIntosh facility live in Washington, Mobile, Clarke and Baldwin counties. Olin employees are involved in the communities and care about the environment which all of us in Southern Alabama share and enjoy.\n\nMaintaining open, positive relationships with the communities is a priority at our plant. We understand that we are an integral part of the community. We support the Olin Community Advisory Panel which was formed in 1988 and is comprised of community members who represent business, education, religion, and youth interests. Bi-monthly, members gather with plant management to share information on topics of mutual interests. Annually, representatives of the McIntosh panel join interested community members to tour the McIntosh facility.\n\nMany items we use every day depend on the products manufactured at the Olin McIntosh Plant. Our primary products: chlorine, caustic soda, Hydrochloric Acid and Sodium Hypochlorite are used to make everything from paper products, clothing, clean water, household bleach, and pharmaceuticals, to plastics, vinyl products, antifreeze, fuels, and paints, and sold to local industrial customers.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES:\n\nSince it's beginning, Olin has had a safety and environmental program, which relies on the fundamental belief that all accidents are preventable. Our \"Goal is Zero\" incidents for environmental, safety, security, and transportation. To help insure that an emergency situation with offsite implications is unlikely to occur, Olin has put six layers of safety protection in place. Employees, Mechanical integrity, Process Hazard Reviews, Process Controls, Safety Systems, and Emergency Preparedness.\n\nAt the Olin, McIntosh, Alabama facility, we are committed to operating and maintaining all of our processes in a safe and responsible manner.

In the case of hydrogen, the volume is less than 100 pounds. The volume for flammables is 10,000 pounds or greater. This product is shipped by pipeline to near industrial neighbors to be used as fuel or processed to a liquid form. \n\nHydrochloric  Acid solution is regulated by RMP at 37% concentration or greater. The guidelines at McIntosh are that we do not receive or manufacture acid that exceeds that concentration.\n\nOur accidental release prevention programs and  our contingency planning efforts help us effectively manage the potential hazards that are posed to our employees, the public, and the environment by our use, manufacturing, or handling of Chlorine.
