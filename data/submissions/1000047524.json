Executive Summary\n\n\n\nThis program is intended to meet the spirit and intent of the following regulations:\n\n- California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program - Title 19 CCR, Chapter 4.5\n\n- Federal EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) - Title 40 CFR ?68\n\n- California Process Safety Management (PSM) Program, Title 8 CCR ?5189\n\n- Federal Process Safety Management (PSM) Program, Title 29 CFR ?1910.119\n\n\n\nHereafter this program will be referred to as the RMP-PSM program.\n\n\n\nThis program is intended to be a \"living document\". As such, the information, procedures, policies, and documentation that make up this program must be made easily accessible and updated as necessary. To accomplish this, River Island Fresh has elected to use PSMWriter, software developed and distributed by Resource Compliance, Inc. This software will assist us with updating, maintaining, scheduling, and tracking RMP-PSM related activities. \n\n\n\n1.1 River Island Fresh, Risk and Process Safety Management Program\n\n\n\nThis is to inform all interested persons, including employees, that River Island Fresh has updated/developed their unified RMP-PSM Program. This program has been prepared to address the risks involved in operating and maintaining the following processes which have the presence of hazardous chemicals above threshold quantities: \n\n\n\nProcess Name               |   Process Chemical     |   Process Quantity(lbs.)\n\nNorth System Refrigeration |   Anhydrous Ammonia    |   12,000\n\n\n\nOur RMP-PSM program promotes overall plant, worker, and public safety. The program enables our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of hazardous chemicals. Overall, the program is designed to prevent accidental fatalities, injuries, illnesses and physical property damage.\n\n\n\nOur company has many policies and procedures in place to promote overall plant, worker and public safety. We have: \n\n1. Prepared a unified program based on the PSM plan to meet CalARP and RM"

The facility has two (2) ammonia refrigeration systems (P1 South System and P2 North System) that provides refrigeration capacity to multiple cold rooms for cooling fruit. There are five (5) cold storage rooms, one (1) precooler, and one (1) hallway. The storage rooms and precooler are equipped with \"bunker style\" evaporator coils that contain chilled liquid ammonia and the hallway is equipped with a ceiling suspended air-cooling evaporator. A computer system provides substantial control and alarm capability.\n\n\n\nBoth ammonia processes are flooded systems. High pressure liquid from a high pressure receiver is piped to each cold room, where it passes through an expansion valve into a low pressure accumulator vessel mounted in the bunker wall. Low temperature liquid circulates by thermal convection through the evaporator coils located behind bunker walls in the cold rooms. Low pressure and temperature gas collects in the accumulator vessel, and passes through a pressure regulator into a suction line. The suction line returns the vapor to the main suction accumulator vessel located in the machinery room (P2 North System only), which separates any residual liquid from the gas. The gas is piped to reciprocating compressors which elevate the temperature and pressure of the gas. The high pressure discharge from the compressors is sent to water cooled evaporative condensers where the high pressure gas ammonia is liquified and returned to the high pressure receiver.

Operation of a float switch activated solenoid valve raises the pressure in the liquid transfer vessel to the point the liquid can be drained into the high pressure receiver. \n\n\n\nThe facility was built in the 1950's by in accordance with industry standards at the time. It was also built in compliance with the Uniform Mechanical Code and Uniform Building Code applicable at the time of construction. The system contains numerous safety devices including sensors which stop the compressors if temperatures or pressures exceed or drop below established limits, and safety relief valves which vent ammonia gas to the atmosphere if the pressure in the system exceeds their set point. In addition, ammonia detectors are located in the P2 North System machinery room, each cold storage room (and precooler), and hallway, which will shut down equipment if ammonia is detected.\n\n\n\nEach ammonia system at River Island Fresh Cold Storage consists of vessel, pipe, and equipment that is interconnected, but the systems are not directly connected to each other or co-located. As such, River Island Fresh Cold Storage has two (2) ammonia refrigeration processes.\n\n\n\n1.3 General Accident Release & Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\n1.3.1 General \n\n\n\nWe inform our employees engaged in process operations of the dangers of an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia in annual safety meetings. During these meeting we also discuss preventative measures, such as evacuation, in order to be prepared for a release.\n\n\n\nRiver Island Fresh has also conducted an off-site consequence analysis of worst-case and alternative release scenarios for the ammonia refrigeration process. These are for the purposes of informing the public in the event of an accidental release. The results of the analyses are reported in PSMWriter and hard copy binders. \n\n\n\n1.3.2 Anhydrous Ammonia\n\n\n\nThe am"

The ammonia processes contains a total charge of approximately 15,600. It is extremely important that this processs are maintained and operated in a safe and efficient manner. Management is committed to making sure that employees are made aware of the potential danger of an ammonia leak.\n\n\n\nOur refrigeration personnel monitor the ammonia refrigeration process and keep an active log book of all procedures and transactions that pertain to ammonia. Also, refrigeration contractors assist in performing the annual mechanical integrity inspection of our ammonia equipment.\n\n \n\n1.4 Five Year Accident History\n\n\n\nRiver Island Fresh has had no accidental release within the last five (5) years.\n\n\n\n1.5 Emergency Action and Response Plan\n\nRiver Island Fresh's emergency action and response program has been developed to satisfy the following requirements:\n\n- California \"Emergency Action Plan\" - Title 8 CCR ?3220\n\n- Federal \"Emergency Action Plan\" - Title 29 CFR ?1910.38\n\n\n\nStrategically, we will respond \"minimally\" to a release. Under this plan we will call emergency personnel and evacuate the facility. All response activities would be done in coordination with the Local Fire Department and their Hazardous Materials Response Team.\n\n  \n\n1.6 Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nRiver Island Fresh has implemented many policies and procedures to promote overall plant, worker and public safety. Nevertheless, River Island Fresh continually strives to improve in all areas, including safety.\n\nBy utilizing PSMWriter software, all necessary employees have access to every aspect of the RMP-PSM program.

When a RMP-PSM program requirement is completed (i.e. mechanical integrity inspection, process hazard analysis, compliance audit, etc.) any specific action items related to that event are entered into PSMWriter, assigned a responsible person, and given a due date. Once the action item has been completed, the resolution can be documented using PSMWriter as well. A list of current or past due action items can be accessed at any time by those with access to PSMWriter.\n\n\n\nIn addition to utilizing PSMWriter to create, schedule, track, and document events, River Island Fresh has also entered into a contract with Resource Compliance to obtain help with RMP-PSM program implementation.\n\nFor the future, River Island Fresh now thinks of the RMP-PSM program as a \"living document\". It is an interactive framework that guides safe action for River Island Fresh employees, but allows for feedback and continual improvement. Through the RMP-PSM program River Island Fresh will continue to maintain overall plant worker and public safety."
