The reviews identify the opportunity for equipment malfunctions or human errors that could cause an accidental release, the safeguards used to control hazards and prevent releases, and the steps used to detect or monitor releases. The results of the reviews are documented and problems identified are addressed in a timely manner.\r\n3)\tOperating Procedures: The facility maintains written operating procedures for the handling and storage of anhydrous ammonia. The procedures generally follow the provisions of the Occupation Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) standard, 29 CFR 1910.111, Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia and the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) standard ANSI/CGA G- 21.-2014, Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia. The written procedures are reviewed by facility management on a regular basis and revised as necessary.\r\n4)\tTraining: All employees at the facility that handle anhydrous ammonia participate in a training program. Initial training for new employees consists of classroom type instruction (e.g., reading safety information, operating procedures and response measures followed by a written test) and on\u00ad the-job supervision. Refresher training for all employees is conducted annually. The training program is reviewed by facility management on a regular basis and revised as necessary.\r\n5)\tMaintenance: The facility maintains written equipment inspection and maintenance procedures. Storage and transfer/process equipment inspections are performed by qualified personnel on an approximate annual basis and are documented. Equipment maintenance procedures follow either instructions furnished by the equipment vendors, Federal or State regulations (i.e., the provisions of the OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.111, Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia) or industry codes (i.e., the provisions of the ANSI standard, Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of A"

The audit will be documented and conducted by a person knowledgeable in the safe handling and storage of anhydrous ammonia. Corrective actions required as a result of each compliance audit will be performed promptly and documented.\r\n7)\tIncident Investigation: Facility management will investigate each incident that results in, or could\r\nhave reasonably resulted in a catastrophic release of anhydrous ammonia. The investigation will be performed to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring. Investigation reports will be retained for five years.\r\n\r\nFive-Year Accident History: \r\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five (5) years that caused deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor, to our knowledge, resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage\r\nor environmental damage.\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program:\r\nIn the event of an emergency, it is facility protocol to notify the local fire department and other emergency responder's and request that they respond to the emergency. Facility employees will not respond to accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia except for those that are small or incidental,\t\r\ncan be controlled at the time of the release by employees in the immediate release area (e.g., shutting a valve) and do not appear to pose an immediate safety or health hazard.
