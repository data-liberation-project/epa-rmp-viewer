Our facility engages in the receiving, storage, and reloading of Anhydrous Ammonia for delivery to farmers in our area. This product is subject to the EPA Risk Management Program and is the subject of this plan.  Only the facility used for this product will be included in this report.\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application to farm fields during the early spring and late fall months.  During the balance of the year, inventories will be stored only with little if any product transfers taking place.  The Maximum quantity stored has been listed earlier in the RMP and will not be disclosed in this summary.  Maximum quantity handled at a given time will be the unloading of a rail tank car or a semi-trailer tank.\n\nOur facilities have adequate lighting, and are inspected day and night during use, and through out the off season.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PROGRAM:\n\nOur accidental release program for anhydrous ammonia is based on guidelines found in the American National Standard Institute (ANSI) Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) standard 29 CFR 1910.111 Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia.

We maintain routine contact with our local fire department and emergency response personnel, and have provided and/or participate in safety training exercises on Anhydrous Ammonia.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\n\nWe have not had a release of anhydrous ammonia within the past five years that has caused death, injury, or significant property damage at the facility.  To our knowledge, we have not caused any offsite death, injury, evacuation, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM:\n\nThis facility is included in the written Community Emergency Response Plan as prepared by the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and the Nebraska Emergency Management Agency (NEMA).  We also include these materials in our own Emergency Action Plan in accordance with OSHA 29 CFR 1910.38.  We have provided State and Local authorities all Community Right-to-Know information requested as well as that required under SARA Title III (EPRA).  Our written employee safety programs include pre-emergency planning and employee training in accordance with OSHA standards, and are offered for review at any time by our Local Emergency Planning Committee to ensure that they conform to the community plan.  We actively encourage participation in our Anhydrous Ammonia training program by the local fire department(s), local emergency response team, hazardous materials responders, community planners, etc. that may be expected to respond to an incident at our site.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY:\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at our facility.
