      "SummaryText": "1.  Facility Information. The City of Gardner, Kansas Treatment Plant facility in Gardner, Kansas is a municipal water treatment facility. The facility includes water collection, water treatment, water storage, and pumping systems for distribution to the community. The facility stores and uses chlorine for water treatment (chlorination).  The chlorine used at the facility is stored in 1-ton cylinders.  Typically a maximum of 4,000 pounds is present at any one time; however, a maximum of 6,000 pounds could be at the facility.  One cylinder is connected to the feed system and is in use. A second cylinder is connected to the feed system but is isolated from the system by the changeover valve. \n\n\n\n2.  Worst-Case and Alternative Release Scenarios. As required for the RMP, the facility has evaluated the chlorination process to identify possible sources of chlorine releases.  In addition, the off-site impact of both a worst-case and an alternative release scenario has been evaluated RMP*Comp. Results of the off-site impact analysis is presented in the submittal.  The chlorination process operates on a vacuum principle that provides a degree of fail-safe operation. A failure of one of the valves or lines between the vacuum regulator at the chlorine cylinder and the injector nozzle would cause a loss of vacuum that would close the vacuum regulator stopping any release of chlorine. In addition, there is an automatic shutoff valve mounted directly on each cylinder valve. The automatic shutoff valves can be operated manually at the cylinder, automatically in the event of a power failure or on the detection of 3 parts per million (ppm) of chlorine at any detector, or through the use of any emergency pushbutton. The chlorine cylinders are stored in a closed room constructed of concrete and cement block. The cylinder storage room has doors direct to an outside delivery area, where the cylinders are received. The chlorine storage room is adjacent to the water treatment building. \n\n"

      "SummaryText": "\n\n3.  Facility Policy.  The owners, management and employees of the City of Gardner, Hillsdale Water Treatment Plant are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of chlorine.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, and/or other authorities, to mitigate and minimize the impacts of the release to the public and the environment.\n\n\n\n4.  Accidental Release Prevention Program.  The City of Gardner abidies by all pertinent State of Kansas Regulation related to Chlorine and to guard against accidental releases of chlorine at the water treatment plant, and, if a release should occur, notify all applicable response agencies to minimize the harm to the surrounding community and the enviromment.\n\n\n\n5.  Five-Year Accident History.  There have been no accidental releases of chlorine during the past five years that have caused injuries at the facility.  There have not been any accidental releases resulting in off-site deaths, injuries, evacuation, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n\n\n6.  Emergency Response Program.  The facility has a written Emergency Action Plan.  We do not plan to have our employees respond to a major release.  If a large release of chlorine takes place at our facility, the response action is to evacuate the area of the release and call 911 and all applicable emergency response numbers.  Johnson County Fire District 2 will respond to a release from the facility from Spring Hill through contract with the Miami County Rural Fire District.\n\n\n\n7.  Planned Changes to Improve Safety.  Safety improvement is an ongoing process at this facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the conditions of the facility.  There are no specific safety recommendations regarding the storage or the use of chlorine for implementation at this time.\n\n"
