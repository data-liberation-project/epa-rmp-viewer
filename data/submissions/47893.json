It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal, State and local regulations. If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to immediately vacate the premises, move to a safe location, and notify the MOORLAND Volunteer Fire Department (via a 911 call) and request that it respond to the emergency. Incidental to the notification to the fire department, a call to the Region 5 LEPC will be made.\n\nWhile we have planned for an emergency, it is acknowledged that a real emergency will be unexpected and may very well be different and cannot be ensured to duplicate what may have been planned. In reality, the situation that develops may not happen in the manner in which it has been planned. In that event, what we may have planned will serve only as a guideline to follow.\n\nThe Emergency Action Plan for this facility describes certain procedures that are intended to minimize the hazards associated with human health and the environment from fires, explosions, the sudden and unexpected release of chemicals (i.e. Anhydrous Ammonia), tornadoes, bomb threats or other accidents or acts of God which might occur on our premises.\n\nThe primary emergency response coordinator for the ROELYN, Iowa location is Frank Huseman, Location Manager. His work and 24-hour emergency response telephone numbers are provided in the Registration Section of this document. The 24-hour emergency response number provided in that section also provides a telephone tree for additional individuals who are available and can respond to an emergency at that location.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE ANHYDROUS AMMONIA STORAGE/DISTRIBUTION PLANT AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCE HANDLED AT NEW COOPERATIVE, INC., ROELYN, IOWA.\n\nThis facility is a bulk anhydrous ammonia storage and distribution plant.

      "SummaryText": "ility is distributed to agricultural crop producers in the surrounding area who utilize the anhydrous ammonia for crop nutrient purposes.\n\nThe bulk plant system consists of two (2) 30,000 gallon storage tanks with associated piping, valves, liquid pumps(s), and other miscellaneous equipment. The anhydrous ammonia plant is only operated on a seasonal basis (Spring and Fall). Full-time equivalent employee numbers were computed on that basis. At a maximum, the plant operates a total of three months (1/4 of the year). The FTEs for this company location is two (2).\n\nNurse tanks are filled and positioned awaiting distrubution and transportation from the parking lot to the farm. The parking lot is seperate from the storage tank facilities. In this instance, nurse tanks are parked in a lot that is not situated on continguous property to the bulk plant. At any one point in time up to 119 nurse tanks could be parked in this lot awaiting pickup or delivery to area crop producers. The specific address of the parking lot is described in the registration section of this document.\n\nTHE WORST-CASE SCENARIO:\n\nThe worst-case scenario is the failure of one (1) of the 15,000 gallon nurse tanks when filled to the greatest amount allowed (85% of capacity), resulting in the release of the total volume in a gaseous (hazardous ammonia vapor cloud) form. According to EPA's RMP*Comp Program (Version 1.06), the distance to the endpoint is 1.0 miles.\n\nThe alternative release scenario involves the rupture of the transfer hose on the nurse tank or the act of vandals opening the liquid withdrawl valve to illegally obtain anhydrous ammonia for methanphetamine production. The resulting release, according to EPA's RMP*Comp Program has a distance to endpoint of 0.1 miles.\n\nSince this facility is located in the Town of Moorland, provisions have been designed to notify all affected persons. An evacuation plan is in place.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION ST"

      "SummaryText": "EPS:\n\nThis facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule and all applicable State and local codes and regulations. The anhydrous ammonia system is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with ANSI Standard k-61.1-1995 and State law.\n\nIn addition the company has specific operating procedures in place intended to minimize the potential for an accidental (and potentially catastrophic) release of anhydrous ammonia. Finally, NEW Cooperative, Inc. has extended to the Moorland Volunteer Fire Department the opportunity to visit our anhydrous ammonia plant, to participate in mock emergency simulation training, and to avail themselves of specific anhydrous ammonia health hazard information and training provided by the company.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\n\nNEW Cooperative, Inc., Roelyn, Iowa has never had an accident involving anhydrous ammonia that caused death, injury, property or environmental damage, evacuations or shelterings in place.\n\nTHE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM:\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving our anhydrous ammonia system, it is the policy of NEW Cooperative, Inc. to immediately notify the Moorland Volunteer Fire Department and the Region 5 LEPC to request that they respond to the emergency. In the unlikely event that the Moorland Volunteer Fire Department is unable to adequately respond to an emergency at Roelyn location, mutal aid (reciprocal agreement between neighboring fire departments) will be summoned. We have discussed this policy with the fire department and Region 5 LEPC. Memebers of the fire department and the LEPC have inspected our anhydrous plant. In addition, copies of photographs taken of our plant have been provided (for reference) to both entities.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY:\n\nNone."
