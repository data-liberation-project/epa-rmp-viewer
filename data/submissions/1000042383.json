We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public as well as protection of the environment. This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including:\r\n- A description of our facility and use of substances regulated by EPA's RMP regulation\r\n- A summary of results from our assessment of the potential off site consequences from accidental chemical releases\r\n- An overview of our accidental release prevention programs\r\n- A five-year accident history for accidental releases of chemicals regulated by EPA RMP rule\r\n- An overview of our emergency response program\r\n- An overview of planned improvements at the facility to help prevent accidental chemical releases from occurring and adversely affecting our employees, the public and the environment.\r\n\r\nFACILITY AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\r\nOur facility is located on 280 acres and is one of the worlds largest PO/TBA facilities. Our facility produces a number of products that include propylene oxide (P0), tertiary butyl alcohol, propylene glycols, propylene glycol ethers, and tertiary butyl hydroperoxide. These units/processes use the following chemicals that the EPA has identified as having the potential to cause significant off site consequences in the event of a substantial accidental release:\r\n\r\nTOXICS\r\nPropylene Oxide (P0): Approximately 35.4 million lbs are produced, stored and used on-site. P0 is the major product of the facility and is also a feed stock for the propylene gylcols and propylene gylcol ethers.\r\n\r\nFLAMMABLES\r\nPropylene: Approximately 1,800,000 lbs are stored and use"

Our management systems address each of the key features of successful prevention programs including:\r\n\r\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\nProcess Safety Information: Chemical hazard, process technology, and equipment information is documented, maintained up-to-date, and available to operating personnel.\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis: A rigorous practice of reviewing new processes or change to existing processes at the design stage to identify and mitigate potential safety, health, and environmental issues before the process is installed and operated. Scheduled process hazard/risk reviews are conducted to revalidate initial process hazard reviews on a periodic basis. Process hazard analyses are conducted every five years to identify major process hazard scenarios and to recommend corrective action(s) needed to prevent their occurrence.\r\nOperating Procedures: Operating procedures provide detail on how to safely operate a process and are maintained up-to-date. Operating procedures are based on process hazard/risk reviews. The procedures include emergency shutdown and safe start-up methods."

Operator recertification is required.\r\nMaintenance Procedures: The plant has specific procedures for maintaining process equipment so that it operates safely. Plant and unit specific procedures for servicing operating equipment are in place, including preventative maintenance and reliability programs.\r\nMaintenance Training: The plant trains and tests mechanics and craftsmen who perform routine or complex maintenance tasks on process equipment and inspections on operating equipment to ensure they have the required knowledge and skills.\r\nMechanical Integrity Program: Vessels (including shipping containers) and other process equipment are periodically tested and inspected to ensure safe operation of process equipment, following recognized standards and/or government requirements. This program includes testing, inspection and maintenance of critical equipment, including pressure relief devices, hoses, piping, instruments, and shutdown systems.\r\nQuality Assurance: The plant has a system to ensure that purchased equipment and materials meet established engineering standards and specifications.\r\nProcess Change Authorizations (Management of Change): The plant has a management system to ensure that modified facilities and processes are safe for operation. Design and pre-startup safety reviews are conducted for facility or process changes before the changes are implemented.\r\nPre-Startup Safety Reviews: Reviews are conducted just prior to start up to ensure that modified facilities and processes are safe for operation.\r\nIncident Investigation: The plant has a program to ensure accidents, incidents, and near miss events are properly investigated to determine the Root Cause(s) and Contributing Cause(s), and to implement corrective action(s) that are needed to prevent recurr"

The plant has a procedure to ensure that welding, cutting and brazing are safely performed in areas where flammable or combustible material may be present.\r\nLine Breaking: Requires isolation and draining of lines to be opened, preventing accidental releases or opening the wrong line.\r\nCompliance Audits: Periodic corporate led and plant led audits are conducted to ensure that process operations comply with governmental and Lyondell requirements.\r\nContractor Safety Program: The plant has a program to ensure that contractors are properly trained and perform their work in compliance with safety requirements. Contractors must meet rigorous safety performance requirements before being allowed to work on process equipment. Contractor employees and regular plant employees must follow all of the same plant safety procedures and requirements.\r\nEquipment Design: Vessels (including shipping containers) and other process equipment are designed according to recognized industry standards and/or governmental requirements.\r\nOperational Excellence Standards: We follow rigorous corporate standards to ensure that we operate our facilities in a safe and environmentally sound manner. Our compliance to these standards is routinely audited by corporate experts. We have Operational Excellence Standards in the following areas: Environmental, Health and Safety; Technical; Operations; Maintenance; Transportation and Storage; Quality; and Purchasing.
