The Emergency Response Team is the core of the response plan. This team is trained in the Emergency Response Plan procedures and implementation. The Emergency Response Team meets to review procedures and discuss new and improved methods of response. Among the benefits of having a trained in-house response team are reduced response time and more immediate decision making capabilities; these qualities greatly contribute to minimizing the effects in the event of an actual emergency. The North Haven Fire Department is an important part of Bozzuto's Emergency Response Plan, and are kept current with Bozzuto's facility information. Bozzuto's continues to revise and improve its Emergency Response Plan. This effort is part of Bozzuto's commitment to the health and safety of its employees and community.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY \nBozzuto's is continually looking for new ways of improving the safety level of its employees and community. Bozzuto's continues to work with an experienced hazardous materials spill contractor. The intention of the partnership is to provide Bozzuto's additional specific expertise in the field of hazardous materials release procedures and prevention. Continuing discussions and exercises are planned to ensure an efficient and prompt response time. Bozzuto's plans to continue its efforts and commitment to health and safety"

The Security Officer will gather the information and initiate the Emergency Response Plan. Having this continuous coverage reduces the response time in an emergency condition, thereby minimizing the consequences. \n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM \nBozzuto's views the risk of accidental release very seriously. \nAccidental release prevention programs include: \n- Process Safety Management / Risk Management, \n- Hazard Communication, \n- Lockout / Tagout, and - Risk Management. \n\nThrough a Process Hazard Analysis Study, Bozzuto's uses a hazard and operability study to identify potential accidental release conditions. Solutions are then developed to prevent or limit these conditions from happening. If an incident were to happen, an investigation would take place, and new procedures would be implemented so a similar occurrence could be prevented. All Bozzuto's prevention programs are audited at regular intervals to validate their effectiveness; the objective is to be proactive in preventing accidental releases, not reactive. \n\nFIVE YEAR HISTORY\n EPA's RMP Regulation defines Accident as the following: The release must be from a covered process and involve a regulated substance held above its threshold quantity in the process. The release must have caused at least one of the following: On-site deaths, injuries, or significant property damage (\u00a768.42(a)); or Known offsite deaths, injuries, property damage, environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place (\u00a768.42(a)). \nBased on the above definition and an investigation into the facility's accident history conducted during the Process Hazard Analysis study on March 6, 2023 there have been no releases of ammonia that meet this criteria in the past five years (March 2018 - March 2023). In addition, there have been no injuries resulting from"

In September of 2008 Bozzuto's moved into an existing refrigerated warehouse distribution center. Among its advantages, this distribution center utilizes the benefits of ammonia as a refrigerant. Bozzuto's does recognize ammonia as a potentially hazardous chemical, and this was a consideration when selecting the facility. In consideration of the risks associated with the use of ammonia, Bozzuto's commits its efforts to ensuring its employees and surrounding community continue to enjoy a healthy and safe environment. \nPart of this commitment includes: \n- Employing only skilled refrigeration technicians; \n- Contracting with only experienced ammonia refrigeration contractors; \n- Organizing an in-house Emergency Response Team; \n- Coordination with the North Haven Fire Department; \n- Partnering with a hazardous materials release contractor; and \n- Maintaining communication with the designated North Haven Local Emergency Planning Commission. \n\nBozzuto\u2019s senior management assumes an active role in overseeing the overall ammonia safety programs, demonstrated by active participation in program audits, observing and critiquing ammonia release drills and serving as the liaison in building relationships and establishing open communication with local LEPCs and emergency responders.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION \nAccidental release prevention is the approach Bozzuto's has taken to minimize and possibly eliminate the potential for an accidental release. Bozzuto's exercises ongoing preventive maintenance and equipment integrity procedures. \nSome of these programs include: \n- Process Safety Management / Risk Management, \n- Hazard Communication, and \n- Lockout / Tagout \n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES \nBozzuto's maintains a twenty-four hour a day,"
