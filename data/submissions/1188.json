L & L Farm Supply Policy\n\nThe owners and employees of L & L Farm Supply are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, we are prepared to work with the Chattanooga Volunteer Fire Department, and other appropriate agencies, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release on the community and the environment.\n\n2. Basic Information\n\nWe are a full-service farm supply store.  Our primary activities are selling feed, parts, fertilizers, pesticides, and other supplies to local farmers.  We also provide custom application of fertilizers and pesticides.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a nitrogen fertilizer for crop production.\n\nThe maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia stored at any one time is 110,000 pounds in our two 12,000 gallon storage tanks.  \n\n3. Worst-case release scenario and alternative release scenario\n\na.) The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of one \n12,000 gallon storage tank as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 56,000 pounds which represents the volume of the tank at the maximum allowable filling capacity.  The likely affected area would be a circle whose center is located at the tank and whose radius is 0.74 miles.  At this distance the concentration of anhydrous ammonia in the air should be less than 200 parts per million.\n\nb.) The alternative release scenario (or most likely potential accident) is a release \nfrom a break in a transfer hose.  The quantity released would be approximately 7,000 pounds.  The likely affected area would be a circle whose radius is 0.33 miles.\n\n4. Accidental release prevention program\n\nWe take extensive precautions to prevent accidental releases.  We have implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handl"

Five-year accident history\n\nTo our knowledge, there have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years:\n- that have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor\n- that have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n6. Emergency response program\n\nWe are prepared to act in a quick and organized manner in the unlikely event of a serious release of anhydrous ammonia.  We have a written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.38, outlining the specific actions we would take in response to an emergency.  We have also provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information required by law.  (SARA Title II, EPCRA)\n\n7. Planned changes to improve safety:\n\nWe have an ongoing commitment to the safety of our employees and our community.  Periodic evaluations are performed to ensure the maintenance of safe operating conditions and procedures.  Currently, no additional anhydrous ammonia safety practices need to be implemented."
