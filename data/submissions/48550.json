      "SummaryText": "nery receives crude oil by tanker for processing into various products.  The process by which crude oil is manufactured into various saleable products (for example, gasoline, propane,  etc.) is known as refining.  Petroleum refining involves the separation of crude oil into several components using distillation methods.  Heavier hydrocarbon compounds are further processed by cracking and subsequent combining or rearranging.  Many of the refining processes include the formation, combining, or rearranging of regulated flammable substances. Regulated flammable substances are present at the Refinery as flammable mixtures. Primary components of the mixtures are propane, butane, pentane and propylene. Secondary components of the mixtures can include: hydrogen, methane, ethane, ethylene, butene, isobutane, isobutene, 2-butene-cis, 2-butene-trans, 1,3-butadiene, and isopentane. \n\nThe only RMP regulated toxic substance that the refinery has above threshold quantities is anhydrous ammonia. Ammonia is an impurity in the crude and as the crude is distilled the ammonia is removed and sold as a product. \n\n \nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM STEPS\n\nThe section is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at the Chevron Pascagoula Refinery.  Because processes at the Refinery that are regulated by the EPA RMP (Risk Management Process) regulation are also subject to the OSHA PSM (Process Safety Management) standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program. The objective of the PSM system is to reduce the consequences of and potential for accidents in the Refinery.  Accidents could include fires, explosions, toxic gas releases, spills, product quality problems, etc.\n\nEmployee Participation \n\nThe Refinery encourages participation in Process Safety Management through training and the development of cross-functional teams to perform process hazards analys"

Safety topic presentations are included as part of meeting agendas and responsibility for these presentations is rotated among employees to give everyone a chance to participate.  \n\nBehavioral Accident Prevention Process BAPP (BST) \n\nEmployee safety participation is built upon the Behavioral Accident Prevention Process (BAPP) developed by Behavioral Science Technology, Inc.  In this process, employees observe each other while performing their daily work for behaviors which might put them at risk for causing an accident.  The employee being observed receives immediate feedback during the observation regarding their performance.  The data from each observation is also collected on a checklist and input into a database.  The data is then used on group and refinery levels to develop action plans to improve behaviors, procedures, and equipment.  Each field employee receives initial and annual refresher training in this process.  Approximately 1000 observations are performed per month.  \n\nThis process is managed by organizational employee steering committees that also provide input on other refinery safety initiatives related to work process improvements and regulatory compliance issues.\n\nSafety Audits\n\nPeriodically the Refinery is subject to company internal audits.  These audits include Fire Loss Prevention surveys, Corporate Safety, Fire, and Health Compliance Reviews and Process Safety Management Audit.  These audits/surveys insure that the facility is in compliance with recommended practices, policies, and government laws and regulations.\n\nSafety Meetings\n\nSafety meetings are held on a routine basis throughout the Refinery and involve all employees as participants and/or presenters. All meetings start with a formal or informal safety minute. We have also started utilizing Safety Standown meetings as needed to communicate or emphasize specific information. \n\nProcess Safety Information \n\nProce"

Process Safety Information includes but is not limited to safety instruction sheets, operating procedures, piping and instrumentation drawings, loop drawings and material safety data sheets.  Most of this information is available electronically for easy access.  Its purpose is to train and inform employees of the hazards, safety precautions, and design related limits for the units. \n\nOperating Procedures\n\nThe Refinery maintains written operating procedures that address each Plant's operational processes including start-up, normal operations, emergency shutdown, planned shutdown, and the initial start-up of a new plant or after a planned maintenance shutdown.  These procedures are available to operations personnel and serve as a basis for training new operations personnel.  These procedures are periodically reviewed and revised as necessary through the management of change process.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nThe Chevron Refinery has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nThe primary technique used to perform these evaluations is known as Process Hazards Analysis.  A PHA study is a systematic review of existing or proposed new equipment Piping and Instrumentation Diagrams (P&IDs) or significant modifications to existing P&IDs for possible deviations from the normal design intent.\n\nThe employer must use one or more of the following PHA methods, as appropriate, to determine and evaluate the hazards of the process being analyzed:\n-What if\n-What If/Checklist\n-Hazard and Operability study (HAZOP)\n-Failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA)\n-Fault tree analysis or\n-An appropriate equivalent"

The team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.   A final list of action items is reviewed with the Refinery Management Team and after concurrence, is distributed for follow-up.  This action item list is tracked to ensure that all follow-up items are completed in a timely manner.  Completed items are documented, and a copy of this document is placed in the PHA study manual.  PHAs are revalidated at least every five years.  The revalidation includes a review of the changes (design, regulatory, etc.) that have taken place in the process since the last PHA and includes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures as with the initial PHA. \n\n\nTraining\n\nThe Refinery also has an active and comprehensive training program for all operations personnel that serves to build on the operating procedures mentioned above.  All new operations personnel must complete an initial five week training session before entering a plant for duty.  Once at the plant, new operations personnel attend a unit school and \"piggy-back\" with more experienced operators before taking on full responsibility for his or her duties.  Only after a new operator demonstrates the skills necessary to operate on his or her own are they allowed to work independently.  In addition, operations personnel receive refresher training on operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained.

Safety audits of contract personnel are conducted either independently by the contractor or jointly with a Chevron representative to ensure that safety standards are being met. \n\nAll contractors are required to attend a Pre-Shutdown Kickoff meeting.  In this meeting, the importance of an incident and injury free (IIF) culture is discussed and contractors are asked for their safety viewpoints. We also discuss the three elements of a good shutdown: safety, quality, and schedule. Emphasis is placed on Safety first and schedule last. At times Contractors may also present their own safety presentations at this meeting. \n\nPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\n\nThe Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation mandates that a pre-startup safety review must be conducted on new facilities and modified facilities when the modification is significant enough to require a change in the process safety information.\n\nThe purpose of the pre-startup safety review (PSSR) is to insure that prior to startup, refinery equipment is reviewed to determine whether it is safe to operate, and meets all applicable requirements of Company standards, good engineering practices, industry codes and practices, and local, State, and Federal codes and statutes.

The purpose of MOC is 1) to anticipate incidents that could be created by a change, as well as health and safety issues, and 2) to design the change in a way that reduces the likelihood of incidents.  Management of Change applies to all changes to Refinery equipment, processes, feeds, chemicals, procedures or technology.  \n\nThe MOC process involves as applicable a review of equipment design, construction, and siting, fire protection, electrical classification, as well as a review of all associated documents and manuals for proper update of the change.  The change passes through several phases of review with an emphasis placed on the type of change and the impact of that change.  The MOC requests are tracked, and once all the required reviews are completed the MOC is given an \"authorization to implement change\" approval.  A copy of the signed MOC documentation form accompanies all copies of the work request for Operator and Mechanic review.  Completed MOC documentation is retained for a minimum of five years.  Training about the change is provided to affected personnel.\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nThe Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation mandates that an incident investigation  must be conducted for every incident that resulted in or could have resulted in a release or fire  in the workplace. Since we are committed to preventing incidents and thereby protecting employees and our surrounding community we actually investigate more incidents than are required under the OSHA PSM law.
