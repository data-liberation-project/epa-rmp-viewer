If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to notify the Gainesville Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency.  \n\nFacility description and the regulated substances handled:   \n\nThe primary purpose of this facility is  to extrude Aluminum products.  We use propane as a backup fuel for natural gas during periods of natural gas curtailment.  We also use propane as fuel for forklift trucks.  The propane standby system consists of one (1) 30,000 gallon propane tank and associated piping, pumpset, vaporizer, blender, valves, burners, and other miscellaneous equipment.\n\nThe worst-case scenario and alternative release scenario:   \n\nOur worst case scenario is failure of the 30,000 gallon propane storage tank when filled to the greatest amount allowed (88% at 60F), resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  According to EPA's look-up tables, the distance to the endpoint is 0.4 miles.  Using available census data, there are approximately 90 people within the distance to the endpoint.  The alternative case scenario involves a pipe on the discharge of the system pumpset breaks while the pump is operating.  In this case, the distance to the endpoint of the possible vapor cloud explosion is 0.14 miles.  The accidental release would affect a population of 10 people.\n\nThe general accidental release program and chemical-specific prevention steps:\n\nThis facility complies with the EPA's accident prevention rule and all applicable state and local codes and regulations.  The propane system is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with NFPA-58 and state laws.\n\nFive year accident history:   \n\nWe have never had an accident involving propane that caused deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, or shelterings in place.\n\nThe emergency response"
