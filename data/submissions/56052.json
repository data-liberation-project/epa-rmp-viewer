Under the worse-case scenario release, it was found that the endpoint distance was 0.2 miles using EPA RMP*Comp software modeling.  The nearest industrial public receptor is the ArcelorMittal USA Plate Mill at 0.31 miles from the source facility.  The nearest residential public receptor is the City of Gary, Indiana at 0.85 miles from the source facility.\n\nBased on this modeling, this source facility falls under Program 1 in accordance with 40 CFR 68.10(b)(2).  Additionally, the source facility has not had any accidental releases of a regulated substance that has caused any offsite impacts or exposures and has emergency response procedures coordinated with local emergency planning and response organizations in accordance with 40 CFR 68.10(b)(2) and 40 CFR 68.10(b)(3).\n\nThe facility maintains all documentation in support of this analysis in accordance with 40 CFR 68.39(a).\n\nThis facility is no longer designated as a Program 2/3 facility and will now comply with the requirements of Program 1 accordingly."
