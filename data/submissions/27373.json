Facility Policy. \n\n     The owners, management and employees of Iowa Double Circle (Stockport) are\n     committed to providing a safe workplace free of accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia and\n     propane.  Health, safety, and environmental compliance are a fundamental part of every employee's\n     job.  It is facility protocol to adhere to applicable Federal, State, and local laws and to implement\n     appropriate controls to prevent accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia and propane.  If an\n     accidental release were to occur, the facility would respond in accordance with its Emergency Action\n     Plan and is prepared to work with local fire department, the Local Emergency Planning Committee\n     and other authorities to control and mitigate the release and minimize the impact of the release\n     to employees, the environment, and general public.\n\n2.  Facility Information.\n\n     The primary activity at the facility is the storage and handling of fertilizers for direct sale to\n     farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application.  Anhydrous\n     ammonia is stored in two storage tanks of 18,000 gal and 26,000 gal.  These tanks are located in\n     the Northeast corner of the facility.  Anhydrous Ammonia is also stored in Thirty-1000 gal wagons\n     and six-1450 gal wagons.  These wagons are stored next to the storage tanks.  The maximum\n     quantity of Anhydrous ammonia would be 363,000 pounds.  Propane is stored in one 18,000 gal\n     storage tank also located in the Northeast corner of the facility.  The maximum quantity of propane\n     would be 56,600 pounds.  The maximum fill level of each tank is 85% of the total capacity, which\n     is controlled by a liquid level guage.\n\n3.  Worst-Case Scenario and Alternate Release Scenario.\n\n     a.

The distance to the end point (point of dispersion to\n             200 parts per millon, or ppm) is 2.4 miles.\n\n             Propane - The maximum quantity released would be 56,600 pounds.  The distance\n             to the end point (point of 1 psi overpressure) is 0.3 miles.\n\n     b.     The alternate release scenerio, based on the five-year accident history (or the most\n             likely potential incident), is as follows:\n\n             Anhydrous Ammonia - The alternate release scenario is a release from a break in a \n             3 - inch transfer hose followed by release of ammonia for 2 minutes before\n             automatic or manual shut-off intervenes and stops the flow of ammonia.  The\n             maximum quantity released would be 26,600 pounds.  The distance to the\n             endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 1.6 miles.\n\n             Propane - The alternate release from hose rupture caused by a pull-away and\n             assumes a 25 - foot length of 4-inch transfer hose.  The active mitigation devices\n             are assumed to function as designed, limiting the release to the contents of the\n             hose.  The maximum quanitity released would be 69 pounds.  The distance to the\n             end point (point of 1 psi overpressure) is 0.03 miles, or 175 feet.\n\n\n\n\n4.  Accidental Release Prevention Program.\n\n     1) Safety Information: The facility was designed and constructed in accordance with applicable\n     Federal and State of Iowa requlations.

The reviews identify the opportunity\n     for equipment malfunctions or human errors that could cause an accidental release, the safeguards\n     used to control hazards and prevent releases, and the steps used to detect or monitor releases.\n     The results of the reviews are documented and porblems identified are addressed in a timely manner.\n\n     3) Operating Procedures: The facility maintains written procedures for the handling and storage of\n     anhydrous ammonia and propane.  The procedures generally follow the provisions of the Occupational\n     Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) standard, 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of\n     Anhydrous Ammonia\".

The written procedures are reviewed by facility\n     management on a regular basis and revised as necessary.\n\n     4) Training: All employees at the facility that handle anhydrous ammonia participate in a training\n     program.  Training of all employees consists of classroom type instruction (e.g. reading safety\n     information, operating procedures, response measures followed by a written test) and on-the-job\n     supervision.
