      "SummaryText": "Colonial Circuits, Inc. is committed to safety in all matters which concern both the workplace and the environment.  This is stated in several places within the company.  Our Quality Policy Statement states, in part, Internal manufacturing processes and procured products shall be environmentally safe.  Further, in Section 501 of our policy manual employees are specifically instructed as to the general safety rules for the plant which include the mandatory use of personal protective equipment where the application of such equipment is appropriate and prudent.  Section 502 of the policy manual describes the mandatory Hazard Communication training each employee will receive.  We have documented training programs for those who deal with dangerous materials, hazardous materials, and hazardous waste.  These training programs are mandatory for all who, in the course of their employment, participate in activities involving any or all of these materials.\nColonial Circuits, Inc. is a manufacturer of printed circuit boards.  There are numerous mechanical and chemical processes which take place during the manufacture of this product.  The chemical processes include several chemical cleaners, etchants, and electroplating operations.  Only one of these operations at Colonial Circuits, Inc. involve chemicals which meet or exceed the threshold limits found in 40 CFR Part 68 tables.  This process is etching of copper which is contained by burms and portable dikes to prevent liquid migration in the unlikely event of a spill. This material is stored in 55 gallon drums so the likelihood of a spill of all the material is remote but meets the definition of Worst Case Scenario.  Inventory control practices have been inplemented to keep this material under the threshold in the future.  We make every effort to use materials which contain little or no hazardous ingredients wherever possible.  Storage of hazardous materials is closely controlled by maintaining a JIT inventory system of raw"

      "SummaryText": "materials and restricting the amount of any hazardous waste on hand at any time.  In a Worst Case Scenario no hazardous or regulated materials would be released into the environment as a ground water contaminant due to the facility's floor capacity being able to contain the contents.  This facility has no floor drains so all spills would have to be processed through the waste water pretreatment system.  In the chemical waste storage area the storms drains have been sealed with valves to capture any potential spills and prevent the material from entering the POTW system accidentally.  The amount of chemical waste on hand is monitored with weekly documentation to control the total volume.  This waste is also segregated for compatibility.  There are no processes which employ automated chemical feed or pumping which could potentially fail and create an environmentally unfavorable condition.  We maintain a written Emergency Response program which is entitiled Contingency plan for Hazardous Materials and Hazardous Waste Control in the Event of Accidental Release or Spillage.  This plan details the specific steps to be taken during any spill or potential emergency situation and is on file with the Stafford County LEPC.  Proudly, in the past 5 years there have been no accidental releases, accidents, or injuries at Colonial Circuits.  Also, Colonial Circuits has been inspected 3 times in the past 4 years by the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality, Division of Hazardous Waste Management and received no notices, violations, or corrective actions.  A complete description of our potential to emit has been filed with the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality, Fredericksburg satellite office of the Air Quality division.  We fall well below any thresholds of potential to emit to the air.  Colonial Circuits, Inc. poses a minimal and managable Worst Case Scenario threat to the environment and will continue, as a matter of policy, to strive to use environmentally"
