The facility is a distribution center for laboratory equipment and laboratory-grade chemicals.  The facility is regulated under 40 CFR Part 68 due to onsite storage of chloroform and ethyl ether.  The one (1) regulated process at the facility is the storage of chemicals.  A review of numerous inventory data indicated that the facility had approximately 14,630 pounds of ethyl ether; and 32,705 pounds of chloroform in storage.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps:  The facility has instituted procedures for the packing and labeling of chemicals to prevent releases.  In addition, new employees are trained on release procedures during new employee orientation.  Remaining employees receive refresher training on release procedures annually during emergency evacuation procedures and drill training.  In addition, members of facility?s emergency response team also receive annual refresher training per the requirements of 29 CFR 1910.120.\n\nFive-Year Accident History:  The facility has had no RMP-reportable accidents or releases of ethyl ether or chloroform within the past five years.\n\nEmergency Response Program:  The facility has instituted a facility emergency response team consisting of employees from various shifts.  The team has received training as described in 29 CFR 1910.120.  The facility has contracted with R-3 Environmental Services to provide assistance in the event of a r"

In addition, the facility has coordinated response efforts with the Bloomingdale Fire Department and established a notification mechanism to ensure that the Department will be properly notified when response is required for a release.  The facility has submitted copies of its SARA 302, 311, and 312 reports to the Department.  The facility is subject to emergency response plan requirements including 29 CFR 1910.138 and 1910.120.  In addition, the facility is subject to the preparedness and prevention requirements of 40 CFR 265 Subpart C since the facility is a small quantity generator of hazardous waste.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:  Periodic reviews of the program, training, and maintenance procedures are conducted to ensure that any necessary and appropriate changes are made to maintain and improve safety."
