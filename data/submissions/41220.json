Butch Roecker\nFacility Telephone:  (361) 528-2528\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Protocols:  The owners, management and employees of the Taft facility are committed to providing a safe workplace free of accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  Health, safety and environmental compliance are a fundamental part of every employee's job.  It is facility protocol to adhere to applicable Federal, State and local laws and to implement appropriate controls to prevent accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release were to occur, the facility would respond in accordance with its Emergency Action Plan and is prepared to work with the local fire department, the Local Emergency Planning Committee and other authorities to control and mitigate the release and minimize the impact of the release to employees, the environment and the general public.\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled:  The primary activity at this facility (the stationary source) is the storage and handling of fertilizers for direct retail sale to farmers.  The facility does not store anhydrous ammonia for customer use.  Once a year the facility brings in a contractor with a portable reactor to manufacture liquid fertilizer (10-34-0).  The contractor is Equalizer Incorporated out of Waco, Texas.  The liquid fertilizer is manufactured by combining anhydrous ammonia, super phosphoric acid and water in a converter reactor.  The anhydrous ammonia and acid are delivered to the facility in railcars.  The facility may have up to six (6) railcars containing anhydrous ammonia at the facility at one time.  The maximum fill level of each railcar is 85% of the total tank capacity, which is controlled by a liquid level gauge.  The maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia stored at this facility would be approximately 960,000 pounds and would occur when there are six fully loaded railcars.\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario and"

      "SummaryText": "Alternative Release Scenario:  The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of an 80 ton railcar.  The maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia released would be approximately 160,000 pounds released in a gaseous form over ten (10) minutes.  The resulting distance to the toxic endpoint concentration extends offsite and public receptors are within the distance to the endpoint.  The distance to the toxic endpoint concentration (0.14 mg/L) is 1.22 miles.  There was one (1) administrative control considered in this scenario; which is, the railcar is not filled more than 85% full.  There were no passive mitigation measures considered in this scenario.\n\nThe alternative release scenario involves a release of anhydrous ammonia from a break/rupture in a two (2) inch hose during transfer of ammonia from a railcar to the portable reactor.  The quantity of anhydrous ammonia released in a gaseous form would be approximately 12,000 pounds, which is based on a release rate of approximately 6000 pounds per minute over a two (2) minute time period.  The resulting distance to the toxic endpoint concentration extends offsite and public receptors are within the distance to the endpoint.  The distance to the toxic endpoint concentration (0.14 mg/L) is 0.56 miles.  There were no passive mitigation measures considered in this scenario.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps:  As described above, once a year the facility brings in a contractor with a portable reactor to manufacture liquid fertilizer (10-34-0).  The contractor is Equalizer Incorporated out of Waco, Texas.  Approximatley once a year, facility personnel check with the contractor to get a verbal report from the contractor on their compliance with EPA's accidental release prevention requirements and applicable State and local codes and regulations.  \n\nFive-Year Accident History:  There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past fiv"

Facility employees will not respond to accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia except for those that are small or incidental, can be controlled at the time of the release by employees in the immediate release area (e.g., shutting a valve) and do not appear to pose an immediate safety or health hazard.  This protocol has been discussed with the local fire department and the other emergency responders and the facility has appropriate mechanisms in place to notify the emergency responders when there is a need for a response.  The facility is also included in the written community emergency response plan developed under the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA).\n \nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:  There are no specific anhydrous ammonia safety changes planned at this time.  However, safety improvement is an on-going process at this facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the safety of equipment and procedures."
