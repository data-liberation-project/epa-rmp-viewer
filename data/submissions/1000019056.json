      "SummaryText": "The Town of Pittsboro owns and operates a water treatment plant on the Haw River in Pittsboro, NC.  The plant is a conventional treatment plant with a capacity of 2 mgd.  The primary disinfectant is chlorine gas that is stored in 2000 pound cylinders.  Up to two (2) full cylinders and one (1) nearly empty cylinder may be on-site at any one time; therefore, it is conservatively estimated that a maximum of 5000 pounds of chlorine may be stored on-site at any one time.  Because this quantity exceeds 2500 pounds, this Risk Management Plan (RMP) was originally prepared in 2005 and revised in October 2010 to facilitate current conditions.  In addition to the RMP, the Water Plant is subject to the OSHA PSM rule.\n\nSafety at the Water Plant is administered at the top by the Town's Pittsboro Safety Committee.  This committee meets monthly to review safety issues related to the Town's facilities, including the Water Plant.  \n\nThe Plant operates a chlorine feed system with automatic switchover gas chlorinators and feed piping.  The Plant also has chlorine gas detectors in its Chlorine Storage Building and Chlorine Feed Room to monitor chlorine levels.  If chlorine levels at either room exceed 1 ppm, a visual and auditory alarm sounds at the site prompting further actions.\n\nThe Town and the Plant have had no accidents in the last five (5) years, demonstrating their combined commitment to employee and public safety.\n\nThe Plant is required by EPCRA to coordinate with the Chatham County LEPC and local emergency authorities on its use of chlorine.  The Plant has informed the Chatham County LEPC of the chlorine on-site.\n\nThe Plant is focused on safety and will continue to assess its processes and equipment for additional upgrades to its chlorine safety.  Any potential upgrades are part of the on-going commitment to site and public safety at the Town of Pittsboro Water Plant.\n"
