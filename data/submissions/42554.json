      "SummaryText": "Introduction\nThe Town of Culpeper operates a Water Pollution Control Facility (WPCF) for treatment of wastewater via chlorination followed by dechlorination (sulfonation) prior to discharge under an operations permit and a Water Treatment Facility (WTF) for treatment of raw water for consumption. Both the WPCF and WTF must comply with the Program 3 Risk Management Program (RMP), under Section 112[r] of the Clean Air Act.  Chlorine and sulfur dioxide are managed in one-ton cylinders in total quantities that exceed threshold limits established under the RMP rule.  \n\nChemical Processes and Safety Equipment\nWater Treatment Facility\nThe Town of Culpeper uses a vacuum system for dispensing chlorine.  The chlorine gas is under vacuum from the switchover-type vacuum regulators mounted on the chlorine ton containers.  The regulators control the flow of chlorine gas and automatically switch to a new gas supply when the online gas supply runs out.  Chorine gas is fed to the raw water supply via three chlorinators.  The amount of chlorine gas dispensed is also monitored via Chlor-scale model 12D80 hydraulic load cell scales.\n\nThe chlorine ton containers are stored in the Chlorine Storage room.  The Chlorine Storage room is equipped with fume exhaust fans and fresh air louvers.  Additionally, the Chlorine Storage room and the Chlorinator Room are both equipped with dual concentration alarms.  Battery back up is provided.  Employees are supplied with ten-minute emergency air bags in the event of a chlorine leak.\n\nWater Pollution Control Facility\nThe Town of Culpeper uses rotometers and throttling ball check valves on each chlorinator to match chlorine dosing to flow demands via a solution fed vacuum chlorination system.  Chlorine gas is stored in 1-ton cylinders located in the Chlorine Storage room. The Chlorinator Room is equipped with dual concentration alarms.  Employees are supplied with ten-minute emergency air bags in the event of a chlorine leak.\n\nSulfur dioxide is used to"

The sulfur dioxide is stored in 1-ton cylinders in the sulfur dioxide storage room.  The sulfur dioxide storage room is equipped with dual concentration alarms, fume exhaust fans, and fresh air louvers.  Employees are supplied with ten-minute emergency air bags in the event of a sulfur dioxide leak.\n\nPrevention Plan\nThe primary component of the RMP is a detailed Program 3 Prevention Plan, which is derived from the Operations and Maintenance Manual (O&M), inclusive of Standard Operating Procedures (SOP).  The Prevention Plan was designed to limit to the extent possible the potential for an accidental release based upon the following key elements:\n\n?    Employment of experienced and highly trained personnel\n?    Continued training of personnel\n?    Use of state-of-the-art process and safety equipment\n?    Use of accurate and effective operating procedures, written with the participation of the operators\n?    Performance of a hazard review of equipment and procedures\n?    Management of change procedures\n?    Preventative maintenance/mechanical integrity program\n?    Implementation of an auditing and inspection program\n?    Incident investigation\n?    Contractor awareness and hot work permit program\n\nEmergency Response Program\nThe Town of Culpeper involved the local emergency response council in the preparation of the RMP in order to optimize response to potential major releases, and optimize release prevention by the facility operators.  Additionally, an emergency response program has been prepared for each facility which outlines the procedures and lines of communication that are necessary to effectively respond to and mitigate a potential chemical release.  \n\nThe facilities? emergency response program includes procedures for notifying the local hazardous materials (HAZMAT) teams of the incident and procedures for evacuating the fac"

      "SummaryText": "ility.  Currently, the responding HAZMAT team is the City of Fredericksburg Fire Department.\n\nFive-Year Accident History\nOn June 14, 2003, a sulfur dioxide alarm alerted the Town of Culpeper Water Pollution Control Facility operators of a leak from a 1-ton cylinder of sulfur dioxide located in the sulfur dioxide storage room.  The leak was perceived by the plant operators to be severe enough to warrant a call to the local HAZMAT response team in Fredericksburg.  The responding HAZMAT team successfully stopped the leak and scale readings indicated that less than 15 pounds of sulfur dioxide had escaped.  The resulting investigation concluded that the valve stem connecting the cylinder to the regulator valve was improperly threaded and was responsible for the leak.  The aforementioned valve stem is supplied with the sulfur dioxide cylinder from the chemical supply company and is not an inventoried, maintained or inspected part of the Town of Culpeper?s dechlorination process equipment.  As a result of the investigation, the Town of Culpeper Water Pollution Control Facility staff now inspects the valve stem/cylinder connection received from the chemical supply company prior to installation."
