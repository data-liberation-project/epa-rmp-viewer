      "SummaryText": "Premium Standard Farms operates a pork processing facility near the northeast corner of Milan, Missouri.  The facility is located at the northwest corner of the intersection of Highway 5 and Highway 6, and has been at this location for approximately 9 years.  The nature of the business involves swine slaughter and processing of pork products for commercial distribution.  The Milan pork processing facility has very few hazardous or toxic chemicals on site.  Our facility's refrigeration system uses approximately 214,000 pounds of ammonia as refrigerant.  The High Pressure Receiver vessel V1, located outside the northwest wall of the main facility structure, holds the greatest amount of ammonia.  This receiver can hold as much as 43,300 pounds of ammonia, based on maximum high level controls in the vessel.\n\nPremium Standard Farms is committed to maintaining our ammonia equipment in safe condition, and to providing our personnel with training in safe operating procedures.  This facility has never had an accidental release of ammonia from our facility which resulted in adverse health effects to the public or to our employees, or to property damage.\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nOur Plant Vice President of Operations, our Plant Manager, and all our employees, are dedicated to maintaining our ammonia refrigerant system in a safe manner.  We have clear lines of authority and responsibility with respect to all aspects of our release prevention program, leading directly to the Plant Vice President of Operations.  We maintain current safety information on ammonia and our ammonia refrigeration equipment, and review any potential hazards that may be associated with the storage and potential use of ammonia at our facility.  \n\nWe train both our operating and maintenance personnel, in our procedures and safe practices.  New employees are trained before being allowed to work without close supervision, and periodic refresher training is provided to all employees."

      "SummaryText": "Any time significant changes occur in equipment or processes which could potentially impact the storage or use of ammonia, affected employees are retrained.  We inspect and audit our facility, using both in-house staff and trained professionals from outside our company.\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE\n\nBecause ammonia is a toxic substance above EPA\u00bfs CAA Risk Management Program threshold quantity, the PSF Milan pork processing facility is required to 1) develop an emergency response program including a written emergency response plan; or 2) coordinate response actions with the Milan, Missouri Fire Department.\n\nThe Milan facility has developed a written emergency response plan.  The plan designates incident commanders, an administrative assistant responsible for contacting outside agencies at the direction of the incident commander, two health professionals, and a 20 person emergency response/hazmat team.  The facility has officially coordinated emergency response planning with the Sullivan County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  Included in the emergency response plan are a list of emergency response equipment locations, guidance on coordination with outside agencies, emergency phone numbers, and response team training requirements."
