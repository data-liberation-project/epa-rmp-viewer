The TSDF may be subject to these provisions because it is possible that the threshold quantity of a regulated toxic liquid may be present in greater than the threshold quantity.  Under most circumstances Clean Harbors' records indicate that regulated substances are present in concentrations below 1% and/or in less than the threshold quantities specified in the ARP regulation.  This Risk Management Plan (RMP), which is prepared under the EPA's predictive filing provisions has been developed in accordance with the requirements specified under 40 CFR Part 68, Subpart G.  The RMP certifies that Clean Harbors of Braintree, Inc. has instituted a Risk Management Program that is in compliance with U.S. EPA ARP requirements. \n\nThis is a predictive filing only since there is a potential for the chemicals described below to be present at the facility on occasion.  The chemicals are not routinely stored at the facility in quantities exceeding the threshold and planning quantities.  Cooperating local response agencies are informed of the actual facility inventories upon request.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICIES \n\nClean Harbors of Braintree, Inc. (CHBI) operates a hazardous waste treatment storage and disposal facility (TSDF) in accordance with a RCRA hazardous waste license issued by the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection.  CHBI strives to conduct its business and operations in strict conformity with all applicable laws, and in a safe and responsible manner.

The CHBI facility is designed, constructed, inspected, maintained and operated in a manner so as to minimize the risk of exposure to employees and the public to hazardous materials managed at the site, and in conformity with all governmental regulations.\n\nCHBI has a comprehensive inspection plan which requires daily, weekly, monthly, and annual inspections of its processes, equipment and management practices.\n\nCHBI has a Contingency Plan which prescribes procedures to be followed in the event of a fire or release at the facility.  The Contingency Plan includes procedures for notifying local, state and federal emergency response officials of incidents, and specifies arrangements which are made with emergency responders to ensure an effective response in the event of an emergency.\n\nCHBI has a training plan which ensures that each employee receives the training necessary to enable him/her to safely and effectively carry out their job responsibilities.  Included in the facility training plan are training modules which instruct employees on the hazards of the regulated substances stored at the site, the procedures for evacuation from the facility, procedures for responding to releases, and procedures for notification of incidents to both facility personnel and offsite emergency responders.  In addition to the initial training that all employees receive, each employee receives refresher training on an annual basis.\n\nRisk Management System \n\nClean Harbors has developed a management system to implement and maintain compliance with the Accidental Release Prevention (ARP) and related chemical safety and emergency response programs.  This management system identifies lines of responsibility for the entire program and each of its key elements.  \n\nClean Harbors of Braintree, Inc. Management Program Responsibilities\n\n1.

Emergency Response Program\nFacility Compliance Manager\n\nThe Clean Harbors RMP tracking program minimizes risk to the facility and its neighbors by periodically checking inventories of RMP chemicals to keep quantities on hand as low as possible.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE FACILITY AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nCHBI receives, temporarily stores, blends, and ships materials that are classified as hazardous waste under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA).  A review of the records over the past several years indicate that portions of the waste streams may contain greater than one percent of one or more substances regulated under ARP.  Maximum potential quantities stored of RMP-regulated chemicals will be under RMP thresholds, except for Hydrogen Fluoride (50%) and Nitric Acid (80%), both toxic liquids.\n\nSeveral classes of substances (including methyltrichlorosilane, phosphorous oxychloride, and phosphorous trichloride) are not processed at CHBI but, rather, are transshipped to other TSDF's. These wastes are considered to be in shipping and are handled in accordance with a number of applicable U.S. Department of Transportation regulations.  \n\nThis is a predictive filing, no regulated toxic or flammable gases are present routinely above threshold quantities at the site.  Wastes that may contain more than 1% of any of these regulated substances would be transported to the facility via either enclosed van trucks in 55-gallon drums or smaller containers, or in bulk transport vehicles.  These wastes may be temporarily stored on-site and then blended with other similarly classified waste streams or they may be directly transferred to other TSDF's for processing.  Flammable and toxic wastes are stored in separate areas.\n\nFlammable wastes are pumped from the drums and blended into larger tanks that contain  mixtures that have a N"

Therefore, once a regulated flammable substance is pumped into a storage tank it is no longer subject to ARP.  \n\nToxic substances that are processed are temporarily stored and then pumped into storage vessels. The storage vessels are insulated and surrounded by a dike to confine spills. \n\nThe EPA risk management regulation identifies three levels of requirements.  Program 2 applies to CHBI,  The activities conducted at CHBI are not listed among the 9 NAICS codes in the regulation, nor is CHBI subject to OSHA's Process Safety Management program.  OSHA has interpreted warehousing/drum storage in excess of threshold quantities (TQ) of highly hazardous chemicals (HHCs) listed in Appendix A of the PSM standard as a covered process.  However, CHBI segregates HHCs such that they are separate processes and no single storage area (i.e., process) exceeds the TQ.  According to OSHA\u00bfs LOI, such segregated storage areas are exempted from PSM requirements.  (Source:  2/1/02 OSHA letter to J&H Marsh & McLennan Risk Control Consulting.)\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM/CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nClean Harbors has procedures in place to prevent and mitigate potential releases of toxic and flammable substances.  These procedures are detailed in CHBI's RCRA Part B hazardous waste license.  The procedures may include, but are not limited to the following:\n\n* An inspection program which requires daily, weekly, monthly and annual inspections of process equipment, alarm systems, and management practices, with a procedure for documenting and correcting any deficiencies identified in inspections.\n\n* A standard operating procedure for the transfer of flammable and combustible liquids.\n\n* A standard operating procedure for ensuring that incompatible materials are not consolidated together.\n\n* A waste analysis plan which ensures that the waste received by CHBI conforms to the waste as initially represented by each generator, and that each waste st"
