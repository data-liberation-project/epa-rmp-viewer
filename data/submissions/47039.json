      "SummaryText": "The City of El Reno Water Treatment Plant is located on the north edge of the city of El Reno approximately 1/3 of a mile from the start of a major population area.  As of this date we have had no major leaks or leaks requiring a notification of a populated area.  However, if such a leak were to occur, we have implemented a response procedure which is currently being introduced to the operators that are working within the treatment plant.  In all aspects of this procedure, we are working hand in hand with the local fire department.  Currently the only chemical that we have in operation and storage is chlorine gas in 1 ton cylinders.  This means that at one given time we could have 6,000 lbs of chlorine on site.  Due to the change in the distributor who we purchase from, we have to keep this amount on hand due to delivery time and distance.  These cylinders are located in a central area within the plant facility, not within a building.  In the event of a worst case scenario, the area to the south of the plant would receive the worst impact.  However with the location of four mile creek, this would create a pit area where most of the chlorine gas would stay creating a barrier restricting the gas from entering the populated area of the north edge of the city.  This would also give emergency personnel extra time to warn the public and evacuate the areas if needed.  To the north, east and west of the plant there is rural area with little or no population.  All of these areas are located and marked on our emergency response map located at the water treatment plant, city hall, the fire station and police station.  In the event of a chlorine gas leak the operator is instructed to follow the chain of notification sheet.  After he has put on appropriate safety equipment and cleared the area if needed.  We have installed cordless phones through out the treatment plant so operators can leave the area and still maintain contact with emergency response personnel.  The operator on"

This training is an ongoing process that is being conducted in everyday hands on experience and through ongoing training during monthly safety meeting being conducted at the treatment plant.  The operators also have access to accident report forms that they will be required to fill out in the event of any size chlorine leak.  These will be kept on file at the water treatment plant.  To improve safety conditions at the water plant and the area plans are being made to increase training to the operators, increased monitoring equipment and a more accurate set of reporting, accident and training records."
