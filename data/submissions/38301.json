This program was adopted in June 2004 based on the Hazards Assessment.  Previously it had a Level 1 program.  The PSM program has been in place and effectively used for many years.  It is part of the plants operating culture.  There are two parts to the RMP/PSM program.  The first is the general overall water division wide program and the Water Treatment Plant site program.  The second is the chlorine-specific actions within the site program.  This is coordinated with the Orange County Fire/Rescue Department (including the Haz Mat Team) and the Regional LEPC.\n3.1.\tGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM   (D) (1)\nPlant-wide, many elements of the prevention program are used for all operations.  An overview of the generally written programs is listed below:\nThe City of Cocoa has detailed process safety information on each of its operations. \nThe document maintenance system is integral to the management of change for all operations on site control.  \nTraining is the backbone of employee knowledge, job operations and is ongoing in each area.

Plus, City of Cocoa demands training of contractors to our standards. \n3.2.\tCHLORINE SPECIFIC RESPONSE PROGRAM (D) (2)\n3.2.1.\tChlorine-Specific Operating Safety Information\nChemical-specific prevention features of the plant include: the policies and procedures listed above and those of the chlorine specific program.  These include:\n\u00bf\tSpecific procedures for the management of the chlorine process. \n\u00bf\tCompletion of a Pre-startup Safety Review prior to startup of the modified chlorine system.   \n\u00bf\tSpecific emergency response procedures for chlorine releases as outlined below under both operating procedures and in the emergency response procedures.

The plant and support equipment of the chlorine storage building and adjacent control room meet and exceed design codes standards and good engineering practices.  The storage and contro"

      "SummaryText": "l building room is equipped with forced ventilation system.  There is a chlorine area monitor inside the storage building.  If chlorine is detected, the monitor alarms and shuts down the forced air ventilation system.  It also starts the building chlorine vent fume scrubber.  The scrubber is capable of neutralizing over 2000 pounds of chlorine.  The control room also has a chlorine monitor.  Both monitors alarm in their local area as well as in the water plant control room. \n3.2.3.\tEquipment Design\nThere are two types of chlorine pipe systems, high pressure and low (vacuum) pressure.  The high pressure chlorine piping system is made of chlorine compatible steel pipes, copper tubes or equipment.  These materials are steel, copper or chlorine compatible non-metallic compound (not corroded by chlorine) rated to 500 psig.  The maximum pressure of the chlorine in the high pressure system is only 150 psig giving a 3 to 1 safety factor.  There are two sets of six tom containers on each high pressure line.  Each leads to an automatic switch over a vacuum pressure regulator. One bank is in service and the other is on standby. \nThe low pressure system operates under a vacuum pressure of 13 inches of mercury.  There is a pressure relief valve which vents if the pressure in the line reaches above atmospheric pressure.  All the pipe, tubes, and equipment are also chlorine compatible.  The system is designed to 150 psig or complete vacuum giving it a large safety factor over the typical vacuum or positive pressure in it.  There is a chlorine monitor which detects the presence of chlorine in the ton storage area and a second monitor in the chlorine control room. \n4.\tFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY (E)\n4.1.\tDATE OF INCIDENT: \nBetween Friday, June 7, 2002 late afternoon and Monday, June 10, 2002. \n4.2.\tTIME DISCOVERED: \nApproximately 8:00 am Monday June 10, 2002.\n4.3.\tDESCRIPTION OF INCIDENT:\n It appears the flexible connection (whip) may have been exposed to moisture either internal or"

When the flexible connection failed, the contents of the containers were released to the atmosphere.  Inspection of the connector and the valve indicate signs of a slight leak at the connection.  It is uncertain if this was the cause of the leak or a result after the failure of the flexible connector. \n4.4.\tPERTINENT INFORMATION:\nWorse case release could have been as much as 3,075 pounds.  Best case release assuming the scrubber neutralized 2,000 pounds would be 1,075 pounds of chlorine released.  It is believed the chlorine system continued to feed chlorine gas, as there was no noticeable drop in chlorine residual in the raw water. \n4.5.\tCAUSE OF RELEASE: \nMoisture internal to the flexible connector or external moisture combined with chlorine gas accelerated the rate of corrosion, causing flexible connector to fail.  \n4.6.\tCORRECTIVE ACTIONS:\n First step was to secure the site and insure the chlorine containers were not posing additional risks.  Site was remediated and minor repairs were made. \nAlarm indication will be hooked up through SCADA to the DYAL Plant.  Tags for the flexible connectors will be used to indicate when the connectors were placed into service.  The flexible connectors will be changed out every three months.\n4.7.\tCONCLUSIONS:\nThe chlorine release plume traveled south west of the chlorine building, across dirt road, across ditch and into a piney palmetto scrub wooded area, Evidence of the plume traveled approximately 500 yards long and approximately 100 yards wide, at the widest point.  There were no injuries to human or wild life.  Damage inside of the building was moderate to heavy; most damage was to chlorine feed related equipment. \n5.\tEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM (F)\nEmergency response procedures contain both the Citywide and Plant Emergency Response Policy.  Both are coordinated with the Orange County Contingency Plan (Emergency Response Plan)."

The Plant also has site specific emergency actions defined in the plants operating procedures.  Emergency operation and response procedures are also reviewed annually.\nThe emergency response program (contingency plan) is coordinated (reviewed by) with the water plant Safety Committee, the County Police Department. The Water Plant and Fire Department coordinates with Local Orange County Emergency Response Planning Committee (LEPC) and the Orange County HazMat Team.  All are located in Orange County, Florida.  Copies of the program are given to key local agencies including: fire, medical, rescue, management, and police departments.  Besides the specific emergency response program, key elements of the prevention programs are incorporated in the operating culture of the City water plant.\nThe Contingency Plan procedures detail the actions and responses to chlorine spills (releases).  The plan includes training of all chlorine-area operators. The primary response team includes the Orange County Fire and Rescue, and county Haz Mat Teams.  All of these respond to severe chlorine leak situations.  Actions include catastrophic, severe, and moderate leaks.  A Chlorine \u00bfB\u00bf Leak Repair Kit is maintained at the chlorine storage area to aid in stopping leaks.  Public notification is facilitated through the County Police and Sheriff\u00bfs Office, which has an automated emergency dialing message system for public notification.\n6.\tPERSONNEL (F) (1)\nPersonnel are the key resource of the City of Cocoa\u00bfs prevention program.

      "SummaryText": "(G)\nChanges to improve safety (recommended actions) were identified in the internal safety HazOp, tour, accident investigation review, and audit of the RMP program to meet requirements of the Risk Management Prevention Program.  These recommended actions have now been evaluated and implemented as required.  An Audit was conducted to review the RMP program.  The key safety action items were completed.  The City of Cocoa continually reviews implemented operating procedures for potential safety improvements for all of its operations.  Currently, the City of Cocoa management team and process safety team are reviewing potential upgrades to the existing design of the chlorine operations to make the system even safer to prevent a release and minimize consequences in the event of a release of chlorine.\nThe City of Cocoa Water Treatment Plant recently compiled the EPA required Vulnerability Assessment.  Recommendations from the VA Report improve site security and safety over all including that of the chlorine system."

The City of Cocoa chlorine process was installed as part of the process of purifying water for public consumption.  It operates under permit from the State of Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FL DEP).  The chlorine is received, stored and distributed to 6 process control systems. \nChlorine is an EPA and OSHA-listed toxic chemical.  It is an irritant and it is corrosive.  Chlorine is a halogen with the formula Cl2.  It is a chlorinating or oxidizing agent that is not flammable.  It has a 1 ppm OSHA ceiling Permissible Exposure Limit (PEL) and a NFPA health rating of 4, severe; with immediate and delayed health hazards.  Chlorine is not a carcinogen.\nThe maximum threshold quantity stored on site is 48 one ton containers.  This equals 96,000 pounds.\n2.\tHAZARD ASSESSMENT\nA hazard assessment was performed in 1999 and in June 2004 to determine the effects a release would have on the public. Based on the 2004 assessment the City of Cocoa is changing the level of the Wewahootee Water Plant from Level 1 to Level 3 based on environmental receptors. For chlorine, the distance a set endpoint concentration of the gas would travel must be determined.  In addition, an estimate of the population that could be affected by a release of chlorine was determined, and sensitive receptors such as hospitals, schools, and nursing homes were researched. The hazard assessment considers two release scenarios-a worst case and an alternative case and also compiles the five-year accident history for the WTP chlorine system (see section 4 below: five year accident history).\nTwo offsite consequence analyses were conducted which include two chlorine release scenarios.  The first is a \u00bfworst case release\u00bf.  The second is a more probable \u00bfalternative release scenario\u00bf.  The first scenario is defined by EPA, which states that \u00bfthe operator shall assume that the maximum quantity in the largest vessel is released as a g"

This plant is one of two water plants operated by the City.  The Wewahootee water plant and the Claude H. Dyal water plant have quantities of regulated hazardous chemicals above the EPA threshold.  The City has a unified Risk Management Program which applies to each plant.  Only the Wewahootee Water Treatment Plant operations and policies are presented in this Plan. Note until June 21, 2004, Wewahootee was classified as a Level 1 RMP program.  The City changed the level based on the 2002 accidental release and new information about public receptors near the plant.\n1.1.\tACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION/EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES     (A)\nThe City of Cocoa Water Treatment Plant accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates technologies, procedures and management practices.  The plant prevention program complies with all applicable procedures of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) 40 CFR-68 Prevention Program under the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990.\n1.2.\tMANAGEMENT SYSTEMS (A) (1)\nThe City of Cocoa has a management system in place which is lead by the City Manager, who oversees the implementation and on-going use of the RMP elements.  This program, along with other City-wide and plant-specific policies, eliminates and /or reduces the likelihood of a hazardous chemical release at the plant.  An organizational chart defining the lines of authority and responsible staff is included in the plants RMP Process Safety Information.\n1.3.\tPREVENTION PROGRAM LEVEL 3 (A) (2)\nThe City of Cocoa maintains policies, procedures and systems"
