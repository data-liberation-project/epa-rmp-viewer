This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers such areas as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility, and it is the policy of Markwest to implement appropriate controls to prevent the possible release of regulated substances. Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, Markwest is completely coordinated with the Kanawha/Putnam Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC), which provides emergency response personnel to control and mitigate the effects of the release.\n\n2.\tThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substance Handled\n\nThe primary function of the Markwest facility encompasses natural gas liquid (NGL) extraction. NGL's and Propane are the two substances present at the facility regulated by Risk Management Plan (RMP) regulations.  NGL's, a flammable substance, are a mixture comprised of propane, normal butane, isobutane, and natural gasoline (pentanes and hexanes).  The NGL's are extracted from a natural gas transmission pipeline. Once extracted, the NGL is stored in five 30,000-gallon capacity pressure vessels (A07-A11). The NGL is then transferred via tank truck to a fractionation facility.\nPropane, used as a refrigerant in the process, is stored at the facility in one (2) 1,000-gallon capacity above ground pressure vessels. \nThe total quantity of product stored in the vessels is administratively controlled to ensure that the vessels are not filled above 80% of full capacity. Additionally, pressure relief devices provide added assurance that the vessels are not over-filled to pressures above 2"

      "SummaryText": "50 pounds per square inch (psi). These controls are in place to prevent the potential for over-pressurization which could cause structural damage to the vessels and lead to a release.\n\nBased on the administrative controls described above, the maximum inventory of NGL's present at the facility would be equal to 80% of the total 150,000-gallon capacity: 120,000 gallons (the equivalent of 508,092 pounds) of NGL. The maximum quantity of propane would be 7,611.4 lbs.\n\n3.\tThe Worst Case Release Scenario and Alternative Release Scenario\n\nThe parameters of the offsite consequence analysis for this MarkWest facility were based on the requirements set forth in the RMP rules outlines in 40 CFR 68.25 (e), Worst-case release scenario-flammable and 40 CFR 68.28, Alternative release scenario analysis.  The worst case and alternative case radii of effect were determined utilizing RMP Comp software provided by the EPA.\n\n4.\tThe General Accident Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention \n\tSteps\n\nMarkwest has taken all the necessary steps to comply with accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR Part 68 of the EPA regulations. The facility is subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard under 29 CFR 1910.119.\nThe following briefly describes the elements of the release prevention program in place at the Markwest stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nMarkwest maintains a detailed record of written safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters, and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nMarkwest conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that the hazards associated with the processes at the facility are identified and controlled efficiently. The HAZOP methodology is used to carry out these analyses. The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel in engineering and process operations and are revali"
