The Putnam Oswego - JT Skid, located in the Oswego gas field, is approximately 5.5 miles southeast of Putnam, OK, and approximately 9 miles northwest of Thomas, OK. Whiting has six employees assigned to the Putnam Oswego - JT Skid.\n\n\n\nThe primary RMP-related activities of the Putnam Oswego - JT Skid involve recovering natural gas liquids (NGL) through use of two Joules-Thompson (JT) valves that serve to chill a natural gas stream containing liquefiable hydrocarbons. Please note, at the time of the original RMP submission, the facility operated a JT-skid that is no longer in use. Rather, the JT valves, as described herein, operate in place of the JT-skid. A distillation process is used to purify the hydrocarbons that condense a result of the JT valve process. The NGL product contains butane, ethane, methane, pentane, and propane.\n\n\n\nThe chilling effect required to recover NGL is provided by using the cold liquid mixture of the incoming gas that is run through separators, JT valves, and a heat exchanger.\n\n\n\nThe Putnam Oswego - JT Skid is a RMP Program Level 1 facility.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICIES\n\n\n\nWhiting Oil and Gas Corporation's policy is to conduct its business in a manner that protects safety, health and the environment. Whiting's Corporate Emergency Preparedness and Response Policy involves assessing the hazards and risks of an unplanned incident, developing a plan for managing those hazards and risks, communicating relevant information to employees, contractors, and appropriate agencies, and conducting emergency exercises. \n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n\n\nWhiting Oil and Gas Corporation encourages employees to participate in all facets of hazard assessment, hazard elimination, and safe work practices. An example of employee participation is mandatory attendance of all safety meetings a"

Employees have access to all accident prevention programs via Whiting's Intranet website. \n\n\n\nThe Putnam Oswego - JT Skid keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes at the facility. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters, and specific chemical inventories and equipment designs basis/configuration information. Chemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs). \n\n\n\nFor the NGL extraction process, Whiting has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, pressure, level, and flow). Whiting ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, properly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\n\n\n\nThe Putnam Oswego - JT Skid has a comprehensive program to ensure hazards associated with the various facility processes are identified and controlled. Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and to ensure adequate controls are in place to manage identified hazards. \n\n\n\nThe Putnam Oswego - JT Skid maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations such as startup, normal shutdown, temporary operations, and emergency shutdown. Whiting has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operation of the facility's RMP processes. \n\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nThe Putman Oswego - JT Skid has had no releases from the RMP Covered processes in the previous five years. \n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\n\n\n\nThe Putnam Oswego - JT Skid employees receive annual training that serves to maintain worker and public safety and environmental quality. The annual training covers the following top"
