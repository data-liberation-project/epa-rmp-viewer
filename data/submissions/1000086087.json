Examples of the end products that are made with DPE materials include:\r\n\r\n- Coatings - from rainwear to liners for roofs and tanks,\r\n- Automotive products - from power steering pressure hoses to high performance timing belts,\r\n- Wire and cable insulation - from electrical wiring to nuclear power station cable, and\r\n- Industrial application - from microwave door enclosures to acid hoses.\r\n\r\nThe Environmental Protection Agency promulgated the Risk Management Plan (RMP) rule to comply with the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990.  RMP is a communication process designed to help the public, emergency responders and regulatory agencies understand the risks associated with certain types of facilities.  This executive summary, one of the requirements under the RMP, is provided in compliance with 40 CFR A\u00a7 68.15.\r\n\r\nAccidental Release and Emergency Response Policies\r\n\r\nThe DPE Pontchartrain Site is committed to operating and maintaining all the processes in a safe and responsible manner.  The site is committed to the safety and wellbeing of employees and the community.  Corporate and site's main goals are to prevent all accidental releases, process safety incidents and employee injuries.  Systems and procedures are in place to assure the safety of the working environment.  The progress against goals is constantly accessed and communicated to the employees.  Achievement of these goals is recognized and rewarded, while failure to attain them is regarded as unacceptable performance.\r\nThe emergency respon"

Examples of these include:\r\n\r\n- Automatic valves for rail cars, which isolate the supply of materials from the rail car in the event of a process upset; \r\n- Computer display and control of process parameters;\r\n- Interlocks to automatically shut down processes for certain process deviations;\r\n- Low concentration chlorine detectors that sound an alarm and provide an alarm signal to the computerized process control system when a leak is detected;\r\n- Emergency scrubber system to prevent emissions from reaching the environment; \r\n- Isolation valves which can be operated remotely from the process control system;\r\n- Deluge systems built into the process to quickly suppress chemical fumes or fires;\r\n- Check valves to prevent cross contamination of chemicals;\r\n- Fire prevention activities like electrical grounding, inerting flammables with nonflammable gases and hot work permitting; and\r\n- Operator surveillance during transfer of hazardous materials from shipping containers.\r\n\r\nFive Year Accident History\r\n\r\nRecords of all significant accidental chemical releases that occur are kept.  No off-site injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage has occurred involving materials and processes covered under the EPA's RMP rule during the last five years.  It should be noted that there was one chlorine related incident with on-site injury within the last five years. Details are included in Section 6 within this submittal.  \r\n\r\nEmergency Response Plan\r\n\r\nThe site has an Emergency Response Plan, which establishes procedures and responsibilities for the various functions involved in handling any plant emergency, either internal or external to this site.

Drills are conducted on a regular basis and are coordinated with the Local Emergency Planning Committee.\r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\r\nAs part of the site's process hazards review procedures, all of the processes are thoroughly studied on a periodic basis to identify risk reduction opportunities.  As a result of these studies, the site continues to implement a number of activities to help identify new risk reduction opportunities and maintain those already implemented. A few of those activities are:\r\n\r\n- Continue to improve the control of the process by installing better instrumentation, more automatic process shutdown interlocks, and upgraded computer control systems as replacements are needed;\r\n- Continue to perform preventive maintenance inspections and improve procedures;\r\n- Continue improvement of training programs; and \r\n- Continue conducting process safety audits to identify any deficiencies in the management systems.\r\n\r\nIt should be noted that our certifying official has changed since the last submittal. It should also be noted that some of the maximum intended inventories (section 1.17.c) have been updated and as noted above the Site recently experienced a chlorine release with on-site injury with details cited in Section 6 of this submittal."

The emergency response teams provide coverage 24 hours a day.  These employees are trained on how to handle emergency situations. \r\n\r\nThis document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that have been designed and implemented at this site, including:\r\n\r\n- A description of the facility and use of substances regulated by EPA's RMP regulation;\r\n- An overview of the accidental release prevention programs;\r\n- A five-year accident history for accidental releases of chemicals regulated by EPA's RMP rule;\r\n- An overview of the emergency response program;\r\n- An overview of planned improvements at the facility to help prevent accidental chemical releases from occurring and adversely affecting employees, the public, and the environment; and\r\n- The certification required by EPA's RMP rule.\r\n\r\nSite Identification and Regulated Substances\r\n\r\nDPE Pontchartrain Site operates on approximately 1,138 acres in Sections 90, 91, 92 and 93 of Township 115, Range 7 East in St. John the Baptist Parish, Louisiana, on property owned by DuPont.  Approximately 200 acres are used for actual manufacturing activities.  The site is located one mile west of LaPlace at 560 Highway 44 at approximately River Mile 136 on the Mississippi River.\r\n\r\nAt this site, DPE manufactures neoprene a synthetic rubber that has been produced for nearly 83 years; chloroprene, which is used as the raw material in the production of neoprene; and ACR (2,3-dichloro-1,3-butadiene) which is used as an additive in some types of neoprene.  Some of neoprene's end uses are: adhesives and sealant, power transmission belts and hoses for automobiles, and wire and cable jacketing.\r\n\r\nThis site uses the following chemicals listed under the RMP regulation: \r\n\r\nToxics\r\n\r\n- Chlorine\r\n- Nitrogen Tetroxide (Louisiana's list)\r\n\r\nFlammables\r\n\r\n- 1,3-B"

      "SummaryText": "utadiene\r\n- Pentane\r\n\r\nThe production areas covered at this site were divided in to four processes per guidance given by the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality during their March 2004 RMP inspection.  The first process is the portion of the neoprene process which uses nitrogen tetroxide to manufacture DIBN (diisobutylene nitrosate) an inhibitor in the manufacture of neoprene.   The process hazard analysis (PHA) information in Section 7 was obtained from PHA 17-351.  This PHA covers the portion of the neoprene process where nitrogen tetroxide is used.\r\n\r\nThe second process is the chloroprene process, which uses chlorine, pentane and 1,3-butadiene as raw materials.  The process hazard analyses (PHA) information in Section 7 was obtained from PHA 18-363.  While several PHAs cover this area of the plant, this is the most recent PHA completed for the portion of the process where one of these three chemicals are used and it covers chlorine process equipment.\r\n\r\nThe third process is the chlorine storage facilities.  Chlorine is used as one of the raw materials in the production of chloroprene.  It is received in tank cars and stored in five refrigerated bullets.   The process hazard analyses (PHA) information in Section 7 was obtained from PHA 18-363.\r\n\r\nThe fourth process is the butadiene railcar unloading facilities.  Butadiene is a raw material used in the manufacture of chloroprene.  Butadiene is received in railcars and unloaded into a storage sphere, from the sphere is fed into the process.  The process hazard analyses (PHA) information in Section 7 was obtained from PHA 11-328.  DPE does not utilize this unloading process anymore.  \r\n\r\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical - Specific Prevention Steps\r\n\r\nDPE takes a systematic, proactive approach to preventing accidental releases of hazardous chemicals.  The Process Safety Management (PSM) program follows OSHA's Guidelines and is directed toward preventing serious, process-related inci"
