The emergency response teams provide coverage 24 hours a day.  These employees are trained on how to handle emergency situations. \n\n\n\nThis document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that have been designed and implemented at this site, including:\n\n\n\n- A description of the facility and use of substances regulated by EPA's RMP regulation;\n\n- An overview of the accidental release prevention programs;\n\n- A five-year accident history for accidental releases of chemicals regulated by EPA's RMP rule;\n\n- An overview of the emergency response program;\n\n- An overview of planned improvements at the facility to help prevent accidental chemical releases from occurring and adversely affecting employees, the public, and the environment; and\n\n- The certification required by EPA's RMP rule.\n\n\n\nSite Identification and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nDPE Pontchartrain Site operates on approximately 1,138 acres in Sections 90, 91, 92 and 93 of Township 115, Range 7 East in St. John the Baptist Parish, Louisiana, on property owned by DuPont.  Approximately 200 acres are used for actual manufacturing activities.  The site is located one mile west of LaPlace at 560 Highway 44 at approximately River Mile 136 on the Mississippi River.\n\n\n\nAt this site, DPE manufactures neoprene a synthetic rubber that has been produced for nearly 83 years; chloroprene, which is used as the raw material in the production of neoprene; and ACR (2,3-dichloro-1,3-butadiene) which is used as an additive in some types of neoprene.  Some of neoprene's end uses are: adhesives and sealant, power transmission belts and hoses for automobiles, and wire and cable jacketing.\n\n\n\nThis site uses the following chemicals listed under the RMP regulation: \n\n\n\nToxics\n\n\n\n- Chlorine\n\n- Nitrogen Tetroxide (Louisiana's list)\n\n\n\nFlammables\n\n\n\n- 1,3-B"

The first process is the portion of the neoprene process which uses nitrogen tetroxide to manufacture DIBN (diisobutylene nitrosate) an inhibitor in the manufacture of neoprene.   The process hazard analysis (PHA) information in Section 7 was obtained from PHA 17-351.  This PHA covers the portion of the neoprene process where nitrogen tetroxide is used.\n\n\n\nThe second process is the chloroprene process, which uses chlorine, pentane and 1,3-butadiene as raw materials.  The process hazard analyses (PHA) information in Section 7 was obtained from PHA 18-363.  While several PHAs cover this area of the plant, this is the most recent PHA completed for the portion of the process where one of these three chemicals are used and it covers chlorine process equipment.\n\n\n\nThe third process is the chlorine storage facilities.  Chlorine is used as one of the raw materials in the production of chloroprene.  It is received in tank cars and stored in five refrigerated bullets.   The process hazard analyses (PHA) information in Section 7 was obtained from PHA 18-363.\n\n\n\nThe fourth process is the butadiene railcar unloading facilities.  Butadiene is a raw material used in the manufacture of chloroprene.  Butadiene is received in railcars and unloaded into a storage sphere, from the sphere is fed into the process.  The process hazard analyses (PHA) information in Section 7 was obtained from PHA 11-328.  DPE does not utilize this unloading process anymore.  \n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical - Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nDPE takes a systematic, proactive approach to preventing accidental releases of hazardous chemicals.  The Process Safety Management (PSM) program follows OSHA's Guidelines and is directed toward preventing serious, process-related inci"
