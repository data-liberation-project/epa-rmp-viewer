The refrigeration system is used to maintain cooling and freezing for warehouse products.  The refrigeration system began operation in March 1998 and was designed and constructed under the applicable fire and mechanical codes.\n\n\n\nThe system is a single-stage, multi-suction, economized mechanical refrigeration system that utilizes recirculated liquid feed to the evaporator coils.  Cooling is required for the 35?F Refrigerated Dock and Refrigerated Warehouse and for the -2?F Freezer Warehouse.  There are two rooms adjacent to the Freezer Warehouse, each with two (2) evaporator coil units that can be converted to/from refrigerated or frozen space.  The anhydrous ammonia also serves as a heat exchange medium for the under-floor glycol heating system.\n\n\n\nSystem components are connected with steel piping approved for ammonia refrigeration service and the system is controlled by the programmable logic controller (PLC), the microprocessors at the screw compressors, safety switches, detection, and control valves.\n\n\n\nThe compressors, pressure vessels, pumps, gauge board, and purger are located in the Machine Room; the condenser and heat exchanger are located on the Machine Room roof; the fire control box and the ammonia diffusion tank are located outside the Machine Room; and, the evaporators are located in their respective cooling and freezing areas.\n\n\n\n \n\nThe Primary System Components include the following:\n\n\n\nQUANTITY    DESCRIPTION\n\n4    Screw Compressor Packages\n\n1    Evaporative Condenser\n\n1    High-Pressure Receiver\n\n1    Thermosyphon Receiver\n\n1    High Temperature Recirculator\n\n1    Low Temperature Recirculator\n\n4    Ammonia Pumps\n\n2    Oil Pots\n\n1    Glycol Heat Exchanger\n\n1    Auto Purger\n\n4    Dock Evaporators\n\n4    Freezer Evaporators\n\n4    Convertible Cooler / Freezer Evaporators\n\n\n"

      "SummaryText": "\nSystem Operation\n\n\n\nThe Evaporative Condenser drains high-pressure liquid to the Thermosiphon Receiver for screw compressor oil cooling.  The Thermosiphon Receiver also supplies high-pressure liquid ammonia to the High Pressure Receiver, which then supplies liquid to the High Temperature Recirculator for recirculated liquid cooling to the Evaporator coils.  As the liquid ammonia leaves the High Temperature Recirculator, an expansion valve reduces the temperature and pressure of the liquid to the coils to maintain a pre-determined pressure.\n\n\n\nLiquid ammonia from the High Temperature Recirculator is supplied to the Low Temperature Recirculator through an expansion valve, which maintains the vessel at a lower pressure.  Liquid from the High Temperature Recirculator is pumped to the Truck Dock Evaporators and optionally to the Convertible Evaporators when high temperature cooling is desired in that space.   Liquid from the Low Temperature Recirculator is pumped to the Freezer Evaporators and optionally to the Convertible Evaporators when low temperature cooling is desired in that space.\n\n\n\nPrior to entering the Evaporator coils, the ammonia expands and flashes to saturation temperature as the pressure is reduced through the respective expansion valves.  The resulting low-pressure liquid ammonia absorbs heat from the space as the liquid ammonia evaporates in the coils.\n\n\n\nSaturated ammonia vapor is returned from the Truck Dock coils to the High Temperature Recirculator and from the Freezer coils to the Low Temperature Recirculator where the vapor is separated from the liquid.  Constant pressure to the High Temperature Recirculator is maintained with backpressure regulating valves, located before the economizer ports of the compressors.  The Low Temperature Recirculator pressure is maintained by the main suction pressure of the compressors.\n\n\n\nHigh temperature vapor from the High Temperature Recirculator provides economized suction to the compressors and low temperature"

High-pressure, high-temperature ammonia vapor discharge from the compressors provides hot gas for the glycol heat exchanger, hot gas defrost for the Evaporator coils, and high stage discharge to the Evaporative Condenser.  The heat of compression in the compressor discharge is removed in the Evaporative Condenser.  Liquid discharge from the glycol heat exchanger is returned to the thermosyphon supply line to the compressors.\n\n\n\nAn Autopurger periodically removes noncondensibles from the system.  The fire control box outside the Machine Room is operated by fire department personnel in the event of emergency.  The Ammonia Diffusion Tank is maintained full of water to absorb a system overpressure release from the vessel pressure relief valves.  Emergency E-stop switches are located outside each Machine Room entrance for emergency shutdown.  Ammonia sensors in the Machine Room and cooling/freezing rooms trigger audible/visual notifications, liquid flow shutdown, purge ventilation activation, and equipment shutdown at prescribed levels.\n\n\n\nThe operation staff consists of the Maintenance Supervisor and two Refrigeration Operator/Mechanics .
