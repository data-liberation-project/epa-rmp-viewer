      "SummaryText": "Lindau Chemicals, Inc. is a specialty organic chemical manufacturer. Lindau supplies raw\nmaterials to many different industries throughout the world. The primary products\nproduced are anhydride curing agents for epoxy resins. These curing agents are used to\nmanufacture composite materials, electrical and electronic components, and many other\nproducts. Other products include coating resins used in concrete and masonry paints and\nspecial polymers and additives for the curing agent products. \n\nThe EPA risk management regulations apply to two flammable substances handled\nonsite, Butadiene and Isoprene. Both of these materials are essential raw materials for\nLindau products and both have been used in our process since the late 1960's without\nserious incident. This plan covers the storage and use of these two materials at Lindau. \n\nThese materials are both stored in pressurized steel tanks. Both of these materials are\nflammable and that is the hazard for which the EPA listed the materials. Isoprene is used\nin greater quantities and so a larger amount of Isoprene is generally onsite. \n\nThe EPA requires that two types of accident scenarios must be evaluated. The first is\nknown as a \"worst case\" scenario. EPA's procedures, for flammable materials, assume\nthat the contents of the largest tank are instantaneously released, vaporized, and\nimmediately disperse to a flammable cloud which then explodes. An actual occurrence of\nthe worst case scenario is extremely unlikely. EPA hopes these \"worst case\" scenarios\nwill raise the public's awareness of potential accidents so that emergency response\ncapabilities are improved. At Lindau, the largest tank contains Isoprene at a maximum of\n150,000 pounds. The radius to the endpoint, from the EPA procedure, includes some\nhomes in the Olympia neighborhood and a large portion of the industrial area along\nRosewood Drive. \n\nEPA also requires analysis of an \"alternative\" scenario. These alternative scenarios give a\nmuch more realistic estimate o"

      "SummaryText": "f the consequences of an accident and are more useful for\nemergency planning than the \"worst case\" scenarios. An alternative release scenario for\nLindau Chemicals has been identified through Process Hazard Analysis and  envisions a\npotential transfer hose failure during unloading a tanker truck. The release amount is 150\npounds of Isoprene because excess flow valves and check valves limit the material\nreleased to the contents of the hose and connected piping. The potential hazard from such\nan accident would be a fire from the flammable material released. Vapor dispersion\nmodeling indicates a distance to the lower flammable limit of less than 300 feet. Beyond\nthis distance there would be no flash fire hazard to our plant or our neighbors. This\ndistance would not reach any homes but would reach the street in front of our plant and\nan adjacent business. \n\nLindau Chemicals has never had any incidents involving either Butadiene or Isoprene that\ncaused property damage, injuries or evacuations off site. During the past five years, there\nhas been one occasion that people were evacuated from their homes but the incident did\nnot  involve the storage or use of Butadiene or Isoprene. This evacuation occurred in\nDecember, 1997 and was the result of a leak and small fire at an Air Products and Chemicals\nHydrogen tank at our site. This incident had no effect on Isoprene or Butadiene storage. The\nEPA Risk management regulations do not apply to our use of Hydrogen. We are not required\nto report this incident but have included the incident in this executive summary to avoid\nconfusion. \n\nLindau Chemicals, Inc. operates its manufacturing facilities and processes in a safe and\nproper manner. We have an effective and continuous safety and environmental program\nincorporating procedures maintained to teach safety, correct deficiencies, and provide a\nsafe, clean working environment, and comply with all applicable laws and regulations.\nAll company supervisors, managers, and officers are resp"

The program details our procedures for\nanalyzing process hazards and implementing improvements to process procedures. The\nprogram includes procedures for safety analyses of processes, called Process Hazard\nAnalysis(PHA). A PHA has been performed which covers the use and storage of these\nmaterials. A portion of this program addresses mechanical integrity of process equipment\nincluding the storage tanks and transfer hoses. Included in this program is a testing\nprocedure to pressure test hoses used for transferring Isoprene or Butadiene on a monthly\nbasis. This procedure tests the hoses at a pressure about 50% higher than the actual\npressure experienced during unloading. Hoses that fail the test are removed from service.\nThis testing procedure exceeds generally recognized industry practices and we believe is\nvery effective in preventing an accident of this type. \n\nLindau Chemicals, Inc. has an Emergency Response Plan in effect. The plan includes a\nclose working relationship between Lindau's trained Hazardous Materials (HAZMAT)\nresponders and the Columbia Fire Department. Firefighters have visited Lindau's facility\nto become familiar with the layout. Lindau employees are trained regularly on emergency\nresponse procedures and notification. Lindau Chemicals, Inc. is a member of the\nRichland County Local Emergency Planning Committee. Lindau also has a close working\nrelationship with the Richland County Sheriff's Department and works with off-duty\ndeputies to provide security at our plant site."
