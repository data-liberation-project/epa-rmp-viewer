Michael Foods uses anhydrous ammonia in a closed-loop, two-stage compression refrigeration system to maintain temperature in the facility production, storage, and shipping rooms.\n\nThe maximum intended inventory of ammonia is 74,000 lbs. The normal operating level ranges between 72,000 and 74,000 pounds. The normal operating system pressures range between a low side pressure of 12 of vacuum to a high side pressure of 180 psig. \n\nChemical Hazards for:        Anhydrous Ammonia\n\nPermissible Exposure Limit--25 PPM for 8 hours\nShort Term Exposure Limit--35 PPM for 15 minutes\nImediately Dangerous to Life or Health--300 PPM\nInhalation Hazard--1,000 PPM\nSkin Aborsption Hazard--10,000 PPM\nLower Exsplosive Limit--16%\nUpper Exsplosive Limit--25%\nEPA Toxic Endpoint--200 PPM\nDOT Classification:--Non-flammable gas\nUnited Nations Number:--UN 1005\n\nAccidental Release and Emergency Response Policies:\n\nMichael Foods Egg Products Company has established a trained, in-house emergency response team to quickly respond to and handle releases of anhydrous ammonia. Training for emergency responders is based on the guidelines set forth by OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.120 (HAZWOPER). The facility has also established annual refresher training for all personnel on the HAZMAT Team as well as periodic spill drills and plant-wide evacuation drills to assure all employees are prepared in the event of an emergency. Emergency response plans have been coordinated with the local Fire Department  and the County Local Emergency Planning Committee. These plans and procedures are periodically reviewed to assure that they are current and up to date.\n\nEmergency Response Program:\n\nThe facility has developed a written Emergency Response Plan and trained the refrigeration operators and selected plant personnel in emergency response to hazardous chemical releases. The trained personnel are expected to a"

This could be simply tightening a packing nut or flange bolt to initiating a system shutdown. Standard Operating Procedures have been developed for the operation of the ammonia refrigeration system including procedures for the emergency shutdown and isolation of equipment should a release occur. This facility has also purchased Level A protective clothing, self contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) and other appropriate protective equipment to support the in-house HAZMAT team. Emergency response assistance is coordinated with local emergency response agencies.\n\nFive Year Accident History: \n\nNo reportable accidents have occurred in the past 5 years.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps:\n\nMichael Foods Egg Products Company has developed and implemented a Process Safety Management (PSM) program to insure the ammonia refrigeration system is maintained in a safe and efficient manner and facility employees are properly trained in the safe operation of this system. The facility has also established and implemented other saftey programs such as lockout/yagout, confined space, hot work permit, and forklift training to prevent or reduce the likelihood of an ammonia release. In addition the facility follows the following codes, standards and guidelines to maintain the mechanical integrity of the ammonia refrigeration system:\n \nInternational Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) guidelines for Ammonia Refrigeration\nASHRAE Safety Code for Mechanical Refrigeration\nANSI/IIAR 2-1999 Equipment, Design, and Installation of Ammonia Mechanical Refrigerating Systems\nANSI B31.3 Piping Code\nNFPA Guidelines for Fire Protection Equipment\n  \nThrough regular audits, training, maintenance, testing and inspection programs Michael Foods Egg Products Company has established a history of safe operation and that community emergency action plans are current a"
