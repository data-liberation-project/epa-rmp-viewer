Ammonia is the only hazardous chemical used at this facility that is subject to the CalARP and EPA RMP program requirements.\n\nThis facility recognizes the hazards associated with the use of highly (acutely) hazardous chemicals.  As a reflection of our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws and regulations, we submit this plan to address the hazards inherent with the use of ammonia.  Our program addresses safety precautions regarding the handling and operation of this covered system as well as proper operator training for those who maintain the system.\n\nOur accidental release prevention program is clearly defined by the Process Safety Management (PSM) Program for this facility.  This prevention program follows industry-recommended standards for preventing unnecessary human exposures and reducing the threat to the health of our employees as well as to members of the community and the surrounding area.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle these chemicals, the safety devices inherent in the design of this facility and its processes, and the training that we provide our personnel.  This Plan is updated as required by law.\n\nOur emergency response (action) plan is summarized in the Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasure (SPCC) Plan for this plant.  The Plan includes procedures for notification of the local emergency responders and of any potentially affected neighbors of the facility.   The Plan includes a specific protocol for responding to an ammonia release and assigns an Emergency Coordinator to implement the response.  This Plan is current and updated as required by law.\n\nIt is the policy of this facility to devote the time, energy, and capital toward maintaining prevention and response programs appropriate to the inherent dangers with the use of hazardous chem"

The plant is situated at about 90 feet above sea level at the southern border of the city limits of Modesto along Whitmore Avenue.  The historically agricultural land south of Whitmore Avenue is currently under residential development by the City of Ceres.  The Union Pacific Railroad tracks separate the facility on the west from light industrial businesses.  The Kraft Foods facility borders the northern property line of ConAgra Foods and shares the same gated entrance on Whitmore Avenue.  Approximately 40 acres of agricultural land lie to the east, which in turn, are bordered by Morgan Road on the eastern border.\n\nThe ConAgra Foods facility, operated since 1958, processes vegetables into a variety of bulk dehydrated products.  The facility operates three shifts throughout the year with some variance depending upon crop availability.  Raw vegetables are trucked to the site and unloaded prior to washing in the wet processing building. Once the vegetables have been washed, they are processed, dehydrated, and packaged.\n\nThe mechanical ammonia refrigeration system is a closed loop system and it is used for product pre-cooling and freezing.  The system utilizes both liquid pumped overfeed and flooded systems.  The maximum quantity of ammonia at this facility is limited by the system capacity of approximately 15,700 pounds.\n\nPlant security is provided by a guard located at the main gate entrance to the facility. The security guard provides emergency response support under the direction of the Emergency Coordinator.  The entire plant is enclosed by a chain-link fence, except at the main gate, where trucks and personnel enter and exit as directed by the plant security guard. Identification cards are required to pass through the security guard and main gate and enter the plant.  Process and office bu"

Due to system controls such as proper operating procedures and equipment with inherent safety features, these scenarios have a low likelihood of occurring.\n\nThe worst-case scenario assumes a complete release of liquefied chemical under pressure from the largest process vessel for a duration of ten minutes.  The model used (ALOHA) assumes a low wind speed of 1.5 m/s and a very stable atmosphere.\nThe distance to toxic endpoint was determined to be approximately 1.5 miles and involves the release of ammonia liquid and subsequent vaporization.  The population within the area potentially affected is estimated to be 25,000 residential inhabitants.  Public receptors potentially impacted by this worst-case release scenario include schools, residences, prisons or correctional facilities, public recreation areas, and commercial/office/industrial areas.\n\nAlternative Case Release Scenarios\n\nThe alternative case release scenarios were modeled using typical site and weather conditions and variables appropriate to the particular release scenario.  The methodology used in the worst-case scenario (ALOHA) was also used for the alternative case release scenarios.  The alternative case release scenarios are those scenarios more likely to occur and that will reach an endpoint offsite, if one exists.\n\nThe alternative scenarios consist of t"

The distances to toxic endpoints offsite ranged from approximately 400 yards to 1.4 miles.  Due to the prevailing winds from the northwest, the impacts are likely to occur in the southeast direction from the facility.  The public receptors potentially affected include schools, residences, and commercial/office/industrial areas.  \n\nThough the distances to toxic endpoints are not necessarily realistic estimates of the areas in which the public might be endangered in the event of a release due to inherent uncertainty in the model assumptions, all three scenarios taken together indicate that prevention measures are essential and that emergency response may require evacuation or sheltering-in-place some distance from the plant.\n \nThough mitigating measures were not considered in modeling these scenarios, most of the ammonia system equipment is inside buildings.  An unabated release is likely to occur inside and exit through the exhaust fan at the roof or be released from exit points at the roof elevation.  The elevation of the release could increase dispersion of the ammonia vapor cloud though much of the release would still be subject to typical weather conditions and release as modeled.  The sprinkler system will likely reduce the release quantity, also, in the event of a fire.\n\nControl measures at the plant that decrease the chance of any of the above events from occurring include trained and qualified system operators, a preventive maintenance program, and alarms and procedures for response to operation deviations. \n\n3.4 THE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND THE CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThis facility complies with the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program, the EPA RMP program, and OSHA?s Process Safety Management (PSM) Program.

This Emergency Action Plan includes release notification for emergency responders as well as potentially affected neighbors.  The Emergency Coordinator implements the response in coordination with the local emergency responders as described in the response protocol.\n\n \n3.7 PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nAs a result of the most recent process hazard analysis and the continuous review of process safety, this facility plans to implement the following changes to the ammonia refrigeration system to improve safety:\n\n?
