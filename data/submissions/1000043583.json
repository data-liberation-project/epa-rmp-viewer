Before using a hazardous substance, we always consider less hazardous alternatives.  When a hazardous substance is used at Rock-Tenn, we consider the potential for this substance to adversely affect our workers, the public, and the environment and take steps to prevent any such effects.\n\n\n\nRock-Tenn prevents releases of the hazardous substances used at the facility.  When a hazardous substance is used, the equipment used to contain it is carefully designed, built, and operated to reduce the likelihood of an accidental release.  Industry and government standards are closely adhered to in the design, construction, and operation of the equipment.\n\n\n\nRock-Tenn limits damage from a release, if such a release occurs.  We work daily to prevent accidental releases from occurring.  However, we also train our workforce to respond to accidental releases and reduce the potential consequences.  In addition, Rock-Tenn works with the local fire department and with the local emergency planning committee (LEPC) to help ensure that all emergency responders work closely together to minimize the impact of the release on our workers and the community.\n\n\n\nThe safety program at Rock-Tenn consists of a number of elements, only some of which are required by the RMP rule.

Rock-Tenn provides response training to our personnel, designates the maintenance superintendent or his designee to oversee response activities, and coordinates response efforts with the local fire department and/or the LEPC.  Response activities have also been discussed with the LEPC.\n\n\n\n1.2 Rock-Tenn and the Regulated Substances We Use\n\nRock-Tenn is an integrated pulp and paperboard mill primarily involved in the manufacture of bleached pulp and related finished paperboard products.  As part of this manufacturing process, Rock-Tenn handles one regulated substance in sufficient quantities to be covered by the RMP rule, as shown in the following list of RMP-covered processes at Rock-Tenn.\n\n\n\nProcess Regulated Substance(s)\n\nPulp Bleaching Systems, Chlorine dioxide\n\nChlorine Dioxide Plant, Chlorine dioxide\n\n\n\n1.3 Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-specific Prevention Steps\n\nRock-Tenn has always believed that safety is the highest priority.  Beginning in 1992, the mill formalized this belief into a prevention program that complies with the OSHA process safety management (PSM) prevention program.  For Rock-Tenn, the prevention program requirements for EPA's RMP rule are nearly identical to the PSM rule.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of Rock-Tenn's prevention program that address the RMP rule prevention program requirements. \n\n\n\n1.3.1 Rock-Tenn's Prevention Program\n\nThe Rock-Tenn accident prevention program, consists of the following 12 elements:\n\n\n\n1. Process Safety Information.  Rock-Tenn maintains a variety of technical documents, including an emergency preparedness plan, to help ens"

These documents address (1) process chemical information of the hazardous substances we handle, (2) process technology information, and (3) equipment information for our equipment.  Rock-Tenn ensures that this process safety information is available to all our employees.\n\n\n\n2. Process Hazard Analysis.  Rock-Tenn performs and periodically updates process hazard analyses (PHAs) of our covered processes to help identify process hazards and generate recommendations that might improve the safe operation of the process.  A team consisting of personnel with engineering and process operating experience and a leader with PHA experience is assembled to analyze the hazards of our processes.  The team painstakingly addresses the potential hazards associated with each piece of equipment, down to the smallest pipe, that carries hazardous material. The PHA team then prepares a written report describing the results of the analysis, including a list of recommendations.  Responsibility to resolve the recommendations is assigned to unit personnel and, when appropriate, changes to enhance the safety of the process are implemented.  PHAs are revisited every five years to ensure they are current.\n\n\n\n3. Operating Procedures.  Rock-Tenn's process engineers, operators, and supervisors work together to develop and maintain operating procedures to define how tasks related to process operations should be safely performed.  The operating procedures are used to train employees and serve as reference guides for appropriate actions to take during both normal operations and process upsets.  Operating procedures include:\n\n? steps for safely conducting activities\n\n? applicable process safety information, such as safe operating limits and consequences of process deviations\n\n? safety and health considerations, such as chemical hazards, personal protective equipment requirements, and "

Our training program includes both initial and refresher training that covers (1) a general overview of the process, (2) the properties and hazards of the substances in the process, and (3) a detailed review of the process operating procedures and safe work practices.  Oral reviews and written tests are used to verify that an employee understands the training material before the employee can begin or resume work in the process.\n\n\n\n5. Mechanical Integrity.  Rock-Tenn maintains mechanical process equipment to help prevent equipment failures that could endanger workers, the public, or the environment.  Our mechanical integrity program includes (1) an inspection,testing, and preventative maintenance plan to help identify equipment deterioration and damage before the equipment fails and (2) a quality assurance program to help ensure that new and replacement equipment meet the strict design standards required for service in our processes.\n\n\n\n6. Management of Change.  We evaluate and specifically approve all proposed changes to chemicals, equipment, and procedures to help ensure that the change does not negatively affect safe operations. All changes other than replacement-in-kind (e.g., replacing a valve with an identical valve) must be confirmed through the full management of change program.  This helps ensure that inadvertent consequences of process changes are prevented, safety consequences of changes are addressed, affected process safety information and procedures are updated, and affected employees are notified of the changes.\n\n\n\n7. Pre-startup Review.  Rock-Tenn recognizes that new or newly modified processes are historically more likely to be involved in accidental releases.  Therefore, we perform safety reviews of new or modified processes before placing them into service to help ensure their safe op"

Compliance Audit.  One of the cornerstones of an effective prevention program is a regular, thorough assessment.  We audit our covered processes every three years to be certain our prevention program is effectively addressing the safety issues of Rock-Tenn operations.  We assemble an audit team that includes personnel knowledgeable in the PSM and RMP rules and in our process designs, and this team evaluates whether the prevention program satisfies the requirements of these two rules and whether it is sufficient to help ensure safe operation of the process.  The results of the audit are documented, recommendations are resolved, and appropriate enhancements to the prevention program are implemented.\n\n\n\n9. Incident Investigation.  Rock-Tenn investigates all incidents that could reasonably have resulted in a serious injury to personnel, the public, or the environment so that similar accidents can be prevented in the future.  We train our employees to identify and report any incident requiring investigation.  An investigation team is assembled, and the investigation is initiated within 48 hours of the incident. The results of the investigation are documented, recommendations are resolved, and appropriate process improvements are implemented.\n\n\n\n10. Employee Participation.  Rock-Tenn has a written employee participation program for covered processes to help ensure that the safety concerns of our workers are addressed.

Rock-Tenn has a hot work permit program to control spark- or flame-producing activities that could result in fires or explosions in our facility.  We reviewed OSHA's fire prevention and protection requirements and created a Hot Work Permit Form to comply with these requirements.  Personnel who are to perform hot work are required to fill out the Hot Work Permit Form.  The appropriate supervisor reviews the completed form before work can begin.  Training in the use of the Hot Work Permit Form is included in our safe work practices orientation.\n\n\n\n12. Contractors.  We have a program in place to help ensure that contractor activities at our facility are performed in a safe manner.  This program reviews the safety record of all our contractors to help ensure that we hire only contractors who can safely perform the desired job tasks.  We explain to the contract supervisors the hazards of the processes on which they and their employees will work, our safe work practices, and our emergency response procedures.  We require that the Contractor Supervisors train each of their employees who will work at the facility before that worker begins work at our facility.  Rock-Tenn periodically reviews contractors' training documents and work performance to help ensure that safe practices are followed. \n\n\n\n1.3.2 Chemical-specific Prevention Steps\n\nIn addition to the required prevention program elements, Rock-Tenn has implemented safety features specific to the hazardous substances used at our facility.  The following paragraphs describe some of these safety features.\n\nChlorine Dioxide.  Chlorine dioxide is produced at the Rock-Tenn facility and stored in a mixture that is 99% water and 1% chlorine dioxide.
