Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at Prinsburg Farmers Coop - East Finishing Facility in Prinsburg, MN are strongly committed\nto employee, public, and environmental safety.  This commitment is an inherent part of our\ncomprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation,\noperating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our\nfacility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated\nsubstances.  If such a release does occur, our trained emergency response personnel are at hand to\ncontrol and mitigate the effects of the release.  We also coordinate our response efforts with the\nPrinsburg Fire Department, which provides additional emergency response expertise.\n\n  2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities include turkey production.  We have propane stored in a 12,000-\ngallon tank located at our east finishing facility in Prinsburg (Figure 1).  The maximum amount\nstored is 10,800 gallons (45,608.4 pounds) at the maximum fill capacity of 90 %.\n\n  3. Worst Case Release and Alternative Release Scenarios\nWe utilized RMP PRO for the worst case scenario of the required offsite consequence analysis for\nour facility.  The following details this scenario.\n\nThe worst case release scenario involves a catastrophic release of the entire contents of the largest\npropane storage tank (45,608.4 lbs.) in gaseous form over a 10-minute period.  At Class F\natmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s wind speed, the maximum distance to an endpoint of 1 psi\noverpressure is 0.29 miles (Figure 2).  This amount o"
