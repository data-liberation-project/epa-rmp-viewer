In order for an operator to be licensed, each must pass a test about the dangers and handling techniques of chlorine gas. Due to the number of operators on site, it is the policy of Severn Trent Environmental Services and the City of Clinton to notify the Clinton fire department in the event of an accidential release. Plant personnel are not to respont to the release. Their duty is to notify the Clinton Fire Department and local residents.  The Clinton Fire Department has personnel with HAZWOPR training.           (b) The stationary source and requlated substances handled; The regulated process from this plant is the water disinfection system.  Disinfection is accomplished with the use of chlorine gas.  Four to Nine thousand two pounds of chlorine gas is kept on-site and stored in the chlorine structure. The gas is delivered to the site in one-ton cylinders and 150 pound cylinders; The worst-case release scenario(s) and the alternative release scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario.       The worse-case scenario review was the loss of one of chlorine in a ten-minute period.  Due to the remote location it is unlikely that the gas would affect inhabited areas. Due to the topography we used and urban setting.  The plant is located in a low area.  It is surrounded by trees and a dam.  The chlorine cylinders are inside an enclosure with a roof.     In the event of a release, the Clinton Fire Department would be notified, and they would take the necessary precautions to protect the public.     We also reviewed and altermate release scenareo.  We rviewed the potential for a .31 inch hole in a pipe or cylinder.  Again the fire department would be notified.  We maintain a chlorine rep"

(d) The general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps;  The chlorine handling equipment is maintained as a part of the on-going plant maintenance program. The feed equipment is vacume operated, with tank mounted regulators.  There are chlorine leak detectors to sound an alarm if chlorine is released.  A line break anywhere in the system would shut down the chlorine regulator.     (e) The five-year accident history;    There have been no accidental releases in th past five year period.      (f)  The emergency response program:    Due to the limited personnel, it is Operators policy for the water treatment plant operator to notify the fire department in the event of an accidential release.  Plant personnel are not to respond to the release.  The fire department has personnel with HAZWOPR training of how to handle chlorine releases.         (g) Planned changes to improve safety: We have implementing drills to determine our effectiveness in planning.  Yearly  air-pack training exercise for all water treatment personnel has been Implimented."
