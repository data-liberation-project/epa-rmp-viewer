Worst-case and alternative case release scenarios for regulated flammable chemicals are not appicable. \r\n5.0  FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY: \r\nFieldale Farms keep records for all significant accidental chemical releases that occur at our facility.  Within the past five years, Fieldale Farms Corporation Murrayville Complex has had no reportable accidents involving anhydrous ammonia.  \r\n6.0  EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM:  \r\nFieldale Farms maintains an intergrated plan, which consolidates all of the various Federal, State and local regulatory requirements for emergency response planning.  Our program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting our employees, the public and the environment during an emergency response.  Emergency response drills are conducted every 6 months by the Fieldale Farms emergency responders.  In the event of an emergency involving our anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system, it is our policy to notify the National Response Center, the State EPD and by dailing 911 the local emergency responders.  Fieldale Farms request the local agencies to respond to the emergency anhydrous ammonia.

The Executive Summary contains elements that we have designed and implemented including (1) A description of our facility and use of a substance regulated by EPA's RMP regulation. (2) An overview of our accidental release prevention programs. (3) A five year accident history documenting accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia an EPA's RMP regulated chemical. (4) An overview of Fieldale Farms  emergency response program. (5) An overview of planned improvements at the facility to prevent accidental chemical releases from occurring and adversely affecting our employees, the public and the environment.  \r\n2.0  STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES:  \r\nFieldale Farms Corporation processes poultry.  Anhydrous ammonia is used in the refrigeration equipment to keep the raw poultry cool or frozen during processing or storage.  Anhydrous ammonia has been identified by the EPA under the clean air act Section 112(r)as having the potential to cause significant offsite consequences in the event of a substantial accidental release.  Our facility qualifies as a Risk Management Program 3 facility because we also are covered by OSHA's Process Safety Management Rule (PSM) (29 CFR 1910.119).  \r\nTOXICS:  \r\nAnhydrous ammonia is a toxic gas regulated by EPA under the clean air act section 112 R Risk Management Program (RMP) rule.
