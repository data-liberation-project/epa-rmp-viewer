      "SummaryText": "ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nThe Penreco Dickinson Facility has a history of commitment to public and employee safety.  Our commitment is demonstrated in the resources invested in accident prevention such as safety and operations training of our personnel, incident investigations, and standards for design, installation, operation and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy at Penreco is to implement reliable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.  \n\nGENERAL DESCRIPTION\n\nThe Penreco Plant has been a member of the Dickinson community since 1942 and is in the business to convert refined base oils into food grade mineral oils and petroleum sulfonates.  Pennzoil Products Company purchased the plant in 1985 from Marathon Morco Company and made it a part of the company's Penreco Division.  In 1997, Pennzoil Products Company and Conoco, Inc. entered into a joint venture agreement and formed an independently operated Penreco Company.  As of 1998, Pennzoil-Quaker State Company and Conoco, Inc. jointly own the Penreco Company.  M. E. Zuckerman Specialty Oil Corporation purchased Pennzoil-Quaker State Company?s 50% interest in the Penreco joint venture in February 2001.  Conoco merged with Phillips Petroleum Company in August 2002 to become ConocoPhillips Company.  \n\nThe plant is located at Park Avenue and Nichols Street in Dickinson, Texas.  The plant covers an area of approximately 28 acres, which consists of the north and south property bisected by Park Avenue and the east Dickinson Bayou property.  The main plant is located on the north property (10 acres) and consists of all the process units and related tankage.  Located on the south property (10 acres) are a modern packaging and distribution facility and a wastewater treatment facility.  The distribution center encompasses drum filling and storage, tank truck loadi"

The east Dickinson Bayou property (8 acres) was purchased in 1989 and is presently undeveloped.\n\nThe facility has five distinct operating areas: the white oil unit, the yellow oil unit, the sodium bisulfite unit, crude sulfonate processing and spent salt processing.  The average daily throughput for all finished products is approximately 50,000 gallons per day.  The plant's feedstock is received by rail and tank truck.  Finished products are shipped to customers in bulk and in drums by rail and trucks.  There are about 70 employees at the Dickinson facility, including a sales staff.  As a company Penreco actively supports and/or participates in numerous local civic organizations, and youth educational and sports programs.\n\nREGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nToxic Substances\n\nThe plant has one Risk Management Program regulated toxic chemical, oleum, fuming sulfuric acid, over the threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds.  Oleum is a chemical raw material used in the manufacturing and processing of many products at Penreco.  Oleum is received only by tank truck and stored in two storage tanks.  At the Penreco Dickinson Plant, oleum is used in the production of white and yellow oils by contacting lube oil feedstocks with oleum.  The acid contact process produces a non-reactive food-grade white oil approved for human consumption.  Penreco's white oils form the basic ingredient in such consumer products as baby oil, cosmetics and pharmaceuticals.\n\nSulfur dioxide, a toxic gas, is also present in the plant, but at quantities well below the threshold quantity of 5,000 pounds.  The operational processes containing sulfur dioxide were evaluated and determined to have no potential impact to the community in the event of a release.\n\nFlammable Substances\n\nThe plant has no Risk Management Program (RMP) regulated flammable materials above the threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds.  The plant utilizes propane cylinders for forklif"

Penreco does not believes that these events are likely to occur because of the preventative controls in place at the plant.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM STEPS\n\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at our Penreco Dickinson Plant.  Because the Oleum Process at the plant that is regulated by the EPA RMP regulation is also subject to the OSHA PSM standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\nEMPLOYEE PARTICIPATION\n\nThe Penreco Dickinson Plant encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents, participation as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team and participation on the Plant Safety Review Committee.  In addition, employees participate on monthly safety and housekeeping inspections and also serve as investigation team members for all plant accidents and/or incidents.  Employees have access to all information created as part of the plant's accident prevention program.  In addition, the plant has a number of initiatives under way that address process safety and employee safety issues.  These initiatives include forming teams to promote both process and personal safety.  The teams typically have members from various areas of the plant, including operations, maintenance, engineering, shipping, laboratory, and plant management.\n\nPROCESS SAFETY INFORMATION\n\nThe Penreco Dickinson Plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of our various proce"

These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  Specific departments within the plant are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.  Information summarizing the reference documents and their location is readily available as part of the written employee participation plan and the plant's process safety manual.  Chemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDS's).  This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  For specific process areas, the plant has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g. temperature, level, pressure and composition) and this information is an intricate part of our process operating procedures.  The plant ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g. automated shutdown systems).\n\nThe plant also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, etc. This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features or systems in the process are not compromised. \n\nPROCESS HAZARD ANALYSIS\n\nThe Penreco Dickinson Plant has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various proce"

Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate safeguards or controls are in place to manage these hazards.  The plant utilizes the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis and the What-If/Checklist technique to perform these evaluations.  HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  The What-If technique is also utilized for less complicated or hazardous processes.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  The team identified and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes recommendations for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to local management for resolution.  Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options being implemented in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.  To help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the plant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and whenever significant changes in the process so warrant.  These reviews continue at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.

These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provides a basis for consistent training of new operators.  These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.  In addition, the plant maintains process parameter documents that provide guidance on how to respond to upper or lower limit exceedances for specific process or equipment parameters.  This information, along with written operating procedures, is readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\nTRAINING\n\nTo compliment the written procedures for process operations, the plant has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  New employees receive basic training in plant operations if they are not already familiar with such operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate (e.g. through testing, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years.  All training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\nCONTRACTORS\n\nThe plant uses contractors to supplement its workforc"

Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their designated work areas, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, (6) notify plant management of any work related incidents, and (7) inform plant personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.  This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work.  In addition, we evaluate contractor safety programs and performance during the selection process of a contractor.  Plant personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\nPRE-STARTUP SAFETY REVIEWS (PSSRs)\n\nThe Penreco Dickinson Plant conducts a PSSR for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and the equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review also provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready.  The PSSR review team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness.  A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves as a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented. \n\nMECHANICAL INTEGRITY\n\nThe Penreco Dickinson Plant has well-established practices and procedures to maintain pressure v"

The basic aspects of this program include: (1) conducting training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspection and tests, (4) correcting identified deficiencies, and (5) applying quality assurance measures.  In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process equipment.  Maintenance personnel receive training on (1) an overview of the process, (2) safety and health hazards, (3) applicable maintenance procedures, (4) emergency response plans, and (5) applicable safe work practices to help ensure that they can perform their job in a safe manner.  Written procedures help ensure that work is performed in a consistent manner and provide a basis for training.  Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended, and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g. thickness testing for piping and pressure vessels).  If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back in service (if possible), or a Management of Change (MOC) team will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment. \n\nAnother integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance. The plant also incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs.  This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.\n\nSAFE WORK PRACTICES\n\nThe plant has long-standing safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety.  Examples of these include (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maint"

These procedures and others, along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\n\nMANAGEMENT OF CHANGE\n\nThe Penreco Dickinson Plant has a comprehensive system to manage changes to processes.  This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented.  Changes are reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.  Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures, are updated to incorporate these changes.  In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on the changes.\n\nINCIDENT INVESTIGATION\n\nThe Penreco Plant promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury.  The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.

Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years so that the reports can be reviewed during future PHAs and PHA revalidations.\n\nCOMPLIANCE AUDITS\n\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, the facility periodically conducts an audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented and remain current.  Compliance audits are conducted at least every three years.  These audits are performed by ConocoPhillips Company corporate or business unit  and/or outside auditors.  The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to senior management and plant management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are retained.\n\nCHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe processes at the plant have hazards that must be managed to ensure safe operation.  The accident prevention program summarized previously is applied to the Oleum Process (Program 3) EPA RMP-covered process at the plant.  Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by (1) equipment failures and (2) human errors.  In addition to the accident prevention program, the plant has safety features on process units to help (1) contain/control a release, (2) quickly detect a release, and (3) reduce the consequences of (mitigate) a release.
