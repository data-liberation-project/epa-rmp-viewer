Hydrogen and methane, in the amounts handled by our facility, are considered hazardous by the EPA.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and State rules and regulations.  Air Products manages the safety of the regulated processes by means of following operating procedures, equipment testing and inspections, safety devices (e.g. alarms, shutdowns, instrumentation, relief devices) inherent in the design of the facility and other controls and systems designed to prevent accidental releases of hazardous chemicals.  Safe work practices and training of our personnel supplement the inherent safe design of the plant.\r\n\r\nOur emergency response program is based upon OSHA's HAZWOPER regulation.  The emergency response plan includes procedures for the notification of the local fire authority, Shell refinery emergency response team and activation of the Contra Cost County Community Warning System so the appropriate measures can be taken by local emergency responders to control accidental releases.\r\n\r\nThis document has been prepared in accordance with the EPA's Risk Management Program regulation (40 CFR, part 68).  The substances and processes considered during the preparation of the Risk Management Plan (RMP) and the scenarios described were selected based on criteria established in the regulation.\r\n\r\n2. The stationary source and regulated substances handled\r\n\r\nThe primary purpose of this facility is the manufacturing of gaseous hydrogen.  Hydrogen is used by our refinery customer to manufacture clean fuels.  Hydrocarbon based gases (including natural gas or methane) are received by our plant via pipeline and used as our feedstock.  The feedstock is then compressed and cracked in our reformer (furnace).  By exposing the feedstock to a catalyst in the presence of heat (approximately 1,500 degrees F) and steam, a chemical reaction takes place tha"

The pure hydrogen is then compressed and delivered to the customer via pipeline.\r\n\r\nThe regulated substance handled at this facility is the flammable gas mixture.  The maximum amount at this site is 32,403 pounds of flammable gas containing approximately 12.8% hydrogen and 13.7% methane\r\n\r\n3. The general accidental release prevention program and specific prevention steps\r\n\r\nThe facility developed prevention program elements based on the Federal EPA Accidental Release Prevention Program, the California Accidental Release Prevention Program (CalARP), and OSHAA\u00bfA\u00bfs Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation.  The facility was designed and constructed to comply with applicable state and industry codes.\r\n\r\n4. Five-year accident history:\r\n\r\nThis facility came on line in June of 1995.  Since that time, only one RMP reportable accident has occurred.  In February of 1996, the facility experienced a failure of a process line that resulted in on-site damage to the plant and no employee injuries.  There was off-site impact.  There were some off-site injuries reported as a result of the concussion of the explosion (e.g., ringing in the ears).  A nearby construction trailer was damaged by flying debris.  Minor damage to public property was reported (e.g., broken windows, cracked wall).  This incident was thoroughly investigated and plant design changes were implemented to prevent similar incidents from occurring.\r\n\r\nSince February of 1996 there have been no accidents involving or accidental releases of flammable gases that resulted in any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage.\r\n\r\n5.

Periodic drills are conducted with these agencies to review the effectiveness of our emergency procedures.\r\n\r\n6.
