As part of this commitment, Stepan Company has established operations and management systems to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility.  One part of this system is a Risk Management Program (RMP) that helps manage chemical risk at Stepan Company's Millsdale Plant and complies with the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) regulation 40 CFR Part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Program Rule (RMP Rule).  One of the requirements associated with the RMP Rule is to submit a Risk Management Plan (RMPlan) describing the risk management program at Stepan Company's Millsdale Plant.  This document is intended to satisfy the RMPlan requirements associated with the RMP Rule and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program at Stepan Company's Millsdale Plant.\n\n1.1\tAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nStepan Company is committed to the safety of Stepan Company employees, public, and preservation of the environment, through the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances.  Stepan Company implements controls to prevent   releases of hazardous substances.  In the event of a chemical release, trained personnel will respond to control and contain such releases.  Stepan Company evaluates each situation, evacuates employees as necessary, and contacts the local fire department to control and contain the release to prevent and/or reduce the consequences of the release.  The Millsdale Plant will also contact Will County Emergency Management Agency (EMA) to assist with emergency management if necessary.   \n\nWill County Emergency Management Agency (EMA) has established a Chemical Emergency Preparedness Plan to coordinate emergency response activities and communicate w"

These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for operating conditions, chemical inventory, and equipment design information.  The facility management of change procedure (MOC) is used to maintain up to date information.  The documents are accessible to all employees electronically from their computers.\n\nChemical specific information, including exposure hazards and treatment are provided in the material safety data sheets (MSDS).

This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, and procedures are properly reviewed and authorized by a multi-functional and multi-level review team prior to implementation.  The intention of the change process is to assure the proposed change is understood and will not introduce hazards into the process.  Affected drawings, procedures, and/or technology documents are updated to reflect these changes.  In addition, personnel training regarding the change may be provided when necessary.\n\nPre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR)\n\nStepan Company's Millsdale Plant conducts a PSSR for any new facility or facility modification.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  The procedure assures construction is completed within design specification and confirms the integrity of the equipment once installed.  The procedure also includes process commissioning tests using non-hazardous fluids to confirm systems function as desired. \n\n The PSSR process uses checksheets and checklists to manage construction and documentation that the process is ready to operate.

Stepan Company is a leading merchant producer of surfactants that are the key ingredients in consumer and industrial cleaning compounds.  Manufacturers of detergents, shampoos, lotions, toothpastes, and cosmetics depend on surfactants to achieve the foaming and cleaning qualities of their products.

Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.  This is referred to as a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA).\n\nThe Millsdale Plant primarily uses the Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) Hazard Evaluation Procedure to perform these evaluations.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\nThe PHA team's findings are summarized in a report and communicated to plant management and all employees associated with the process.   Implementation of the findings is based on relative risk ranking parameters assigned by the PHA team.  The risk ranking helps assure the findings with the highest risk receive prompt attention.  All PHA findings are tracked until completion.  \n\nTo help ensure that process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the Millsdale Plant revalidates the process hazards analysis on a five (5) year frequency for the entire life of the process in accordance with the PSM regulation.
