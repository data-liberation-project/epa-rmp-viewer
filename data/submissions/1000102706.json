      "SummaryText": "Emergency Procedures Information\n\nThe Dubuque Terminal maintains a written emergency procedure, which is in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment. The procedures are for the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is  accidentally released. The procedures address notification of local emergency response agencies if a release occurs. Employees receive training in emergency procedures. The emergency procedure is updated when necessary based on modifications made to the plant facilities.\n\nThe overall emergency procedure program for the Dubuque Terminal is coordinated with the Dubuque County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC). This coordination includes periodic meetings of the committee, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials and industry representatives. The Dubuque Terminal has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (e.g. Dubuque\nCounty Sheriff's Department). This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident. In addition to periodic LEPC meetings, the Dubuque Terminal conducts periodic  emergency drills that involve the LEPC and emergency response organizations, and also provides periodic refresher training to local emergency responders regarding the hazards of regulated substances in the plant.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThe Dubuque Terminal & Storage resolves all findings from PHAs, some of which result in modifications to the process.  Other recommendations for possible changes to improve safety come from periodic accident prevention program audits, incident investigations, or employee suggestions and recommendations.  The following changes are planned for implementation at the Dubuque Terminal & Storage.\n\n* No changes are planned."

Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human errors.\n\nSpecialized Safety Features\n\nThe Dubuque Terminal & Storage has safety features on many units to help contain/control a release, to quickly detect a release and reduce the consequence of a release.  The following types of safety features are used in the covered processes:\n\nRelease Detection\n\n* Hydrocarbon (hazardous gas) detectors and alarms\n* Plant video surveillance system\n\nRelease Containment and Control\n\n* Area relief valves and vents that discharge to atmosphere.\n* Valves to permit isolation of the process (manual or automated).\n* Automatic shutdown systems for specific process parameters (e.g., high pressure).\n* Secondary containment (curbs and dikes) to contain any release of liquid ethyl mercaptan.\n* Redundant equipment and instrumentation where advisable\n* Storage tank emergency shutdown valves\n* Loading line excess flow valves\n\nRelease Mitigation\n\n* Hand-held fire extinguishers\n* Personnel trained in emergency response and procedures.\n* Personnel protective equipment (e.g., chemical protective clothing, hard hats, safety glasses, etc.)\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nRecords are kept for all significant accidental chemical releases that occur at our facility.  The following is a brief summary of accidental chemical releases involving materials covered under EPA's RMP rule during the past five years:\n\nThis facility has not had an accidental release in the last five years which meets the criteria set forth in 40 CFR 68.10."

However, ethyl mercaptan is stored at less than the 10,000 pound threshold quantity specified in the regulation.\nOffsite Consequence Analysis Results\n\nThe offsite consequence analysis will not be reflected in the executive summary but rather is reflected in the data components.  There are flammable substances on site and no toxic substances above the threshold quantity.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe following is a summary of the accidental release prevention program in place at Dubuque Terminal & Storage.  The process at the facility is regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) regulation (Program 1).  Release prevention is provided through the use of written operating procedures, employee training in written procedures, including normal operation and emergency release procedures, and in the design of safety and release prevention equipment installed at the terminal site.  In addition, a written safety program designed to comply with all applicable OSHA safety performance regulations is strictly enforced at all Enterprise facilities, including the Dubuque Terminal & Storage facility.
