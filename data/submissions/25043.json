Logan County DES has current facility plans and plan of action. CIMA / Russellvllie Water Treatment Plant currently supplies drinking water for the residents of Russellville.  Cima employees about 45 people.  An RMP covered chemicl Chlorine is used in the treatment of the city drinking water. The water treatment plant is located corner of 1st St and Main St Worst Case Scenario Chemical: Chlorine gas. Assumptions: 1) Catastrophic failure of our two one ton cylinders. 2) Failure of all safety systems. 3) Worst case weather conditions (stable, low wind speed). 4) Total release of entire contents of two one ton cylinders (4000lbs) in 10 minutes. Estimated distance to toxic endpoint: 1.3 miles. Alternative Release Scenario Chemical  chlorine gas. Assumptions: Both one ton cylinders rupture releasing 4000Lbs of chlorine gas in 10 minutes in an enclosed space, in direct contact with outside air.  Urban surroundings with many obstacles in the immediate area. Estimated distance to toxic endpoint: .2 miles. Accident prevention 1) Al plant operators trained in product handling and safety procedures. 2) Cylinders and feeders are inspected to ensure structaul integrity. 3) Access to the chlorine area is restricted to operation personnel and enclosed by steel protective fence and both cylinders are enclosed by a building. Emergency Response  1) Trained Hazardous Material Response personnel are available in the event of any release. 2) Alarm and notification systems are in place.  3) Logan County DES would coordinate notification and clean-up activities with outside responders.  Five year accident history: There have been no releases of chlorine gas at this facility in the past 5 years that have had an impact on the community or that meet the EPA RISK Management Program reporting guidelines. In the current history of this facility there have been no inc"

How is it transported? Shipped by truck. How is it stored? In steel containers. First Aide for chlorine exposure General: 1) Be cautious, do not become a casuality yourself. 2) Prompt treatment is essential. Firmness and assurance to exposed person will assist anxiety. 3) Immediate removal of exposed person from contaminated area. 4) Remove any contaminated clothing and wash contaminated parts of bady. 5) Never give any thing by mouth to an unconscious person. 6) Call  911 for medical assistance.  Planned changes to improve safety: Within the next year this Water Treatment plant will no longer be used, so chlorine gas will not be on site."
