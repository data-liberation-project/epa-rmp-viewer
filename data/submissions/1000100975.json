In fact, there have not been any incidents, as defined in the regulation.\n\nEmergency Response Program Information\n\nThis plant maintains a written action program to protect the workers, public, and environment.  The program consists of procedures for handling releases of regudures, and other facility changes.  The MOC facilitates appropriate review and authorization before a change is implemented.  Changes are reviewed to ensure adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and to verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.  Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, equipment information, drawings, and procedures are updated for these changes.  In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided the necessary training related to the change.\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nThis plant promptly investigates incidents that resulted in (or could have reasonably resulted in) a fire, explosion, release, major equipment/property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury.  The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations, and forwards these results to management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings are tracked until completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented, and investigation results are reviewed with employees (including contractors) who could be affected.  Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years so that reports can be reviewed during the next PHA revalidation.\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nTo help ensure the accident prevention program is functioning properly, an audit is conducted at the plant at least once every 3 years to determine whether t"

New operators are then paired with experienced operators to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After the new operators demonstrate (e.g., written tests, hands-on skills demonstration) that they have adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they are certified and allowed to work independently.  In addition, personnel who operate process equipment receive refresher training at least every 3 years on the applicable procedures to help ensure their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This training and the means used to verify that the employee understood the training is documented.\n\nContractors\n\nThis plant uses contractors to supplement its workforce for routine maintenance or construction.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, procedures are in place to help ensure contractors: perform their work in a safe manner, have the appropriate knowledge and skills, are aware of the hazards in the workplace, understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, understand and follow safety rules, and inform plant personnel of any hazards they find during their work.  This is accomplished by providing contractors an orientation prior to working in this plant which includes: a process overview, information about safety and health hazards, applicable emergency action plan provisions, and information on safe work practices.  Also, a job safety analysis (JSA) is reviewed/updated or developed by the c"

The analyses are conducted using a team of facility operations/maintenance personnel, facility engineers, and technical consultants (as necessary).  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the processes as well as the accident prevention and mitigation measures.  \n\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to management to coordinate further evaluation and resolution.  This process involves field level business teams, which include engineering, operations personnel, and management.  Operations personnel are also involved in the evaluation of resolution options.  Implementation of the resolutions is prioritized for accomplishment based on relative risk.  Resolution plans are tracked until completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\nTo help ensure the process controls and/or hazards do not deviate significantly from the original design, this plant updates and revalidates the process hazard analysis at least every 5 years.  The results of these updates are also documented and retained.  Similarly, the team's findings are forwarded to management to coordinate further evaluation and resolution, and the final resolution of findings are documented and retained.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nThis plant maintains written procedures that address the various modes of process operations (e.g., startup, normal, temporary, emergency shutdown, normal shutdown) and provide guidance on how to respond to upper/lower limit exceedances for specific equipment o"

Within this program, each process is systematically examined to i of 7, and a church that is primarily utilized only on Sunday.  Other cases that were considered include a VCE of the NGL storage tank, and LNG storage tank.  The Condensate Storage Tank was selected due to it being the highest volume of flammable mixture with the largest radius to end point and an additional residence within this radius.  RMPComp was used for all scenarios considered.\n\nAlternate Case Scenario: The Alternate Case Scenario (ACS) is a vapor cloud fire initiated by a crack in a weld on the Condensate Storage Tank.  This scenario assumes a .25 square inch area total crack area at point of failure with 20\" of liquid height above failure.  Liquid released would be into diked secondary containment with distance to endpoint (Lower Flammable Limit) being .1 mile.  This distance to end point would impact a public roadway (FM 1795) but not include any other public receptors.  This scenario was selected due to its potential realistic nature and proximity to FM 1795.

This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention (e.g., training of personnel, considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the facility, etc.).  Our approach is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances as well as other substances.  If a release does occur, our trained personnel will take steps to control and contain it, until local emergency organizations arrive.  Additional details are included in the other sections of this plan.\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances  \n\nThe Hawkins Gas Plant, located about 1.5 miles northeast of Hawkins, TX, consists of one Program Level 3 process that utilizes several operations (e.g., compression, dehydration, separation, cryogenic) to produce petroleum products (e.g., natural gas liquid mixture, methane) from a naturally occurring hydrocarbon gas mixture.  \n\nThis plant could contain regulated flammables but no regulated toxic inventories in excess of threshold quantities established in the regulation.  Transportation into and out of the facility is handled via pipelines and trucks.  The adjacent oil treating station for the field operations handles produced water and condensate (i.e., no regulated flammables) and is considered part of the covered process.  This plant is located in a rural setting surrounded by pasture and woodlands.\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis Res"
