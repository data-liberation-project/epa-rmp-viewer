This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, facility trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\r\n\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\r\n\r\nThe Wamsutter Stabilization Facility, located near Wasmutter, Wyoming, operates a condensate stabilization process to produce petroleum products, including natural gas, natural gas liquids and stabilized condensate from the unstabilized condensate liquid inlet stream.   The mixed NGL stream is recovered from the overhead of the condensate stabilization process.  The only regulated flammable at the Wamsutter Stabilization Facility is the mixed NGL product produced from the condensate stabilization process.  This mixed NGL product contains regulated flammables from methane through pentane and these compounds are present as components of the mixed stream.  There are no regulated toxic compounds at the Wamsutter Stabilization Facility and hydrogen sulfide is not present in the facility in any concentrations or volumes subject to regulation or of concern.  Due to being a field production facility upstream of a a gas plant, as defined in the regulations, the other hydrocarbon streams at the facility are not subject to the RMP rule.  However, the scenario of a catastrophic failure of the NGL storage bullet represents the greatest off-site impact distance potential from any portion of this facility. \r\n\r\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\r\n\r\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place for the process at"

The process at the facility is regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) risk management program (RMP) regulation and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) process safety management (PSM) standard. \r\n\r\nEmployee Participation\r\n\r\nThe Wamsutter Stabilization Facility encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a team to evaluate process hazards.  Employees have access to all information created as part of the facility accident prevention program.  \r\n \r\nProcess Safety Information\r\n\r\nThe Wamsutter Stabilization Facility keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and equipment design basis/configuration information.  The reference documents are maintained on file at the facility to provide open access.\r\n\r\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDS's).  This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  For the process, the facility has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) in key process parameter documents.  The facility ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\r\n\r\nThe facility also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process"

This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Reviews\r\n\r\nThe Wamsutter Stabilization Facility has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the process are identified and controlled. Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards. The Wamsuter Stabilization Facility makes use of PSM techniques in its safety management program. The Wamsutter Stabilization Facility uses hazard and operability analysis techniques to perform evaluations. This type of analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques. The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe process hazard review team findings are forwarded to local management for resolution.  Implementation of mitigation options in response to process hazard review findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the process hazard reveiw team.  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned that highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options in response to process hazard review team findings are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding is doc"

These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operative.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.  Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.  \r\n\r\nOperating Procedures\r\n\r\nThe Wamsutter Stabilization Facility maintains written procedures that address various modes of operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of any new process.  These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.  The procedures are kept current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the Wamsutter Stabilization Facility maintains key process parameter documents that provide guidance on how to respond to upper or lower limit accedences for specific process or equipment parameters.  This information, along with written operating procedures, is readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\r\n\r\nTraining\r\n\r\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the Wamsutter Stabilization Facility has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process.

After operators demonstrate (e.g., through supervisor review, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  In addition, all operators skills on the operating procedures are periodically evaluated to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\r\n\r\nContractors\r\n\r\nThe Wamsutter Stabilization Facility uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform facility personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.  This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work.  In addition, the Wamsutter Stabilization facility evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor.

The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to facility management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings.  Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years so that the reports can be reviewed during process hazard reviews and process hazard review revalidations.\r\n\r\nCompliance Audits\r\n\r\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, the Wamsutter Stabilization Facility periodically conducts an audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented.  Compliance audits are conducted whenever informal review indicate the need for a formal compliance audit.  Both hourly and staff personnel participate as audit team members.
