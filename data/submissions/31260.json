      "SummaryText": "ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nThe J. B. Latham Regional Plant?s senior management is not only committed to offer superior service, but to also maintain a safety and environmental program to promote a safe environment for all its employees and the surrounding communities.  The Director of Operations administers the facilities safety and environmental policies. The Director of Operations is responsible for various inspections of the facilities to ensure compliance, and oversees the entire safety and environmental programs.  These programs include forklift safety, hazard communications, lockout/tagout, Hazardous Materials Emergency Business Plan, employee safety manuals, manufacturers documentation, Emergency Response, as well as the Risk Management Plan.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nThe J. B. Latham Regional Plant of South Orange County Wastewater Authority (SOCWA) is located at 34156 Del Obispo Street in Dana Point.  The facility is situated west of the Del Obispo Street near Villager Road.  Pacific Coast Highway lies approximately 0.10 kilometers (0.16 miles) south and Interstate 5 lies approximately 1.2 kilometers (0.72 miles) east of the facility.  The immediate area is primarily commercial and residential areas.\n\nThe chlorine system at the J. B. Latham Regional Plant is used for wastewater treatment.  The wastewater treatment system uses chlorine for odor control, filamentous control, or disinfection for the various stages of the treatment processes:  1) influents, 2)  return activated sludge (RAS), and 3) plant process water.  Chlorination of the wastewater controls filamentous bacteria growth in the mixed liquor tanks and kills the germs that cause diseases.  Chlorine is delivered to the facility in one ton containers.  Chlorine gas leaving the one ton container passes through a vacuum regulator to the chlorinators.  From the chlorinators it is pulled into injectors and mixed with water from the treatment process."

      "SummaryText": "  The injectors send the chlorine solution into each of the reclamation treatment processes.\n\nA maximum of 3 one ton chlorine containers (6,000 lbs) is maintained in the chlorine room of the chlorine building. \n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe chlorine system at the J. B. Latham Regional Plant has many safety features.  Much of the safety of the system is inherent in the policies and procedures that govern the operation of the system.  For example, the SOCWA treatment processes operate in accordance with OSHA?s Process Safety Management regulation and the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program.\n\nIn the event that the primary engineering or administration controls at the J. B. Latham Regional Plant fail and cause a release of chlorine, there are several mechanisms in the plant to minimize the impact:  1) chlorine sensors / detectors, 2) alarms, and 3) emergency vapor scrubber system.  The chlorine sensors that trigger audible and visual alarms are located in the chlorinator room and the chlorine storage room.  Once a chlorine leak of 0.2 ppm is detected by the sensors, the ventilation system that continuously circulates the air in the chlorine building will be shut off by the emergency vapor scrubber system. \n\nThe emergency chlorine scrubber system at the J. B. Latham Regional Plant is designed and built by RJ Environmental Incorporated.  The scrubber system consists three stage chemical absorption system:  one horizontal crossflow spray scrubber followed by two horizontal crossflow packed bed sections.  The released chlorine gas is absorbed and reacted with caustic solution. The system is designed with the ventilation rate of 3000 acfm and the maximum discharge chlorine concentration of 5 ppm.\n\nIn addition, common industry standards, policies, and procedures are utilized to ensure safe practices are being performed.  This includes common practices recommended by the Chlorine Institute.\n\nFIVE YEAR A"

      "SummaryText": "CCIDENT HISTORY\n\nBased on the Hazard Assessment (January 23, 2004) review of the accident history (April 1999 - April 2004), there have been no releases of chlorine that exceeded the Federal Reportable Quantity of 10 pounds or the California threshold of any release at either Plant. In addition, there have been no injuries resulting from a chlorine release. \n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe SOCWA has an emergency response plan in effect at the facility.  The Emergency Response Plan (Plan) is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of the PSM/RMP document.  This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives: \n\n    1.)    To save lives.\n    2.)    To minimize and avoid injuries.\n    3.)    To protect the environment.\n    4.)    To minimize property damage.\n\nThe SOCWA maintains a safety committee whose members include the emergency coordinators for the facility.  The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility. \n\nThe Plan also includes the Emergency training for all SOCWA employees. The SOCWA performs periodic emergency evacuation drills every 90 days to enhance the emergency response skills of its personnel.\n\nThe Emergency Response Plan is reviewed and updated by the SOCWA J. B. Regional Plant responsible person, Mr. Michael Wilson at least once a year.  This Plan will be review and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM, RMP, and CalARP regulations, and to ensure that the plan is kept current.\n\nThe SOCWA has coordinated emergency response efforts withe the local fire department,  Orange County Fire Department.  In the case of a chlorine-related emergency, its is the policy of SOCWA to evacuate the employees and to allow the fire department to respond to the emergency (potentially with the assistance of trained facility personnel).\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nSOCWA has taken a pro-active a"

The annual emergency response drills are documented and mitigation measures to improve the Team?s response are continuously being reviewed. SOCWA has implemented all recommendations from the initial technical studies, as well as all recommendations from the Process Hazard Analysis Revalidation (July 29, 2003). \n\nThe Process Safety Management team is planning to complete several items over the next year as their continued effort to provide a safe work environment for the facility employees.  These changes include the following items:\n\n1.  Continue to train all employees in Process Safety Management and the facility Safety Plan/Programs.\n\n2.   Continue to have employee involvement in Safety Plan Development.\n\n3.  Continue employee involvement through safety team participation.\n\n4.  Continue internal and external safety audits/inspections and implement changes as needed."
