The facility complies with NFPA-57 requirements for LNG storage, and it is the facility's policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws. The facility's system is designed, installed, maintained, and operated to utilize current technology, safety, and control devices to ensure effective and safe operation, emergency shutdown, and fire prevention and fire fighting, etc. The facility has developed its emergency response procedures, and trained the personnel.\n\nYOUR FACILITY AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED. The facility is owned and operated by IMCO Recycling of Utah, Inc. It is an aluminum production facility, using liquefied natural gas (LNG) as fuel. The LNG is stored in a horizontal cylindrical tank. The system consists of the tank, associated piping, valves, burners, etc. The regulated substance handled is methane which is the major component (99%) of LNG. Methane is a non-toxic, flammable, and clean burning gas. The maximum allowed inventory of LNG at the site is 38,379 gallons (135,900 lbs).\n\nTHE WORST-CASE RELEASE SECNARIO. By using EPA's 40 CFR part 68 and OCA Guidance, it is determined that the worst-case scenario is failure of the storage container when it has the maximum allowed inventory, resulting in a vapor cloud explosion involving the total quantity which becomes vapor in 8.8 minutes. The resulting distance to the endpoint extends offsite. Since this facility is located in a relatively remote, unoccupied area, the worst-case scenario would not affect anyone beyond the facility's property. It should be pointed out that no explosion of unconfined methane vapor cloud has ever happened, nor is it considered a credible accident.\n\nTHE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION. The facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule and all applicable state and local codes and regulations. The LNG"

We have never had an accident involving LNG or methane that caused deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place.\n\nTHE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM. The facility does not have an emergency response program as defined by EPA's Risk Management Program. However, it does have emergency response procedures in its Operator's Emergency Manual and Supervisor's Safety Manual. All the emergency response procedures were reviewed/updated in March 1999. The personnel have been trained to follow the procedures when an emergency situation occurs. The most recent emergency response training for the facility's employees was done in April 1999. It is the facility's policy to immediately call the Wendover Fire Department in case of fire. The local Fire Department is familiar with the process and experienced in fighting hydrocarbon-fuel fires. The local Fire Department and/or EMS will be contacted as needed.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY. None."
