The chemical accident prevention provisions require an executive summary in the Risk Management Plan (RMP) submission to EPA. Per 40 CFR 68.155, the owner or operator shall provide in the RMP an executive summary that includes a brief description of the following elements:\r\n(a) The accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at the stationary source;\r\n(b) The stationary source and regulated substances handled;\r\n(c) The general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps;\r\n(d) The five-year accident history;\r\n(e) The emergency response program; and\r\n(f) Planned changes to improve safety.\r\n\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n\r\nThe Facility complies with OSHA's 29 CFR 1910.111 requirements for anhydrous ammonia storage, and it is the facility's policy to adhere to applicable federal, state, and local laws.  If an emergency were to occur, it is KF's policy to notify the Marshall County Emergency Management Agency(EMA) or the Sheriff's Office.\r\n\r\n\r\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance\r\n\r\nThe Marshalltown Terminal stores anhydrous ammonia in two 30,000 ton refrigerated tanks, one 90,000 gallon bullet tank, and one 61,000 gallon bullet tank. The total storage capacity of anhydrous ammonia at the facility is 120,800,000 pounds.\r\n\r\nAnhydrous ammonia is the only toxic substance regulated under the Risk Management Program (RMP) that is present at the Marshalltown Terminal in amounts above threshold quantity.  The terminal is subject to the Prevention Program/Program 3 requirements. \r\n\r\n\r\nPotential Release Scenarios\r\n\r\nThe facility evaluated both worst-case release scenarios and alternative release s"

KF's evaluation took into account process knowledge, hazard review, mitigation measures and safe-guards (i.e. dike, emergency shut-downs, etc.) in place.\r\n\r\n\r\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention\r\n\r\nThe facility complies with EPA's chemical accident prevention rule (40 CRF 68) and applicable state and local codes and regulations.  The anhydrous ammonia system is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.111 and relevant American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) standards.\r\n\r\n\r\nFive-Year Accident History\r\n\r\nOn January 8, 2016, an equipment failure at the Marshalltown Terminal resulted in a release of anhydrous ammonia. Based on engineering estimates, approximately 2250 pounds of ammonia were released. There were no onsite or offsite deaths, injuries or property damage. However, traffic on Garwin Road, North of the Terminal, was briefly diverted and one residence located to the west of the terminal was evacuated as precautionary measures. The cause of the release was 1/2 stainless steel tubing minimum flow line for hot pump P-4 which fractured at the upper fitting.  This event was reported to regulatory agencies.\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program\r\n\r\nIn the event of an emergency involving the anhydrous ammonia system, it is the facility's policy to notify the Marshall County EMA and request response to the emergency.  The facility has discussed this policy with the Local Emergency Planning Committee.  A specific Emergency Response Plan for the terminal is in place and that plan has been coordinated with local officials.  The Emergency Response Program provides the essential planning for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\r\n\r\nInternal and third party compliance audits will ensure that the level of safety protection at the terminal is periodically evaluated for improvements.\r\n\r\nAn ongoing dialogue"
