Our Plant Manager has the overall responsibility for ensuring that our facility operates in a safe and reliable manner.  This includes overseeing implementation of the elements of our Risk Management Program.  To ensure that our program is appropriately developed and implemented, our Plant Manager has assigned the role of RMP Coordinator to a staff member with the authority delegated directly from the Plant Manager, and is responsible for coordinating the development, implementation, and integration of the RMP elements as is required under Section 68.15 of the RMP rule.\n\n\n\n2.

Toluene Diisocyanate (TDI), which is regulated by EPAs RMP rule, is one of the reactants required to manufacture polyurethane foam.  TDI is received at the plant by railcar and tanker trucks that have double-wall protection.  It is stored in two tanks in the contained bulk storage tank room.  The TDI is then transferred to the process utilizing a computer-controlled system.\n\n\n\nAccess to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, management personnel, and contractors.  The maximum amount of TDI that can be stored at this facility is 30,085 gallons.  \n\n\n\n\n\n3.  The general accidental release prevention program and specific prevention steps.\n\nWe take a systematic, proactive approach to preventing accidental releases of chemicals.
