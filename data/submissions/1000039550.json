The Plan includes an analysis of the potential offsite consequences of an accidental release, a five-year accident history, and a release prevention and emergency response program.  \n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nWilbur-Ellis has implemented release prevention and emergency response procedures to minimize the potential for accidental releases of hazardous materials.  Emergency response procedures including evacuation procedures and notification procedures have been implemented by Wilbur-Ellis.  In addition, Wilbur-Ellis has developed operating procedures and preventative maintenance activities to reduce the likelihood of accidental releases.\n\n\n\nThis Plan and the emergency response procedures document the accidental release prevention, safety, and emergency policies in place at Wilbur-Ellis.\n\n\n\nDescription of Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nWilbur-Ellis is located at 2901 County Road in Muleshoe, Texas (the \"facility\").  Wilbur-Ellis is a retailer of fertilizer in the form of anhydrous ammonia stored under pressure.  There are two anhydrous ammonia storage tanks located at the facility with maximum capacities of approximately 12,000 gallons and 8,000 gallons.  The anhydrous ammonia is transferred from the storage tanks into 1,000 gallon nurse tanks.  A maximum total of four nurse tanks containing anhydrous ammonia are stored at the facility at any given time.  The contents of the nurse tanks are sold to the local farming community for use as fertilizer.\n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nWilbur-Ellis has developed and implemented this Plan with the objective of complying with the requirements and guidelines set forth by the Federal R"

The Plan's purpose is to enhance the facility's existing safety programs implemented at the site to reduce the possibility of accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia that could cause harm to employees, the public and the environment.  The emergency response program, documented in the emergency response procedures, includes accidental release prevention and chemical specific prevention steps.\n\n\n\nWilbur-Ellis ensures that equipment meets the appropriate industry standards prior to use.  Wilbur-Ellis implements operating procedures and maintenance procedures, in accordance with manufacturer and industry specifications, to prevent accidental releases at the facility.  Chemical specific prevention steps implemented at the site include excess flow valves, pressure relief valves, emergency shut off valves with cables that run along the length of the horizontal storage tanks for quick access and ammonia training for personnel.\n\n\n\n\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\n\n\nThere have been no qualifying accidents involving ammonia in the five-year period prior to the completion of this Plan.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\n\n\nThe facility coordinates with the Earth Fire Department (\"fire department\") regarding specific actions to be taken in response to an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia.  The facility has established emergency evacuation procedures to evacuate the site and notify the appropriate agencies regarding a release.  The facility's emergency response program is documented in the facility's Emergency Response Procedures.  The emergency procedures contain the following key elements:\n\n\n\n1.    Procedures for informing local agencies responsible for responding to accidental releases.\n\n2.    Information on emergency health care.\n\n3.    Emergency response training for employees.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nPlans to improve safety at the facility were developed based on the results of a hazard evaluation and compliance audit by an outside contra"

Develop a complete approved equipment list with specifications and maintain documentation.\n\n2.    Document employee training on maintaining the on-going mechanical integrity of the anhydrous ammonia, process, hazards of the process, how to avoid or correct unsafe conditions, and procedures applicable to the job tasks. \n\n3.    Document contactor training and qualification records and maintain onsite. \n\n4.    Install locks and caps for fill valves.\n\n5.    Install break away valves on the ammonia fill hoses used at the nurse tank filling stations.\n\n6.    Replace pressure relief valves and rain caps on the storage tanks that have been painted and replace with uncoated pressure relief valves and rain caps.\n\n7.    Install locks on compressor and controls for security.\n\n8.    Install identification labels on storage tanks.\n\n9.    Ensure that liquid lines and valves are painted orange to distinguish them from the vapor lines and valves.\n\n10.    Evaluate potential installation of a remote shutdown system for the ammonia system.\n\n11.    Evaluate potential installation of a fenced perimeter for added security. \n\n12.    Evaluate venting ammonia to a container with water when bleeding the ammonia system."
