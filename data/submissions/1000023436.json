      "SummaryText": "This executive summary provides a brief overview of the Risk Management Program (RMP) and the associated policies at the Marston Water Treatment Plant, one of several facilities owned and operated by Denver Water.\n\n\n\nPrevention and Response Policies\n\n\n\nDenver Water believes that it is important to provide a safe workplace to its employees and minimize the impact of its operations on the surrounding community and the environment.  Accordingly, Denver Water has developed proactive safety and environmental programs, which are reliant upon active employee participation and management leadership and support.  This same proactive philosophy was employed in the development and implementation of the Marston Water Treatment Plant RMP for the chlorine system.  \n\n\n\nThe RMP prevention program is arguably the most important element of the rule.  Its program elements require the active participation of facility employees and management in conducting activities aimed at preventing accidental releases of regulated chemicals.  If prevention activities could be completely successful, there would be no need for emergency response activities, since no releases would occur.  Accordingly, a well-developed and properly-implemented prevention program will lower the possibility of an accidental release and minimize the consequences of a release should one occur.\n\n\n\nDenver Water takes an active role in preventing accidental releases at all of its facilities by ensuring that its employees are well-informed regarding the hazards associated with the regulated processes (e.g., chlorine at the Marston Water Treatment Plant) and actively participated in comprehensive hazard analyses.  The system employees are properly trained in the safe operation of the covered process and the safe handling of treatment chemicals.  They are aided in this work by complete, understandable system operating procedures.\n\n\n\nDenver Water management understands its duty to provide a safe working environment and to take m"

This understanding is reflected in procedures described and referenced in the Marston Water Treatment Plant RMP procedures and policies.\n\n\n\nAs for emergency response, Denver Water has established procedures for emergency response and notification when necessary.  Marston Water Treatment Plant employees are responsible for providing initial response to a release of chlorine.  Releases contained within the plant facilities will be remedied by plant personnel and equipment, in accordance with OSHAs Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response (HAZWOPER) Standard (29 CFR 1910.120).  Releases affecting (or with the potential to affect) areas outside the facility will require outside assistance, and local emergency response entities will be solicited for emergency response support.\n\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nThe Marston Water Treatment Plant is located at 6100 West Quincy Avenue in Denver, Colorado.\n\n\n\nThe facility provides treated drinking water for Denver Water customers.  Facility influent consists of flows from the South Platte River and uses conventional water treatment technologies to remove solids, and pathogens (chemical treatment, flocculation, sedimentation, and filtration).  The water is further treated by the addition of chlorine, aqueous ammonia, and sodium hydroxide.  The chlorine (Cl2) is stored in the disinfection building.\n\n\n\nThe maximum intended inventory of chlorine at the Marston Plant is 48,000 pounds (24 one-ton containers).  Therefore, the plant is regulated under the RMP rule due to the volume of chlorine stored and used at the facility.\n\n\n\nPrevention Steps for Chlorine\n\n\n\nThe prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps are described in detail in the Marston Water Treatment Plant RMP manual.  The prevention program includes the following elements:\n\n-Process safety information, which includes information pertaining to the haza"

The scrubber will pull vapors out of both the chlorine storage and feed rooms.  An exhaust fan pulls air into the scrubber and into a multistage chamber, exposing it to caustic spray and a mist eliminator prior to discharge to the exhaust stack.  The scrubber has an exhaust detector to monitor the chlorine concentration in the discharge stack. Dampers allow for makeup air to enter the chlorine storage and feed rooms, replacing air that is pulled through the scrubber.  The scrubber's discharge stack is curved downward at its exhaust point to prevent water from getting in.  The end of this vent stack is 6 feet above the roofline.  "

The scrubber will pull 3000 cfm from the chlorine storage room, and 500 cfm from the chlorine feed room.\n\n\n\nThe chlorine storage room has 3 leak detectors.  There are also 2 leak detectors in the chlorine injector/feed room. An alarm of 4 ppm or greater at any of these 5 leak detectors will activate the scrubber.  They will also trigger red, flashing alarm beacons, audible alarms (local and over the plant intercom system), and control room alarms to warn other personnel.  Leak detectors will be calibrated for a range of 0-30 ppm, with digital chlorine level readout locally, outside of the room, and in the control room.  The system also closes seven of the eight emergency shutoff valves on the on-line group of ton containers, and closes all emergency shutoff valves on the remaining two off-line groups of ton containers.\n\n\n\nThe chlorine scrubber will be maintained and tested on a regular basis to ensure proper operation during a chlorine release event.\n\n\n\nAccident History\n\n\n\nThere have been no releases of hazardous air pollutants from the Marston Water Treatment Plant with off-site consequences during the past five years.  The chlorine system was installed in 1998, with construction completed in 1999.  The system incorporates up-to-date safety measures to help prevent releases.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\n\n\nDenver Water has established procedures for emergency response and notification when necessary.

Employee meetings that focus on safety issues will be held regularly at the Marston Water Treatment Plant.  Employees will be encouraged and trained to recognize hazards and to present ideas to eliminate them or to minimize the potential consequences of those hazards.\n\n\n\nAs part of the development of the Marston Water Treatment Plant RMP program, a hazard analyses was conducted with key employees to meet the prevention program requirements.  During these sessions, recommendations were made for the purpose of improving safety and preventing accidental chemical releases.  Each recommendation has been considered for implementation.  Though not all recommendations may be implemented, all have been considered. "
