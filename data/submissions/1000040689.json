A Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) has been reviewed and revised to enable the employees to handle chlorine in a safe and efficient manner.\n\n\n\nThe Chanute Water Treatment Plant has chosen to be a non-responding facility in the event of an emergency.  Responsibility for emergency response to an accidental release has been given to the Chanute Police and Fire Departments and the State and Local Emergency Response Centers.\n\n\n\nStationary Sources and Regulated Substances.\n\n\n\nThe Chanute Water Treatment Plant utilizes chlorine as a disinfectant for the treated drinking water.  The maximum inventory and threshold quantities for this chemical are shown below.\n\n\n\n     Chemical        Maximum Inventory (lb.)    Threshold Quantity (lb.)\n\n    Chlorine                       12,000                         2,500\n\n        \n\n \n\n \n\nHazard Analysis\n\n\n\nThe City of Chanute has compiled a Hazard Analysis to assist in minimizing releases.  This Program includes; safety information on the covered chemicals, hazard reviews, operating and maintenance schedules, training, compliance audits, incident investigations, and emergency response procedures.\n\n\n\nFive-year Accident History\n\n\n\nIn the last 5 years the Chanute Water Treatment Plant has had no accident from the covered processes that resulted in deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering-in-place, property damage, or environmental dama"
