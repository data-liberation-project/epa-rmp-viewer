The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first-aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post-incident cleanup and decontamination requirements.  In addition, the terminal has developed procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment, as well as instructions that address the use of emergency response equipment.  Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties.  The ERP is updated when necessary based on modifications made to terminal processes or operations. The emergency response program changes are administered through the MOC process, which includes informing and/or training affected personnel in the changes.\n\nThe overall emergency response program for the terminal is coordinated with the local fire department and the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  This coordination includes periodic meetings of the committee, which are attended by local emergency response officials, local government officials, and industry representatives.  The terminal has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., fire department).  This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.  In addition to periodic LEPC meetings, the terminal conducts periodic emergency drills that involve the LEPC and emergency response organizations, and the terminal provides annual refresher training to local emergency responders regarding the hazards of regulated substances at the terminal."

According to the US Census data (Appendix B), approximately 9,702 people within the facility\u0092s zip code, 77547, may be affected by a BLEVE alternative scenario. The RMP*Comp modeling results are provided in Appendix A. In the event of a release of this magnitude, the facility should make every effort to verify that the impacted area has been evacuated. The facility should notify all neighboring businesses and industrial complexes in the event of this accidental release scenario. No sensitive environmental receptors were identified as potentially being affected by this alternative scenario. \n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM \n\nChevron views the health and safety of its employees and the communities in which it operates as its top priority.  On a global scale, Chevron has implemented its Operational Excellence (OE) process that establishes the standards by which all Chevron business units must operate.  Guided by the Chevron OE process, the terminal has implemented a robust OSHA PSM program to protect its people, the local community, and the integrity of process equipment.  Refer to Section 7 of this RMP submission for a detailed discussion of the terminal's OSHA PSM program. \n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nAt the time of this RMP submission, there are no RMP-related accidents to be reported. The terminal did not experience RMP-related accidents since the butane blending process became operational.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\n\nThe terminal maintains a written Emergency Response Plan (ERP), which is in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment.

Approximately 9,702 people may be affected by a release in the area. Google Earth was used to assess the surrounding area around the facility. No schools or hospitals were identified within the impact areas, however residential areas were found within the worst-case and BLEVE scenarios. The next public receptors that the worst-case and BLEVE scenarios encounter would be the Houston Ship Channel (a.k.a., The Buffalo Bayou) and the Galena Park Water Treatment plant. Additionally, within each scenarios impact area, there are multiple industrial facilities. No sensitive environmental receptors were identified as potentially being affected by the worst-case release scenario.\n\nALTERNATIVE FLAMMABLE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\nAs a RMP Prevention Program 3 facility, the facility is required to submit one alternative release scenario for an accidental flammable release.  A possible alternative flammable release scenario is a release at the butane unloading area as a result of a truck accidentally pulling away while still connected or a hose misconnection or malfunction during the unloading operation. This scenario was identified as a possibility in the process hazards analysis for the butane blending process.  The butane released could potentially ignite due to an engine spark and could cause the butane truck being unloaded to catch fire or reach a critical temperature, eventually resulting in a boiling liquid expanding vapor explosion (BLEVE).  The BLEVE scenario yields a more conservative endpoint distance than that of a flash fire or vapor cloud fire thus the BLEVE was selected as the alternative scenario.  In the event of a flash fire or vapor cloud fire, this BLEVE alternative scenario should be referred to when"

      "SummaryText": ", isobutane, isopentane, hexane, olefins, normal pentane, and propane.  The flammable mixture possesses physical characteristics of a NFPA No. 4 flammable material and the weight percentages of each constituent vary; therefore, for modeling purposes, it is assumed that the entire weight of the flammable mixture is normal butane.  It should be noted that an analysis was also performed using the other constituents in the flammable mixture but the resulting endpoint distance was no greater using any of these constituents either as the entire weight of the flammable mixture or in varying percentages.  Because the two storage vessels are located in close proximity to one another, they are considered to be co-located and the catastrophic rupture of both storage vessels is considered to be the worst-case release scenario. The facility utilizes administrative controls to not allow the vessels to be filled beyond eighty (80) percent capacity; therefore, the storage volume of each vessel is 72,000 gallons.  In addition, according to the process safety information an estimated 1,611 gallons of the flammable mixture may be contained in process piping and associated appurtenances, and this quantity is also included in the worst-case release scenario as these may rupture in the event of a catastrophic release.  Therefore, the maximum storage capacity of this flammable mixture in the two 90,000-gallon storage vessels, process piping, and associated appurtenances for the worst-case flammable release scenario taking into account administrative controls is estimated at 716,493.5 pounds (145,611 gallons), assuming a specific gravity of 0.59 for the flammable mixture.\n\nThe latitude and longitude of the storage vessels are 29\u00b0 44\u0092 40.239\u0094 North (29.744511\u00b0) and 95\u00b0 12\u0092 34.0662\u0094 West (-95.209463\u00b0), respectively.

The terminal is a petroleum products transfer facility, which began operation in 1966. The facility has pipeline, truck transfer, and storage areas.\n\nChevron Products Company has a butane blending process at the terminal to inject butane into its gasoline immediately prior to truck loading of various gasoline products.  The terminal receives butane via tanker trucks and stores the butane in two 90,000-gallon pressurized horizontal butane storage bullets.  The butane blending operation and associated butane storage render the terminal subject to 40 CFR 68 requirements.  Moreover, this operation renders the terminal subject to the United States Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) - Process Safety Management (PSM) of Highly Hazardous Chemicals, codified in 29 CFR \u00a71910.119.  The facility also stores other flammable substances in pressurized spheres which are covered under the OSHA PSM standard.  As such, the terminal is subject to RMP Prevention Program 3 requirements.\n\nChevron and the terminal have a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety, which is demonstrated by our efforts in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will evaluate the situation, take actions within the capabilities of the facility, and/or notify the necessary outside agencies.\n\nWORST-CASE FLAMMABLE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\nThe two 90,000-gallon storage vessels at the facility carry a flammable mixture consisting of normal butane"
