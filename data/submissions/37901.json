The Water Pollution Control Facility is located at 4027 4th Street SE,  in Everett, Washington.  The wastewater is disinfected by introducing chlorine (Cl2) to wastewater to kill harmful organisms.\n\nCl2 is the only toxic chemical regulated by the Risk Management Program (RMP) that is present at the EWPCF.  The chlorine system is closely monitored and controlled to prevent accidental releases to the environment.  It is EWPCF's policy to manage the chlorine process \"using the highest standards for the protection of our people, the community, and the environment in order to ensure a safe and productive\".\n\nRegulated Chemicals\n\nEWPCF uses chlorine as a disinfectant to eliminate harmful organisms in the water before discharge.  Cl2, a gas at ambient temperatures and pressure, is delivered to EWFP in 1-ton containers and unloaded into an enclosed process building.   \n\nIn the unlikely event of an accidental release, Cl2 would either be released directly into the air as a gas or evaporate into the air from liquid pools formed in low spots on the floor.  The primary health affect of Cl2 gas is respiratory irritation.  In sufficient concentrations, the gas irritates mucous membranes, the respiratory tract and the eyes.  Following a release, Cl2 gas will migrate downwind and disperse to below health effect concentrations.\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response\n\nThe toxicity of Cl2 at high concentrations make it necessary for EWPCF to observe certain safety precautions to prevent unnecessary human exposure, and reduce the threat to the personal health of employees as well as nearby members of the community.  It is EWPCF's policy to adhere to all applicable federal and state rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle toxic chemicals including equipment design and safe handling proc"

      "SummaryText": "edures used to operate the equipment.  EWPCF's release prevention program is based on four principles; inherently safe design, effective written procedures, training, and the goal of continuous improvement.  The chlorine storage and handling equipment meets or exceeds design codes and standards as well as incorporating good engineering practices recommended by industry groups, such as The Chlorine Institute.  As a result, EWPCF's equipment incorporates inherently safe designs.  Written operating procedures are prepared and reviewed annually for accuracy and safety.  Operating and maintenance personnel are thoroughly trained on proper procedures and safety hazards, and are provided with regular refresher training.  Equipment and procedures are frequently evaluated and updated with the goal of continuous improvement in both operation and safety.\n\nEWPCF's emergency response program integrates OSHA's and EPA's preparedness planning response and training requirements.  In the event of an accidental release, the emergency response plan includes notifying 911 dispatch, who will notify local responders.  Plant personnel receive classroom training on implementation of the response plan in addition to participating in training exercises.\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nDuring the five year period between May 1994 and June 1999, the EWFP has not had a reportable release of Cl2."
