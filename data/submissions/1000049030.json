      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\n\nMarch 2015\n\n\n\nMiami Products and Chemicals Co. is a chemical manufacturer, chemical repackager, and distributor of swimming pool equipment and supplies.  The primary product produced at the Fairborn, Ohio facility is liquid sodium hypochlorite (bleach).  The bleach is produced by reacting two raw materials, sodium hydroxide and liquid chlorine, in a continuous, liquid-phase reactor.  The intermediate product is then filtered to remove impurities, tested, and stored in 12,500 gallon tanks prior to loading into tank trucks for shipment to various customers.  \n\n\n\nThe manufacturing process is highly automated and is controlled by two chemical technicians with more than twenty years of experience in the bleach manufacturing industry.  \n\n\n\nThe two raw materials, sodium hydroxide and chlorine, are considered hazardous materials.  The sodium hydroxide is received in tank truck quantities and stored in two 12,500 gallon FRP storage tanks.  The sodium hydroxide is then pumped to the reactor.  The storage tanks are located inside the building and contained within a diked structure.  The chlorine is received in ninety ton tank cars, which are held on a private rail spur.  A maximum of six chlorine tank cars may be stationed on the private rail spur. When used, the liquid chlorine is fed directly from the tank car to the liquid-phase reactor.  The offloading station has two spots, only one of which is connected to the manufacturing process at any given time.  \n\n\n\nThe worst case scenario for a potential chemical release centers on the release of liquid chlorine from a ninety ton rail car.  Catastrophic failure of the tank car, failure of a transfer hose, or failure of piping or valves could, if not controllable, could result in the release of up to 180,000 pounds of chlorine into the environment.  Because the tank cars are not inter-connected during use or storage, simultaneous release of more than one car is not a considered scenario.\n\n\n\nThe Fairborn facilit"

The nearest business is I-Supply, which is located approximately 75 yards east of the facility.  Other sides are bounded by vacant lots.\n\n\n\nThe Fairborn facility is new and incorporates state-of-the-art technology to prevent and control chlorine releases.  The offloading system is equipped with an extensive interlock system that, when activated, automatically closes the tank car valves and prevents chlorine flow to the rest of the process.  The interlock system may be activated by high or low pressures, by operator choice, or by any one of a series of chlorine monitors positioned around the offloading station and in the processing building.  \n\n\n\nThe Fairborn facility has implemented a comprehensive process safety program based on the extensive experience gained in operating a sister facility in Dayton, Ohio, and the new technology being installed.  Elements of the program include operator and maintenance training, standard operating procedures, regular inspections and audits, management of change, and emergency response plans.  As part of this program, the Fairborn facility will adopt Chlorine Institute guidelines and recommendations for safe operation of chlorine facilities and units.  \n\n\n\nFor added site security, the Fairborn facility is monitored by two, independent, CCTV and motion detection systems.  The first is controlled by the facility, but monitored under contract by Sonitrol.  The second system is controlled by the Fairborn police department and monitored from their dispatch center.  Both systems are designed to monitor for intruders, or to detect chlorine plumbs.\n\n\n\nThe facility manager is responsible for the safety program, and will have two chemical technicians trained in emergency response to chlorine releases.  The Fairborn facility will maintain two \"C\" kits for use by these technicians, or by the local fire department, in the event of a leaking chlori"
