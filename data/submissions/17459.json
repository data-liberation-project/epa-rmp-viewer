Many of our employees are members of the Local Emergency Planning Committee in their areas.  Our facilities have written emergency preparedness plans that are updated regularly.  \n\nAshland facilities typically host open houses every 3 to 5 years as an opportunity for neighbors to learn about our commitment to safety.  Ashland makes an effort to support our communities through sponsorship of local activities and participation in many local organizations.\n\nA description of your facility and the regulated substances handled:  \n\nThis facility is a chemical distribution warehouse.  The regulated substances arrive at the warehouse loading dock, are transferred to storage, and subsequently loaded for shipment without ever opening the containers.  The regulated substances are hydrochloric acid and phosphorus oxychloride.  \n\nFor more information, visit our web site at www.ashdist.com or contact the Plant Manager.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario:\n\nThe USEPA RMP regulations require the worst-case release scenario to assume that the entire contents of the largest vessel of a regulated substance in a process are released.

The passive mitigation considered in the analysis was the storage of the phosphorus oxychloride in an enclosed building.\n\nThe alternative-case release scenario:\n\nThe USEPA RMP regulations require an analysis of the alternative-case release scenarios.  The alternative-case release scenario represents an accidental release that is more reasonable than the worst-case, but is still highly unlikely to occur.  Based on our analysis using USEPA-approved methods, the alternative-case release scenario for phosphorus oxychloride could impact offsite public receptors.  There were no specific administrative controls or active mitigation measures considered in the analysis to limit the distance reported.  The passive mitigation considered in the analysis was the storage of the phosphorus oxychloride in an enclosed building.\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps: \n\nThis facility is operated in strict accordance with the USEPA prevention program requirements.  A written management system is in place along with written operating procedures.  Our management system procedures ensure rigorous training for operations employees, numerous management checks and balances, and strict attention to changes in the operations with a thorough review and examination of potential incidents that could lead to an accidental release.  Ashland maintains a 24-hour corporate emergency reporting system that can speedily coordinate emergency response with management and quickly communicate key first aid or medical information to local health care providers.  This facility has emergency medical treatment information readily available for use in an emergency.  \n\nFive-year accident history:\n\nWe have never had a release of hydrochloric acid or phosphorus oxychloride that resulted in or could have resulted"
