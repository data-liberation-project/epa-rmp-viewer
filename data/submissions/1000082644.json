These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  Specific departments within Chevron's Mid-Continent Business Unit (MCBU) are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.

This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our process.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, gas plant trained personnel will evaluate the situation, and with assistance from Van Field personnel and the Van Volunteer Fire Department will respond to control and contain the release.\r\n\r\n\tDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\r\n\r\n\tThe Van Gas Plant, located in Van, TX, operates a process to produce petroleum product called NGL or Natural Gas Liquids. The boundaries of the stationary source are defined by the external fence surrounding the facility. NGL is a flammable liquid that is stored under pressure and is composed of methane, ethane, propane, normal-butane, iso-butane, normal-pentane and iso-pentane which are regulated flammable hydrocarbons. The Van Gas Plant does not use and/or process any regulated toxic substances. \r\n\r\n\t\r\n\tGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\r\n\r\n\tThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the plant.  Because the process at the Gas Plant that is regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) risk management program (RMP) regulation is also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) process safety management (PSM) standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the system in place to implement the accidental release prevention program.\r\n\r\n\tEmployee Participation\r\n\r\n\tManagement at the Van Gas Plant encourages employees to participate in all facets of process"

This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready.  The PSSR review team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness.  A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\r\n\r\n\tMechanical Integrity\r\n\r\n\tThe Van Gas Plant has well-established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition.  The basic aspects of this program include: (1) conducting training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and test, (4) correcting identified deficiencies, and (5) applying quality assurance measures.  In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process.\r\n\r\n\tMaintenance personnel receive training on (1) an overview of the process, (2) safety and health hazards, (3) applicable maintenance procedures, (4) emergency response plans, and (5) applicable safe work practices to help ensure that they can perform their jobs in a safe manner.  Written procedures help ensure that work is performed in a consistent manner and provide a basis for training.  Inspections and test are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels).

The Van Plant incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs.  This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper material and spare parts are used when repairs are made.\r\n\r\n\tSafe Work Practices\r\n\r\n\tThe Van Gas Plant has long-standing safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety.  Examples of these include (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) an Isolation of Hazardous Energy (IHE) procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous substances before process piping or equipment is opened, (4) a permit and procedure to control spark-producing activities (i.e., hot work), and (5) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space.  These procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\r\n\r\n\tManagement of Change\r\n\r\n\tThe Van Gas Plant has a system to manage changes to the covered process.  This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process-operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented.  Changes are reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.

Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\r\n\r\n\t \r\nOperating Procedures\r\n\r\n\tThe Van Gas Plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) normal startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, when they exist, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process.  These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  These procedures are periodically reviewed and necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.\r\n\r\n\tIn addition, the Van Gas Plant maintains Safe Operating Limits/Consequences of Deviation tables that provide guidance on how to respond to upper or lower limit exceedances for specific process or equipment parameters.

Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human errors.\r\n\r\n\tSpecialized Safety Features\r\n\r\n\tThe Van Gas Plant has safety features to help contain/control a release and reduce the consequences of (mitigate) a release.  The following types of safety features are used in the covered process:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tRelease Containment/Control\r\n\r\n\t1. Process relief valves \r\n\r\n\t2. Valves to permit isolation of the process (manual or automated)\r\n\r\n\t3. Automated shutdown and/or alarm systems for specific process parameters (e.g., high pressure, low pressure, high level, low level, etc.)\r\n\r\n\t4. Curbing to contain liquid releases\r\n\r\n\t5. Redundant equipment and instrumentation \r\n\r\n\tRelease Mitigation\r\n\r\n\t1. Fire Extinguishers\r\n\r\n\t2. Personal protective equipment (e.g., fire retardant clothing)\r\n\r\n\r\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nThe Van Gas Plant has an excellent record (no incidents that resulted in onsite or offsite effects) of accident prevention over the past 5 years.  However, if an incident did occur, we would investigate the incident very carefully to determine ways to prevent similar incidents from recurring.\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\r\n\r\nThe Van Gas Plant maintains a written emergency action plan, which is in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment.  The plan consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The action plan addresses proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, and notification of local emergency response agencies if a release occurs.

The emergency action plan is updated when necessary based on modifications made to the gas plant process or other Van Gas Plant facilities.  \r\n\r\nThe overall emergency action plan for the Van Gas Plant is coordinated with the Van Zandt County, TX local emergency planning committee (LEPC) but more specifically with the Van Fire Department.  This coordination includes periodic meetings which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials, and industry representatives.  The Van Gas Plant has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC official and emergency response organizations (e.g., fire department).  This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident. The Van Gas Plant conducts periodic emergency table top/evacuation drills that the LEPC and emergency response organizations are invited to participate in, and the gas plant provides information to local emergency responders regarding the hazards of regulated substances in the gas plant if they change.\r\n\r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\n\r\nThe Van Gas Plant resolves all findings from PHAs, safety audits and incident investigations, some of which result in modifications to the process.  As conditions are identified where improvements in safety can be made, the Van Gas Plant will maintain an active plan to implement appropriate changes to the overall safety of the system. For example, to address a concern statement/recommendation from the most recent PHA, a section of piping on the JT Skid has been recently replaced and upgraded from 150 class to 600 class, thus providing inherent safety which will prevent loss of containment from happening in the case of overpressure in the system."

      "SummaryText": "ent Investigation\r\n\r\n\tThe Van Gas Plant promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury.  The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to gas plant management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years so that the reports can be reviewed during future PHAs and PHA revalidation. Also, incident investigation reports are shared with affected personnel.\r\n\r\n\tCompliance Audits\r\n\r\n\tTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, the Van Gas Plant periodically conducts an audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented.  Compliance audits are conducted at least every 3 years.  Personnel from other Chevron facilities who are knowledgeable in the audit process participate as audit team members.  The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to gas plant management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are retained.\r\n\r\n\tCHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\n\r\n\tThe process at the Van Gas Plant has hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation.  The following is a description of existing safety features applicable to prevention of accidental releases of regulated"

This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment.  This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\r\n\r\n\tProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\r\n\r\n\tThe Van Gas Plant conducts studies to help ensure that hazards associated with the process are identified and controlled.  Within this studies, the process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\r\n\r\n\tThe Van Gas Plant uses the HazOpS and LOPA methodologies on these studies.  The studies are conducted using a team of people that will be knowledgeable in the specific process hazard analysis methodology used.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\r\n\r\n\tThe PHA team findings are forwarded to local management for resolution.  Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed. The PHA team findings are shared with the affected personnel and the final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\r\n\r\n\tTo help ensure that the process control"

In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years.  All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training. Training is documented for each operator via documentation kept at the facility and in the Competency Management System (CMS).\r\n\r\n\tContractors\r\n\r\n\tThe Van Gas Plant uses contractors to supplement its work force during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the gas plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform gas plant personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.  This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work.  In addition, the Van Gas Plant evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor, along with historical data from our locations. Gas plant personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\r\n\r\n\tPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\r\n\r\n\tThe Van Gas Plant conducts a PSSR for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information.
