WPC follows the City of Huntsville's general safety policy of providing a safety program designed to safeguard all employees, and to minimize the frequency and severity of accidents. In addition to the City's general safety policy, WPC safety policy involves a combined commitment of both management and employees through continuous efforts in reducing/preventing hazardous conditions at all City of Huntsville Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP) facilities. The WPC emergency response policy includes an emergency action plan designed for non-responding facilities involving the coordination with local emergency responders (Huntsville Fire Department-HazMat Unit) and local emergency planning committee (Huntsville-Madison County Emergency Planning Committee) to ensure, in the unlikely event of accidental release, the community and environment has an effective response strategy available.\n\nA description of your facility and the regulated substances handled:\nThe Aldridge Creek Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP), located at 13331 Memorial Parkway South, Huntsville, Alabama, is an 8.4 million-gallon per day (MGD) facility. Treatment processes include screening, grit removal, primary clarification, biological treatment (which incorporates both trickling filter - primary trickling filtration / secondary trickling filtration and oxidation ditch - extended aeration activated sludge), secondary clarification and chlorination.  Sludge treatment and processing involves gravity thickening, digestion (anaerobic and aerobic) and dewatering using sand-drying beds. The treated effluent is discharged to the Tennessee River.  The"

The purpose for the chlorination process is for effluent disinfection and thus to prevent the spread of waterborne diseases. The maximum amount of chlorine on site is twelve (12) one-ton cylinders.\n\nThe worst-case and alternative release scenarios:\nThe Offsite Consequence Analysis (OCA) was conducted by following the guidance outlined in EPA's industry-specific, Risk Management Program Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants document, 40 CFR Part 68-Risk Management Programs document, and the consequence distances were estimated utilizing EPA's RMP*CompTM atmospheric dispersion modeling software.\n\nToxics worst-case release: EPA predefined the assumptions used for this analysis.  This release scenario involves the release of a one-ton chlorine cylinder (2000 lbs.) uniformly, over a 10-minute period, resulting in the greatest distance to a specified endpoint.  Mitigating effects of the chlorine building are considered; i.e., the release rate from the building will be approximately 55 percent (building release-rate-multiplicative factor provided by EPA) less than if the release occurred outdoors.  The estimated distance to the endpoint obtained using EPA's specified parameters is 0.9 miles from the release source. The resulting area extends offsite, and public receptors are within the distance to the endpoint.  The estimated residential population potentially affected is approximately 490.\n\nToxics alternative release: This scenario involves a release due to the uncoupling of a chlorine cylinder transfer hose.  The resulting release takes place indoors (mitigation effects of the building are taken into account) for a period of 10-minutes at a release rate of 30 pounds per minute.  Active mitigation measures are not considered.  Other assumptions (meteorologic"

The estimated residential population potentially affected is 0.  \n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps:\nThe City of Huntsville ensures the Aldridge Creek WWTP facility is designed in compliance with recognized and generally accepted good engineering practices. The facility is designed, built and operated in accordance with all applicable Federal, state and local industry-specific regulations, codes and standards.  The equipment specifications (materials for construction, actual design and tolerances) of any equipment used to store or transfer a regulated substance are appropriate for the specific materials and operations for which it is used. \n\nElements of WPC's accident prevention program include a preventative maintenance and routine equipment inspection program.  An upgraded training program, which augments the current level of training received by operators and maintenance personnel, has also been instituted.  In addition, each department within WPC conducts weekly safety meetings to further enhance WPC's commitment towards accident prevention and community protection.\n\nFive year accident history:\nThe Aldridge Creek WWTP has had no accidental release of chlorine that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage onsite, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage.\n\nThe emergency response program:\nIn the event of an accidental release involving a regulated substance, WPC emergency response procedure is to notify the Huntsville Fire Department (HazMat Unit) and request that they respond to the emergency.  To ensure that an effective response is available, appropriate mechanisms are in place to notify emergency responders when there is a need for a response.  Furthermore, emergency r"

This will help to ensure that, in the unlikely event of a regulated substance release, the community and environment has an effective emergency response strategy available.\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety:\nRecommended actions to improve safety were identified in March 1999, when a hazard review was completed for the facility.  These recommended actions have been evaluated and implemented as required."
