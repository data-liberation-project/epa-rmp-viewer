      "SummaryText": "HALOCARBON PRODUCTS CORPORATION\n\nHalocarbon Products Corporation's plant is located on about 100 acres in the North Augusta Industrial Park at street address 1100 Dittman Court.  Construction of the plant began in 1982 and shipping of product from the state-of-the-art facility began in 1986.  The plant employs about 130 highly skilled people from the surrounding communities.\n\nHalocarbon Products Corporation manufactures fluorinated specialty chemicals including lubricants used for oxygen and aggressive chemical service, flotation fluids used in gyroscopes, acids for agricultural chemicals, alcohols used in the manufacture of pharmaceuticals and the generic inhalation anesthetics halothane and isoflurane.  To produce these products, Halocarbon needs various chemicals on-site.  These chemicals do not pose any unusual hazards when handled and stored properly.  Our employees are trained in identifying and handling the hazards associated with these chemicals in the event of an emergency, such as a fire or spill.\n\nHalocarbon has divided the plant into three main processing areas.  Area 1 and 2 are on the north side of the building and are for processing flammable materials.  Areas 1 and 2 are separated by fire doors.  Area 3 is located on the south side of the building and is used to process non-flammables.  Area 3 is separated from Areas 1 and 2 by the mechanical equipment area and the centrally located control room.\n\nTwo chemicals present at Halocarbon Products Corporation fall under the risk management plan: hydrogen fluoride (HF) and chlorine.  As described later, the worst case release scenarios for both these chemicals involve their storage containers.\n\nA monitoring alarm is in place at the HF storage area to quickly detect leaks.  A water curtain around the storage area can be used to suppress HF leaks.  In addition, there is an emergency dump tank designed to hold the entire contents of the primary HF storage tank.  In the unlikely event of a failure of the primar"

Both tanks are diked.\n\nChlorine is stored in industry standard ton cylinders.  If a leak were to develop in a cylinder, the cylinder kits (both \"A\" and \"B\") required to stop the release are at Halocarbon.  These kits consist of various tools, plugs and gaskets necessary to stop cylinder leaks. Two emergency ton cylinders are always available and are capable of holding the contents of a chlorine cylinder.   In addition, alkaline material is available to construct a \"tent\" to absorb and neutralize the escaping chlorine gas.  Area alarms are in place to warn of a leak for quick response.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nHalocarbon Products Corporation falls under OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) standard.  Processes are closely scrutinized for all aspects of safety in processing and handling.  Whenever a new process is planned or an existing process is modified, a team of highly trained professionals and certified operators hold a formal, structured review of the project.  Any potential problems identified during the review are investigated.  The team must be satisfied with the outcome of these investigations before the project can proceed.  To ensure complete employee involvement, comments are requested from plant operators.  These comments also must be addressed by the team.  Many times a pre-start up safety review is done prior to starting a new or modified process.  This review includes a tour of the process by a team of trained employees to be sure the process is installed correctly.  The team also must be satisfied that standard operating procedures, training and Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) for the process chemicals are complete.  Any incidents in a PSM process are reviewed routinely to see if process improvements are needed.\n\nPrior to an operator being certified on a PSM process, he must pass a test ab"

In order to ensure that operators keep up with process changes, each operator must make a presentation before their peers and managers every year discussing the process, the chemicals handled and how they operate the process.  This operator certification program has worked well for Halocarbon in preventing incidents and releases.\n\nTo minimize the possibility of spilled chemicals getting into the environment, all process areas and truck loading areas are contained.  If there is a spill, the contained material can be reused or properly disposed.\n\nOutside storage tanks are diked.  If a spill occurs, the material collects in the dike.  It is then drained or pumped from the dike to a recovery drum.  There are no automatic pumps in the dikes for rainwater, reducing the possibility of accidentally pumping spilled material to the environment.\n\nHalocarbon uses, stores and ships chemicals in high pressure cylinders.  These cylinders are hydrostatically tested on a regular basis.  Halocarbon has the capability to stop leaks from these cylinders and practices response to a leaking cylinder as part of regular training.\n\nAs part of our emergency response plan, Halocarbon maintains the following equipment:\n\n          Self-contained breathing apparatus\n          Level A response gear\n          Level B response gear\n          Level C response gear\n          Air line respirators\n          Emergency A kit for cylinder repair\n          Emergency B kit for cylinder repair\n          Stretchers for rescue\n          Back board for rescue\n          Automatic external defibrillator\n          Fuel oil absorbent\n          Absorbent \"pigs\"\n          Shovels\n          Brooms\n          Alert meters for hazardous atmospheres\n          First aid kits\n          Neutralizing chemicals for chemical spills\n          Acid-resistant gear\n          Radios for communication\n          Oxygen cylinders and masks\n          Salvage drums\n          Portable emergency dump tanks\n              "

The program is maintained with a computerized tracking system that generates reports to plant management that insure that items get done as scheduled.\n\nThe plant and the tank farms are monitored by a leak detection system.  If the system detects a leak, an alarm sounds in the control room.  All operators are trained in steps to take in responding to a leak alarm, including annual response drills for a stimulated leak.\n\nCONTINGENCY PLAN AND EMERGENCY PROCEDURES\n\nThis plan involves the following steps:\n\n1.

This system is based on the principle that at all times of plant operation there will be at least one person, either on-site or on-call, who will be responsible for directing and coordinating all site emergency response activities.  This person is the Incident Commander and will have the authority to allocate all resources necessary to control an incident.  Additionally, there will be one person responsible for all outside communications.  This person is called the Emergency Coordinator.\n\nIn the case of an emergency at the facility, the primary Incident Commander and Emergency Coordinator, or their alternates, shall be contacted immediately.

The power switch for the heater was shut off for the weekend.  On Monday morning, the container was found to be empty.  An investigation showed the release was due to a faulty heater power switch - the switch contacts were fused together and power was actually applied to the heating element all weekend.  As a result, chlorine pressure would build up to the container's pressure relief valve rating.  The pressure relief valve then opened, reducing the pressure, closed, then opened again.  This cycle continued through the weekend, emptying the container.  While it was not required for Halocarbon Products to report this release, a report was filed to avoid future questions.\n\nWORST CASE SCENARIO\n\nOur worst case scenario for hydrogen fluoride (HF) involves a total failure of the primary storage tank.  The entire contents of the tank spills and vaporizes within 10 minutes.  We are required to assume that there is a very mild breeze, all mitigating devices we have installed (diking, water curtain and emergency dump tank) fail and, at the time of the tank failure, it is 90% full.  Further, we must assume that no operators respond to the tank failure and no alarms or leak detectors are activated.  In summary, this scenario is required to assume that nothing is done or can be done about the tank failure.\n\nThe worst case scenario for chlorine is the complete failure of a 2,000 pound container.

      "SummaryText": " assumptions here again are no operator involvement, no alarms warning of the leak, no attempt to mitigate the situation and a complete loss of chlorine in 10 minutes.  As in the HF case, the atmospheric conditions are very stable with little wind.\n\nALTERNATE CASE SCENARIO\n\nThe alternate case scenario for hydrogen fluoride (HF) involves two bolts rusting on a tank flange, allowing a small gap between the flange faces.  At first, the HF will leak out undetected, then the alarm will notify the operators of the problem.  Automatic valves will be activated to: 1) start draining the HF to the emergency dump tank and 2) start the water curtain.  The acid water generated by the water curtain will be collected in the tank dike and will be neutralized prior to disposal.  The water curtain will absorb the hydrofluoric acid, reducing the release to the air by 90%.\n\nThe alternate scenario for chlorine involves the transfer line from the cylinder rupturing.  The chlorine vapor will set off one of the area alarms causing a response from the operators.  Operators will respond using protective gear and shut a valve on the cylinder.  The total response time is estimated to be 10 minutes.\n\nTRAINING\n\nHalocarbon Products Corporation has an aggressive training and safety program.  The operators demonstrate their ability to handle emergencies via our emergency drills.  At least once per year, management arrives at the plant unexpected at an off hour, activates an alarm, hands the responders a scenario and records the response of that shift.  This is done for each of the four shifts.  The drill is video taped and then reviewed and critiqued by each shift during our regular safety meetings.  Lessons learned are made part of the safety meeting.  Each operations shift must attend 24 hours of safety meetings per year.  These meetings include discussions and hands-on training on subjects such as:\n\n          Chlorine cylinder A and B kits\n          Repairing a leaking cylinder\n          Level A"

Each report is investigated to determine the cause so as to prevent the same incident happening again.  These reports are kept in a file and the more serious incidents are discussed with the employees during safety meetings.  During the past 5 years, Halocarbon has had an excellent record of not releasing chemicals to the environment.  This is attributed to the intensive training the operators receive during the year.  This training is continuously up-dated and increased to make Halocarbon the best partner the community can have.  To further this goal, Halocarbon will be establishing a Community Advisory Panel (CAP) as well as continuing to work under the Chemical Manufactures Association's Community Awareness and Emergency Response (CAER) program."
