This document consists of the executive summary and registration data elements (68.155 through 68.185).\n\n\n\n1.0    RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\n\n\nThe Covington Wastewater Treatment Plant (CWWTP) has chlorine and sulfur dioxide on site that requires protection as defined under Occupational Safety & Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation.  The City of Covington, TN, has implemented a PSM program to provide information to employees to deal with the risks involved with the storage, handling and processing of highly hazardous materials.  The program emphas the application of management controls and standard operating procedures when addressing the risks associated with handling or working near highly hazardous chemicals.  This Risk Management Plan (RMP) summarizes the worst case scenarios for a release of chlorine and sulfur dioxide, the management systems and monitoring systems in place to prevent such a release, and the training and employee participation in the PSM program.\n\n\n\nIn accordance with the 2004 amendment to the RMP regulations, the off-site consequence analyses (OCA) are not included in this executive summary.\n\n\n\n2.0    PROCESS DESCRIPTION AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n\n\nThe CWWTP treats and disposes of all sanitary waste discharged to the City Sewer System.  The facility utilizes 1-ton cylinders of chlorine and sulfur dioxide to treat the wastewater in the chlorination room.  Three chlorine cylinders are always connected to the chlorination system and as many as two cylinders are stored as a backup. Two sulfur dioxide cylinders are always connected to the sulfonation system with one stored as a backup. \n\n\n\n3.0    GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL - SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nThe CWWTP has developed an OSHA PSM program for the chlorination system. At CWWTP, chlorine and sulfur dioxide fall "

EPA has said that if the process is in compliance with OSHA PSM, then it is compliance with RMP Program 3. Thus, the CWWTP chlorine and sulfur dioxide PSM has been reviewed and determined to be complete for the RMP document. \n\n\n\nAnnual waste water operator certification and continuing education maintains and continually improves safety at the CWWTP. \n\n\n\n4.0    FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nThere has been no reportable release from CWWTP in the last five years. \n\n\n\n5.0    EMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN\n\n\n\nCWWTP has developed an Emergency Response Plan. The response plan is a detailed document which discusses the role of employees and management in an emergency situation. The plan outlines specific procedures for evacuations for plant personnel. For all emergencies, Facility Manager, has operating authority for emergency response at the site of release and assumes control of the incident scene beyond the first responder awareness level.\n\n\n\nThis document contains specific information regarding: contact numbers; emergency communication; incident team job descriptions; evacuation zones; emergency evacuation procedures; notification procedures; training; emergency shutdown procedures; personnel roles and lines of authority; emergency recognition and prevention; safe distances and places of refuge; site security and control; medical/first aid treatment; emergency alerting and response procedures; PPE and emergency equipment; and standard operating procedures in the event of a chlorine or sulfur dioxide release.\n\n\n\n6.0    PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nDue to the CWWTP's, exemplary safety record no changes to the existing safety plan have been identified.  \n\n"
