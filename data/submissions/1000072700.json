Process Safety Information\n\nWritten process safety information is compiled before conducting process hazard analyses for the manufacturing processes including Anhydrous Hydrogen Fluoride, Anhydrous Ammonia, and 29% Ammonia Solution. This enables the employees involved in operating these processes to identify and understand the potential hazards associated with the processes. The information compiled includes data on the safe use and handling of the regulated chemicals (e.g., Material Safety Data Sheets), data on the process technology (e.g., Process Flow Diagrams, process chemi"

The process safety information shows compliance of the process design with generally accepted good engineering practices.\n\n3b. Process Hazard Analyses\n\nProcess hazard analyses for the manufacturing process have been completed in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.119(e) (OSHA Process Safety Management). These process hazard analyses are updated and revalidated in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.119(e) and are retained on plant for the life of the process.\n\n \n\nIn general, one or more of the following methodologies are used to complete each process hazard analysis: (a) what-if evaluation; (b) checklist; (c) hazard and operability study (HAZOP); (d) failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA); (e) fault tree; (f) process mapping; and (g) cause and effect matrix. Each process hazard analysis addresses the process hazards, process incident history, process control devices, and detection systems, evaluation of the failure of process control devices, equipment location, and human factors. A team of employees having experience and knowledge of the process design and operation, and knowledge of how to complete a process hazard analysis perform each process hazard analysis. The Management of Change process (described below) is used to track and document process changes, which occur because of recommendations from process hazard analyses.\n\n \n\n3c. Operating Procedures\n\nWritten operating procedures are prepared for the manufacturing processes including Anhydrous Hydrogen Fluoride, Anhydrous Ammonia, and 29% Ammonia Solution. The program in place meets the requirements of ISO 9001:2015 and RC14001:2015 certifications for the plant. "

The procedures are maintained to reflect current operating practices and are certified annually for accuracy.\n\n \n\nSpecific information and instructions covered by the operating procedures include startup, normal operation, emergency operation, shutdown, operating limits, operating controls, chemical-specific health and safety information, required personal protective equipment, and use of safety systems. Written procedures are also provided for specific operations such as Lockout/Tagout, confined space entry, and line breaking.\n\n\n\n3d. Training\n\nEmployees currently engaged in operating the manufacturing processes using Anhydrous Hydrogen Fluoride, Anhydrous Ammonia, and 29% Ammonia Solution have received training to ensure they have the required knowledge, skills, and abilities to safely carry out the requirements specified in the written operating procedures. Refresher training is provided every three years at a minimum, or sooner if warranted by changes to operating conditions, equipment, or procedures. Where refresher training is required more frequently than every three years, it is triggered through the Management of Change process (described below). Training records are maintained for each employee to show the date training was conducted and the material covered by the training.\n\n\n\n3e. Mechanical Integrity\n\nHoneywell Bryan maintains the mechanical integrity of equipment used to process and handles Anhydrous Hydrogen Fluoride, Anhydrous Ammonia, and 29% Ammonia Solution. Such equipment includes pressurized vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, pressure relief, and vent systems, emergency control devices, pumps, and valves.

Equipment inspection and testing are conducted in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations and generally accepted good engineering practices. Records of inspections and testing are maintained to show the date, equipment identification, inspector, type of test or inspection performed, and test results or observations. If deficiencies are noted during equipment inspection and testing, corrective actions are taken in a timely manner to assure the safe operation of the process. In some cases, equipment inspections are driven by permit requirements as well as the mechanical integrity program. For example, process pumps are inspected visually on a weekly basis, and quantitatively for leaks on a quarterly basis, in accordance with specific air permit requirements.\n\n\n\n3f. Management of Change\n\nOne component of the plant's Process Safety Management (PSM) program is a written procedure for the Management of Change. Except for \"replacements in kind\", any change to the PSM-covered process requires completion and approval of a Request For Change prior to making the change.\n\nSuch changes include new process chemicals, new technologies, new or modified equipment, new or modified operating conditions, and new or modified procedures. The Request For Change must be reviewed and approved by a team of employees having experience and knowledge of the process, knowledge of the proposed changes, and knowledge of applicable regulatory requirements. The Request For Change must describe the proposed change and its impact on employee health and safety, the purposes and benefits of the change, the target date for the change to take effect, and whether the change is temporary or permanent. The Request For Change must also indicate whether any of the following items are required as a result of the change, and if so, who is responsible for completing these items and when they"

Pre-startup Review\n\nPrior to startup of a new process involving Anhydrous Hydrogen Fluoride, Anhydrous Ammonia or 29% Ammonia Solution, a pre-startup safety review is conducted to ensure that the equipment and installation meet design specifications, a process hazard analysis has been completed, employee training has been completed, and safety, operating, maintenance, and emergency procedures are in place. A pre-startup safety review is also conducted for process changes where the approved Request For Change indicates a change in the process safety information is required. A team of employees having knowledge of the process, equipment, procedures, and safety requirements operating conditions conducts the pre-startup safety review, procedures, and safety requirements.\n\nAll items on the pre-startup review checklist must be satisfied prior to commencing startup.\n\n\n\n3h.

The Five Year Accident History:\n\n\n\nAt approximately 5:00 AM CST on December 6, 2019, the filling operator was sprayed with Hydrofluoric Acid (49%) while performing routine transfer operations. The material splashed between his chemical protective suit and work clothes. Exposure was limited to the upper torso (pectoral region)\n\n\n\nThe filling operator showered, and calcium gluconate was applied liberally then taken to the emergency room per plant policy. Once at the emergency room it was determined that the filling operator need to be transferred to the regional burn center.\n\n\n\nThe Root Cause was determined that the operator improperly executed the Line Breaking Procedure and Permit.\n\n\n\n\n\n5. The Emergency Response Plan:\n\n\n\nAn Emergency Response/Contingency Plan has been developed to provide a formal emergency preparedness program that protects human health and property for both the employees and surrounding community in the event of an emergency such as fire; explosion; release of highly hazardous chemicals (HHC); transportation emergency; criminal acts; and natural emergency.  This plan also formalizes the arrangements with local police, local neighbors, fire departments, hospitals, and emergency response contractors, and all governing state and federal agencies in case of an emergency.
