Facility Policy\n     The owners, management and employees of the Elkton Farmers Union Coop Oil Ass'n are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If any accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the Elkton Fire Dept., Brookings County LEPC and or other authorities to mitigate and minimize the impacts of the release to the people and the environment.\n2. Facility information:\n    The primary activity at the facility is the storage of fertilizer for sale to farmers. Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application as a nutrient for crop production.  The maximum quanity stored would be 200,000 pounds in a storage tank and the nurse tanks.\n3.  Worse case senario and alternate release senario\n     A.  The worst case senario would be the release of the entire contents of the storage tank released as a gas over the period of ten minutes.  The maximum quanity released would be 130,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the only storage tank at the 85% volume level as allowed by design standards and administrative controls.  The distance to the end point (point of dispersion to 200 parts per million) is 4.4 miles.\n     B.  The alternate release senario: a three inch transfer hose is used as as alternate release senario followed by the release on ammonia for two minutes before the automatic excess flow shut-down valve intervenes and stops the flow of gas.  The maximum quanity released would be 28,000 pounds.  The distance to the end point is .7 miles.  ( The most likely potential accident would be a release from a break in a one inch transfer hose scenario followed by a release of ammonia for 2 minutes before the automatic excess flow shut-down valve intervened and stopped the flow of ammonia.  The maximum quanity released with this senario would b"
