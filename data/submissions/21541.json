If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\nFACILITY INFORMATION\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage and sale of fertilizers to farmers.\nAnhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for application for crop production nutrients.\nThe maximum quantity stored would be 76,000 pounds in our 18,000 gallon storage tank.  \n\nTHE WORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO\nThe worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of the storage tank, as a gas, over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 76,500 pounds, which represents the volume of the storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 PPM) is 1.90 miles.\n\nTHE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO\nThe alternative release scenario based on the five-year accident history (or the most likely potential incident) is a release from a break in a transfer hose.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 PPM) is 1.60 miles.\n\nTHE ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\nThe facility has implemented the provision of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc., and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia\".\n\nTHE FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that: have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant prop"

Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are not additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
