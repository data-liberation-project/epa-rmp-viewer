This protocol has been discussed with the local fire department and the other emergency responders and the facility has appropriate mechanisms in place to notify the emergency responders when there is a need for a response.  The facility is also included in the written community emergency response plan developed under the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA).\r\n\r\n5.10\tPlanned Changes to Improve Safety (40 CFR 68.155(g)\r\n\r\nThere are no specific anhydrous ammonia safety changes planned at this time.  However, safety improvement is an on-going process at this facility. Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the safety of equipment and procedures."

Process Safety Information and Process Hazard Analysis\r\n\r\nUnited Cooperative maintains a separate written Emergency Action Plan regarding safety information that describes the chemical hazards associated with anhydrous ammonia.  Further safety information is also detailed in the RMP.  In addition, operating procedures and equipment design codes and standards associated with the anhydrous ammonia process are maintained in the RMP at the Facility.\r\n\r\nThe Facility conducts safety inspections to identify and control the hazards associated with the anhydrous ammonia process.  United Cooperative inspection includes two 18,000-gallon anhydrous ammonia bulk storage vessels, hoses, valves, gauges, and pumps.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\r\n\r\n5.4\tOperating Procedures\r\n\r\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities at the Facility associated with anhydrous ammonia, United Cooperative maintains written operating procedures included in the RMP.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after an emergency shutdown.  The information is reviewed as needed and is readily accessible to operators involved with the processes.\r\n\r\n5.5\tTraining\r\n\r\nUnited has an anhydrous ammonia operator safety training program in place to train employees involved in the anhydrous ammonia process.  The facility maintains written operating procedures for the handling and storage of anhydrous ammonia.  The procedures generally follow the provisions of the Occupation Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) standard, 29 CFR 1910.111, Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia and the American National St"

The audit will be documented and conducted by a person knowledgeable in the safe handling and storage of anhydrous ammonia.  Corrective actions required because of each compliance audit will be performed promptly and documented.\r\n\r\n5.8\tIncident Investigation\r\n\r\nFacility management will investigate each incident that results in, or could have reasonably resulted in a catastrophic release of anhydrous ammonia.  The investigation will be performed to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  Investigation reports will be retained for five years.  Report forms that will be completed in the event of an incident or possible incident are found in the EAP and the RMP.\r\n\r\n5.9\tEmployee Participation\r\n\r\nUnited believes accident prevention is a team effort.
