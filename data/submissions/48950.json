Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at  Ineos  are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program in place that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, our highly trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  \n\n\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe process used to produce Ineos  Green Lake products contain quantities of flammable or listed hazardous chemicals which require application of Process Safety Management (PSM) as required in OSHA 29 CFR Part 1910 and the  EPA Risk Management Program (RMP).  INEOS management strongly supports Process Safety Management  and the Risk Management Program and recognises it as a good business practice as well as a good approach to protecting workers and the public from industrial operation hazards.  Ineos  Green Lake applies the basic principles of Process Safety Management and the Risk Management Program.\n\nIneos  has 8 EPA RMP regulated substances present at our facility above the threshold quantity.  These substances include; \n    Acrylonitrile\n    Ammonia            \n    Butane\n    Propylene        \n    Propane\n    Chlorine\n    Sulfur Dioxide\n    Hydrogen Cyanide\n        \nAcrylonitrile is the end product of our process. Ammonia (anhydrous) and Propylene are utilized as raw materials in the production of Acrylonitrile.  Propane is an impurity in the Propylene. Butane is utilized in catalyst activation. Chlorine is utilized in water purification. Sulfur Dioxide is utilized as an inhibitor. A by-product of the Acrylonitrile process is Hydrogen Cyanide.  Hydrogen "

The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\nMethodology given in the RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance by the EPA using equations has been employed by our facility to perform worst and alternative case release scenarios.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 3 flammable substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from Propylene Storage in the Acrylonitrile manufacturing  process.  The scenario involves the release of  3,080,000         lbs. of Propylene  [1-Propene].  It is assumed that the entire quantity is released as a vapor, which finds an ignition source, with 10 percent of the released quantity participating in a vapor cloud explosion.  Under worst case weather conditions, the maximum distance of  1.2              miles is obtained corresponding to an endpoint of 1 psi overpressure.  \nThe alternative release scenario submitted for Program 3 flammable substances involves a release from Propylene Pipeline in the Acrylonitrile manufacturing  process. The scenario involves the release of 122,400  lbs. of  Propylene /Propane mixture in 60 minutes. "

Due to our stringent release prevention policies, there has been no accidental release meeting the RMP definition during this period.\n\n\n6.    Emergency Response Plan\nIneos  carries a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials.  The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas.\n\nTo ensure proper functioning, our emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced.  In addition, the plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within our processes that would require a modified emergency response.  A new ambulance and an off-site response vehicle were purchased in 2004.  A new fire truck was purchased in 2005.\n\n7.    Planned Changes to Improve Safety\nA project was initiated to review the Hot Work permitting system. A team of Process Technicians, the Safety Supervisor, and Maintenance Representatives reviewed the existing process for compliance and efficiency. The process was updated to include a permit to work process so that all work in the process unit was covered.  Additionally a safety analysis was integrated into the process.  Previously this was done in a separate function.  The revised process has been operation for almost a year and has been determined to be a significant improvement in overall safety and it has improved both maintenance and operations efficiency.

Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nWe at  Ineos  are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program in place that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, our highly trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  \n\n\n\n\n\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nThe process used to produce Ineos  Green Lake products contain quantities of flammable or listed hazardous chemicals which require application of Process Safety Management (PSM) as required in OSHA 29 CFR Part 1910 and the  EPA Risk Management Program (RMP).  INEOS management strongly supports Process Safety Management  and the Risk Management Program and recognises it as a good business practice as well as a good approach to protecting workers and the public from industrial operation hazards.  Ineos  Green Lake applies the basic principles of Process Safety Management and the Risk Management Program.\n\n\n\nIneos  has 8 EPA RMP regulated substances present at our facility above the threshold quantity.
