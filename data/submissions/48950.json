The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 3 flammable substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from Propylene Storage in the Acrylonitrile manufacturing  process.  The scenario involves the release of  3,080,000         lbs. of Propylene  [1-Propene].  It is assumed that the entire quantity is released as a vapor, which finds an ignition source, with 10 percent of the released quantity participating in a vapor cloud explosion.  Under worst case weather conditions, the maximum distance of  1.2              miles is obtained corresponding to an endpoint of 1 psi overpressure.  \nThe alternative release scenario submitted for Program 3 flammable substances involves a release from Propylene Pipeline in the Acrylonitrile manufacturing  process. The scenario involves the release of 122,400  lbs. of  Propylene /Propane mixture in 60 minutes."

The scenario involves the release of 925,000     lbs. of Hydrogen Cyanide.  It is assumed that the entire quantity is released into a dike, which vaporizes and moves downwind. Passive mitigation controls such as dikes are taken into account to calculate the scenario. Under worst case weather conditions, the maximum distance of >25      miles is obtained corresponding to the endpoint indicated in the EPA Tables.  \nThe alternative release scenario submitted for Program 3 toxic substances involves a release from the Crude Storage Tank containing 8.1% Hydrogen Cyanide in the Acrylonitrile manufacturing  process.

These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved with the processes.\n\nTraining\nIneos  has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees that are operating processes are completely competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  New employees receive basic training in process operations followed by on-the-job supervision until they are deemed competent to work independently.  Refresher training is provided at least every 3 years and more frequently as needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nIneos  carries out documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper functions.  Process equipment examined by these checks include among others; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nManagement of Change\nWritten procedures are in place at Ineos to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures.

A team of Process Technicians, the Safety Supervisor, and Maintenance Representatives reviewed the existing process for compliance and efficiency. The process was updated to include a permit to work process so that all work in the process unit was covered.  Additionally a safety analysis was integrated into the process.  Previously this was done in a separate function.  The revised process has been operation for almost a year and has been determined to be a significant improvement in overall safety and it has improved both maintenance and operations efficiency.
