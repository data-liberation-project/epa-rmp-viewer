It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal, State and Local laws and guidelines where applicable. If an emergency were to occur the Brenham Municipal Fire Department would be immediately notified and requested to respond to the emergency. We also maintain and train a fire brigade to respond to small emergencies.\n\n\n\nThis facility is a packager of aerosol and liquid cleaning products. LPG is used as a propellent in many of the aerosol products packaged. The facility consists of 2-12,000 gallon and 1-6580 gallon storage tanks. These storage tanks are limited to a fill of 80% of total capacity.\n\n\n\nWorst Case Scenario: Our worst-case scenario is failure of one of the 12,000 gallon storage tanks when filled to the 80% capacity. This would result in a vapor cloud explosion. The 1 psi endpoint is 0.20 miles which extends offsite. The estimated residential population within a circle centered on the tank out to a distance of 0.20 miles is less than 10. There are offsite public receptors which would be impacted by the worst case scenario.\n\n\n\nAlternative Release Scenario: Our alternative release scenario is a pull away break at the loading manifold. This would lead to a release lasting less than 2 minutes. This could lead to a vapor cloud fire. The resulting endpoint does not extend offsite, and there are no public receptors within the distance to the endpoint. \n\n\n\nThis facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule, the OSHA PSM standard and all applicable state and local codes and regulations. The LP-Gas storage system is designed, installed and maintained in accordance with NFPA-58 and state law.\n\n\n\nWe have never had an accident involving LP-Gas that caused deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or shelterings in place.\n\n\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving our LP-Gas system it is our policy to notify the Brenham Municipal Fire Department and reque"
