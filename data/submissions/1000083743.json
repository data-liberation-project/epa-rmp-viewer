Spectrum is a level 3 facility and works to comply with the OSHA PSM rules and the EPA RMP program. \n\n\n\nSpectrum participates in the LEPC #3 meetings as a concerned representative of industry in the local community.\n\n\n\nSpectrum utilizes anhydrous ammonia(CAS 7664-41-7) in the processing of parts for customers. Spectrum is member of LEPC #3. To date no releases of ammonia have occurred. The Cranston Fire Department will be the first responders in the event of an accidental release or accident onsite. The fire department and members of the LEPC have inspected the facility. The Cranston fire department has reviewed the Community Emergency Action plan for Spectrum Thermal Processing. Spectrum has drilled with the Cranston Fire department in order to respond to an emergency in a more effective manner.\n\n\n\nThe employees receive ammonia awareness training yearly. Maintenance personnel have received training in the operation of the ammonia system.\n\n\n\nAn updated Community Emergency Action Plan (Revision N) was submitted to Cranston Fire in December of 2018. \n\n\n\nSpectrum utilizes ultrasonic inspections of all piping, valves and the ammonia tank by the outside contractors. On an annual basis an visual inspection is conducted by the  ammonia supplier. Spectrum utilizes the ultrasonic inspections of the ammonia tank to determine mechanical integrity. In 2018 we are installing an interior ammonia sensor that will be connected to an outside alarm company. This sensor is in addition to the two external sensors in place.  The alarm company will telephone specific employees should the sensor activate.\n\n\n\nSpectrum Thermal Processing LLC is committed to providing a safe and clean environment for our personnel, facility and the"
