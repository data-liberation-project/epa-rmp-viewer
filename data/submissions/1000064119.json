We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public as well as protection of the environment. This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including: A. A description of our facility and use of substances regulated by EPA's RMP regulation. B. A summary of results from assessment of the potential offsite consequences from accidental chemical releases. C. An overview of our accidental release prevention programs. D. A five-year accident history for accidental releases of chemicals regulated by EPA's RMP Rule. E. An overview of our emergency response plan program. F. An overview of planned improvements at the facility to help prevent accidental chemical releases from occurring and adversely affecting our employees, the public, and the environment. G. The certifications that EPA's RMP rule requires us to provide. H. The detailed information (called data elements) about our risk management program. 2.0 STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES Our facility treats drinking water using a variety of chemicals in the process. We have a 24 Million Gallon per day Split Treatment Softening Plant which treats drinking water for the City of Jackson and surrounding communities.
