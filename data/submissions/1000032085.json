From intersection of County Road 37 and 125th Avenue NW, travel south on 125th Avenue NW for 1.8 miles to the Little Missouri facility.\n\nHazard Assessment - Worst Case Scenario\nThe Worst Case Scenario for this facility is a release of a flammable mixture that would result as a failure of a natural gas liquids storage tank releasing the entire contents instantaneously to the atmosphere having an offsite impact.  EPA's RMP*Comp&trade; was used to calculate a scenario where the entire contents of the largest facility bullet storage tank were considered liquid propane for a BLEVE release.  This type of scenario is unlikely to occur.  In addition, qualified individuals operate the subject processes.  The equipment is inspected and maintained according to a preventative maintenance schedule further reducing the likelihood of this release occurring.\n\nHazard Assessment - Alternative Release Scenario\nThe Alternative Release Scenario's explored for the facility included (1) a single storage tank containing propane that experiences a BLEVE and (2) a single storage tank containing pentane that experiences a pool fire. \n\nGeneral Accident Release Prevention Program\nThe following is a summary of the accidental release prevention program in place at the Little Missouri Gas Plant.  The Little Missouri Gas Plant has been classified as a Program 3 facility because of the close proximity to a nearby commercial facility.  The facility is not only regulated by the EPA's Risk Management Program but also the OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) standard.

The MOC program requires that changes be documented, authorized by appropriate facility personnel, and that the changes are adequately conducted to prevent any type of release.  The MOC program also ensures that changes are communicated to affected personnel and that training has been conducted as necessary.\n\nIncident Investigation\nSaddle Butte Pipeline promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury.  The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings.  Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years so that the reports can be reviewed during future PHAs and PHA revalidations.\n\nCompliance Audits\nSaddle Butte Pipeline periodically conducts an audit of the Little Missouri Gas Plant to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are"

As such, there have been no releases of listed Hazardous Substances which have resulted in offsite effects.\n\nEmergency Response Program\nSaddle Butte Pipeline has written emergency response procedures to protect workers, ensure public safety and to protect the environment.  These procedures address all aspects of emergency response including response to a regulated substance release including the possibility of a fire or explosion in the event that a flammable substance is accidently released.  Procedures also address evacuation, accounting for personnel and company and agency notification.  The emergency response plan is updated when necessary based on modifications made to the process or facility.  The overall emergency response plan is coordinated with the local emergency responders including local law enforcement and the McKenzie County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\nSaddle Butte Pipeline personnel are continually developing new ways to improve the safety of it's equipment and operations.  This is done through training which is considered a vital part of any safety program.  Training is conducted according to a schedule so employees and contractors are given the most up to date information available.

In addition, facility has a number of initiatives that address process safety and employee safety issues including plant safety meetings and safety training to promote both process and personal safety.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nSaddle Butte Pipeline keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the process.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  Up-to-date process safety information is maintained on a going basis.  The reference documents are readily available at the plant location.\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDS).  The facility ensures that the process is maintained within safe operating limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\n\nThe gas plant also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes material of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment.

HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  OSHA and the EPA recognize the analysis as an approved method for conducting PHAs.  Plant PHAs are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering and safety expertise.  The team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to company's local and corporate management for resolution.  Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options in responses to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\nSaddle Butte Pipeline periodically updates and revalidates the PHA results to ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not deviate significantly over time from the original design and safety features.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.
