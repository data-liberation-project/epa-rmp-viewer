      "SummaryText": "basis.  Heico utilizes the HAZOP (Hazards and Operability Study) method to review any potential hazards.  HAZOPs review, identify, and rank potential problem areas of a process before they can occur.  Any new process has a HAZOP completed prior to introduction into the manufacturing facility.  Our HAZOP programs provide the basis for continuous improvement of our plant operations and safety.\n\n\u00bf\tHeico recognizes that it is both environmentally responsible and good business practices to generate less waste and minimize emissions. Heico has been aggressively working on projects to reduce waste generation.  We have a waste minimization policy that requires an annual review of all processes to identify pollution prevention opportunities.  We have a strong commitment to Total Quality Management and consider waste reduction an important part of our quality improvement process."
