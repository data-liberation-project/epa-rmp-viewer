Personnel working with hazardous materials are trained in safe operating procedures, the proper utilization of safety equipment and safeguards, and maintenance techniques required to operate in a safe and efficient manner.\r\n\r\nOWA is a water treatment facility located along the Allegheny River that utilizes chlorine in its'  treatment process. The chlorine is contained inside a brick structure (the chlorine building) in three one ton containers  for the pre-treatment process.  OWA employs a dual regulator vacuum system with an automatic switchover and one container as an extra.  Two containers are connected to a manifold and the valves are opened to activate one tank and put the other on standby.  The third container is backup.  The chlorine gas passes through the regulator and travels to the chlorinators located in the chlorine building.  The chlorinators adjust the feed rates to produce an appropriate mixture of domestic water and chlorine relative to the raw water being treated. The mixture travels through the solution line to the applications point where it is injected into the raw water being pumped from the river.\r\n\r\n  In the case of a catastrophe affecting chlorine at the facility, the worst case scenario would involve the release of the contents of a one ton container  in a ten minute period.  According to the Environnmental Protection Agency's (EPA) rmp Guidance for Waste Water Treatment Plants Reference Tables, the contents of the container would be released at the rate of 200 pounds/minute.  If the container was not enclosed, and there are no controls, the release would have an impact on the environment and population up to a distance of 1.3 miles in an urban setting.  The continers are in an enclosed area which would re"

      "SummaryText": "duce the potential of release of chlorine into the environment. \r\n\r\n A more likely occurrence would involve a leak in the container, valves, connectors or piping involved in the process.  A vacuum system for distribution of chlorine has been installed at the facility to reduce the likelihood that a chlorine release offsite would occur.  The vacuum system automatically eliminates chlorine distribution if a leak occurs between the regulator and the chlorinators inside the building.  Remote sensors and alarms alert operators of a chlorine discharge within the enclosure.  Using the RMP Guidance for Waste Water Treatment Plants, if damage was done to a container during the loading or unloading procedure, the offsite impact would encompass .1 miles. \r\n\r\n OWA has implemented a prevention program to reduce the potential for an accidental release.  The process equipment is evaluated against best engineering practices and adhers to codes and a standards regulating the water treatment industry. Supplier manuals and maintenance instructions are used as a basis for scheduled maintenance activities and equipment changes.  Training on operating procedures, the safe handling of chlorine, and inspeciton and testing procedures, are in place to reduce the potential for an accidental release.  Operators inspect the process on an hourly basis and monitor chlorine sensors from a remote control panel.  Personnel are trained in the use of Self Contained Breathing Aparatus (SCBA) and the use of repair kits for one ton and 150 pound containers. \r\n\r\n The facility emergency response plan has been approved by the Local Emergency Planning Committee of Allegheny County.  Edward Adams, Facility Emergency Response Coordinator, or his assistant, Carl Schultz, may be contacted at 412/828-9508.

Employee initial training and retraining will be conducted as required by SARA Title III.  Maintenance procedures with documented schedules have been implemented to ensure that potential equipment failures are reduced due to improved maintenance and inspeciton activities.  Additional procedures have been documented and implemented to improve the safety operations at the facility. The Regal Chlorine Regulators are routinely removed from service and inspected, cleaned and repaired if necessary.  We have two spare regulators on hand."
