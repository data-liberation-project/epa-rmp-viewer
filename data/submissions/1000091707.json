The facility maintains a written Emergency Action Plan to document specific procedures to be implemented in the event of various emergencies, including ammonia release. The Emergency Action Plan includes procedures for facility evacuation, as well as for notification to the local emergency action agencies, which are responsible for notifying the public. The plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within the facility that would require modified procedures.\r\n\r\nFood Lion has devised a comprehensive emergency action program, designed to protect both employees and the community in the event of a release. This program is fully described in a document entitled EMERGENCY ACTION PLAN (EAP) in order to facilitate response efforts in the event of an off-site anhydrous ammonia release.  Included in the plan are measures to be taken internally by Food Lion as well as measures to be taken by off-site response agencies.  \r\n\r\nFood Lion on-site personnel will respond only to minor incidental ammonia releases.  Trained off-site responders will handle all non-incidental and major releases.\r\n\r\nTo assure that local governmental response agencies are familiar with the Food Lion, Greencastle, Pennsylvania emergency action procedures, Food Lion has provided copies of the ERP for review and approval by the local agencies. \r\n\r\nTo plan for an ammonia release with off-site effects, Food Lion EAP includes procedures/equipment to mitigate the release, procedures to inform local response agencies, transportation maps for response agencies, evacuation route maps, and procedures for public communication.\r\n\r\nP"
