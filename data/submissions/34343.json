Memphis\r\nRisk Management Plan\r\nExecutive Summary\r\n\r\n\r\n1.0 ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICY\r\n\r\nAt Buckeye Technologies Inc. - Memphis Plant, we are committed to operating and maintaining all of our processes (especially those using hazardous substances) in a safe and responsible manner.  We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public as well as protection of the environment.  This Executive Summary provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including:\r\n\r\n> A description of the Memphis Plant and use of chlorine, which is regulated by EPA's RMP regulation,\r\n> A summary of results from our assessment of the potential off-site consequences from accidental chemical releases,\r\n> An overview of our accidental release prevention programs,\r\n> A five-year accident history for accidental releases of chlorine,\r\n> An overview of our emergency response programs,\r\n> An overview of planned improvements at the Memphis Plant to help prevent accidental chlorine releases from occurring and adversely affecting our employees, the public, and the environment,\r\n> The certification that EPA's RMP rule requires us to provide, and,\r\n> The detailed information (called data elements) about our risk management program.\r\n\r\n2.0 STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\r\n\r\nBuckeye Technologies Inc., Memphis Plant, produces purified alpha cellulose from cotton fibers (linters).  The Memphis Plant mechanically sizes, cleans, and fluffs raw cotton linters prior to combining with water.  This is then placed in a digester, which then uses steam and caustic soda to purify and reduce to a raw slurry.  The raw slurry is then further purified prior to being delivered to one of the finishing (drying) operations.\r\n\r\nIn our processes, we use the following chemicals that EPA"

Chlorine Railcar Staging\r\na. Derailers, chocks, sign placements to prevent accidental movement\r\nb. Unique unloading site that is specific for chlorine\r\nc. Video monitoring of unloading area\r\nd. Automated railcar value closure system\r\n2. Hose and Gasket Leaks\r\na. Written Mechanical Integrity Program\r\nb. Color-coded lines/hoses\r\nc. Chlorine sensors that alarm on detection of chlorine vapor\r\nd. Video monitoring of railcar continuously\r\ne. Excess Flow Check Valves block flow if overpressurized\r\nf. Unique fittings prevent improper connections\r\ng. Daily Preventive Maintenance Checks of unloading system\r\nh. Numerous interlocks and redundant valves\r\n3. Training\r\na. Maintenance & Operat"

The following is a brief summary of accidental chemical releases involving materials covered under EPA's RMP rule during the past five years:\r\n\r\nAccidental releases, as defined in 40 CFR 68.42(a), are those ?from covered processes that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.?  Buckeye ? Memphis Plant has had no releases during the past five years that were significant or meet these reportability criteria.\r\n\r\nFor all incidents, non-reportable releases, or non-routine events, we conduct formal incident investigation"
