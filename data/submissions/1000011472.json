It is a chlorinating or oxidizing agent that is not flammable.  It has a 1 ppm OSHA ceiling Permissible Exposure Limit (PEL) and a NFPA health rating of 4, severe; with immediate and delayed health hazards.  Chlorine is not a carcinogen.\nThe maximum threshold quantity stored on site is 24 one ton containers.  This equals 48,000 pounds.\n\n2.\tHAZARD ASSESSMENT\nA hazard assessment was performed to determine the effects a release would have on the public. For chlorine, the distance to a set endpoint concentration of the gas would travel must be determined.  In addition, an estimate of the population that could be affected by a release of chlorine was determined, and sensitive receptors such as hospitals, schools, and nursing homes were identified. The hazard assessment considers two release scenarios-a \"worst case\" and an \"alternative case\" and also compiles the five-year accident history for the WTP chlorine system.\nTwo offsite consequence analyses were conducted which include two chlorine release scenarios.  The first is a \u00c2\u00bfworst case release\u00c2\u00bf.  The second is a more probable \u00c2\u00bfalternative release scenario\u00c2\u00bf.  The first scenario is defined by EPA, which states that \u00c2\u00bfthe operator shall assume that the maximum quantity in the largest vessel is released as a gas over 10 minutes\u00c2\u00bf due to an unspecified failure.  The alternative scenario is defined as \u00c2\u00bfmore likely to occur than the worst-case scenario\u00c2\u00bf.\nAtmospheric dispersion modeling was performed to determine the distance traveled by the chlorine released before its concentration decreases to the \u00c2\u00bftoxic endpoint.\u00c2\u00bf  The EPA specified endpoint for chlorine is 0.0087 mg/l which equals 3 ppm.

The scrubber is capable of neutralizing over 2000 pounds of chlorine.  The control room also has a chlorine monitor.  Both monitors alarm in their local area as well as in the water plant control room. \n3.2.4.\tEquipment Design\nThere are two types of chlorine pipe systems, high pressure and low (vacuum) pressure.  The high pressure chlorine piping system is made of chlorine compatible steel pipes, copper tubes or equipment.  These materials are steel, copper or"

      "SummaryText": "chlorine compatible non-metallic compound (not corroded by chlorine) rated to 500 psig.  The maximum pressure of the chlorine in the high pressure system is only 150 psig giving a 3 to 1 safety factor.  There are two sets of six ton containers on each high pressure line.  Each leads to an automatic switch over a vacuum pressure regulator. One bank is in service and the other is on standby. \nThe low pressure system operates under a vacuum pressure of 13 inches of mercury.  There is a pressure relief valve which vents if the pressure in the line reaches above atmospheric pressure.  All the pipe, tubes, and equipment are also chlorine compatible.  The system is designed to 150 psig or complete vacuum giving it a large safety factor over the typical vacuum or positive pressure in it.  There is a chlorine monitor which detects the presence of chlorine in the ton storage area and a second monitor in the chlorine control room. \n\n4.\tFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY (E)\nThe plant has been chlorine reportable and release free since 1992 to the present, 17 years.\n\n5.\tEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM (F)\nEmergency response procedures are contained both the Plant Emergency Response Policy that is coordinated with the Orange County Contingency Plan (Emergency Response Plan).  The plan includes an emergency response \u00c2\u00bfdecision tree\u00c2\u00bf and a notification plan.  The Plant also has site specific emergency actions defined in the plants operating procedures.  Emergency response drills are conducted annually by the operating department.  Emergency operation and response procedures are also reviewed annually.\nThe emergency response program (contingency plan) is coordinated (reviewed by) with the water plant Safety Committee.  The Water Plant coordinates with local Orange County Emergency Response Planning Committee (LEPC) and the Orange County HazMat Team.  All are located in Orange County, Florida.  Copies of the program are given to key local agencies including: fire, medical, rescue, management, a"

      "SummaryText": "nd police departments.  Besides the specific emergency response program, key elements of the prevention programs are incorporated in the operating culture of the City water plant.\nThe Contingency Plan procedures detail the actions and responses to chlorine spills (releases).  The plan includes training of all chlorine-area operators. The primary response team includes the Orange County Fire and Rescue, and county Haz Mat Teams.  All of these respond to any severe chlorine leak situation.  Actions include catastrophic, severe, and moderate leaks.  A Chlorine \u00c2\u00bfB\u00c2\u00bf Leak Repair Kit is maintained at the chlorine storage area to aid in stopping leaks.  Public notification is facilitated through the County Police and Sheriff\u00c2\u00bfs Office, which has an automated emergency dialing message system for public notification.\n\n6.\tPERSONNEL (F) (1)\nPersonnel are the key resource of the City of Cocoa\u00c2\u00bfs prevention program.  City employees make up the operators and emergency operations first responders.  The City of Cocoa fosters a high level of involvement in every aspect of the chlorine system operations including participation in:\n\u00c2\u00bf\tPSM/RMP safety teams, \n\u00c2\u00bf\tDevelopment of the operation procedures, \n\u00c2\u00bf\tHazard evaluations and \n\u00c2\u00bf\tOn-going training of the operators and other involved staff.\n\u00c2\u00bf\tProcess Hazards Analysis (PHA)\n\n7.\tCHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY (G)\nChanges to improve safety (recommended actions) were identified in the internal safety HazOp, tour, and audit of the RMP program to meet requirements of the Risk Management Prevention Program.  These recommended actions have now been evaluated and implemented as required.  An Audit was conducted to review the PSM and RMP program.  The key safety action items were completed.  See the \u00c2\u00bfUpdate\u00c2\u00bf Section 6 of the Audit Report.
