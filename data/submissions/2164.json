The management and employees of the Lumber City facility are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to the community and the environment.\n\nThe facilities primary operation is the separation of air into there main components.  A support process to this operation involves the use of ammonia.  Ammonia is received and stored in a 12,000 gallon tank.  The ammonia is then sent to a Dissociator where the ammonia is separated into it's component elements of hydrogen and nitrogen gas.  The process of separation occurs when ammonia gas flows through a dissociator where separation (cracking) is accomplished over a catalyst at 1750 degrees Fahrenheit.  The cracking reaction is an endothermic reaction with no potential of runaway.  From the dissociator the cracking products, hydrogen and nitrogen gas, are cooled by a cross-exchanger and further cooled by use of an aftercooler.  The final product, (H2-N2) is fed to a argon purification skid.\n\nThe worst-case scenario, based on the EPA's definition for a toxic gas release, would be the rupture of the 18,000 gallon Ammonia Tank. The results would be a maximum release of 46,000 lbs of ammonia over a 10 minute period.\n\nThe endpoint of 0.14mg/L (EPRG-2 Level) was determined to be 2.6 miles using the RMP*Comp. (1.06) software. The weather conditions used were a wind speed of 1.5 meters/sec., Stability Class F, an air temperature of 77 degrees F and urban topographical terrain.\n\nThe impacted area would affect 530 residents and several special receptors which includes one Nursing Home  and several churches and the Ocmulgee Academy School based on the 1990 US Census data obtained from"

The employees  are periodically evaluated to ensure they posses the necessary skills and knowledge via written tests, observation and/or oral interviews. The training program was last reviewed on 2/15/99.\n\nA contractor screening process has been established and is designed to ensure that contractors hired or used can accomplish their assigned tasks without compromising the safety and health of employees and the public.   The screening program involves obtaining information on the contractor's safety performance, including injury and illness rates, and experience.  In addition, the contractor's safety performance, job skills, knowledge, and certifications (such as pressure vessel welders) are also verified. The contractors safety procedures were last review in Feb. 1999.  \n\nPreStart-up Safety Reviews (PSSR) are used for new or modified processes to improve the design and construction of the process from a reliability and quality stand point.  The PSSR recommendations are resolved before final installations are complete. Other items completed prior to initial process startup include piping and instrument diagrams, operating procedures, and ensuring operating personnel are fully trained.  The initial startup and normal operating procedures are fully evaluated as part of the PSSR to assure a safe transfer into the normal operating mode for meeting the process parameters. The last PreStart-up Safety Review was conducted on May 1995.\n\nAn on-going mechanical integrity program (maintenance) is used to ensure safe process operations. Equipment used to store, process, or handle ammonia has been designed, constructed, installed, and maintained to minimize releases.  The mechanical integrity program includes the identification and categorization of equipment/instrumentation, inspection/tests and their frequencies, development of maintenance procedures and training of maintenance personnel, criteria for acceptable test results, documentation of test/insp"

The BOC Hazardous Work Program describes the steps that a supervisor, contractor representative or other authorized issuer needs to follow to manage hazardous work.   The program references and coordinates applicable lockout/tagout procedures, line breaking, hot work authorization, elevated work/fall protection, controlling access to covered process areas, and excavation procedures. BOC's Confined Space Entry Program is a separate permitting system designed to manage it's employees/contractors in performing this type of work. This Program was review in 9/3/98 for both employees and contractors.\n \nManagement of Change (MOC) procedures have been developed for permanent changes to process chemicals, technology, equipment and facilities.  MOC procedures are designed to ensure that prior to any change occurring, that technically qualified personnel with knowledge and expertise of the chemical process, reviews and approves the proposed changes.  This would include both technical and mechanical changes.  Process changes include all modifications to equipment, procedures, raw materials and processing conditions other than replacement in kind.  A Process Change Authorization is required for all changes.  Management of Change procedures were review on 2/15/99.\n\nProcess incidents which result in or could reasonably have resulted in a release of ammonia are investigated, including near misses, within 48 hours of the incident.

No passive/active mitigation or administrative controls were considered in this assessment.\n\nThe alternative release, or more probable, scenario which was determined involved the uncoupling of the 2 fill hose during filling of the tank from a road trailer. This release would result in the 10 second release of 15 gallons (77 lb) of liquid anhydrous ammonia prior to the activation of the emergency shut-off valve. The Excess Flow Valve would shut-off the liquid pump along with the activation of the Emergency Shut-off Valve by the driver, resulting in termination of the release.\n\nThe release endpoint of 0.14mg/L (EPRG-2) was determined to be 0.13 miles using the RMP*Comp. (1.06) software. The Weather conditions used were a wind speed of 3.0 meters/sec., Stability Class D, and air temperature of 77 degrees F and urban topographical terrain.\n\nThe affected area would include 16 homes with approximately 41 residents and one businesses (Amercord) based on actual observations. \n\nPassive and Active Mitigation systems in place that would reduce the likelihood of a release or the release itself.
