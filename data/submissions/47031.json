This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive Accidental Release Prevention Program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\r\n\r\n2.\tThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled:\r\n\r\nOur facility is used primarily for the refrigeration and storage of fresh produce.  We have one regulated substance present at our facility.  This substance is Anhydrous Ammonia and is used as a refrigerant in our cold storage system.\r\n\r\nThis is a Program Level 2 CalARP.  \r\n\r\n3.\tThe Worst Case Release Scenario and the Alternative Release Scenario, including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario:\r\n\r\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used the EPA's RMP Comp ?.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\r\n\r\nWorst Case:\r\n\r\nThe worst case release scenario involves a catastrophic release from the receiver tank in the Cold Storage Engine Room.  In this scenario 3,649 lbs. of Ammonia is released.  Total vaporization is assumed within 10 minutes.  No passive mitigation systems such as a building enclosure were taken into account to calculate this scenario.  \r\n\r\nAt Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 meters/second wind speed to a toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L.

Under neutral weather conditions and a rural setting, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L of Ammonia is 0.2 miles, potentially affecting 454 persons.\r\n\r\n\r\n4.\tThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps:\r\n\r\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the California Accidental Release Prevention Program requirements set out under CCR Title 19, Division 2, Chapter 4.5.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with the Uniform Mechanical Code and piping was constructed in accordance with ANSI standards.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\r\n\r\nSafety Information:\r\n\r\nBristol Ag Partners maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards (MSDS), operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Review:\r\n\r\nOur facility has conducted comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The studies were undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and will be revalidated at a regular interval of every five years or whenever major changes in the process are proposed.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.  The most recent Process Hazard Revie"

These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\r\n\r\nTraining:\r\n\r\nBristol Ag Partners has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating the refrigeration system process are competent in the operating procedures associated with the process.  Refresher training is provided at least annually and more frequently as needed.\r\n\r\nMaintenance Program:\r\n\r\nBristol Ag Partners carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps. The most recent review/revision of maintenance procedures was performed on 10/20/2006.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\r\n\r\nCompliance Audits:\r\n\r\nBristol Ag Partners intends to conduct audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the CalARP rule are being implemented.  The most recent compliance audit was conducted on 10/20/2006.

Due to our stringent release prevention policies, there has never been an accidental release at this facility.\r\n6.\tEmergency Response Plan:\r\n\r\nBristol Ag Partners carries a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials.  The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas when appropriate.\r\n\r\nTo ensure proper functioning, our emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced.  In addition, the written plan is reviewed annually and promptly updated if necessary to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within our processes that would require a modified emergency response.\r\n\r\n7.\tPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:\r\n\r\nSeveral developments and findings have resulted from the implementation of the various elements of our accidental release prevention program.  The installation of additional process controls, ongoing safety inspections and further employee training are some of the major steps we want to take to improve safety at our facility.  These changes are expected to be implemented by 01/01/2007."
