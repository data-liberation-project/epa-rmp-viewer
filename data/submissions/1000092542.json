Carbon disulfide (CS2): The process line from the pump leaks beyond the immediate area of the storage tank while material is being removed from the tank. The release would not be contained and the leakage would located at the tank farm. The rate of the leak is estimated at 25 gallons/minute for a period of 15 minutes. Safeguards:\r\n\r\nSafeguards include an operator in attendance when pumping carbon disulfide; a trained Hazwoper team; and process procedure established to stop pumping at a specified time and investigate cause of leak. Impact Area: The release is calculated to extend beyond the property line but would not affect any residential or industrial areas."

Also, contractors working in the plant are initially and annually evaluated for safety performance and receive annual Safety and Hazard Communications Training. \r\n(2) Maintenance: The plant has a corrective maintenance, a preventive maintenance, and a predictive maintenance program along with a maintenance training program to ensure that process system integrity is maintained. \r\n(3) Management of Change: A management of change program has been established for the plant incorporating procedural changes, equipment changes, personnel changes or chemical changes. \r\n\r\nIV. The Five-Year Accident History\r\nThe plant has not had any events at the Henry plant that would qualify for inclusion in the RMP 5- year accident history.\r\n\r\nV. The Emergency Response Program\r\nThe plant has a series of procedures dealing with emergency response within the facility. \r\n\r\nVI.

Health, Safety and Environmental Policies: The Henry Plant is governed by a commitment to excellence as it pertains to Health, Safety, and Environmental performance. The Henry Plant conducts its operations and business activities in a manner that protects our employees, our communities and the environment. The Henry Plant is committed to compliance with the requirements of all applicable laws and regulations and seeks continuous improvement of its health, safety, and environmental performance. All employees of the Henry Plant are committed to carrying out these principles.\r\n\r\nII. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled: The Henry Plant is located approximately two miles northeast of the City of Henry, Illinois. It is located on a 250-acre tract adjacent to the Mexichem Specialty Resins and the City of Henry Waste Treatment Facility. The plant manufactured industrial organic chemicals and is currently being decommissioned. The plant currently employs approximately 10 employees. At this location carbon disulfide is the only toxic chemical subject to the threshold quantity of the RMP regulation.\r\n\r\nIII. The Accidental Release Prevention Program and Emergency Response Policies at the Stationary source\r\n\r\nThe Henry Plant's policy has been to meet or exceed requirements established by applicable safety, health and environmental regulations promulgated by Federal and State agencies. Our safety policies and practices have historically preceded the regulation of such practices under, for example, the OSHA Process Safety Management Standard and the EPA Risk Management Program Rule. Our policy is to strive for zero OSHA Recordable injuries, Lost Time Injuries, Serious Operational Incidents and Releases to the Environment. These measurements are tracked on a continuous basis.
