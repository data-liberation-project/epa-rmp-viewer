We prevent accidents by designing for safety, taking care of our equipment, operating safely, and auditing our operations.   SFFI has an active Process Safety Management (PSM) program in place under Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) which is audited annually. \n\nSFFI is a year round facility processing frozen vegetables.  SFFI also freezes fresh vegetables during the packaging season usually June to November.  At this facility there are 10 freeze tunnels and two large cold storage facilities.  SFFI takes pride in its employees and their safety record.  All employees have a great safety record and undergo refresher training on a yearly basis.  The Ammonia PSM is reviewed annually and updated as needed.  All supervisors are familiar with ammonia safety procedures.  It is important to SFFI that our close family of employees is safe when working around hazardous chemicals.    \n\n5 Year Accident Summary\nSFFI has proven to be safe facility. This is demonstrated by the fact that SFFI has a good safety record with few accidental releases.  A worst case scenario modeling was performed for a large scale ammonia release. \n\nThere has not been a release incident in the last five years.  The last release occurred on June 23, 2004.  An employee was repairing a subcooler; the employee believed the system to be drained when he removed the hose and opened the valve.  The release was stopped after releasing 48 lbs of ammonia.  \n\nPrevention Program (Program 3)\n\nSFFI has a comprehensive Process Safety Management program that is directed by Rick Turner, Refrigeration Supervisor.  The program meets all the requirements of 29 CFR 1910.119.  The PSM is composed of the following 13 elements:\n\nEmployee Participation\nProcess Safety Information\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOperating Procedures\nTraining\nContractors\nPre-Startup Safety Review\nMechanical Integrity\nHot Work Permit\nManagement of Cha"

Most of the requirements are audited annually.  Because of the scope of PSM it will not be completely included within this RMP document but will be maintained as a separate document.  \n\nCommunity Response Plan\n\nIn the case of an accidental release all nonessential personnel are to leave the area of the possible release. Various emergency controls are activated; exhaust fans may be used to expel ammonia from the facility or doors may be closed if it is determined that the release should be contained.  Local emergency officials are immediately notified and requested to assist by dialing 911.  All engine room operators have been trained and fully understand how to implement the procedures in the case of a catastrophic ammonia release.  \n\nA community notification plan is activated if the release could affect the surrounding neighborhood.  In order to alert the community the police or sheriff from Weston will be notified by the 911 operator.  The Weston officer will then proceed to contact people starting downwind from the facility and inform them what they should do. The East Umatilla County Rural Fire Department (EUFD) will report to SFFI to lend assistance.  The EUFD may also be used to contact local citizens and coordinate the emergency effort.  This plan was prepared with input from the local fire department, the Hazardous Materials response team from Hermiston and Umatilla County Emergency Management.  \n"
