      "SummaryText": "Eagle Food Centers' distribution facilityand Headquarter offices have been located in Milan, IL for over thirty (30) years.   The distribution center receives, stores, and ships grocery, non-food, frozen, dairy, meat, and produce products as ordered by the ninety (90) Eagle Food Center full line grocery stores.      The Perishable Department, which includes the freezer, meat, dairy, and produce sections, is cooled by a refrigeration system that utilizes anhydrous ammonia as it's refrigerant.    It is estimated that the system contains approximately 15,000 pounds (~2140 gallons) of ammonia.   In recent years both the Occupational Health Administration and Environmental Protection Agency have passed regulations outlining specific requirements that companies using,producing, or distributing hazardous chemicals must follow to ensure employee and public safety.   Anhydrous ammonia is included as an extremely hazardous substance.     Eagle Foods has always incorporated safety and the safe operation of the refrigeration system as a normal operational procedure as evidenced by our record of never having a major release of ammonia in the many years of the system's working life.   The Maintenance personnel in charge of the system are as knowledgable and responsible as anyone in the ammonia refrigeration industry.   That knowledge and experience is currently being passed on to others during our four year apprenticeship program.     Although we've never had a major release of ammonia from the system, personnel are trained in how to respond should that event ever occur.   Training is accomplished in a classroom setting while on the job and by sending our designated emergency response personnel to formal programs to be instructed by experts in the industry.     The Milan area emergency response organizations have toured the facility and are familiar with what their role is should an accidental release of ammonia occur at our site.     A \"worst-case\" release scenario has been crea"

      "SummaryText": "ted to determine just who and what might be affected.   For our system, a worst-case would be a release of 5,000 lbs. of ammonia in a ten minute time period.   Ammonia is readily absorbed into the atmosphere, even in a large quantity such as 5,000 lbs. hence, depending on weather conditions, a cloud of ammonia vapor would dissipate to a non-toxic level before traveling 1/2 mile from the facility.     The scenario, although possible, is highly unlikely as there is rarely that much ammonia consolidated in a single vessel during the normal operation of our system.   An alternative scenario was created that would result in a release of a reportable quantity of 100lbs. from a lioquid line pipe.   A release such as this may result in an ending point of 1/10th of a mile and would travel off our property boundries only if the wind were blowing in a southwesterly direction.   The release would not affect area residences.   Eagle management and employees are committed to operating our refrigeration system in the safest possible manner.   Occupational Safety & Health Administration regulations are in place and incorporated into our normal activities.   The system has been analyzed, compared,  and measured against numerous guidance publications for the safe operation of ammonia refrigeration systems as established by the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration and the American National Standards Institute.   As a matter of practice, we will continue to evaluate new ideas regarding system safety for our Employees, the surrounding community, and the mechanical integrity of our process."
