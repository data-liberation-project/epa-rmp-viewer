Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nThe Emergency response procedures are detailed in the TLC/Sara Lee SouthWest Regional Logistics Center Emergency and Hazardous Materials Response Plans and Procedures. These manuals were designed to meet the following objectives.\n\n\n\n1) To save lives.\n\n2) To minimize and avoid injuries.\n\n3) To protect the environment and the public.\n\n4) To minimize property damage.\n\n\n\nThe Emergency Response Plan had Procedures provides the reporting and notification procedures,evacuations procedures,and mitigation procedures that may be implemented to ensure operators respond effectively to an emergency situation. All employees are trained in there specific roles when responding to an emergency. The manuals are kept in strategic locations throughout the facilities and are readily available to all employees.\n\n\n\nB. STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\n\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system is a closed loop system that cycles refrigerant, or ammonia, from a ligiud to gas and back to liquid again. The system, consisting of vessels, and interconnecting piping, valaves, and process equipment,cycles ammonia through various stataes(high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid,low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration for product and process equipment.\n\n\n\nChanges in pressure are directly related to changes in temperature: lowering thje ammonia pressure lowers its temperature.

Heat is later removed from the ammonia as it is condensed back into a liquid. Typical operating conditions range from 5\"hg on the low side to 190 psig on the high side.\n\n\n\nAmmonia is used as a refrigerant in the refrigeration process.\n\n\n\nThe Maximum intended inventory of ammonia is 12,800 pounds.\n\n\n\nC. ACCIDENTAL RELEASE AND PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe facility operates in accordance with the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) giudelines and standards including the following:\n\n\n\nIIAR Bulletin 107, A Suggested Safely and Operating Procedures When Making Ammonia Refrigeration Tie-ins\n\n\n\nIIAR Bulletin 109, Minimum Safety Criteria for a Safe Ammonia Refrigeration System\n\n\n\nIIAR Bulletin 110, \"Start-up, Inspection, and Maintenance of Ammonia Refrigeration Systems\"\n\n\n\nIn addition the TLC/SaraLee Southwest Regional Logistics Center has implemented a Process Safety Management program for compliance with CFR 29, 1910.119. This include an initial Process Hazard Analysis that is revalidate every five years. In addition, the facility has a Mechanical Integrity program that includes an Engineering Cxhecklist for equipment inspections.\n\n\n\nD. FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nThere have been no reported release of ammonia at this facility over the last five years(New facility charged 12/05/2007)\n\n\n\nE. Emergency Response Program\n\n\n\nTLC`s Emergency Response Program is described in  their Emergency Response Plan (ERP) for the TLC/SaraLee Southwest Regional Logistics Center.\n\nThis plan includes planned responses and procedures for evacuation. Notification and alarm procedures are outlined in the ERP as well. The plan addresses training requirements for employees, including production employess, supervisors, managers, and operators. Emergency response drills involving all facility personnel are performed on an annual basis. This ensur"

PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nThere have been numerous changes to the facility to improve process chemical safety as a result of PSM and RMP implementation. TLC/SaraLee Southwest Regional Logistics Center will maintain PSM and RMP programs for continued process safety improvement. This will be accomplished through audits, PHA revalidations, training, mechanical integrity testing and inspections.The facility is in the process of updating P&ID valve labeling."
