Also, as the operator of a facility at which substances may be used that in uncontrolled situations could cause harm to the public and damage to the environment, we will strive for environmental excellence with a commitment to continual improvement, pollution prevention and compliance with legislative requirements.  The Risk Management Program (RMP) is one of these programs.\n     Each employee in areas where the RMP is applicable will be knowledgeable of the related policies and procedures and the supervisors or a designated person is required to insure that they understand them.  Employees and supervisors are required to comply with our policies and are subject to corrective action in those cases determined to indicate willful violation.\n    A written plan of action regarding the implementation of employee participation in the program has been developed as a part of our Release Prevention Program as specified by 29 CFR 1910.119.

As a manufacturer of aluminum ingots its products are sold globally under its corporate company, Connell, Ltd, 1 International Place, Fort Hill Square, Boston Massachusetts.\n    The Wabash Alloys facility is located at Hazle and Biddle Streets, Marietta, Pennsylvania 17547.  The site is approximately 8 acres in size.  The site is serviced with electricity, water, natural gas, and sewer lines.  The water lines, natural gas lines and sewer laterals enter the site from the north.\n    The surrounding vicinity consists generally of residential structures.  \nA 32,000 pound chlorine tanker truck is stationed on the northeast side.  Access to the property is to the north side as well as employee parking.  The entire site is fenced.\nOperation Description\n    The site process involves the sorting, grading, processing (removing organics via a rotary kiln), melting, and alloying of metals for sale.  As part of the sorting process, large aluminum scrap is shredded or crushed, and ferrous metals are removed using a maseparation process.  A dryer with a secondary combustion unit and baghouse is used to remove impurities from the aluminum scrap such as moisture, paints and resins.\n    The sorted aluminum is charged into one of two furnaces where the metal is melted.  Once melted, various additives are used to modify the composition and hence the physical characteristics of the metal.  The metal is degassed by bubbling nitrogen through the molten metal.   Magnesium is removed by bubbling chlorine through the melt to form magnesium chloride.  Materials kept on-site for the process are aluminum, magnesium, zinc, copper, silicon, sodium, beryllium, and strontium.  Approximately 8,000,000 pounds of these materials are on-site at any given time.\n    Once the molten product is prepared, the melt is either poured and cooled as ingots or sows, or is transferred to heated crucibles for shipment as a molte"

The emissions from the dryer are treated first using a secondary combustion unit, and then with a baghouse.  Emissions from melters, ingot and sow molding processes, and dross cooling operations are controlled using a baghouse.\n    Chlorine is received at the facility in a 32,000 pound tanker truck.  The tanker is connected into piping through which chlorine as a liquid flows to a vaporizer at a pressure of 150 psi. \n     The vaporizer heats the chlorine to the vapor state by a recirculated hot water electric heater which is thermostatically controlled.  Chlorine gas exits the vaporizer through a regulator and into a piping manifold.  Each furnace has its own chlorine supply pipe and flowmeter which regulates the pressure.\n     At each particular furnace the chlorine gas passes a shut off valve, then through another flowmeter, and then through a needle valve where its flow is regulated by the furnace operator to the molten metal pump.  Close to the needle valve is the tubing connection that connects to a carbon lance which feeds the gas to the pump housing.  Here the chlorine reacts with magnesium and aluminum to demag and clean the aluminum alloy.\nCommunity Description  \nGeography and Weather:\nThe city of Marietta is located approximately 12 miles west of Lancaster, PA.  As a small community it is also located approximately 15 miles from Interstate 83.\n    The weather during the winter includes numerous snow falls with an average temperature of 200.

The following information was determined using the Automated Resource for Chemical Hazard Incident Evaluation (ARCHIE) model, based on the stability class F, 5.5 mph wind speed level of 3ppm for chlorine.  This resulted in a release rate of 32,000 lbs/min, and an end point of 17.02 miles from the spill point during summer season at 85 degrees F.\n    As an alternative case scenario it was decided that the possibility would include damage to a 1\" pipe, probably at the connection station where the facility is connected to the chlorine tanker car.
