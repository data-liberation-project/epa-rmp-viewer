      "SummaryText": "r Treatment Plant, as per Appendix F Supplemental Risk Management Program Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants.  This guidance considers the release of the Chlorine Gas of the entire container (2,000 pounds) during 10 minutes and other specifications related to the weather conditions and a radio of 1.3 miles, for a chlorine concentration equal or higher than 3 ppm, which is the American Industrial Hygiene Association exposure limit above which it is determined human health will be affected.  Using the Landview 6 Simulator and the US Census 2010, it was identified that 6,266 residents are inside the 1.3 miles radio.  Lago Patillas is an environmental receptors (state parks, or official designated wildlife preserves) located within this radio area.  The ALOHA Modeling Dispersion Program was used to simulate the gas dispersion.Due to both processes are close to each other, the worst case scenario for the storage facility was designed considering the widest extension of dispersion of the two process, which is the chlorine injection process.\n\nAlternative Case Scenario:\nThe more realistic scenario was also simulated as a release of a 880 pounds container, but throughout a valve seal rupture. Part of  Patillas reservoir is located within this radio area.\n\nGeneral Accident Release Prevention Program \nPRASA is actually in a very aggressive operation to implement a Prevention Plan to ensure the maintenance and mechanical integrity of the facility which will improve significantly the safety scope of the current prevention plans.  Standard Operational Procedures (SOP's) are already in place to comply the OSHA and PROSHO requirements in order to keep all the involved parties aware of the hazardous and risk related to the chlorine.  List of all SOP are indicated in the PSM report and are located in the facility.\n\nEmergency Response Program:\nPRASA has various SOP's to manage emergency programs associated to a release of the chemical and also related to the emergency actions to"

      "SummaryText": "Patillas Filtration Plant is located at Carretera 181 Km. 32.8 Bo Marin Bajo, Patillas Puerto Rico, 00723.  This water treatment plant is owned by Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Authority (PRASA) which is a Government Agency.  PRASA has developed the RMP following the Program #3 for the Management and Prevention of Risks associated with the storage and handling of the toxic substance used as for water disinfection: Chlorine.  The RMP was prepared in compliance with EPA 40 CFR Part 68.  The Prevention Program was prepared in accordance with OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation, as established in 29 CFR Part 1910.119.\n\nAccidental Release:\nIt is PRASA policy to comply with EPA and OSHA Federal and State applicable requirements. Chlorine is a toxic substance regulated by EPA, for that reason Patillas Filtration Plant has undergone some engineering controls changes.  These changes have been put in place to improve security and as a part of the Prevention Plan implanted to protect the wellness of workers, employees, contractors, visitors and immediately surrounding areas and inhabitants.\n\nThe Stationary Source and Regulated Substance Handled:\nPatillas Filtration Plant is located close to the area where the plants supply the potable water.  The chlorine is used as a disinfectant to destroy the microorganism that could cause illness in humans.\n\nThe chlorine is delivered from the PRASA Storage Center in Puerto Nuevo to the plant in one (1) ton containers. The containers are connected to chlorinators from which the chlorine flows to the injectors and then the chlorinated water is sent to two (2) different injections points along the process of the plant. The other process is a warehouse containing 150 pounds cylinders for distribution among neighbording facilities. This maximun inventory for this process is 6,750 pounds for a total of 18,750 pounds for the whole facility.\n\nWorst Case Scenario:\nThe Worst Case Scenario was determined as indicated in the EPA Wastewate"
