Chlorine is used in the disinfection process of treating wastewater before the water is discharged into the Tar-Pamilco River Basin. The plant is located 1399 West 2nd in the City of Washington. There have been no chlorine incidents or accidents in the most recent Five-Year history period.\n\nThe Process Safety Management (PSM) that was completed in 1996 has been maintained current for the past five years. The PSM compliance also demonstrates our compliance with the Risk Management Program (RMP) Prevention Program. Key activities have included:\n\noAn annual review of  all chlorine, PSM and RMP procedures\noThree Year Refreshed training conducted on November 14, 2003\noA Process Hazards Analysis conducted in April 27, 2000 \noSelf Audits every three years with the last one on May 12, 2004\noA comprehensive Mechanical Integrity program that uses a computer-based maintenance scheduling program\noAn annual review and update of the Emergency Response Plan including periodic drills with the Washington Fire/Rescue Department\n\nIn addition to these compliance activities, the City of Washington has implemented these chlorine safety controls\n\noThe cylinders are stored inside a secure building which provide significant passive mitigation against a release\noThe plant computerized SCADA system monitors the chemical release alarms 24 hours a day\noAny active mitigation would be applied by the Haz-Mat team and support personnel of the Washington Fire/Rescue Department. \n\nWithin the Utilities department, there are monthly safety meeting to review an OSHA subject or discuss a safety issue.
