This commitment is demonstrated by our efforts in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, facility trained personnel will evaluate the situation, take actions within the capabilities of the facility, and/or notify the necessary outside agencies.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\r\n\r\nThe Maysville Gas Plant (Facility), located in Maysville, Oklahoma, U.S.A., operates a variety of processes to produce Propane, Normal Butane, Isobutane, Ethane, Methane, and Gasoline Condensate petroleum products from natural gas. The Maysville Gas Plant has regulated flammables, including:\r\n     - Methane\r\n     - Ethane\r\n     - Propane\r\n     - Isobutane\r\n     - Normal Butane\r\n     - IsoPentane\r\n     - Pentane\r\n\r\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM \r\n\r\nFollowing is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the Maysville Gas Plant.  Processes at the Maysville Gas Plant which are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) Risk Management Program (RMP) regulation are also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) process safety management (PSM) standard.

Employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's accident prevention program.  Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the facility and addresses each accident prevention program element.  In addition, the Maysville Gas Plant has a number of initiatives under way to address process safety and employee safety issues. These initiatives include forming teams to promote both process and personal safety.  The teams typically have members from various areas of the plant, including operations, maintenance, engineering, and plant management.\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\n\r\nThe Maysville Gas Plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific inventories, and equipment design basis/ configuration information. The Maysville Gas Plant currently has a Process Safety Management/Risk Management Plan PSM/RMP) Coordinator on site that assists in maintenance of up-to-date process safety information. A table summarizing the reference documents and their location is readily available as part of the written employee participation plan to help employees locate any necessary process safety information.  Chemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDS). For specific process areas, the facility has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) in Operator Procedures Manual.

This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment. This information, in combination with procedures and equipment operating history, provides a basis for inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes so that safety features in the process are not compromised. \r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\r\n \r\nThe Maysville Gas Plant has a comprehensive program to identify and control hazards associated with the various processes. Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify potential hazard controls in place to manage these hazards, and recommend additional controls, as appropriate.  The Maysville Gas Plant uses hazard and operability studies (HAZOP's) which are conducted using a team of employees who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. This team identifies and evaluates potential hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures.\r\n\r\nThe Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) team findings are forwarded to local management for resolution. Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings are based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team. The approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.

These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate. The procedures are maintained current and accurate by revising them as necessary through the management of change procedure to reflect the changes. In addition, the Maysville Gas Plant maintains information on how to respond to upper or lower limit exceedances for specific process or equipment parameters. This information, along with written operating procedures, is readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\r\n\r\nTraining\r\n\r\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the Maysville Gas Plant has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process. New employees receive basic training in process operations if they are not already familiar with such operations. After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.

Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the facility has procedures in place to ensure that contractors:   \r\n     (1) perform their work in a safe manner\r\n     (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills\r\n     (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace\r\n     (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency\r\n     (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and\r\n     (6) inform facility personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.\r\n\r\nThis is accomplished by providing contractors with:\r\n     (1) a process overview\r\n     (2) information about safety and health hazards\r\n     (3) emergency response plan requirements, and\r\n     (4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the Maysville Gas Plant evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor.  Facility personnel periodically monitor contractor performance with regard to their safety obligations.\r\n\r\nPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\r\n\r\nThe Maysville Gas Plant conducts a PSSR for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information. The purpose of the PSSR is to see that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service."
