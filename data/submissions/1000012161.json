In order to protect its employees, the public and the environment, Ralcorp Frozen has an integrated safety management program to prevent ammonia releases and mitigate the consequences of a release, should one occur. \n\n3.Worst Case and Alternative Case Release Scenarios\n\nOff Site Consequence (OCA) data is available for review onsite at the Kent facility.\n\n4.General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Ammonia Specific Prevention\n\nThis Ralcorp facility has an emergency plan that addresses the response necessary for a release of ammonia from the refrigeration system. Because of the pungent odor of ammonia, any leak is easily detected.  The system is designed so that major components can be isolated by closing selected valves.
