      "SummaryText": "The facility covered in the Risk Management Program (RMP) includes the Sabine River Water Treatment Plant for the City of Longview.  The process included in the RMP is the disinfection process using chlorine and anhydrous ammonia.  Currently the plant uses one ton chlorine cylinders (2000 lbs).  The chlorine system includes four cylinders mounted for use, with two cylinders on-line (4,000 lbs) and two cylinders ready for service on stand-by (4,000 lbs) when the other two are empty.  Since the threshold quantity for chlorine is 2,500 lbs, thiess is regulated by the current RMP rules.  The ammonia system includes a 3,000 gallon steel pressure tank.  The maximum capacity of the 3,000 gallon tank is approximately 15,000 lbs.  The fill capacity for the anhydrous ammonia is 85% of full tank capacity or a total of 12,750 lbs.  The threshold quantity for anhydrous ammonia is 10,000 lbs.  The facility handles several other chemicals and processes.  These chemicals are either not on the list of regulated toxic substances or do not exceed the current  threshold limits.  \n\nA worst-case release scenario and an alternative release scenario were developed for both chlorine and anhydrous ammonia at the plant.  The OCA Guidance Tables from the EPA Guidance Manual were used for the worst-case and alternative release scenarios for both chemicals.  Mitigation measures were not considered in the analysis.  The worst-case release scenario for both processes consists of release of the greatest amount held in a single vessel over a ten minute period of time.  The chlorine scenario produced a distance to end-point of release of 4.3 miles.  The ammonia scenario produced a distance to end-point of release of 2.12 miles.  The alternative release scenario for the chlorine cylinders consists of failure of a 1-inch schedule 80 pipe connecting  two 1-ton containers.  The result is a distance to end-point of release of 0.24 miles.  The alternative release scenario for the ammonia tank consists of l"

The alternative release scenarios were chosen to better represent a possible release event in accordance with any previous accidental release that occurred or potential problems experienced at the plant.  Both the worst case and alternative release scenarios will be updated at least every five years or if a chemical storage value occurs.\n\nThe prevention program for the plant consists of several sections, including safety information, hazard review, operating procedures, training, maintenance, compliance audits, and incident investigations.  The safety information, hazard review, and operating procedures sections are completed for both the chlorine and ammonia systems.  The training, maintenance, compliance audits, and incident investigations sections are completed for the plant as a system.  The safety information includes material safety data sheets for each chemical, maximum inventories, safe operating limits, equipment specifications, and codes and stardards for design.  The plant maintains a form specifying the current safety information used and documents any changes as they occur.  The safety form must be updated at least every two years.  The hazard review information includes the forms necessary for the reviews that will be performed at least every five years for the different processes.  The operating procedures information includes standard operating procedures for initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency or normal shutdown, and startup following an emergency or normal shutdown.  Forms are provided to document the procedures for the plant, including a chlorine checklist and chlorine change-over form.  The training information includes certification that all employees have been trained for the processes and equipment that they operate.  Documentation is also kept for refresher training that must be provided at least every thr"

The forms also include verification and information documenting the development of the maintenance program for the facility and must be updated at least every two years.  The compliance audit information includes the forms necessary for the audit and the certification to be completed at least every three years.  Incident investigation information includes the forms to be completed upon occurrence of an incident, including the Accident Investigation Report, Chemical Release Form, and Safety Team Report.  The investigation summaries are maintained for at least five years.  The City of Longview Sabine River Water Treatment Plant previously maintained material relating to the areas discussed above.  This information for the chlorine and ammonia processes will now be documented together with additional RMP information.\n\nThe five-year accident history for the plant includes one accident.  The accident involved a small chlorine release in 1999 reported as a chlorine leak around a loose packing nut on a one ton cylinder.  The amount of release was mininmal.  No one offsite was injured, but one treatment plant employee left the plant to receive medical attention.     \n\nThe emergency response program includes the response program for incidental leaks as handled by plant employees and the program for major spills and/or releases as covered in the City of Longview's Emergency Response Program.  The incidental releases include leaks encountered when installing the cylinders for use, dismantling the chlorine cylinders, and any minor release found upon inspection or testing of the equipment.  Proper handling equipment is maintained at the plant for use in the incidental release situations.  Major releases or problems encountered with the smaller releases will be handled by outside assistance.  The plant will contact the City of Longview Fire Department for assistance with chemcial releases"

The fire department will iniate contact with the First Call program for emergency notification assistance. \n\nThe City of Longview Emergency Response Plan for Hazardous Material Incidents is identified in detail in the RMP with copies of the forms for emergency notification.  These emergency notification forms include:  Emergency Public Information Checklist for Hazardous Material Incident, Sample Radio/TV Message for Unidentified Spill/Release in Heavy Traffic Area, Sample Radio/TV Message for Low Hazard/Confined Spill/Release - No General Evacuation, Sample Radio/TV Message for High Hazard Spill/Release - In Place Sheltering, Sample Radio/TV Message for High Hazard Spill/Release - General Evacuation, and Sample Radio/TV Message for High Hazard Spill/Release - School Evacuation.\n\nCurrently the Sabine River Plant is scheduled for the construction of improvements to its chemical feed system  this year.  The new system is designed to incorporate a dual header feed system for chlorine.  The improvements will allow more frequent and better inspection and testing of the chemical equipment.  Specifications and information for the new equipment are contained in the RMP."
