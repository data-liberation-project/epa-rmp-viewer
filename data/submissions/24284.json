Our facility makes products which help produce better and healthier foods.  We also make products to eliminate pests indoors and outdoors.\n\nAt Syngenta, Safety,  Health, and the Environment are always our top priorities.  They are top priorities from product development right on through its final use.  This benefits our community,  our customers,  and our employees.\n\nIt is the responsibility of Syngenta Cold Creek management to identify and control risks to an acceptable level. \n\nWe are an accepted part of our community because we strive to meet all relevant laws and regulations so that we can protect the health of all employees and our neighbors,  and reduce environmental impact to a practical minimum.  We participate in our Lemoyne Industrial Park Community Advisory Panel which is an active and worthwhile panel.  We are also active members of the Chemical Manufacturers Association (CMA) Phosgene Panel.\n\nWe have adopted a \"Zero Tolerance\" philosophy defined as the level of acceptance the organization has for leaks,  spills,  and incidents.  Zero Tolerance means that we don't accept incidents and injuries as a given.  We recognize they are preventable and we are accountable to establish their cause and elimination.  Zero Tolerance is a  part of our culture.  It is   accepted proactively,  pursued during work activities by every member of the Cold Creek Site.\n\nWe have worked 2.0 years and greater than 1.0 million manhours without a Lost Time Injury.
