The service area is located at an elevation of approximately 8,000feet on the eastern sides of the Sierra Nevada mountain range.  The town is surrounded by the United States Forest Service lands and is heavily utilized as a recreational area.\n\n\n\nThe district has institued a Risk Management Program to ensure that its facilities utilizing regulated hazardous chemical substances are opeated accroding to the rules established by the United States Environmental Protection Agency.\n\n\n\nThrough its risk management program the District has perfromed a hazard assessment to assess the potential effects of an accidental release of a hazardous substance.  This assessment includes perfroming an off-site consequence analysis including analysis of a worst-case scenario and one alternative release scenario.\n\n\n\nThe Dsitrict has established a prevention program to prevent accidental releases of regulated hazardous chemical substances.  This program includes safety precautions and maintenance, monitoring and emplee safety training.\n\n\n\nA response program has also been established that requires specific action to be taken in emergency situations.  This includes procedures for notifying public and local agenicies responsible for responding to accidental releases, and employee response training measures.\n\n\n\nThe District utilizes one regulated substance in its water treatment operations.

Minimal amounts of chlorine gas in the atmosphere will trigger on-site alarms and provide notification.  District personnel also receive specific training in the handling of chlorine cylinders and apparatus.  Only necessary amounts of chlorine required for use in the treatment processes is stored at the water facility to mninimize the potential hazards.  Equipment added to the system are automatic shutof valves on the chlorine cylinder tanks to shut down the accidental release of chlorine.\n\n\n\n                     Five Year History-None\n\n\n\n                     Emergency Repsonse Program\n\n\n\nThe District relies upon the emergency services of the fire department community hazardous materials response team in the even of a catastrophic release of chlorine.
