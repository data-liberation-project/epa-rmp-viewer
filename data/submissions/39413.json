Anhydrous ammonia (NH3), is a \r\ngas at ambient conditions.  The anhydrous ammonia (ammonia) \r\nrefrigeration system is used to manufacture and store milk and related \r\ndairy products.  It is a closed system that may contain as much as 15,000 \r\npounds of ammonia in various physical states (gas, liquid, and saturated \r\nvapor) when fully charged.  The largest vessel is the high pressure \r\nreceiver that operates at approximately 150 psig and can contain as much \r\nas 11,760 pounds of liquid ammonia (at its maximum fill volume of \r\napproximately 75%).  However, during typical operation, the vessel \r\ncontains about 3,000 pounds of ammonia.  Most of the ammonia \r\nequipment is located indoors.  The condensing towers, receiver, and some \r\npiping runs are located outdoors.  The Battle Creek plant is located in a \r\nrural setting.\r\n\r\nAmmonia is the oldest and most common refrigerant in general industrial \r\nuse throughout the world.  It is a high capacity refrigerant that operates at \r\nreasonable pressure.  Although exposure to ammonia is irritating and \r\npotentially toxic in large doses, personnel exposure to more than a small \r\nleak is rare because ammonia operates within a closed system of vessels, \r\npiping, and equipment.  In addition, ammonia can be easily detected by \r\nsmell at levels well below its toxic endpoint.\r\n\r\n1.2\tPROCESS DESCRIPTION\r\nThe anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system at the Battle Creek plant is \r\na single-stage system consisting of a discharge (high pressure) side and a \r\nsuction side.  Three screw compressors and one reciprocating compressor \r\ndraw suction from the suction accumul"

Ammonia liquid which \r\ncollects in the accumulator is returned to the liquid line by a pumper \r\ndrum.  The major discharge from the high side compressors (hot gas) \r\n\r\n\r\nenters a roof-mounted condenser.  A portion of the hot gas is also used for \r\ndefrosting and for operation of the pumper drum.  The condensed liquid \r\nis returned to the high pressure receiver where it is fed to the refrigeration \r\nequipment.\r\n\r\nVarious safety systems are part of the anhydrous ammonia refrigeration \r\nsystem.   These include pressure relief valves and safety interlocks.  \r\nPressure relief valves protect the compressor discharge, condensers, \r\npumper drum, suction accumulators and other pressure vessels, and \r\nsuction lines from overpressurization.  Safety interlocks include high \r\npressure, low pressure, and oil pressure cut-outs for the compressors, as \r\nwell as high level floats for the accumulator.  The high level float turns off \r\nthe king valve to reduce the amount of liquid going to the system, sounds \r\nan alarm in the control room and shuts off the compressors.  The high \r\npressure cut-out for each compressor is set 190 to 200 psig.\r\n2.0\tPREVENTION PROGRAM\r\nThe facility has carefully considered the potential for accidental releases \r\nof ammonia, such as the occurrence of the worst-case and alternative-\r\nrelease scenarios described in Section 2.0.  To help minimize the \r\nprobability and severity of an ammonia release, a prevention program \r\nthat satisfies the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), \r\nProcess Safety Management (PSM) of Highly Hazardous Chemicals \r\nstandard (29 CFR 1910.119) has been implemented.  The key components \r\nof the prevention program are summarized below:\r\n\r\n?\tThe development, documentation, and operator availability of critical \r\nprocess safety information regarding the hazar"
