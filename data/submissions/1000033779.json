The facility is regulated under Risk\r\nManagement Program (RMP) due to onsite anhydrous ammonia storage in excess of the 10,000 pounds RMP\r\napplicability threshold. The facility's only RMP covered process is the ammonia refrigeration system used to\r\nrefrigerate various areas of the facility.\r\n\r\nChemical Safety Overview: The facility overall approach and commitment to chemical safety is demonstrated\r\nby 1) the existing Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM)\r\nprogram as specified by 29 CFR 1910.119 already in place at the facility, and 2) the hazard assessment,\r\nprevention program and emergency response provisions implemented specifically for ammonia in response\r\nto the RMP requirements. The management structure and oversight to ensure safety is documented in the\r\nfacility's PSM and RMP programs and includes compliance with applicable regulations, codes and standards\r\n(i.e. International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) guidance for ammonia).\r\n\r\nFive-Year Accidental History: The facility has had no RMP reportable accidents/releases of ammonia within\r\nthe past five years due to a new facility. \r\n\r\nPrevention Program: The facility has implemented a Program 3 level Prevention Program, as required by the\r\nRMP rules, in accordance with US EPA, OSHA PSM, IIAR, and vendor guidance for ammonia. These\r\nprevention program provisions are specifically intended to minimize the probability and/or consequences of\r\nany accidental ammonia releases from the facility and include such measures as a system hazard review,\r\noperating and maintenance procedures, training, compliance auditing, management system and updates, etc.\r\nThe facility prevention program is an on-going system based on periodic training, incident investigations,\r\naudit"

      "SummaryText": "s, procedure revisions, and RMP updates as required to reflect facility changes and RMP requirements.\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program: The facility has developed an emergency response plan for potential\r\nammonia release scenarios. This plan includes coordination with the facility local fire department responders\r\nand any emergency response activities required.\r\n\r\nSafety Management and Changes: The facility is committed to ensuring its operations are safe and in\r\naccordance with all RMP requirements, and has an established senior manager responsible for RMP\r\ndevelopment, implementation and compliance. This manager is committed to maintaining the safety of the\r\nRMP covered ammonia system through active adherence to the appropriate procedures and codes, While\r\nthis manager carries out the mechanics of the RMP requirements, the authority for such activities comes\r\nfrom the CEO of Nordic. To ensure that the appropriate changes occur as necessary to maintain /improve\r\nsafety, ongoing hazard reviews, training, audits, maintenance and investigations will be conducted as\r\nrequired by RMP. Updates to the RMP will be completed as necessary in response to these activities.\r\n\r\nSummary: As documented in this submittal, the RMP for the facility has been completed in accordance with\r\nall 40 CFR 68 requirements and the facility has certified compliance."
