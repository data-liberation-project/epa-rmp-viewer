      "SummaryText": "The Webster WWTF uses ton cylinders of chlorine. Every year, in-house refresher training covers SCBA and the dangers of chlorine and the safe handling and unloading of the ton cylinders. Reviews of how to check for leaks and what to do in the event of a leak are covered at the annual refresher training held at the plant before the chlorine season.\n\nThe wastewater treatment plant has proceedures for the following scenarios, chlorine delivery, switching chlorine feed systems, procedures for changing empty 1-ton chlorine cylinders, initial startup, normal operation, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and initial startup following a turnaround for safe working conditions.\n\nThe preventative maintenance program provides for the annual rebuilding of regulators and alarms.\n\nThe chlorinator whips are replaced annually.\n\nThe facility has a wind sock to indicate the safe evacuation direction. \n\nThe chlorine handling system incorporates rupture disks, vents and manual shutoffs. Additional safety equipment includes emergency air supply, emergency power and alarms and procedures.\n\nThe chlorine storage room (scale room) and the chlorinator rooms are both monitored with chlorine and sulfur dioxide leak detectors.\n\nThe chlorine system undergoes twice a day inspections and operational checks.There is a log that provides for a record of the inspections that includes the date, time and the initials of the person doing the inspection."
