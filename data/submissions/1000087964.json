      "SummaryText": "Samsung Austin Semiconductor operates a semiconductor manufacturing facility and has reviewed its obligations under Section 112r of the Clean Air Act. There are three RMP covered processes at the Samsung facility; Silane, Anhydrous Hydrochloric Acid and Ammonium Hydroxide. All other chemicals are maintained in volumes less than the threshold quantities.\n\n\n\nSamsung is committed to providing a safe work place with management of chemical hazards. To accomplish this, Samsung has implemented an Integrated Emergency Plan (IEP) in accordance with FEMA guidelines for Integrated Contingency Plans. This IEP includes detailed instructions on detection, response, and recovery from chemical emergencies.  The IEP also includes scenario that may be encountered based on stored materials and operating conditions.\n\n\n\nSamsung maintains a fully trained Emergency Response Team with members covering all shifts throughout the facility. All Emergency Response Team members are trained to HazWOPER 40-hour standards as a minimum. In addition, Samsung maintains full-time Safety Technicians covering 24/7 operations. These Technicians have received advanced training in emergency response and release management. Samsung coordinates training and response efforts with the Austin Fire Department and associated HazMat teams. All employees receive training on emergency awareness and evacuation. \n\n\n\nSamsung complies with the standards for Process Safety Management (29 CR 1910.119) for Nitrogen Trifluoride, Silane, and Hydrochloric Acid. Samsung also complies with International Building Code, International Fire Code, and NFPA 101 (Life Safety Code) as well as applicable EPA, OSHA, and state regulatory requirements.  \n\n\n\nSamsung has not had any releases of Silane, Ammonium Hydroxide or Hydrochloric Acid (the RMP-regulated materials) in the previous five years. There are no major planned changes to the facility's process safety program."
