This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\n                  1) To save lives;\n                  2) To minimize and avoid injuries;\n                  3) To protect the environment; and\n                  4) To minimize property damage.\nAllens maintains an emergency response committee whose members are the designated emergency response coordinators for the facility.  The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazard information, and accident mitigation procedures.  The procedures will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations which may arise at the facility, including any accidental releases of ammonia.  The Plan is reviewed and updated at least once each year.  The Plan was recently reviewed for compliance with the PSM and RMP rules and revised to incorporate facility changes.\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance\n\nThe Allens facility repackages frozen food and prepares breaded/deep-fried frozen foods.  The facility is cooled by a refrigeration process that uses anhydrous ammonia as the refrigerant.  The refrigeration process, consisting of compressors, evaporators, condensers, vessels, piping, valves, and instrumentation, cycles the ammonia through various physical states, from  high pressure liquid, to low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, and then back to high pressure liquid.  These changes in the system pressure enable ammonia to absorb ambient heat and provide cooling to the food storage areas.  Typical operating conditions range from vacuum (approximately 6\"Hg) on the low pressure side of the system to 160 psig on the high pressure side.  The refrigeration process holds 35,000 pounds of ammonia.\n\nAccidental Release Prev"

The facility has trained an Emergency Response Team to First Responder Operations Level, in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.120, Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response (HAZWOPER).  Team members receive annual refresher training as required.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThe Allens Montezuma-Plant #22 facility will continue to implement the recommended action items resulting from the most recent Process Hazard Analysis, and PSM Program review.  Employees will be trained on new or revised procedures as needed."
