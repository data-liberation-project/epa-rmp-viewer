      "SummaryText": "EmpireABO Gas Plant\nRisk Management Plan\n\nExecutive Summary\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nThe Empire ABO Gas Plant demonstrates a commitment to worker and public safety.   This commitment includes regular instruction and training in accident prevention and in emergency response.  Installation of equipment is permitted only after adequate reviews are conducted to ensure that the equipment can be operated without significant impact on workers or the public.  Employees are instructed to operate and maintain equipment within its design limits.  Elkhorn Operating Company, as operator of Empire ABO Plant, recognizes that policies and procedures that protect workers, the public, and the environment, also improve the operating efficiency of a facility.  If a release does occur, plant personnel will utilize their HazWOper training to respond to, control, and contain any release.  \n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF EMPIRE ABO GAS PLANT AS A STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES \n\nThe Empire ABO Gas Plant, located about 8 miles east of Artesia, NM, processes natural gas.  The plant is considered to be a single process qualified for Program Level 1.\n\nProducts produced and stored at this facility include market quality residue gas, propane, butane and natural gasoline. A liquid ethane product is piplelined without storage. The plant also produces sulfur.  All products are extracted from the plant inlet natural gas stream.  The market quality products are all regulated flammables and are stored in quantities that exceed threshold quantities.  The sulfur extraction process involves the reduction of Hydrogen Sulfide (H2S).  The threshold quantity of Hydrogen Sulfide (10,000 lbs) is not met at this facility.\n\n\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS RESULTS\n\nThe WCS associated with the release of flammable substance in Program Level 1 is a vapor cloud explosion (VCE)  involving the full inventory of the largest storage tank containing propane.  This tank is also the largest vessel "

An administrative (written)  procedure is in place to limit the storage inventory in any one tank to 150,000 lbs (approximately 55% of the maximum tank capacity).  The WCS assumes the inventory is released and ignites, reulting in a VCE.  The maximum distance to the 1-psi endpoint for this WCS, using RMPComp ver.1.04, is 0.4 miles.  The evaluation of the release scenario does not take any passive mitigation procedures into account.  There are no public receptors within a 0.4 mile radius of this storage tank.\n\nThe Empire ABO Gas Plant is covered under Program Level 1. Alternative release scenarios are not required.\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe Empire ABO Gas Plant takes several proactive approaches to prevent the accidental release of regulated flammable and/or regulated toxic substances.  The essentials of the accidental release prevention program include worker training, safe work practices, operating knowledge and mechanical integrity.\n\nAll employees and contractors are trained in the hazards associated with regulated substances found at Empire ABO Gas Plant.  Training includes the characteristics of products produced as well as the specific hazards associated with hydrogen sulfide.  All visitors to the plant who might be exposed to operating equipment are required to receive the process overview training prior to entering the plant. This training serves to make workers aware of the importance of conducting plant operations and maintenance in a manner that prevents the release of regulated substances.\n\nMany safe work practices are enforced at Empire ABO Gas Plant.  These practices are found in the plant safety manual.  Safe work practices include procedures for things such as: energy isolation, hot work, crane/lifting operations, vehicle operation and hazard reporting.  All of the safe work practices are intended to provide a margin of safety in work that prevents damage to equipment or injury "

Operating procedures are contained in manuals available to all plant personnel 24 hours/day.  Plant operations knowledge levels on each shift are maintained by limiting the number and classification of operators on vacation at any one time.  Various Plant Operators are trained to relieve Lead Operators as necessary.  Refresher training is conducted as necessary to keep operator skills honed.  This procedure maintains the operators' awareness of design and operating limits for equipment under their control.  Every employee at Empire ABO Plant has the authority to shutdown the plant whenever they feel it is unsafe to operate.  Operating procedures include methods to prevent excessive corrosion in the plant amine systems.\n\nOne of the most significant components of the accidental release prevention program is the mechanical integrity program.  This program utilizes scheduled and unscheduled inspections of vessel and pipe wall thickness, compressor and pump serviceability, critical control calibration, and relief and vent system serviceability.  Wall thickness is used to determine corrosion rates in various equipment.  This program is monitored by an on-site Mechanical Integrity Coordinator who is certified in piping inspection and ultrasonic thickness determination.  Vessels and piping are inspected on a scheduled frequency depending on service and established corrosion rates.  Qualified mechanics constantly inspect and maintain fluid moving equipment such as pumps and compressors.  Repairs are made as necessary. Critical controls, such as those designed to prevent overpressure of vessels and piping, are tested periodically to ensure that they are calibrated accurately.  Pressure safety valves are inspected and tested annually by a certified PSV repair shop. All of these programs are intended to en"
