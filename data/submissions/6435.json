THE PLANT IS APPROXIMATELY 225000 SQ. FT. DESIGNED FOR THE PROCESSING OF GREEN PEAS,CORN AND CARROTS. THE NORMAL PROCESSING OF FRESH VEGETABLES BEGINS IN JUNE AND MAY RUN UNTIL NOVEMBER. AFTER PROCESSING THE PROCESSING SIDE IS PUMPED BACK TO THE ENGINE ROOM AND STORED IN DESIGNATED PRESSURE VESSELS. THE REMAINDER OF TIME TILL NEXT PROCESSING SEASON IS DIVOTED TO MAINTENANCE.  15% OF THE REFRIGERATION CAPACITY IS DEVOTED TO COLD STORAGE OPERATION WHICH OPERATES 12 MONTHS A YEAR.  THE PLANT MAINTAINS 30000 LBS. OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA ON SITE FOR THE REFRIGERATION SYSTEM.\n    THE AMMONIA SYSTEM CONSISTS OF A TWO STAGESYSTEM FOR FREEZING VEGETABLES AS WELL AS BOTH TWO STAGE AND SINGLE STAGE FOR THE COLD STORAGE.  THIS EQUIPMENT VARIES IN AGE FROM THE 1960'S TO 1999.  EACH YEAR EXTENSIVE MAINTENANCE IS DONE TO EACH PIECE OF EQUIPMENT TO INSURE IT'S RELIABILITY DURING THE NEXT SEASON.\n     THE SYSTEM IS OPERATED BY FOUR OPERATING ENGINEERS WHO ARE MEMBERS OF THE OPERATING ENGINEERS UNION. THE OPERATORS ARE TRAINED BOTH ON SITE AND OFF SITE IF OFFSITE TRAINING IS AVAILABLE. THE ENGINEERS RESPONSE EQUIPMENT CONSISTS OF RADIOS,SCBA'S,CANNISTER MASKS,CLASS A SUITS AND MONITORS.\n   THE PLANT HAS DOCUMENTED PROCEEDURES FOR, OPERATION, PARAMETORS,ACCIDENTAL RELEASE, ALL INCLUDED AS PART OF \"PROCESS SAFETY MANAGEMENT \"PROGRAM WAC296-67-013.
