      "SummaryText": "Century Aluminum of West Virginia (CAWV) is a primary aluminum manufacturer with a facility located in Jackson County, WV.  The facility property is about 2,000 acres in size, most of which is undeveloped land.  The manufacturing area occupies about 300 acres.  The property lies along the east bank of the Ohio River approximately 3.2 miles downstream of the town of Ravenswood, WV.\nThe only material at the CAWV Ravenswood facility that is present in a sufficient quantity to be subject to the risk management program (RMP) rule is propane.  This RMP plan was prepared to cover storage areas for propane used as fuel for molten aluminum baking pots.  The propane is stored in four 1,000 gallon portable cylinders that are located in trailer-mounted steel racks designed to fit two cylinders each.  During filling, the trailers are staged in an open area near the north end of the manufacturing plant and to the west of the main gate.  An outside vendor supplies the propane, placing 800 gallons in each cylinder.  During use, the two trailers are staged in one of the courtyards (rectangular open areas) associated with the potrooms.  The maximum amount of co-located propane during use is about 13,560 lbs.\nCentury Aluminum has an Integrated Contingency Program (ICP) that is designed to unify emergency response procedures for the Ravenswood, WV facility.  The written ICP Plan describes the personnel, procedures, and equipment to be deployed during a health, safety, or environmental emergency.  Primary responsibility for implementation of the ICP program lies with CAWV's in-house Security, Medical and Fire Department.  Personnel employed in this Department are trained emergency response personnel.  Century's ICP program is coordinated with the Jackson County LEPC.\nThere have been no accidents involving propane at CAWV's Ravenswood facility in the past five years."
