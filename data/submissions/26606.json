Our management philosophy goals are achieved by the personal commitment of our employees and contractors, and open communication with our employees, customers, neighbors, and with regulators.  The accidental release prevention and emergency response programs we have at our facilities are part of the high standards we strive for through Responsible Care programs.  Our high standards are achieved by operating and maintaining our assets in such a manner that any unpermitted release will be unintentional and acknowledged as unacceptable, by remedying any shortcomings found during regular audits of our facilities, and by reporting promptly to regulators any shortcomings found during the course of our audits as required by law.\n\nThe Riverton Facility is one of two facilities operated by Peak Sulfur Incorporated.  At the facility, we manufacture commercial grade sulfuric acid (200 tons per day) from elemental sulfur and spent sulfuric acid in two separate process trains.  Oleum is the only toxic substance regulated under the Risk Management Program (RMP) that is present at the Riverton Facility in amounts greater than threshold quantity.  The facility is classified as Program Level 3 under the regulation.  The purpose of this Risk Management Plan (RMPlan) is to provide information about our operations at the facility, our programs to prevent accidental chemical releases, our emergency response plans in case an accidental release should occur, our 5 year accident history, and our planned changes to improve safety at the facility.\n\n\nWorst Case and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nAs specified by the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) RMP Regulations, our worst ca"

      "SummaryText": "se release scenario for toxic chemicals would be the loss of all of the Oleum in our largest vessel within 10 minutes.  In the case of the Riverton Facility, this would involve our 500-ton oleum tank.  Such a scenario is highly unlikely.  Although we have numerous controls to prevent such releases (high level alarms, emergency shutdown, and others) and to manage their consequences, no credit for any controls or mitigation measures were taken into account when evaluating this scenario.  The alternative release scenario is characterized as a more likely scenario that could involve an offsite exposure to oleum vapors.  We selected the alternative release scenario based on a release of oleum due to knocking off a 1\u00bf nipple on the oleum pump suction line.  We have mitigation measures in place to greatly reduce the chance that such an event could ever occur.  The plant is manned 24 hours a day and facility inspections are conducted every two hours.  Tank level gauges are checked during inspection to ascertain that there are no leaks from the tank or piping.  Heavy equipment is in place at the facility to be used in such cases when containment is necessary.  The presence of these mitigation measures serves to either prevent this scenario from occurring or minimize its impact if it does occur.\n\nWe have discussed these potential oleum releases with our employees and with local emergency response officials in Fremont County, thereby further reducing the possibility of any impact on the public.\n\n\nPrevention Program\n\nThe Riverton Facility has been operating under the strict guidelines of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Program since 1998.  Our ongoing analysis of the potential hazards of our process, detailed training of our employees, and constant emphasis on safety have helped us avoid any serious accidents over the last 5 years.  Part of this program has also involved identifying and taking steps to avoid potential acc"

A few examples of the additional prevention features implemented at this facility include the following:\n\n\u00b7\tA vapor scrubber system on the oleum tank to prevent venting of SO3 vapors into the atmosphere; \n\t\n\u00b7\tSO2 monitors on the sulfur furnace stacks in order to limit the SO2 concentration in the stack gases to 2000 parts per million (ppm) (when the SO2 concentration exceeds 1,975 ppm, an alarm will sound which will enable the operator to take necessary corrective actions such as reducing the sulfur throughput);\n\t\n\u00b7\tA pump failure shutdown interlock system on the 99% sulfuric acid recirculation pump which will shutdown the process in order to prevent the release of oleum vapors to the atmosphere;\n\t\n\u00b7\tAlarms at safety showers, at eye wash stations, and at emergency button locations in order to enable Peak personnel or contractor employees to request assistance in case of an injury or accident; and\n\t\n\u00b7\tSafety orientation to all the contractor employees to enhance personal safety.\n\t\n\tThese safeguards as well as the vigilance of our trained employees will help us operate safely at this facility.\n\t\n\t\n\tFive Year Accident History\n\t\n\tNo incident having resulted in offsite impacts or onsite injuries from a RMP regulated substance has occurred at the Riverton Facility within the last five years.
