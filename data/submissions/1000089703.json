To meet this commitment, we have established systems to ensure safe operation of plant processes, which includes the safe and proper handling of hazardous substances at the plant.  One component of these systems is a Risk Management Program (RMP), which manages the risks involved with using hazardous substances.  This program has been designed to control and reduce the risk of injury, death, environmental damage, or property damage as well as being a teaching aid for employees to learn how their job is an integral part of the RMP process.  The program protects employees, contractors and the public.   \r\n\r\nWateree Station's RMP complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) regulation 40 CFR  68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements:  Risk Management Programs.  This regulation is also referred to as \"the RMP rule\".  One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit an executive summary in the Risk Management Plan (RMPlan) describing the RMP at Wateree Station.  This document is intended to satisfy the executive summary requirement of the RMP rule and to provide a description of the RMP.  \r\n\r\nWateree Station is the largest fossil plant in the Dominion Energy South Carolina (DESC) system.  The plant generates 700 megawatts of electricity by burning pulverized coal in two identical generating units.  Wateree Station's Unit 1 began commercial operation in 1970, and Uni"

      "SummaryText": "t 2 began operation in 1971.  To comply with the requirements of the Clean Air Act, DESC had to reduce 85% of the total Nitrogen Oxides (NOx) emitted system-wide by May, 2004.  After exhaustive studies, DESC determined that Wateree Station would install a Selective Catalytic Reduction Reactor (SCR) for each of Wateree Station's generating units.  Inside each SCR, anhydrous ammonia is sprayed into the exit gas as it leaves the boiler and then the gas is processed through a series of ceramic plates (referred to as catalyst), converting the NOx into nitrogen (an inert gas) and water vapor.  Design engineering indicated the need to install two 60,000-gallon anhydrous ammonia storage tanks to support operation of the SCRs.  The SCRs are operated year-round.\r\n\r\nThe Wateree Station Risk Management Program consists of three elements:\r\n\r\n1.\tA hazard assessment to identify (a) the potential offsite consequences of hypothetical Accidental releases and (b) accidents that have occurred during the last 5 years associated with the substances regulated by the RMP rule.\r\n  \r\n2.\tA prevention program to help maintain and safely operate processes containing significant quantities of substances regulated by the RMP rule (see Section 3 of this executive summary); and\r\n\r\n3.\tAn emergency response program to provide guidance to the plant for responding to Accidental releases of regulated substances from processes covered by the RMP rule (see Section 5 of this executive summary).\r\n\r\nAlthough the RMPlan helps ensure that Wateree Station's RMP covered system is maintained and operated in a safe manner, it is only one component of the plant's overall safety program.  In fact, a comprehensive safety program exists that establishes many levels of safeguards against accidents.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONSIDERATIONS\r\n\r\nLimiting the use of substances regulated by the RMP rule:\r\n\r\nDESC did perform a thorough evaluation before selecting a pollution control technology that uses a hazardous substance regulated by the RMP"

The potential for the hazardous substance to affect individuals and the environment has been considered, and DESC has taken the appropriate steps to address the hazards.\r\n\r\nPreventing releases of the regulated substances used:\r\n\r\nWhen a regulated substance is used, the equipment that contains it is carefully designed, built, and operated to reduce the likelihood of an accidental release.  All applicable federal, state, corporate, and industry standards are strictly adhered to in the design, construction, and operation of the equipment.\r\n\r\nLimiting damage from a release, if such a release occurs:\r\n\r\nWateree Station's main objective is to prevent the accidental release of anhydrous ammonia from occurring.  In the unlikely event of a release, employees are trained to recognize accidental releases quickly, assess the severity of a release and respond to mitigate and stop the release.  Coordination with the county's Local Emergency Planning Commission (LEPC) is crucial to protect the health and safety of the surrounding community.  Emergency planning efforts have been performed with Richland County Emergency Services, and DESC will continue to work closely with them.  In addition, the LEPCs for the adjacent communities (Sumter County and Calhoun County) have been informed.  In short, actions have been taken to ensure appropriate plans are in place to minimize the impact of a release on our employees and the community.\r\n\r\nThe DESC safety program consists of several elements, many of which are beyond what is\r\nrequired by the RMP rule.

The plant has a trained and equipped Emergency Response Team that is highly qualified to mitigate releases from the RMP covered system.  The planning efforts performed in conjunction with Richland County Emergency Services / Columbia-Richland Fire Service will help ensure proper coordination of emergency response personnel.\r\n\r\n\r\n2.   REGULATED SUBSTANCE USED AT DESC WATEREE STATION\r\n\r\nThe Wateree Station has one substance (anhydrous ammonia) in sufficient quantity to be regulated by the RMP rule.  The anhydrous ammonia used at the plant is covered as a toxic material by the RMP rule.  As stated previously, anhydrous ammonia will be used as a reactant to reduce the emission of NOx from the plant.\r\n\r\n\r\n3.\tACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC\r\n      PREVENTION STEPS\r\n\r\nDESC has developed a comprehensive prevention program that complies with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation.  For Wateree Station, the prevention program requirements of EPA's RMP rule are also satisfied by this PSM program.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of our prevention program that address the RMP rule requirements.\r\n\r\n   \r\n3.1   Accidental Release Prevention Program\r\n\r\nThe accident prevention program for anhydrous ammonia consists of the following 12 elements:\r\n\r\n\r\n3.1.1   Process Safety Information\r\n\r\nA number of technical documents are maintained and are readily available at the plant, including an emergency preparedness plan (called the Integrated Conting"

These documents address (a) physical properties of anhydrous ammonia, (b) operating parameters for the equipment, and (c) design basis and configuration for the equipment.  This process safety information is available to our employees and contractors, as well.\r\n\r\n3.1.2   Process Hazard Analysis\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis of the anhydrous ammonia process was performed and will be periodically updated to identify process hazards, as well as to establish recommendations that will improve the safe operation of the RMP covered process.  A multidisciplinary team was assembled to analyze the hazards of the anhydrous ammonia storage and handling process.  This team includes personnel with engineering / process operating experience and a leader with experience in performing Process Hazard Analyses.  The team systematically addressed the hazards associated with operation of the equipment in the anhydrous ammonia system.  The team then prepared a written report describing the results of the analysis, including a list of recommendations.  Responsibility for resolving the recommendations was assigned to plant personnel, and, when appropriate, changes to enhance the safety of the system were implemented.  This analysis is revised at least every 5 years to ensure it is current.\r\n\r\n3.1.3   Operating Procedures \r\n\r\nWateree Station's engineers, operators, and the Plant Manager worked together to\r\ndevelop and maintain operating procedures to define how tasks related to the\r\nammonia system operations should be safely performed.

The mechanical integrity (preventive maintenance) program includes (a) an inspection and testing program to help identify equipment deterioration and damage well before the equipment can fail and (b) a quality assurance function to help ensure that new and replacement equipment meet the strict design standards required for service in our process.\r\n\r\n3.1.6   Management of Change\r\n\r\nThe Management of Change procedure is a written procedure that requires the review and approval of all proposed changes to the anhydrous ammonia system.  This includes chemicals, equipment, technology, and procedures to help ensure that the change does not negatively affect safe operations.  All changes other than replacement-in-kind (e.g., replacing a valve with an identical valve) must be approved through the Management of Change procedure.  This helps to ensure that inadvertent consequences of changes are prevented, safety consequences of changes are addressed, affected process safety information and procedures are updated, and affected employee"

A program is in place to perform compliance audits of our RMP-covered processes every 3 years to be certain the prevention program is effectively addressing the safety issues of the process.  These audits are performed by an audit team that includes personnel knowledgeable in the PSM and RMP regulations and in our process designs, and this team evaluates whether the prevention program satisfies the requirements of these two regulations and whether it is sufficient to help ensure safe operation of the ammonia system.  The results of the audit are documented, recommendations are resolved, and appropriate enhancements to the prevention program are implemented.\r\n\r\n     \t3.1.9   Incident Investigation\r\n\r\nA program is in place to investigate any incidents or near misses that could\r\nreasonably result in serious injury to personnel, the public, or the environment so\r\nthat similar accidents can be prevented in the future.  The requirements to identify\r\nand report any incident requiring investigation are communicated to employees.  In\r\nthe event of an incident, an investigation team would be assembled, and the\r\ninvestigation would be initiated as soon as possible, but always within 48 hours of \r\nthe in"

We encourage active participation of personnel in the prevention program activities of all processes at the plant.  Employees are consulted and informed about all aspects of our accidental release prevention program.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    \t 3.1.11 Hot Work Permits\r\n\r\nA Hot Work Permit Program exists, which is intended to control spark or flame-producing activities that could result in fires or explosions at Wateree Station.  This program conforms to OSHA requirements.  Training on hot work activities and on the requirements of the hot work permit program is included in our new employee orientation.\r\n   \r\n   \t3.1.12   Contractors\r\n\r\nA program is in place to help ensure that contractor activities related to the RMP covered ammonia system are performed in a safe manner.  Contractor supervisors are informed of the hazards of the processes on which they and their employees will work, our safe work practices, and our emergency response procedures.  Contractors are required to ensure that training has been performed for each of their employees before he/she performs work at the plant.  Routine verification that this training has been provided is performed.\r\n\r\n\r\n3.2   Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\n\r\nIn addition to the required prevention program elements, safety features specific to the anhydrous ammonia process have been implemented.\r\n\r\nThe anhydrous ammonia is delivered in tank trucks that must be approved by the Department of Transportation.  The plant's anhydrous ammonia storage tanks and equipment are designed and maintained to standards established by the federal government and by industry.

FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nThere have been no recordable releases of anhydrous ammonia within the last five years.  The anhydrous ammonia system has been designed to codes and standards that were established to minimize the possibility of accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia from the system that could result in exposure to employees, contractors, the public, or the environment.\r\n\r\n\r\n5.   EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAMS\r\n\r\nWateree Station's Emergency Response Team personnel will respond to an accidental release of ammonia.  The Integrated Contingency Plan (ICP) has been developed to help facilitate the evacuation of employees and to ensure the safety of DESC and local emergency responders who could be called on to respond to an accidental release.  The ICP addresses:\r\n\u00b7 informing local emergency responders about accidental releases that could\r\n  reasonably result in offsite consequences;\r\n  \t \u00b7 providing emergency medical assistance;\r\n  \t \u00b7 obtaining outside assistance to control and contain accidental releases of\r\n \t   Hazardous substances; and\r\n \t \u00b7 plan review and upkeep.\r\n\r\nEmployees are trained to recognize, and report known, or even perceived, emergency situations. Employees and contractors are trained in evacuation procedures.  The county LEPC (Richland County Emergency Services) is responsible for notifying the public of the emergency situation and coordinating with other public safety agencies and LEPCs, if necessary.\r\n\r\nThe ICP complies with other federal contingency plan regulations [i.e., OSHA regulation 29 CFR 1910.38(a) and 1910.120(q)], and a copy of the plan has been provided to the Richland County LEPC.  In addition, a hazardous material inventory has been provided to the LEPC and local fire department, as required by the Emergency Planning and Community Right-To-Know Act.  Wateree Stat"
