This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of the facility\u00bfs processes.  It is the practice of Enterprise Products Operating L.P. (Enterprise) to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of substances.  However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will respond to, control and contain the release.\n\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nThe Inver Grove Heights Terminal located in Dakota County, Minnesota is owned by Enterprise Products Operating, LP and is operated by Enterprise.  The terminal receives propane LPG primarily via pipeline, although a rail rack is available for receipt of propane via railroad tank cars.  The propane is stored on-site in one or more of the available above ground storage tanks located on the terminal site.  This propane in storage is delivered through facility piping to a truck loading rack for wholesale delivery to purchasers.  The only listed flammable substance which is stored above the threshold quantity at the Inver Grove Heights Terminal is propane. The Terminal is subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation and is classified as a Program Level 3 site under the EPA RMP program.  \n\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis Results\n\nThe offsite consequence analysis will not be reflected in the executive summary but rather is reflected in the data components.  There are flammable substances on site and no toxic substances above the threshold quantity.\n\n\nGeneral Accident Release Prevention Program\n\nThe following is a su"

The process safety information will be useful to the operators, the team performing a process hazard analysis and those in charge of updating the emergency preparedness plans.  Process safety information is readily available to all employees.  Enterprise keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain a safe operating process.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters, specific chemicals inventories and equipment design basis/configuration information.\n\nChemical specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDS).\n\nEnterprise also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of the storage facility equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure ratings, temperature ratings and electrical rating of equipment.  This information in combination with written procedures and trained personnel provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to insure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\nThe Inver Grove Heights Terminal has a comprehensive program to help insure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and insure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nEnterprise primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) and What-if/Checklist method analysis technique to perform these evaluations.

Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps insure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\nTo help insure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the Terminal periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every five years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.  Once again, the responses to the team findings are also documented and retained.\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nThe Inver Grove Heights Terminal maintains written procedures that address various modes of terminal operations such as; (1) start-up, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown and (6) initial startup of  Inver Grove Heights terminal operations.

These procedures, along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help insure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely\n\nManagement of Change\n\nThe Inver Grove Heights Terminal has a comprehensive system to manage change to all covered termnal operations.  This system requires that changes to items such as storage and loading equipment, technology (including terminal operating conditions), procedures and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented.  Changes are reviewed to insure that adequate controls are in place to manage any Inver Grove Heights hazards and to verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.  Affected chemical hazard information, storage and loading operating limits and equipment information, as well as procedures, are updated to incorporate these changes.  In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on the changes.\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nThe Inver Grove Heights Terminal promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury.  The goal of each investigation is to gather the facts, determine the root cause, and develop corrective action to prevent the reoccurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendation(s) to prevent a reoccurrence and forwards these results to the business man"

      "SummaryText": "agement team for resolution.\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nTo help insure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, Enterprise periodically conducts an audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented.  Compliance audits are conducted at least every three years.  Both hourly and staff personnel participate as audit team members.  The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to Terminal management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team\u00bfs findings are tracked until they are resolved and completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are retained.\n\n\nChemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe operations at the Inver Grove Heights Terminal have hazards that must be managed to insure continued safe operation.  The following is a description of existing safety features applicable to prevention of accidental releases of regulated substances in the facility.\n\nUniversal Prevention Activities\n\nThe accident prevention program summarized previously is applied to all RMP covered operations at the Inver Grove Heights Terminal.  Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human errors.\n\nSpecialized Safety Features\n\nThe Inver Grove Heights Terminal has safety features on the storage and loading equipment to help contain/control a release, to quickly detect a release and reduce the consequence of a release.  The following types of safety features are used in the covered processes:\n\n\nRelease Containment and Control\n\n> Valves to permit isolation of the storage and loading operations (manual or automated).\n> Automatic shutdown systems for specific terminal parameters (e.g., high flow).\n> Redundant equipment and instrumentation (e.g., uninterruptible power supply for loading control system)\n> Storage tank relief valves tha"
