      "SummaryText": "The Airgas facility in Bessemer, Alabama is owned and operated by Airgas USA, LLC.  The Facility is a chemical distribution plant, which stores, sells, and repackages industrial gases. In accordance with the EPA's RMP regulations (40 CFR Part 68), the facility inventory of chemicals was evaluated to determine if any regulated flammable or toxic substances were found to be stored in quantities above the EPA threshold quantities .  Based on the facility inventory, the following listed flammable substances are stored by the Facility in quantities above the substance's EPA threshold quantity:\n\n\n\nPropylene gas (CAS # 115-07-1)\n\nPropane gas (CAS # 74-98-6)\n\n\n\nIn the last five years, there have been no major accidents associated with either process.\n\n\n\nAccidental release prevention and emergency response policies for the stationary sources include safe operating procedures and a well trained workforce, along with an emergency response plan and hazardous materials response team.\n\n\n\nAdministrative controls and mitigation measures used to limit the distances for the worst and alternative case scenarios include implementation of a Process Safety Management Plan, the use of Emergency Stop controls, rupture disks, relief and check valves, manual shutoffs, and concrete storage bunkers.\n\n\n\nAt this time there are no planned changes to improve safety. Should additional opportunities to improve safety become available, the facility will thoroughly review the feasibility of such a change.\n\n\n\nAirgas USA, LLC has developed and implemented a Program 3 Risk Management Plan for the above identified processes, as described in this submittal.  All documents pertaining to the RMP are kept on-site and updated as required.\n\n\n\n"
