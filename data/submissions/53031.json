It includes required actions by plant employees as well as required notification and coordination with local responders and agencies. All employees are trained in the execution of the Emergency Response Plan and drills are conducted annually.\n\nThe Stationary Source and Regulated substances:\n\nThe Lybrook Gas Conditioning Plant processes raw natural gas into pure methane, ethane, butane, propane, and other natural gas liquids. The raw natural gas is received by pipeline. The finished products are delivered to both pipelines and to a truck loading rack.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program:\n\nThe Lybrook Gas Conditioning Plant has implemented all the elements of a Program 3 Risk Management Plan (RMP) and all the elements of OSHA?s Process Safety Management (PSM) program. The plant has also implanted all the elements of Williams Midstream?s System Integrity Plan (SIP), which contains additional environmental, health, and safety standards.
