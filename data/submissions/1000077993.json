(MarkWest) Langley Processing Plant has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, facility trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release. \n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES \n\n\n\nMarkWest Hydrocarbon, L.L.C. - Langley Plant, is a natural gas liquids (NGL) extraction facility located in a rural section of Floyd County near Langley, Kentucky. This facility can extract up to 400,000 gallons per day of NGLs from raw natural gas that is piped to the plant. The liquid product primarily consists of liquid propane with lesser amounts of butane, isobutane, isopentane, hexanes and smaller quantities of ethane and methane. This mixture of NGL is flammable and is considered to be hazardous by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The y-grade NGLs are stored in seven pressurized horizontal bullet storage tanks. Also in the process area there are three smaller tanks, two of which hold NGLs and one which holds propane. The NGLs are transported offsite via pipeline or trucks for fractionation.  The entire plant is considered one process for the purpose of this RMP.  \n\n\n\nThe total quantity of product stored in the tanks and the total of each substance over the threshold for an RMP substance has been calculated in a separate document. This document is available for review but is not included in this summary as it may contain confidential business information. \n\n\n\nThe products at the Langley Processing Plant contain methane, ethane, propane, butanes, pentanes, and heavier h"

This facility does not handle regulated toxic substances above their threshold quantities and there are no toxic release scenarios to consider.\n\n\n\nWORST-CASE AND ALTERNATIVE CASE RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\n\n\nThe parameters of the offsite consequence analyses for this MarkWest facility were based on the\n\nrequirements set forth in the RMP rules outlined in 40 CFR 68.25 (e) for flammable worst-case release scenario, and 40 CFR 68.28 for the alternative release scenario analysis. The worst case and alternative case radii to endpoint were determined utilizing RMP*Comp software provided by the EPA. In evaluating the worst-case and alternative-case scenarios there were no administrative controls or mitigation measures taken into account to reduce potential off-site impact. Populations within each radius were determined using the Missouri Census Data Center.\n\n\n\nSeveral vessels within the facility process were evaluated for their release scenarios.  Results of the worst-case release scenarios indicate that the process is subject to Risk Management Program (RMP) Program Level 3 requirements.  Details of the worst-case release scenarios and alternate release scenario are included with the backup documentation associated with this RMP Plan\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM \n\n\n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place for the process at the facility. The process at the facility regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) risk management program (RMP) regulation is also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) process safety management (PSM) standard.

Employees will be provided with the information created as part of the facility accident prevention program. Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the facility. Company employees are encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.\n\n\n\nHot Work Permit \n\n\n\nMarkWest Hydrocarbon, L.L.C., uses a hot work permit for hot work operations including grinding, welding, and spark producing activities conducted on or near a covered process. The hot work permit documents the fire prevention and protection requirements prior to beginning hot work operations. The permit indicates the days on which hot work may be performed and the object upon which hot work is to be performed. Hot work permits are kept in a place that is easily accessible for the workers and on file at the office until the completion of hot work operations. \n\n\n\nSafe Work Practices\n\n\n\nMarkWest Hydrocarbon, L.L.C. has long-standing safe work practices in place as mandated by OSHA, Industrial Standards, and Good Engineering Practice to help provide employee, public and process safety.\n\n\n\nContractors \n\n\n\nThe Langley Processing Plant uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased or specialized maintenance or construction activities. Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors: perform their work in a safe manner; have the appropriate knowledge and skills; are aware of the hazards in their workplace; understand what they should do in event of an emergency; understand and follow site safety rules; and inform facility personnel of the hazards that they find during their work. This is accomplished by providing contractors with: a process overview; information about potential f"

In addition, the Langley Processing Plant will only select contractors who submit certification that employees are trained in specifics and safe work practices associated with their job, and that provide safety performance documentation from the previous three years. Finally, facility personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations. \n\n\n\nCHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS \n\n\n\nThe processes at the Langley Processing Plant have hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation. The following is a description of existing safety features applicable to prevention of accidental releases of regulated substances in the facility. \n\n\n\nUniversal Prevention Activities \n\n\n\nThe accident prevention program summarized previously is applied to the RMP-covered process at the Langley Processing Plant. Collectively, these prevention program activities prevent or mitigate potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human errors. \n\n\n\nSpecialized Safety Features\n\n\n\nThe Langley Processing Plant has safety features on many units to help (1) contain/control a release, (2) quickly detect a release, and (3) reduce the consequences of (mitigate) a release. The following types of safety features are used in the covered process: \n\n\n\nRelease Detection \n\n1) Hand-held hydrocarbon detectors operated by facility personnel. \n\n2) Personnel are on site 24 hours a day, seven days a week. \n\n\n\nRelease Containment/Control \n\n1) Process relief valves that discharge to a flare to capture and incinerate episodic releases. \n\n2) Valves to permit isolation of the process (manual and automated). \n\n3) Automated shutdown systems for specific process parameters (e.g., high temperature) \n\n4) Curbing or dykes to contain liquid releases. \n\n5) Redundant equipment and instrum"

The facility maintains a written emergency action plan, which is in place to help protect employees and public safety as well as the environment.  The plan identifies steps to be taken in case of an accidental release including: evacuation plans, accounting for personnel after an evacuation, and notification of company staff, local emergency response agencies, and the public if a release occurs.  However, facility personnel are not trained to be first responders to large fires and should a release occur from one of the vessels the Langley Processing Plant would rely on the local fire department to respond.  \n\n\n\nEmployees receive training in the procedures to be followed when certain employees must remain to operate critical process operations before they evacuate.  The Langley Processing Plant has around the-clock communications capability with appropriate emergency response organizations (Fire Department, Police and Sheriff's Office).  This interface provides the means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.\n\n\n\nThe overall emergency response program for the Langley Processing Plant is coordinated with the Floyd County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC). This coordination includes periodic meetings of the committee, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials, and industry representative"
