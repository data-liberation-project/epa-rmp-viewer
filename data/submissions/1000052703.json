The US Nitrogen facility manufactures liquid ammonium nitrate solution using natural gas as the primary feedstock for the ammonia process. The facility has a maximum ammonia storage capacity of 1,600,000 pounds in four high-pressure storage vessels which feeds both the nitric acid and liquid ammonium nitrate plant processes.\n\n\n\nUS Nitrogen has implemented a comprehensive program to safely manage ammonia at the facility. Austin Powder Inc. and US Nitrogen's executive management teams have committed to full implementation of RMP and Process Safety Management (PSM) programs to prevent the release of ammonia.\n\n\n\nThis is a new facility, therefore, there have been no ammonia incidents in the most recent five-year history period.\n\n\n\nThe facility is subject to RMP and OSHA PSM requirements for anhydrous ammonia. \n\n\n\nA PSM Compliance Manual has been developed for the facility. Key items included in the manual are:\n\n\n\n?    Written site specific procedures for Employee Participation, Mechanical Integrity, Management of Change, Incident Investigation, Pre-Startup Safety Reviews, and Internal Compliance Audits.\n\n\n\n?    Training on PSM and its key components including Management of Change, Lockout Tagout, Emergency Response and Incident Investigation.\n\n\n\n?    Conducting Process Hazards Analyses for the ammonia processes\n\n\n\n?    Developing an Emergency Response Plan (ERP)\n\n\n\n?    Training in support of the certification of operators\n\n          \n\nThe Operations Manager and Operations personnel annually review and update procedures and activities to maintain compliance with all aspects of the PSM/RMP regulations. \n\n          \n\nIn addition to RMP/PSM compliance, USN has implemented a number of systems to ensure the safe handling of ammonia, including:\n\n\n\n?    Ammonia storage vessels have dual relief valves that releas"

      "SummaryText": "e to a flare system designed to destroy ammonia rather than release it to atmosphere\n\n\n\n?    The pressurization system on the ammonia storage vessels also has a variety of controls and interlocks designed to prevent ammonia from reaching the relief valves.\n\n\n\nThe site's ERP contains considerable detail. The Operations staff has been trained to the Hazmat Technician standard, which allows our own employees to be able to provide an immediate response in the event that there is a release or spill of a hazardous material onsite. Also, if needed, the services of the Greeneville Fire Department's Hazmat Team is available. We have worked in conjunction with their team to ensure that they are fully aware of the hazards present on our site.  US Nitrogen has also worked closely with the Greene County Director of Emergency Management to be sure that communication plans exist to alert residences that may be impacted by a release. Response Drills and a community Tabletop exercise will be coordinated with the Local Emergency Planning Committee and the local Director of Emergency Management.\n\n\n\nIn addition to PSM, the organization has an active safety program. US Nitrogen had dedicated environmental, health and safety staff and experienced consultants prepare and implement the safety program at the facility.  US Nitrogen anticipates having a Safety Committee that will continue the emphasis on safety after the facility is fully operational. The committee will hold regular meetings to review new safety procedures, accident investigations, safety surveys and safety communications.\n\n\n\nRoutine safety training is also conducted for topics such as:\n\n\n\n-    Hazard Communications\n\n\n\n-    Personal Protective Equipment\n\n\n\n-    Lockout/Tagout\n\n\n\n-    Confined Space\n\n\n\n-    Blood-borne Pathogens\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
