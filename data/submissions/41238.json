The Oiltanking Marine Terminal is located approximately (5) miles south of Texas City and is involved in the transportation and distribution of chemicals and products. In accordance with U.S. EPA regulation 40 CFR 68, the U.S. EPA has identified quantities for 140 toxic or flammable substances that require a facility to comply with the Risk Management Program (RMP) rule when unit inventories exceed threshold quantities. The RMP rule requires a facility to report the unit inventory for each RMP substance that exceeds threshold quantities, along with an EPA approved chemical release prevention program. In addition, 40 CFR 68 requires all RMP covered facilities to update its Risk Management Plan (RMPlan) every five (5) years or six (6) months after an RMP reportable incident. This is the initial submittal of the RMPlan for the Oiltanking Marine Terminal. In compliance with 40 CFR 68, Oiltanking Marine Terminal is submitting the five (5) year plan as the initial RMPlan submittal.\nOiltanking Marine Terminal currently holds the following RMP-regulated substances above threshold quantities:\n\nTable 1\n\nRegulated Chemical          CAS Number         Characteristic      Threshold (lbs)\nPropylene                         115-07-1               Flammable           10,000\nVinyl Acetate Monomer      108-05-4              Toxic                    15,000\n\nKey Off site Consequence Analysis\n40 CFR 68 requires all facilities, subject to the rule, to conduct an offsite consequence analysis to provide information about any potential consequences of an accidental chemical relea"

      "SummaryText": "se to the public and state and federal environmental agencies. Offsite consequence analyses are essential in identifying potential hazards of accidental release. The offsite consequence analysis (OCA) comprises 2 elements, a worst-case scenario and an alternative release scenario.\n\nWorst Case Scenarios\n\nOffsite consequence analyses for the worst-case scenarios (WCS) were conducted using the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidelines. The RMP sets forth specific criteria that must be incorporated in modeling the worst-case scenarios. The EPA defines a WCS as one that results in the greatest distance from the point of release to a specified endpoint. As defined by the rule, the endpoint for a toxic substance is a specified concentration while for flammables it is a specified overpressure from a vapor cloud explosion (VCE).\n\nThe scenarios for the Oiltanking Texas City Marine Terminal were calculated using the EPA RMP*Comp Modeling Program which was downloaded from the EPA. Although numerous controls are in place to prevent chemical releases and manage such consequences should an incident occur, no credit for active mitigation measures was taken into account in evaluating these scenarios.\n\nAlternative Release Scenarios\n\nAlternative Release Scenarios (ARS) assess the potential hazards that are more realistic than worst-case scenarios and are designed to assist in the development of emergency response plans. EPA's RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidelines were used in modeling the alternative release scenarios. A summary of the alternative release scenarios for the Oiltanking Marine Terminal is provided in Table 3. As required, alternative release scenarios are created for both a toxics and flammables. These scenarios were calculated using the EPA OCA Look Up Tables. Although numerous controls are in place to prevent chemical releases and manage such consequences should an incident occur, no credit for active mitigation measures "
