We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public as well as protection of the environment. This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including:\n\nA description of our facility and use of substances regulated by EPA's RMP regulation\nA summary of results from our assessment of the potential offsite consequences from accidental chemical releases \nAn overview of our accidental release prevention programs\nA five-year accident history for accidental releases of chemicals regulated by EPA's RMP rule\nAn overview of our emergency response program\nAn overview of planned improvements at the facility to help prevent accidental chemical releases from occurring and adversely affecting our employees, the public, and the environment\nThe certifications that EPA's RMP rule requires us to provide\nThe detailed information(called data elements)about our risk management program\n\n2.0 Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nOur facility produces flexible polyurethane foam using a variety of chemicals and processing operations. The facility is housed in an approximately 225,000 sq. ft. building located in an industrial area. The process area is divided into two areas; one being the south area which contains the process and houses the tank farm, which is diked. The north area contains the fabrication departments. In our processes, we use the following chemical that EPA has identified as having the potential to cause significant offsite consequences in the event of a substantial accidental release:\n\nToxics:\n\nSee Appendix E, MSDS for Toluene Di"

The distance to the specified endpoint for the worst-case accidental release scenario for the covered process may impact the small residental population surrounding the facility.\n\nWithin the past five years, the process hashas had no accidental releases that caused offsite impacts provided in the RMP rule (40 CFR 68.10(b)(1). We have taken voluntary measures to improve our operations to minimize potential releases of covered materials in order to protect both our employees and the public. In the event of fire, explosion,  or a release of  regulated substance from the process, entry within the distance to the specified endpoint may pose a danger to public emergency responders.
