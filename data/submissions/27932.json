Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe management and employees of Western Farm Service, 14442 Thornton Road, Walnut Grove, California, 95690 are committed to the prevention of a release of Anhydrous Ammonia, Aqua Ammonia and pesticides.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility will work with the local fire department, and other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.  An emergency response plan has been developed and would be implemented in the event of a release.\n\n2.  The Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe primary business at the facility is to sell fertilizers, agricultural pesticides and agronomic services to growers and ranchers.  To conduct this business, the following activities occur at the facility:\n\na.  Storage and delivery of bulk and packaged containers of fertilizers, bulk and packaged containers of agricultural chemicals and packaged seed.  All fertilizer, agricultural chemicals and seed are distributed to growers.  No mixing or formulating of agricultural chemicals occurs at the facility.\n\nb.  Eight agricultural pesticides stored in the Chemical Warehouse are regulated substances.  The maximum quantities of the regulated substances stored in the Chemical Warehouse are:  Azinphos Methyl (175 pounds); Carbofuran (1060 pounds); Dimethoate (880 pounds); Fenamiphos (105 pounds); Methamidophos (160 pounds); Methomyl (180 pounds); Paraquat (880 pounds) and Phorate (4200 pounds).\n\nc.  Anhydrous Ammonia is received and stored at the facility.  It is distributed to growers for use as a plant nutrient.  Anhydrous Ammonia is also used, at the facility, in the manufacturing of Aqua Ammonia and Ammonium Polyphosphate.  Anhydrous Ammonia is received by truck and stored in two 18,000-gallon capacity storage tanks.  The maximum quantity of Anhydrous Ammonia handled at the facility is 157,590 pounds.\n\nd.

      "SummaryText": "a (24.4% of ammonia by weight) is manufactured and stored at the facility.  It is distributed to growers for use as a plant nutrient.  Aqua Ammonia is stored in two aboveground storage tanks - one tank is 79,906-gallon capacity and the other is 30,301-gallon capacity.  The maximum quantity of Aqua Ammonia handled at the facility is 837,573 pounds.\n\n3.  Worst-Case and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\na.  Worst-Case Release Scenarios  \n\nThe worst-case release scenario was determined to be the release of the contents from the largest storage tank of Aqua Ammonia.  The quantity of Aqua Ammonia released was 607,286 pounds over a 10-minute period.  No mitigation or administrative controls were considered for this release.  Under the worst-case release scenario, Aqua Ammonia vapors would travel 4.5 miles before reaching a concentration level that would not pose a hazard to the public or environmental receptors. \n\nb.  Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nThere are four alternative release scenarios being reported in this RMP.  The alternative release scenarios are:\n\n(1)  A 1\" Anhydrous Ammonia transfer hose develops a leak in the hose during transfer operations.  The transfer rate of the Anhydrous Ammonia vapor compressor is 63 gallons per minute and the release lasts 10 minutes before an emergency responder activates the emergency shut-off valve.  Distance to the endpoint is 0.3 mile.\n\n(2)  A 2\" steel Anhydrous Ammonia feedstock pipeline between the Anhydrous Ammonia storage tank and the Aqua Ammonia conversion unit breaks at the threaded fitting due to an earthquake.  The transfer rate of the liquid Anhydrous Ammonia pump is 40 gallons per minute and the release lasts 5 minutes before an emergency responder activates the emergency shut-off valve.  Distance to the endpoint is 0.3 mile.\n\n(3)  An Aqua Ammonia storage tank is overfilled.  The Aqua Ammonia conversion unit creates 120 gallons per minute and the release lasts 10 minutes before the conversion process is stopped.  The ove"

Distance to the endpoint is 0.3 mile.\n\n(4)  Anhydrous Ammonia vents from the spray head of the Ammonium Polyphosphate reaction unit.  The transfer rate of the liquid Anhydrous Ammonia pump is 20 gallons per minute and the release is not detected for 3 minutes before a valve in the pipeline is closed.  Distance to the endpoint is 0.2 mile.\n\n4.  Accidental Release Prevention Program \n\nWFS Walnut Grove now has comprehensive written programs and procedures to comply with the RMP program regulations.  Key to getting all programs and procedures in place was (1) having the facility management understand what the RMP regulations required and (2) developing and implementing specific written programs, written procedures and practices to meet those regulations.\n\nFacility management and employees involved in any of the covered processes have now been trained and made aware of the provisions and requirements in the new programs and practices.\n\nCompliance audits and general inspections by Western Farm Service corporate staff is the next key for ensuring the facility remains in compliance.\n\n5.  Five-Year Accident History \n\nIn the past five years, there have been no releases of Anhydrous Ammonia or Aqua Ammonia that have caused any deaths, injuries or significant property damage at the facility nor resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage.\n\n6.  The Emergency Response Program\n\nThe facility has an emergency response plan.  The local fire department has conducted a facility visit specifically addressing their response to releases of Anhydrous Ammonia and Aqua Ammonia.  The emergency response contractor for the facility has visited the facility to review how they would response in the event a release occurs.  Three employees at the facility are trained as emergency responders to the 24-Hour HAZWOPER Technician Level.  The facility emergency responders and the "

Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nListed below are the planned changes at WFS Walnut Grove.\n\na.  Implement the recommendations contained in the seismic assessment (dated 5/5/95) conducted on the Anhydrous Ammonia storage tanks.\nb.  Confirm with commercial Anhydrous Ammonia transport drivers (that delivery Anhydrous Ammonia to the facility) that their cargo tanks have been inspected in accordance with DOT regulations.\nc.  Install back-flow prevention devices in the finished product pipelines to the Aqua Ammonia storage tanks.\nd.  Ensure each feedstock pipeline to the Aqua Ammonia conversion unit has a flexible connection installed.\ne.  Implement the Agrium Retail Tank Management Program on the Aqua Ammonia storage tanks.\nf.  Lock all control switches when the process operator is not in attendance\ng.  Evaluate the use of a security service at the facility\nh.  Evaluate the installation of additional globe valves in the feedstock pipelines to the Aqua Ammonia conversion unit.\ni.  Evaluate the installation of breakaway fittings on the transfer hose at the Aqua Ammonia transfer site."
