The facility is a batch chemical production plant that produces amphoteric surfactants, esters, and solutions for the agrochemical market.\r\n  \r\nThe following information is intended to satisfy the requirements under 40 CFR \u00a768.155 regarding the Executive Summary of a United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) Risk Management Plan (RMP).  In this facility, Oxiteno plans to handle Ethylene oxide (CAS 75-21-8) in volumes that exceed the threshold quantity (10,000 pounds) as prescribed under Table 1 of 40 CFR \u00a768.130.  Additionally, this proposed process is subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standards under 29 CFR 1910.119 and is under Code 325199 of the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS).   As such, the Program 3 Prevention Program is applicable.\r\n\r\nThe RMP is maintained online via EPA's Central Data Exchange (CDX).  This document serves as a site copy of the RMP for Oxiteno to maintain at the Pasadena Plant for their records.  Any additions or updates to the RMP should be addressed within EPA's CDX and in this document to be maintained at the site.\r\n\r\n1.1\tACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\r\nEthylene oxide (EtO) is used as part of the ethoxylation process at the facility.  It is unloaded from railcars, stored in tanks, and used in site reactors.  The same properties that makes EtO valuable to Oxiteno's production process also makes it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling the substance to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to our own personal health and welfare as well as those of its employees, and to reduce the threat to the nearby population.  It is Oxiteno's policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and State regulations.  Safety depends upon the manner in which EtO is handled, the safety device"

The emergency response plan includes procedures for the notification of the local emergency services and any affected neighbors in the vicinity of the site.  \r\n\r\n1.2\tSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\r\nEtO is transported to the site in pressurized tanker rail cars and loaded into two 53,000 gallon pressurized bullet tanks for storage on site.  EtO is piped under its own pressure to various processes throughout the facility.  Access to the bullet tanks is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel, and authorized contractors.  The maximum amount of EtO that can be stored at the facility is 106,000 pounds.\r\n\r\n1.3\tGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND \t\t\t\tCHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\nThe facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with OSHA, the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA), and recognized and generally accepted good engineering practices.  All employees have received on-the-job training and written testing regarding accidental release prevention.\r\n\r\n1.4\tFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\nThere have been no accidental releases from the covered process.  Specifically, there have been no accidental releases that have resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\r\n\r\n1.5\tEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\r\nThe facility's emergency response program is based upon OSHA Standards.
