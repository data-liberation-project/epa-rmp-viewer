As such, the information, procedures, policies, and documentation that make up this program must be made easily accessible and updated as necessary. To accomplish this, Sun Pacific Tulare has elected to use PSMWriter, software developed and distributed by Resource Compliance, Inc. This software will assist us with updating, maintaining, scheduling, and tracking RMP-PSM related activities. \n\n\n\n1.1 Sun Pacific Tulare, Risk and Process Safety Management Program\n\n\n\nThis is to inform all interested persons, including employees, that Sun Pacific Tulare has updated their unified RMP-PSM Program.

In this system, high pressure liquid from the high pressure receiver is piped to multiple accumulators. Each accumulator is equipped with an expansion valve which expands the high pressure liquid into a low temperature and pressure liquid as it enters the accumulator. Each accumulator either feeds one ceiling suspended evaporator coil located in the CA Storage Rooms, or four bunker mounted evaporator coils located in the Cold Storage/Precooler Rooms. The evaporators contain a set of continuous coils through which the low pressure liquid flows. Due to the low pressures and temperatures maintained in the evaporator, the liquid refrigerant absorbs a great deal of heat from the surrounding area and evaporates. To increase the rate of heat removed, the evaporator uses an electric fan to move warm air over the coils of cold liquid ammonia. Once the liquid has evaporated to form low temperature and pressure vapor, it travels back to the accumulators, through a suction return line, and into the main suction accumulator. Any rema"

      "SummaryText": "ining liquid falls to the bottom of the vessel and is fed by gravity into the transfer vessel. Inside the transfer vessel, the liquid rises in temperature and is returned to the high pressure receiver as high pressure liquid. From the main suction accumulator, the remaining low pressure vapor is piped to the suction inlet on the screw compressors.\n\n\n\nThe system also includes direct expansion (DX) ceiling suspended evaporator coils. In DX evaporators, high pressure liquid is supplied from the high pressure receiver directly to the evaporators. Each evaporator is equipped with an expansion valve which reduces the pressure and temperature of the liquid as it enters the evaporators. Once the liquid has evaporated to form low temperature and pressure vapor, it exits the evaporators and is returned to the main suction accumulator.\n\n\n\nThe compressors compress the low pressure vapor, and it exits through the discharge outlet as a high pressure and high temperature vapor. The vapor is then sent to the evaporative condensers where it is cooled and liquefied. The condenser uses air and water to cool the warm ammonia as it passes through a series of tubes within the condenser. As the cooling medium of air and water draws the heat from the vapor, the refrigerant condenses into a liquid and flows to the high pressure receiver. The receiver serves as a holding tank for the liquid refrigerant being fed to the low side, and holds the bulk of the refrigerant in the system when it is not operating. \n\n\n\nSafety Systems \n\n\n\nThe machinery room is equipped with a roof-mounted emergency ventilation fan that runs continuously across the line.\n\n\n\nEach screw compressor has numerous safety devices to protect the compressor and the associated equipment.\n\n\n\nAll ASME pressure vessels and positive displacement compressors are equipped with pressure relief valves designed to relieve pressure and protect the equipment from rupturing.
