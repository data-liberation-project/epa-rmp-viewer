      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\n\nThe Schering-Plough HealthCare Products Inc. (Schering-Plough) facility in Cleveland, TN is subject to the Process Safety Management (PSM) and Risk Management Program (RMP) for Aerosol and Bag-on-Valve manufacturing; and Aerosol Warehousing.  The materials used in these processes places the site with one Program 3 process \u00bf Aerosol and Bag-on-Valve manufacturing; and one Program 1 process \u00bf Aerosol Warehousing.  \n\nTo simplify the implementation process and improve program maintenance efficiency, the requirements of both the PSM and RM Programs have been addressed in a single compliance program.  This combined program, covering process safety and risk management is referred to as the \u00bfProcess Risk Management Program (PRMP)\u00bf.  This program satisfies the requirements of section 112\u00ae of the Clean Air Act, 29 CFR, Part 1910.119, Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals (PSM), and 40 CFR, Part 68, Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions (also known as Risk Management Program (RM Program)), for the facility.\n\nThe existing PRMP was developed in 2006 for FreezeAway\u00ae, a consumer product containing a mixture of dimethyl ether (also known as methyl ether or oxybis-methane) and propane in an aerosol container which is packaged in a consumer kit format.  \n\nIn August 2007, the Process Risk Management Program (PRMP) was expanded to incorporate a new covered process called \u00bfAerosol and Bag-on-Valve\u00bf manufacturing.  This process involves handling flammable materials in excess of the 10,000 pounds threshold.  This facility will produce sun care and foot care aerosol products.  The RMP-covered chemicals \u00bf dimethyl ether and isobutane \u00bf are used as propellants in these products.  There are two- 30,000 gallon storage tanks for each propellant.  The maximum inventory of dimethyl ether is 360,000 pounds; and the maximum inventory of isobutane is 280,000 pounds.  \n\nThe worst-case scenario for this process is failure of an isobutane storage tank and generati"

The unloading hoses are equipped with excess flow valves and smart disconnects, limiting the release to the volume of material in the hose.\n\nThe Aerosol Warehousing process serves two purposes:  \n1)  warehousing QC retain samples\n2)  packaging other consumer aerosol products received from another manufacturer into individual consumer units and warehousing prior to distribution.\n\nThe RMP-covered chemicals in the Aerosol Warehousing area include:\n1)  flammable mixture of dimethyl ether and propane,\n2)  dimethyl ether \n3)  isobutane\n\nThe worst-case scenario for Aerosol Warehousing is failure of one 5.3 weight ounces container of Lotrimin Spray Aerosol (HC K22-057E).  This container has 123.1 grams of isobutane.  This event would not affect off-site receptors.\n\nThe facility complies with OSHA 1910.38 requirements and it is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws.  If an emergency were to occur, Schering-Plough would coordinate with the Cleveland Fire Department, Bradley County EMA, and other agencies as appropriate to respond to the emergency.  The Chairmen of the Local Emergency Planning Committee and members of the Bradley County Emergency Management Agency visited the site during the week of August 5, 2007 to review the site Emergency Response Plan.  The site, LEPC and EMA have agreed on an appropriate response in the case of an event.\n\nIn accordance with the OSHA PSM and EPA RMP requirements, the facility has an active process safety management program that encompasses all process safety elements including, employee participation, process safety information, process hazards analysis, standard operating procedures, operator training, contractor safety, pre-startup safety reviews, mechanical integrity, hot work permitting, management of change, incident investigation, emergency respons"

Since the Program 3 process is a new process, we have not completed a compliance audit cycle for this process at this time.  \n\nThe Aerosol and Bag-on-Valve manufacturing process was subject to rigorous process safety reviews prior to startup.  A process hazards analysis using the HAZOP technique was conducted and recommendations resolved.  This process incorporates a number of safety features including a deluge system in the propellant storage area, safety interlocks and trips in the process, pressure relief systems, and monitoring systems to alert operators of potential incidents.\n\nNo accidents have occurred involving the aerosol products stored at this facility.  The Aerosol and Bag-on-Valve manufacturing unit is new and has no accident history.\n\nAs the facility gains experience with the Aerosol and Bag-on-Valve manufacturing process, we expect to make continual improvements in our Process Safety Management programs.  These improvements will include such items as: on-going training,  continuous upgrading of standard operating procedures, etc."
