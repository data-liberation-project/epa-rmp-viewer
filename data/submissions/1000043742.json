              "Description": "This Prevention Program 3 has been updated from the 2004 RMP submission and covers the recirculating closed-loop ammonia refrigeration system.  The process includes many interconnected vessels and refrigeration units.  Preventive maintenance and on-the-job training of operators and maintenance personnel make up the foundation of the program.  Rose Packing Company continues to implement safe work practices (including lockout/tagout, confined space entry, line break, and entrance control policies and permits), expand our training and emergency response program and reassess procedures to maintain the ongoing integrity of the refrigeration equipment.  Rose Packing has continuously modernized the facility as new technologies are developed.  One important feature of the prevention strategy is the program for the repositioning of evaporators in recessed areas, making contact with vehicles highly unlikely, as well as the placement of virtually all of the refrigeration piping on the building's roof.  Other items include updating of the operations manual and training to reflect improved approaches to safety.",

The RMP includes the Facility's Emergency Response Plan (ERP) that contains procedures, which are designed to maximize the safety of all employees, contractors, and visitors in the event of an emergency and also guard against environmental consequences.\n\n\n\nIII.    Facility Identification\n\nThe Rose Packing facility is located at 4900 South Major Avenue in Chicago, Illinois. The facility is a manufacturer of fresh, smoked and processed pork products for the retail and food service industries.  Operations include packing, cooking and processing meats. Rose Packing produces Canadian Style Bacon and a full line of raw and fully cooked pork sausage, ethnic sausage and back ribs.  The facility also makes hams, smoked pork shoulder butts, sectioned and formed processed pork, fresh boneless backs, pork roasts and pork tenderloins.  The NAICS code for the facility is 311612.\n\n\n\nThe facility uses ammonia for refrigeration, and is regulated under 40 CFR Part 68, the EPA RMP Rule. There is one recirculating closed-loop refrigeration system onsite. The system previously contained a charge of approximately 34,000 pounds of ammonia. The current system charge is estimated at 49,000 pounds. For the purposes of this RMP, the quantity of ammonia onsite will be reported as 49,000 pounds (using EPA's rounding guidance to two significant figures per the RMP Submit User's Manual dated January 4, 1999). \n\n\n\nAn aerial map identifying the site location is included as Appendix A. \n\n\n\nIV.    Hazard Assessment - Worst Case Scenarios (WCS)\n\nAppendix B consists of the RMP*Submit Printout and contains additional information on the worst-case scenario.

Emergency Response Program\n\nRose Packing has an Emergency Response Plan (ERP), updated during June 2013, to ensure that in the event of an emergency the facility personnel are aware of the appropriate actions to take and authorities to contact in order to mitigate the effects of a release. Response activities are coordinated with the Central Stickney Fire Department (which coordinates response activities with the Mabis 10 HAZMAT Team). This coordination effort includes providing the fire departments with site diagrams and hazardous material information, meeting with fire department personnel to discuss facility operations/processes, and periodic on-site inspections by fire department personnel.\n\n\n\nThe facility maintains an ERP on file at the plant. According to the ERP, facility employees are responsible for investigating and assisting the fire department (if necessary) with response to accidental releases of ammonia. The plan includes annual training of all employees on evacuation procedures and emergency notification procedures. The plan also includes annual training for emergency response team members. It identifies the Emergency Response Coordinators, Evacuation Coordinators and alternates. In addition to the facility ERP, the plant is included in a community emergency response plan developed by the Suburban Cook County Central Section Local Emergency Planning Committee.
