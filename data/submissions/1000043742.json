(Rose Packing), Chicago facility, for the reduction of accidental releases of hazardous materials. This updated, Risk Management Plan (RMP) has been prepared to reflect changes made to the system and the resulting addition of ammonia to the system. The RMP summarizes the management, administrative, procedural, and technological controls that work together to minimize the risk to site personnel, contractors, visitors, and the community and environment at large of hazardous chemical releases. The Risk Management Plan (RMP) is organized to correspond with specific U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) RMP, Program 3 of 40 CFR 68, definitions and requirements of Subpart G, including: \r\n\u00bf\tIntroduction;\r\n\u00bf\tRose Packing's policies to protect health, environment, and safety;\r\n\u00bf\tFacility identification and regulated substances covered processes;\r\n\u00bf\tHazard Assessment;\r\n\u00bf\tPrevention Program;\r\n\u00bf\tFive-Year Accident History;\r\n\u00bf\tEmergency Response Plan; \r\n\u00bf\tEmergency Communications;\r\n\u00bf\tSpill Reporting / Environmental Release Procedures;\r\n\u00bf\tPlanned changes to improve safety; and\r\n\u00bf\tManagement Program\r\n\r\nII.\tRose Packing's Policies To Protect Health, Environment, and Safety\r\nRisk management and safety are important concerns at Rose Packing; this RMP formalizes and documents these activities. Rose Packing is committed to conducting its operations in a safe and responsible manner and to reducing risks to human health and to the environment. It is Rose Packing's policy to comply with all applicable federal, state, and local rules and regulations.\r\n\r\nThis RMP has identified potential hazards and has taken steps to design and maintain a safe facility in order to prevent releases, and minimize the consequences of accidental releases, which could occur.

The RMP includes the Facility's Emergency Response Plan (ERP) that contains procedures, which are designed to maximize the safety of all employees, contractors, and visitors in the event of an emergency and also guard against environmental consequences.\r\n\r\nIII.\tFacility Identification\r\nThe Rose Packing facility is located at 4900 South Major Avenue in Chicago, Illinois. The facility is a manufacturer of fresh, smoked and processed pork products for the retail and food service industries.  Operations include packing, cooking and processing meats. Rose Packing produces Canadian Style Bacon and a full line of raw and fully cooked pork sausage, ethnic sausage and back ribs.  The facility also makes hams, smoked pork shoulder butts, sectioned and formed processed pork, fresh boneless backs, pork roasts and pork tenderloins.  The NAICS code for the facility is 311612.\r\n\r\nThe facility uses ammonia for refrigeration, and is regulated under 40 CFR Part 68, the EPA RMP Rule. There is one recirculating closed-loop refrigeration system onsite. The system previously contained a charge of approximately 34,000 pounds of ammonia. The current system charge is estimated at 49,000 pounds. For the purposes of this RMP, the quantity of ammonia onsite will be reported as 49,000 pounds (using EPA's rounding guidance to two significant figures per the RMP Submit User's Manual dated January 4, 1999). \r\n\r\nAn aerial map identifying the site location is included as Appendix A. \r\n\r\nIV.\tHazard Assessment - Worst Case Scenarios (WCS)\r\nAppendix B consists of the RMP*Submit Printout and contains additional information on the worst-case scenario.

This prevention program covers those processes that handle ammonia above the threshold quantity for both PSM and RMP rules. The most recent audit of the PSM program was concluded on June 29, 2012, and the next audit will be conducted no later than June 29, 2015, in compliance with the requirement to conduct PSM audits every three years.  The elements of the PSM / Program 3 prevention program and a brief description are listed below.\r\n\u00bf\tEmployee Participation - Rose Packing has developed a site-specific employee participation plan that ensures employees and their representatives are consulted when conducting and developing process hazard analyses and other information required to be developed under the PSM/RMP regulation.  In addition, the employee participation program ensures employees and their representatives have access to process hazard analyses and all other information required to be developed under PSM/RMP. Employees at Rose Packing have assisted in developing the initial PHA and the five (5) year PHA revalidations for the ammonia process.  In addition, employees have assisted in the development of other PSM/RMP information such as the development of operating and preventative maintenance procedures.\r\n\u00bf\tProcess Safety Information - Rose Packing has developed a site-specific PSI program that ensures information pertaining to the hazards, technology, and equipment of the process are properly developed and maintained. Process safety information for the ammonia process has been compiled and was last reviewed during July 2013.\r\n\u00bf\tProcess Hazard Review - Rose Packing has developed a site-specific PHA program that ensures a PHA i"

The last PHA was completed on July 30, 2013.\r\n\u00bf\tOperating Procedures - Rose Packing has developed a site-specific procedure that ensures operating procedures provide clear instruction for different phases of process operations and ensures they are properly maintained. The Standard Operating Procedures manual was completed on January 19, 2004. Annually, the operating procedures are reviewed and certified as accurate. The most recent review was completed on March 20, 2014.\r\n\u00bf\tTraining - Rose Packing has developed a site-specific training procedure that ensures employees operating the ammonia process have the knowledge to safely operate the process, are aware of the potential hazards of the process, and understand the causes of process problems.\r\n\u00bf\tManagement of Change - Rose Packing has developed a site-specific management of change procedure that ensures changes (except for replacement in kind) to the ammonia process, such as additions of new equipment or changes in operating, maintenance, or other procedures are documented. The most recent MOC was conducted on April 20, 2012.\r\n\u00bf\tPre-Startup Review - Rose Packing has developed a site-specific pre-startup safety review procedure that ensures a safety review is performed when modifications to the ammonia process are significant enough to require a change in PSI.

This procedure also makes provisions to ensure a report is prepared at the conclusion of the investigation and findings are promptly addressed. \r\n\u00bf\tCompliance Audit - The facility completed an original RMP on June 17, 1999 for the ammonia refrigeration system.

Response activities are coordinated with the Central Stickney Fire Department (which coordinates response activities with the Mabis 10 HAZMAT Team). This coordination effort includes providing the fire departments with site diagrams and hazardous material information, meeting with fire department personnel to discuss facility operations/processes, and periodic on-site inspections by fire department personnel.\r\n\r\nThe facility maintains an ERP on file at the plant. According to the ERP, facility employees are responsible for investigating and assisting the fire department (if necessary) with response to accidental releases of ammonia.

It identifies the Emergency Response Coordinators, Evacuation Coordinators and alternates.
