We seek to maintain consistency in our level of protection for people and the environment in the places where we operate. The Environmental and Safety Management System will be the means by which we will accomplish this.\n\nWe will foster cooperation, openness, and dialogue with employees, partners, authorities, and the communities in which we operate and will consider their concerns.\n\nWe will measure and regularly report on our performance, in an appropriate manner.\n\n(b) Stationary source and regulated substances handled\nThe Kalamazoo warehouse and distribution center is a regional center for the distribution of human and animal pharmaceutical products.  The facility uses boilers for heat and so therefore is a stationary source under the Clean Air Act.  A single product Micatin(TM), an aerosol consumer product stored in the warehouse, is covered by RMP requirements.  The propellant in Micatin is an 80/20 mixture of propane and isobutane.  Warehouse storage of Micatin is the sole RMP applicable processes at the facility.  Storage is in cardboard shipping boxes containing eight-ounce steel cans on pallets.  The Micatin storage area is enclosed in a wire mesh cage to contain pressurized cans in the event of a fire.\n\n(c) Worst case scenario and administrative controls\nThe worst case scenario is a fire in the Micatin storage area.  Administrative controls include standard loss control procedures such as fire extinguisher, evacuation, and facility maintenance programs.\n\n(d) General accidental releas"
