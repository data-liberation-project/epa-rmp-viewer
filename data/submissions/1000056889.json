Parts of the operations at this facility involve the distillation and storage of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) and are subject to the Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions located in Part 68 of Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations (i.e., 40 CFR 68).\r\n\r\nCRC is strongly committed to protecting its employees, the public, and the environment.  As part of this commitment, CRC maintains an operational policy that requires compliance with all applicable federal, state, and local regulations.  Significant resources have been used to implement a robust Process Safety Management (PSM) program that is compliant with 29 CFR 1910.119 and, more importantly, is continually being improved to further reduce the potential for an accidental chemical release.  CRC's PSM program addresses all 14 elements of PSM including those elements listed in 40 CFR 68 Subpart D.  Several years ago, CRC established an HSE committee with a PSM subcommittee.  The PSM subcommittee is comprised of hourly and salary personnel from departments throughout the company.  This group meets once a month and works to identify and implement further improvements to our PSM program.   \r\n\r\nCRC's Emergency Response Plan meets or exceeds the requirements as set forth in 40 CFR 68.95 (Risk Management Rule, Subpart E - Emergency Response), 29 CFR 1910.119(n) (Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals) and 29 CFR 1910.38(a) (OSHA's Emergency Action Plans Regulation).

      "SummaryText": "he local fire district and other agency contacts (e.g., Calcasieu LEPC).  As part of its Risk Management Program, CRC has implemented an automatic calling service that notifies Calcasieu Refining personnel if an emergency upset has the potential to cause an off-site impact.\r\n  \r\nCalcasieu Refining Company (CRC) operates a petroleum refinery consisting of 2 atmospheric distillation units, a vacuum unit, 2 naphtha stabilizer units, supporting utility units (e.g. wastewater treatment), a products pipeline, a natural gas pipeline  and various transfer operations (e.g., loading of naphtha product to barges).  The facility operates 24 hours a day and may process up to approximately 90,000 barrels per day of crude oil.  The CRC facility meets the definition of stationary source as contained in 40 CFR 68.3.\r\n\r\nBased on a thorough review of the CRC facility there is only one affected process with a regulated substance (RS) present above its threshold quantity.  This process is the distillation and storage of LPG in storage tanks TK-2001A/B.  LPG is a mixture of various hydrocarbon compounds including propane, butane, and pentane.  The entire LPG mixture is considered to be a RS because it has a NFPA flammability hazard rating of four (4).  The LPG contains the following listed RSs: methane (0.2 weight percent), ethane (1.6 weight percent), propane (11.98 weight percent), isobutane (9.5 weight percent), normal butane (22.0 weight percent), isopentane (20.5 weight percent), normal pentane (19.3 weight percent), and heavy hydrocarbons (15.1 weight percent).  \r\n\r\nThe CRC facility does not have any processes that contain toxic RSs in amounts or conditions that warrant review under the Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions.  For example, hydrogen sulfide (CAS number 7783-06-4) is present in the crude oil in concentrations less than one percent by weight of the mixture.  Therefore, under the mixture rule, the amount of hydrogen sulfide in the mixture is not subject to the review."
