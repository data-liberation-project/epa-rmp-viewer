The Plan includes an analysis of the potential offsite consequences of an accidental release, a five-year accident history, and a release prevention and emergency response program.  \r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n\r\nWilbur-Ellis has implemented release prevention and emergency response procedures to minimize the potential for accidental releases of hazardous materials.  Emergency response procedures including evacuation procedures and notification procedures have been implemented by Wilbur-Ellis.  In addition, Wilbur-Ellis has developed operating procedures and preventative maintenance activities to reduce the likelihood of accidental releases.\r\n\r\nThis Plan and the emergency response procedures document the accidental release prevention, safety, and emergency policies in place at Wilbur-Ellis.\r\n\r\nDescription of Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\r\n\r\nWilbur-Ellis is located at 36025 Highway 12 in Dayton, Washington (the facility).  Wilbur-Ellis is a retailer of fertilizer in the forms of anhydrous ammonia stored under pressure and aqueous ammonia.  There is one anhydrous ammonia storage tank located at the facility with a capacity of approximately 12,500 gallons.  The anhydrous ammonia is transferred from the storage tank into 1,000 gallon tanks on tender trucks.  There are two tender trucks with two 1,000 gallon tanks at the facility.  The contents of the tender trucks are sold and delivered to the local farming community for use as fertilizer.  \r\n\r\nThere is one aqueous ammonia storage tank located at the facility with a capacity of approximately 22,000 gallons.  The aqueous ammonia is transferred from the storage tank to tankers with capacities ranging from 750 gallons to 2,500 gallons.  There"
