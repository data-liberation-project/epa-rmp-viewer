Stationary Source and Regulated Substance\r\nThe CRC (California Resources Corporation) - Buena Vista Nose Gas Processing Facility is located at 99999 Lake Station Road, Maricopa, California 93252.\r\nThe Buena Vista Nose Gas Processing Facility has developed a Risk Management Plan (RMP) to address California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program requirements (California Health & Safety Code, Title 19, Division 2, Chapter 4.5, Sections 2735-2785). The Buena Vista Nose Gas Processing Facility is extremely diligent and committed in the handling of all flammables and chemicals and is dedicated to the safety of its employees and the neighboring community. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention such as personnel training, building safety into the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the facility.\r\nThe philosophy is to implement engineering and administrative controls to eliminate preventable releases of regulated substances; as well as non-regulated substances. The Program 1 process exclusively includes Natural Gas Liquid. The Plant is Process Safety Management (PSM) Normally Unoccupied Remote Facility (NURF) exempt. Plant operations and/or employees will not average more than 1.5 man-hours per day and a total of 14.5 man-hours per week.\r\nRegulated flammable mixtures containing isopentane, ethane, propane, butane, pentane, and isobutane are present at the facility. No regulated toxic substances are present at the facility in excess of the threshold quantities established by this regulation.\r\nEmployees are provided annual training in HAZWOPER 29 CFR 1910.120, Emergency Action Plans 29 CFR 1910.38, (including tabletop drills that periodically include local emergency response agencies depending on their availability), Hazard Communication 29 CFR 1910.1200, Fire Prevention Plans 29 CFR 1910.39 and Injury and Illness Prevention Plan Cal/OSHA Title 8, Section 3203.\r\n1.2.
