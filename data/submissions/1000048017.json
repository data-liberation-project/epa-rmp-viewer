Stationary Source and Regulated Substance\n\nThe CRC (California Resources Corporation) - Buena Vista Nose Gas Processing Facility is located at 99999 Lake Station Road, Maricopa, California 93252.\n\nThe Buena Vista Nose Gas Processing Facility has developed a Risk Management Plan (RMP) to address California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program requirements (California Health & Safety Code, Title 19, Division 2, Chapter 4.5, Sections 2735-2785). The Buena Vista Nose Gas Processing Facility is extremely diligent and committed in the handling of all flammables and chemicals and is dedicated to the safety of its employees and the neighboring community. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention such as personnel training, building safety into the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the facility.\n\nThe philosophy is to implement engineering and administrative controls to eliminate preventable releases of regulated substances; as well as non-regulated substances. The Program 1 process exclusively includes Natural Gas Liquid. The Plant is Process Safety Management (PSM) Normally Unoccupied Remote Facility (NURF) exempt. Plant operations and/or employees will not average more than 1.5 man-hours per day and a total of 14.5 man-hours per week.\n\nRegulated flammable mixtures containing isopentane, ethane, propane, butane, pentane, and isobutane are present at the facility. No regulated toxic substances are present at the facility in excess of the threshold quantities established by this regulation.\n\nEmployees are provided annual training in HAZWOPER 29 CFR 1910.120, Emergency Action Plans 29 CFR 1910.38, (including tabletop drills that periodically include local emergency response agencies depending on their availability), Hazard Communication 29 CFR 1910.1200, Fire Prevention Plans 29 CFR 1910.39 and Injury and Illness Prevention Plan Cal/OSHA Title 8, Section 3203.\n\n1.2.

Five Year Accident History\n\nThe five year accident history reporting requirement does not apply, at this time, to the Buena Vista Gas Processing Facility as the covered process and the facility containing said process is a new facility.  This submittal will mark the first submittal for the covered process at Buena Vista Gas Processing Facility.\n\n1.4. Toxic: Worst Case\n\nThe use of toxic materials at the CRC - Buena Vista Nose Gas Processing Facility is not encompassed by either the federal or state RMP requirements. Therefore, this section is not applicable.\n\n1.5. Toxic: Alternative Release\n\nThe use of toxic materials at the CRC - Buena Vista Nose Gas Processing Facility is not encompassed by either the federal or state RMP requirements. Therefore, this section is not applicable.\n\n1.6. Emergency Response Program\n\nCRC - Buena Vista Nose Gas Processing Facility has written emergency response procedures to address hazards that may be encountered during response or follow-up of an emergency at the Buena Vista Nose Gas Processing Facility. These emergency response procedures address the following issues: 1) releases of regulated substances, including the possibility of fires or explosions; 2) proper emergency rescue, first aid and medical treatment for exposure; 3) notification of local emergency response agencies; 4) evacuation plans for the Buena Vista Nose Gas Processing Facility and methods of accounting for facility personnel after an evacuation; and 5) post-incident cleanup/decontamination requirements. In addition, the Buena Vista Nose Gas Processing Facility follows procedures that address the maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment and alarms on a routine basis. Written emergency response procedures are in compliance with OSHA Standard 29 CFR 1910.38 Emergency Action Plans. Training on the emergency response plan enhances the preparedness of employees to r"

The emergency response procedures provide a comprehensive approach for managing emergencies including prevention, preparedness, hazard assessment, response, rescue, decontamination and follow-up procedures.\n\n1.7. Planned Changes To Improve Safety\n\nCRC - Buena Vista Nose Gas Processing Facility is extremely diligent in the handling the Natural Gas Liquid Storage/Extraction. At this point, CRC - Buena Vista Nose Gas Processing Facility feels confident in the system arrangement, therefore there are no current improvements to be made.\n\n"
