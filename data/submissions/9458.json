The Butadiene Hydrogenation Unit (BHU) removes butadiene from the MTBE reactor feed, the MTBE Reaction and Purification Unit produces and purifies MTBE and byproducts.  Several HAZOPs were conducted in order to cover all of the equipment in this process.  The most recent HAZOP (11-17-1998) which is listed in this report covered the equipment in the BHU.  The process controls, mitigation, monitors and detection systems noted apply to all units except as follows:  The deluge system is used on all pumps and accumulators in the MTBE Reaction and Purification Unit.  Note that the flammable mixture quantity listed in Section 1.17 for this process only includes RMP chemicals present in this process in less than reportable quantities and non-RMP flammables.",

              "Description": "The Butadiene Process is made up of five units.  The Acetylene Hydrogenation Unit (AHU) removes acetylenes from the crude butadiene feed, the Butadiene Purification Unit purifies butadiene products and byproducts, the Sponge Oil Unit recovers C4s from the Vent Gas System and depentanizer bottoms streams, the Flare and Vent Gas Systems collect off-gas for recovery and/or combustion in an elevated flare, and the Waste Water Stripper Unit removes process chemicals from the process water.  Several HAZOPs were conducted in order to cover all of the equipment in this process. The most recent HAZOP (11-17-1998) which is listed in this report covered the equipment in the AHU. The process controls, mitigation, monitors and detection systems noted apply to all units except as follows: Interlocks are used in the Butadiene Purification Unit, the AHU, the Flare and Vent Gas Systems, and the W3F54 Wastewater Stripper.  Automatic shut-offs are in the AHU, Butadiene Purification Unit, and Flare and Vent Gas Systems.  The deluge system is only used on all pumps and accumulators in the BD portion of the process and on the accumulator in the vent recovery system.  Note that the flammable mixture quantity listed in Section 1.17 for this process only includes RMP chemicals present in this process in less than reportable quantities and non-RMP flammables.",

This area also includes storage of finished product for the O&O Plant F5 Unit.  Several HAZOPs were conducted in order to cover all of the equipment in this process.  The most recent HAZOP (5-22-1998) which is listed in this report covered the equipment in the truck and rail car loading rack areas. The process controls, mitigation, monitors and detection systems noted apply to all units except as follows:  Only butadiene tanks have rupture disks.  Automatic shutoffs are on all electric pumps only.  Excess flow devices are only located at the truck and rail car loading racks.  The docks are not covered by perimeter monitors.  Deluge systems are used on 11 pumps and underneath the docks.  Interlocks are only used on the finished butadiene product sphere.  Note that the flammable mixture quantity listed in Section 1.17 for this process only includes RMP chemicals present in this process in less than reportable quantities and non-RMP flammables.",

      "SummaryText": " HUNTSMAN CORPORATION  C4 PLANT - EXECUTIVE  SUMMARY\n\n1.    Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies.  Huntsman's C4 Plant is committed to providing a safe, healthy and environmentally conscious work place for its associates and neighbors.  This is exemplified by the C4 Plant having earned the Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA) VPP Star award for excellence in safety performance. The C4 Plant maintains a working OSHA Process Safety Management  (PSM) program, which implements a series of steps to prevent potential hazards associated with the process and assures a well-trained work force.   The PSM program further implements its policies with onsite procedures and manuals.  The EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) has been built upon this existing PSM program.   The C-4 Plant participates with the Jefferson County Local Emergency Planning Commission (LEPC) Sabine-Neches Chiefs Association and the Port Neches Fire Department in assisting local officials in the development of emergency response plans and participates in cooperative training with them.   The facility complies with all applicable codes and standards regarding operating and equipment safety. Huntsman participates in the Responsible Care. initiative of the Chemical Manufacturer's Association, is committed to the responsible management of chemicals and is an active participant in the International Standards Organization (ISO) 9002 quality management program.   In addition, the C4 Plant maintains a Hurricane Preparedness Plan which is implemented in the event of a hurricane approaching the plant.\n2.    The stationary source and regulated substances handled. The C4 Plant is located  at the corner of Highway 136 and Highway 366 in Port Neches, Texas. The site began production in 1943 and was acquired by Huntsman in 1994.  The site produces as primary end products butadiene and Methyl Tertiary Butyl Ether (MTBE).

MTBE is not an RMP chemical. \n\n    The C4 Plant processes or stores volumes of the following regulated flammable substances greater than the threshold amounts:  1,3-butadiene, 1-butene, 2-methyl-1-butene, 2-methylpropene, 3-methyl-1-butene, 2-butene-cis, butane, ethane, isobutane, isopentane, methane, pentane, propane, propylene, propyne, 2-butene-trans, vinyl acetylene and ethyl acetylene. The only regulated toxic substance, in a quantity greater than the threshold amount, at the time of the initial submittal of the Risk Management Plan is chlorine. At some time during the summer of 1999 another regulated toxic substance, aqueous ammonia, (ammonia concentration = 30% wt) will be added to the facility.  Consequently, this RMP submission will contain predictive filing for 30% wt aqueous ammonia. \n\n    The C4 stationary source is composed of four processes. They are identified as the Butadiene Process, the MTBE Process, Receiving, Storage, and Transfer (RS&T) and Steam, Power and Water (SP&W).\n\n    The Butadiene Process produces butadiene by extraction and distillation of crude butadiene purchased from various olefin plants. This process also produces a by-product stream (Raffinate-1) which contains isobutylene and is used as a feedstock for the MTBE process.\n\n    The MTBE Process uses a catalytic method to react isobutylene with methanol to produce MTBE. The feeds to the MTBE Process are the Raffinate-1 stream from the Butadiene Process and butane/butylene streams from several refinery operations. The MTBE is then puified by distillation and sold to refineries.\n\n    The Receiving, Storage & Transfer (RS&T) Process consists of storage tanks, marine docks, and railcar facilities for,  loading, unloading and storage of raw materials, intermediates, by-products and finished products.\n\n    The SP&W Process consists of utilities, includ"

The only part of the SP&W Process which is covered by PSM and RMP is that area which contains chlorine.  Chlorine is stored in cylinders and utilized for water treatment.  The wastewater treatment facility will be adding a regulated toxic chemical, aqueous ammonia (30% wt ammonia), during the summer of 1999 for the control of BOD.  Although the bulk of the SP&W process is not \"covered\", the C4 Plant is in the process of implementing various elements of PSM/RMP for this area, including Management of Change, Operating Procedures and Mechanical Integrity.   \n\n    Offsite Consequence Analysis  \n    The RMP Rule requires that offsite consequence analysis (OCA) be performed to estimate the potential for an accidental release of a regulated substance to affect the public or the environment.  This OCA includes the development of worst and alternative release scenarios for the release of toxic and flammable substances.  The OCA allows for the consideration of administrative controls and mitigation measures in estimating potential scenario impacts.  The EPA computer program, RMPComp version 1.06, was used to model the release scenarios.  \n\n    Worst Case Release Scenarios\n    These worst case scenarios are based on EPA required assumptions which are highly unlikely and have never occurred at this facility.\n\n    The C4 Plant has one worst case release scenario to represent all toxics and one worst case release scenario to represent all flammables.  \n\n    The representative toxic worst case scenario for C4 Plant involves the  failure of a chlorine cylinder with the entire contents released over 10 minutes.  This scenario results in off-site impacts. \n\n    The flammable worst case scenario involves the complete failure of a storage sphere containing butadiene. The entire volume  in the tank  is assumed to vaporize and result in a vapor cloud explosion. This scenario results in offsite impacts.   Failure of a tank can be"

In order to protect against overpressure, this sphere contains Pressure Relief Valves which will reduce the pressure in the tank in a controlled manner long before failure of the tank occurs.  The fact that the system was designed to operate safely under the conditions which it is now operating, a rigorous inspection program complying with industry codes and standards,  effective operation and maintenance of this system using procedures consistent with safe operation, and adherence to the PSM Rule all work together to reduce the risk of releasing the entire contents of the butadiene tank.  The amount of butadiene which is stored in this tank (this directly impacts the amount of butadiene which would be released in this scenario) is controlled administratively by procedures which state the maximum fill level and alarms which alert operators when the tank reaches 80% of the maximum fill level.\n\n    Alternative Case Release Scenarios\n    The C4 Plant has one alternative release scenario for the toxic substance currently on site (chlorine) and one for the toxic substance that is being predictively included (aqueous ammonia). The C4 Plant has one alternative release scenario to represent all flammables.\n\n    The first toxic alternative release scenario involves a 5/16\" diameter leak from a chlorine cylinder for 30 minutes (vapor release).  This scenario results in no offsite impacts to public or environmental receptors.  Controls and mitigation measures for chlorine scenarios include testing and inspections, chlorine detectors, alarms, procedures, trained emergency responders, emergency chlorine cylinder repair kits and fixed firewater monitors.\n\n    The second toxic alternative release scenario (being submitted predictively) involves a leak from a tank that contains 30% wt aqueous ammonia. The leak is a result of a leak from a >\" line break for 30 minutes.  This scenario results in no offsite impacts to public or environmental receptors. \n\n    The representat"
