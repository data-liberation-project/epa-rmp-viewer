      "SummaryText": "Our company is an agricultural retail business that provices inptus for grain production. This company strives to maintain a safe and healthy work lace. Every effort is made to prevent any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia. Our plant consists fo three 12,000 gallon anhydrous ammonia storatge tanks and when filled to 85% capacity will hold 159,000 pounds. With the addition of 40 nurse tanks with a capcity of 176,000 pounds makes the company's total capcatiy 335,000 pounds. The worst case scenario may potentially release 335,000 over a distance of 1.63 miles. The release has the potential to affect 160 residents. The alternative release scenario would have a releae of 13319 pounds over a 2 minute release period. This release would have destance to endpoint of .83 miles and would still affect the same 160 people within the community. This company maintains and operates their NH3 plnat in strict accordance with all federal, state and loca authorities. The Kansas Department of Agriculture inspects our plant on a regular basis and we comply with their recommendations. Changes will be accted upon immediately to reduce potential ammonia releases or as budget allows. Our employees are trained in safety procedures, proper plant operation, plant maintenance and the employees are competency tested over the training material. Each employee uses goggles and gloves during ammonia operations as well as always providing plenty of safety water during nurse tank loading operations. No injuries or accidents or poperty damage have occurred at this facility for the past five years. Our emergency action plan is desinged tominimize the risks to employeesm the surrounding public and the area first responders. This company provides plant tours for our local fire department and our action plan has been shared with the county local emergency planning commission. They are aware of the dangerous nature of NH3 and they have agreed to assist us in the event of an emergency."
