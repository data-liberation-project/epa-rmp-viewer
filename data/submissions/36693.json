This Risk Management Program was previously submitted in December 1999.\n\nCalifornia Dairies, Inc. (California Dairies) in Turlock, California, prepared a Chemical Risk Management Program and Process Safety Management Program (RMP/PSM) in general accordance with state and federal regulations.  The state risk management regulations, also referred to as the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) program, are codified in California Code of Regulations (CCR), Title 19, Section 2735.1, et. Seq. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) also regulates facilities with certain toxic and flammable substances. The regulations are codified in Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 68. Finally, both the Occupational Safety and Health Association (OSHA) and the California Occupational Safety and Health Association (CalOSHA) regulate facilities with certain acutely hazardous materials under the PSM regulations, as defined in CCR Title 8, Section 5189 and CFR Title 29, Part 1910, Section 119, respectively.\n\nCalifornia Dairies prepared the RMP/PSM to satisfy regulatory requirements and to demonstrate a commitment to evaluate and improve anhydrous ammonia handling systems and practices at the facility. California Dairies incorporated many state-of-the-art safety features into the ammonia refrigeration system at the facility as part of the original system construction and system modifications.  California Dairies will continue to improve ammonia-handling safety through the implementation of the prevention program elements of the RMP/PSM. In"

The California Dairies ammonia system is continuously monitored by automated control systems that shut down components if deviations from normal operating conditions occur. The major pressure vessels in the system are connected to a diffusion panel.  Ammonia from the vessels can be mixed with water (neutralized) and discharged to the city sewer to prevent over-pressurization of the vessels. Further, all pressure vessels in the system are equipped with pressure relief valves.\n\nOther safety features at the facility include: \n\u00bfemergency shutdown systems\n\u00bfcomponent specific safety shutdowns\n\u00bfpressure relief valves on all vessels, compressors, and several other areas in the system where trapped ammonia could build pressure\n\u00bfall major vessels are connected to a fire diffusion panel\n\u00bfengine room is equipped with ammonia detection system\n\u00bfengine room is equipped with emergency shut down switches\n\u00bfengine room is equipped with a ventilation system\n\u00bfmany of the ammonia pipes, valves and components are labeled\n\u00bfa fire sprinkler system is installed in the plant\n\u00bfoperators receive ongoing training in operations, maintenance and emergency response\n\nIn addition to the physical features of the ammonia refrigeration system at the facility, California Dairies has extensive administrative controls in place to maintain safe operation of the system. Administrative controls include, but are not limited to, formal training programs for system operators and mechanics, emergency training, a hot work permit program, a lockout/tagout program, a contractor safety program, incident investigation program, mechanical integrity program, management of change program, pre start-up safety review program, and a RMP/PSM auditing and inspection program.

A preventive maintenance system is utilized to manage the maintenance of the refrigeration system. Preventive maintenance at the facility includes daily, weekly, and periodic inspection; calibration; testing; and overhaul of ammonia system equipment. The system is used to track equipment performance and to create reports that are used by maintenance personnel to monitor the frequency of repairs and deviations from normal operating parameters.\n\nChanges to improve safety at the facility are ongoing.  Many of the mitigation measures suggested by the process hazard analysis team have already been implemented.  Others will be implemented during the next several months.  The status of significant mitigation measures is as follows:\n\u00bf\tpreventive maintenance program is being changed from a manual system to a computer system and reviewed to verify that all ammonia system components are included and maintenance frequencies are appropriate\n\u00bf\tmanagement is evaluating installing oil drain pots on accumulators, recirculators and glycol chillers\n\u00bf\tmanagement is evaluating connecting an automatic phone dialer to ammonia detection system\n\u00bf\tammonia awareness will be added to forklift training program\n\u00bf\tmanagement is evaluating safe work practices and emergency response plan\n\nCalifornia Dairies will respond to all suggested mitigation measures promptly.

The site is bordered by Tegner Road to the east, West Main Street to the north, Ruble Road to the south, and industrial businesses to the west. California Dairies is approximately 0.8 miles west of Highway 99. The surrounding area consists of industrial and commercial businesses and residential development.\n\nThe facility was originally constructed in the late 1980s. The refrigeration system was remodeled in the mid 1990s. Operations at the facility consist of the storage, processing, packaging, and distribution of milk and dairy products. The facility is staffed by a refrigeration operator or mechanic 24 hours per day, 365 days per year.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is used in a refrigeration system at the facility. The refrigeration system, which is a closed system, contains approximately 16,600 pounds of anhydrous ammonia. The system provides cooling for production areas, product, and water chilling. The desired temperatures are maintained by controlling the flow of ammonia with manually and electrically operated valves, float switches, and compressor controls.  \n\nThe RMP/PSM regulations require a review of the five-year accident history at a regulated facility. The California Dairies facility reported no accidental releases of ammonia within the past five years. \n\nThe RMP/PSM regulations require a review of the accidental release prevention program and chemical specific prevention steps used by the facility. Many safety features have been incorporated into the ammonia refrigeration system to prevent system failures and to mitigate potential releases. The predominant safety concern with closed-loop ammonia systems is an inadvertent buildup of p"
