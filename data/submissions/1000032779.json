Flammable propellants, including Butane (106-97-8),Difluoroethane [Ethane, 1,1-difluoro-](75-37-6),Methyl ether [Methane, oxybis-] (115-10-6), and Propane (74-98-6), are used to pressurize  a majority of our product containers. All propellants are stored within the five (5) tanks located in our tank farm. Each tank is limited to 85% of capacity by administrative controls. The largest of the tanks has a twelve thousand (12,000) gallon capacity . (10,200 when de-rated to the 85% capacity level) The remaining tanks range from eighteen hundred (1,800) to five thousand (5,000) gallons nominal capacity. Propellants are pumped from the tank farm to a specially designed Gas House where the aerosol cans are pressurized. Subsequently, the cans are mechanically conveyed into the plant from the Gas House for testing, inspection, packaging and shipment.\n\n\n\nWorst Case Scenario:\n\nOur worst case would be the release of the contents of our largest tank. If the tank contained propane, forty three thousand (43,000) pounds of flammable propellant would be released into the environment. This occurrence would have an of"

This case assumes a fire of unknown origin causes the tanks to overpressure and either release all gas through the relief valves, or rupture due to high pressure that cannot be alleviated by the relief valve.\n\n\n\nAccident Prevention Program:\n\nThe use of flammable propellants in our facility, has been subject to the Delaware Extremely Hazardous Substanve Risk Management Act (EHSRMA) and the OSHA Process Safety Management standard (29CFR 1910.119) since operations commenced in 1994. The facility has a reviewed and updated risk management system in place to meet these requirements and to minimize the potential for accidental release of these substances . Our management system includes:\n\nProcess hazard analysis to identify and correct potential hazards\n\nManagement of change procedures to assure that standards are maintained and potential new hazards are identified and evaluated.\n\nMechanical integrity procedures designed to recognize a potential failure and correct it before damage occurs.\n\nDetailed operating procedures for process control.\n\nTraining for personnel involved in operating and maintaining the processes.\n\nFacility design allows for multiple layers of incident prevention.\n\n\n\nFive (5) Year Accident History\n\nDuring the past five (5) years, this facility has not had any accidental releases of flammable substances that resulted in on-site injuries or damage and no off-site impacts.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nActivAir, Inc.  has a written emergency response plan which has been updated and reviewed with the last 6 months . A prior revision was coordinated with the Sussex County Emergency Planning Committee (L.E.P.C.) and the Seaford Fire Department.  Plans to review the current revision are underway.  Key personnel at our facility have been trained using the new procedure and guidelines are in place to regularly retrain"
