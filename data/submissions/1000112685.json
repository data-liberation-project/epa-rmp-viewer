The alternative release scenario (or a more plausible potential incident) is a spill of a container of each individual regulated pesticide substance using adjusted modeling parameters, \u0093D\u0094 stability class and a wind speed of 6.7 miles per hour. \n\nThe toxic endpoints for both the Worst-case Release Scenario and the Alternative Release Scenario are orders of magnitude less than the regulated toxic endpoint.
