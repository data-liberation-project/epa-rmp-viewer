      "SummaryText": "e Worst Case Scenario as required by EPA, assumes that the tank's contents are fully released as a gas/vapor over a 10-minute period.  \n\n3.1.2  The dispersion model, Screen3, predicted, with a wind speed of 3 mph and atmospheric stability class F, the anhydrous ammonia release may travel 1.2 miles from the point of release (See: Appendix B).  Approximately 2500 people, in the surrounding community, reside within the radius to the toxic endpoint (level of concern = 200 ppm, anhydrous ammonia).  A list of schools, churches, parks, etc. that lie within the radius to the toxic endpoint are listed in Section 9.0.  There are no environmental receptors within the radius of the toxic endpoint.\n\n3.2  Alternate Case Scenario (ACS)\n\n3.2.1  The Alternate Case, more realistic, Release Scenario for Zartic Foods, Inc. was selected to involve a relief valve release on a condenser located on the roof.  Anhydrous ammonia (at approximately 250 psi and 113 0F) was estimated to have a flow rate from the relief valve (inner orifice diameter: 0.75 inches) of approximately 92 lbs./min., determined from an ammonia gas release table.  It is estimated that the relief valve could be isolated, or the overpressure condition corrected, in approximately 10 minutes by trained operators on site, with a corresponding anhydrous ammonia quantity released of approximately 920 lbs.\n\n3.2.2  The Screen3 air dispersion model predicted, with a wind speed of 6 mph and atmospheric stability class D, that the anhydrous ammonia release may travel approximately 0.13 miles.  Approximately 160 people reside within the radius to the toxic endpoint (level of concern = 200 ppm, anhydrous ammonia).  A list of schools, churches, parks, etc. that are located within the radius to the toxic endpoint are listed in Section 9.0.

This tank holds approximately 111,000 lbs. of propane when 88% full.  The Worst Case Scenario as required by EPA, assumes that the tank's contents are fully released as a vapor cloud followed by ignition.\n\n4.1.2  The vapor cloud explosion model, Archie, predicted the propane vapor cloud explosion endpoint (1 psi overpressure) may extend to 0.38 miles from the point of release (See: Appendix B).  Approximately 230 people, in the surrounding community, reside within the radius to the explosion endpoint of 1 psi-overpressure.  Public receptors lying within the explosion endpoint radius are listed in Section 9.0.  There are no environmental receptors within the radius of the toxic endpoint.\n\n4.2  Alternate Case Scenario (ACS)\n\n4.2.1  The Alternate Case Release Scenario for Zartic Foods, Inc. was selected to involve the relief valve lifting on the propane storage tank.  Propane was estimated to have a flow rate from the relief valve (inner orifice diameter: 4.0 inches) of approximately 1,432 lbs./min., determined from a propane relief valve discharge table.  The overpressure scenario condition was estimated to be relieved in approximately 5 minutes.  The resulting vapor cloud could contain approximately 7,160 lbs.\n\n4.2.2  The vapor cloud explosion model, RMPComp, predicted the propane vapor cloud explosion endpoint (1 psi overpressure) may extend to 0.1 miles from the point of release (See: Appendix B).  Approximately 60 people, in the surrounding community, reside within the radius to the explosion endpoint of 1psi overpressure.  Public receptors lying within the explosion endpoint radius are listed in Section 9.0.

('68.155(a) ).\n\n1.1  Zartic Foods, Inc. prevents accidental ammonia releases through classroom and on the job training of refrigeration / maintenance personnel and ongoing inspection and maintenance of the refrigeration system.  Refrigeration system components are located in areas that are not as likely to become damaged (i.e., tanks placed away and protected from forklift and truck traffic).\n\n1.2  Accidental propane releases are prevented through classroom and on the job training of refrigeration / maintenance personnel and ongoing inspection and maintenance of the propane system.  Propane system components are placed away and guarded from truck and forklift traffic.\n\n2.0  Source and regulated substances handled ('68.155(b)).\n\nApproximately 47,000 lbs. of anhydrous ammonia and 111,000 pounds of propane are contained on site at Zartic Foods, Inc.  The EPA requires a Risk Management Plan be developed and maintained when the total amount of anhydrous ammonia or propane exceeds the threshold quantity of 10,000 lbs.  No other substances, in quantities subject to EPA RMP certification requirements, are located at the Zartic Foods, Inc. facility.\n\n3.0  Ammonia Worst Case and Alternate Case Release Scenarios ('68.155(c)).\n\n3.1  Worst Case Scenario (WCS)    \n\n3.1.1  The high pressure receiver, located on the roof, contains the largest quantity of anhydrous ammonia, on site, on a predictable worst case basis.  This tank holds approximately 9,722 lbs. of anhydrous ammonia when 85% full, under an internal pressure and temperature of approximately 181 psig and 95 0F.  This tank is typically 30% to 60% full during normal operations, however, during periods of partial plant shutdown, ammonia is pumped into the high pressure receiver for storage.
