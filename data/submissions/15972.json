If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to notify the Valley Park Fire Protection District Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency.\n\nA description of our facility and the regulated substances handled:  This facility is an insecticide manufacturer for use by commercial applicators.  We use a number of different propellants in our aerosol insecticide can products.  We have one 12,000 gallon propane tank (A- 108), one 12,000 gallon demethyl ether tank (DME), three 2,000 gallon isobutane/propane mixture tanks (A-46), and one 2,000 gallon difluouroethane tank (Dymel 152A).  The two 12,000 gallon tanks are located in aboveground bunkers. \n\nThe worst-case and alternative release scenarios: A worst-case analysis was done for each flammable propellant above the threshold.  The propellant with the greatest offsite consequence radius was chosen for the worst-case scenario which in this case was the 12,000 gallon propane tank.  The failure of the 12,000 gallon propane tank when filled to the greatest amount allowed (88% at 60 degrees F), results in a vapor cloud explosion.  The resulting distance to the endpoint extends offsite, and public receptors are within the distance to the endpoint.  Our alternative release scenario is a break in a 2-inch diameter pipe from the 12,000 gallon propane tank, leading to a 10-minute release and explosion of some of the released propellant.  The resulting distance to the endpoint extends offsite, and public receptors are within the distance to the endpoint.\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps:This facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule and all applicable state and"

The propellant system is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with NFPA 58 and state law.\n\nFive-year accident history:  We have never had an accident involving the propellant system that caused deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or shelterings in place.\n\nThe emergency response program:  In the event of an emergency involving our propellant system, it is our policy to notify the Valley Park Fire District Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency.  We have discussed this policy with the fire department and they are aware of their responsibility.     \n\nPlanned changes to improve safety: A water deluge system is planned to be installed in late 1999.\n\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY FOR PROGRAM  1 WAREHOUSE PROCESS\n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at our facility: This facility complies with NFPA-58 requirements for LP-Gas storage, and it is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws.  The packaging and storing of the aerosol cans follow accepted industry standards.

We use a number of propellants in our insecticide aerosol can products.  We chose propane as a representative sample since it has the worst-case impact.  The quantity of cans stored in our warehouse puts us over the 10,000 lbs propane threshold.\n\nThe worst-case and alternative release scenarios: We have one worst-case scenario for this location.  It is a failure of one, 2 lb can of pesticide with 1 lb of propellant.  The failure of a can in a fire results in an endpoint of 43 feet so it does not extend offsite.\n\nThe general accidental release prevention progra"
