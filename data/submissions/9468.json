              "Description": "The Light Olefins Unit (LOU) Process has five units which are the Hot Side, cold Side, GHU/PHU, PDU and LOU Offsites.  The Hot Side (last process hazard analysis (PHA) completed on 10/03/95) includes the furnaces up through the quench columns.  The Cold Side (last PHA on 07/21/98) includes compression, refrigeration, and fractionation.  GHU/PHU are two stage gasoline and pyrolysis gasoline hydrogenation units (last PHA on 10/21/98 and most recent PHA for LOU Process RMP Program).  The PDU is the propylene drying and transfer units (last PHA on 03/25/98).  LOU Offsites (last PHA on 10/28/98) include tankage, waste water stripping unit, flare, custody transfer stations, and loading racks associated with the LOU.  The process controls, mitigations, monitors and detectors listed apply to all units except as follows:  the PDU and LOU Offsites do not have automatic shutoffs; the GHU/PHU and Cold Side are the only units with quench system process controls; only LOU Offsite unit tankage have dikes; the GHU/PHU do not have process area detectors; and only the PDU has fire detectors.  The flammable mixture mass noted below includes inventories of non RMP flammable chemicals and RMP flammable chemicals below the threshold quantity in the process.  RMP chemicals below the threshold quantity included in the flammable mixture are: Acetylene, Ethyl Acetylene and Hydrogen",

The Cyclohexane Unit manufactures cyclohexane (last PHA 03/16/99 and most recent for this process).  The AU/Cyclohexane Offsites includes storage, cooling tower, and flare (last PHA 05/20/97).  The risk management program's elements for the units listed apply to all units except as follows:  Only the Cyclohexane unit has a quench system; the dikes apply only to storage tanks in the AU/Cyclohexane Unit.  The emergency power and air, automatic shutoffs and purge systemdo not apply to the AU/Cyclohexane Offsites Unit.  The flammable mixture mass noted below includes inventories of non RMP flammable chemicals and RMP flammable chemicals below the threshold quantityin the process.  RMP chemicals below the threshold quantity included in the flammable mixture are: 1,3 Butadiene; 2 Butene CIS; Butane; Ethane; Isobutane; Methane; Propane and Hydrogen.",

Huntsman Aromatics and Olefins (A&O) Plant is committed to achieving excellence in environmental, health and safety.  This is exemplified by the A&O Plant having earned the Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA) Star Award for excellence in safety performance.  The Huntsman A&O Plant maintains a working Process Safety Management (PSM) program, which implements a series of steps to prevent potential hazards associated with the process and assures a well-trained work force.   The PSM program further implements its policies with onsite procedures and manuals.  Huntsman A&O Plant participates with the Jefferson County Local Emergency Planning Commission (LEPC), Port Arthur Fire Department and the Sabine Neches Chiefs Association to develop emergency response plans and participates in cooperative training with these agencies. Huntsman participates in the Responsible Care. initiative at the Chemical Manufacturer's Association and are committed to the responsible management of chemicals. The Plant Manager of the A&O Plant is responsible for implementation of the risk management program (RMP).\n\n2.    Regulated Substances.   The Aromatics and Olefins Plant is located on 230 acres at the corner of State Highway 73 and Savanna Avenue in Port Arthur, Texas and employs 275 people.  The site first opened in 1957 and was acquired by Huntsman in 1994.  The site produces as primary end products ethylene, propylene, cyclohexane and intermediates.  The A&O Plant has four processes:  the Light Olefins Unit (LOU) manufactures ethylene and propylene; the Aromatics/Cyclohexane Unit manufactures aromatics extract and cyclohexane; Utilities uses chlorine for water treatment; and the offsite tankage area operated by an adjoining plant, is included in this filing, but adds no additional chemicals other than an increased inventory of exi"

Huntsman's A&O Plant has twenty-five (25) regulated substances at the facility.\n\nThe twenty-four (24) flammable substances are:\n\n7 Ethylene - Product used to manufacture polyethylene grocery bags, wraps and machine parts, and as a raw material for other ethylene based products (ethylene glycol-antifreeze, ethanol amines-shaving creams, hand lotions, furniture polishes, and dry-cleaning preparations, etc.)\n7 Propylene - Product used to manufacture polypropylene materials such as films, clothesline and other kinds of rope and, in turn, is used as a raw material for other propylene based materials (propylene glycol-factory fill antifreeze and propylene oxide).\n7 Propane and Ethane - Products recycled to manufacture propylene and ethylene and are ingredients in natural gas.\n7 Methane - Product used for fuel and is an ingredient of natural gas.\n7 Isobutane, 2-Methyl Propene, Butane, 1-Butene, 1,3-Butadiene, 2-Butene cis and trans, and Vinyl Acetylene - Products used as raw materials in the manufacture of synthetic rubber for tires, and butyl rubber for films, coatings and carpet.\n7 Isopentane, Isoprene, 1-Pentene, 1,3 Pentadiene, 2-Pentene (E) and (Z), 2-Methyl-1-butene, 3-methyl-1-butene, Pentane - Raw and recycled materials used as feed stocks for the manufacture of ethylene and propylene or sold as a product mix.\n7 Propyne and Propadiene - Intermediates destroyed in downstream reactors.\n\nThe one (1) toxic substance is:\n\n7 Chlorine - Added to cooling water for treatment\n\n \n \n3.    Offsite Consequence Analysis (OCA)  \nThe RMP Rule requires that offsite consequence analysis (OCA) be performed to estimate the potential for an accidental release of a regulated substance to affect the public or the environment.  This OCA includes the development of worst and alternative release scenarios for the release of toxic and flammable substances.  The OCA allows for the consideration of administrative controls in estimating potential scenario impacts.  EPA's computer "

      "SummaryText": "program, RMP Comp, Ver. 1.06, was used to model the release scenarios\n\nToxic Release Scenarios\n\nThe Toxic Worst Case Scenario is based on EPA required assumptions, and is highly unlikely, and has never occurred at this facility.\n\n    The Toxic worst case scenario for A&O Plant involves the failure of a 2000 pound chlorine cylinder with the entire contents released over 10 minutes.  This scenario has potential off-site impact.\n\nThe toxic alternative case scenario involves a 5/16\" diameter leak from a chlorine cylinder for 30 minutes (vapor release). This scenario results in no offsite impacts to public or environmental receptors.\n\nMeasures for preventing these toxic release scenarios are as follows:  Chlorine systems have automatic shut-off devices and operate under vacuum to minimize releases in the event of a pipe/tube break.  Chlorine detectors, alarms and procedures are in place to alert of a release.  Emergency chlorine cylinder repair kits are also available on site should a leak occur.  Fixed fire water monitors with trained and drilled fire responders are on site.\n\nFlammable Release Scenarios  \n    \n    The Flammable Worst Case Scenario is based on EPA required assumption and is highly unlikely and has never occurred at this facility.\n\nThe flammable worst case scenario involves the complete failure of a storage tank containing a hydrocarbon mixture.  The volume of RMP chemicals in the tank is assumed to vaporize, ignite, and result in a vapor cloud explosion.   A rigorous inspection program complying with industry codes and standards, effective operator and maintenance training using procedures consistent with safe operation, and adherence to the Process Safety Management program reduce the risk of releasing the entire contents of these tanks.  This scenario has potential for offsite impacts.\n\nOverfilling the tank has been considered and safeguards implemented to reduce the chance of this scenario.  The administrative control for the tank is the maximum fill level whi"
