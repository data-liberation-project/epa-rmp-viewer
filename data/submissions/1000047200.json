The methodology used to carry out these analysis is HAZOP.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are re-validated at a regular interval of every five years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.  The most recent PHA/update was performed on April 9, 2014.\r\n\t\r\n3.3\tOperating Procedures\r\nFor the purpose of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Cherokee Nitrogen maintains written operating procedures.

This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at out facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\r\n\r\n2.0\tCherokee Nitrogen, LLC and Regulated Substances\r\nOur facility's primary activities encompass the manufacture of ammonia and related processes.  Ammonia is a natural part of the life process.  It is produced internally by all humans and mammals to process essential proteins.  Ammonia is one of the most widely used industrial chemicals in the world, and is commonly used to purify water and refrigerate foods.\r\n\r\nThe company is a supplier to the fertilizer, explosives, and commercial industries by manufacturing ammonium nitrate, ammonium nitrate solutions, and other products.   Cherokee Nitrogen markets its fertilizers to distributors, dealers, national farm retail chains, regional farm cooperatives, and other fertilizer producers for ultimate sale and delivery to farmers.\r\n\r\nWe have four regulated substances present at our facility at or above threshold quantities.  These substances include ammonia (anhydrous), ammonia (conc. 20% or greater), chlorine, and sulfur dioxide.  Anhydrous ammonia is used to manufacture nitric acid (<80 percent).  Aqueous ammonia is contained within the letdown, urea, and ammonium nitrate solutions processes.  Chlorine is used to treat the incoming process water prior to use by the facility.  Sulfur dioxide is used to treat the outgoing process water prior to discharge from the facility.\r\n\r\nTypically, the facility manufactures two types of ammonium nitrate solutions:  industrial grade (83 weight perce"

Refresher training is provided at least every three years and more frequently as needed.\r\n\r\n3.5\tMechanical Integrity\r\nCherokee Nitrogen carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others:  pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls, and pumps.\r\n\t\r\nMaintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\r\n\r\n3.6\tManagement of Change \r\nWritten procedures are in place at Cherokee Nitrogen to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment, and procedures.
