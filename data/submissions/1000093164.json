Five Year Accident History:\n\n\n\nThis facility had an RMP/PSM accident on February 22,2021. A leak from an ammonia transfer line caused vapors to leave the site.  The duration of the event was 20 minutes. Approximately 793 lbs of Ammonia were released to the atmosphere. An additional 1400 lbs were absorbed by the firewater curtain and routed to wastewater treatment. This resulted in local roadways being closed. Five individuals received medical treatment for exposure to ammonia but returned to work later that day. Taminco updated training and procedures for maintaining ammonia in the transfer lines during unit shutdowns.\n\n                                                                                                                                                                                          \n\n6.The Emergency Response Program:\n\n\n\nThis facility's emergency response program is based on OSHA's"
