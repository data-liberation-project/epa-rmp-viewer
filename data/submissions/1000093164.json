The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Specific Prevention Steps:\r\n\r\nThe St. Gabriel facility of Taminco US LLC takes a pro-active role regarding accidental release prevention:\r\n*This facility is ISO 9001 certified and is re-audited every 6 months.  \r\n*This facility is compliant  with the Process Safety Management Program and the OSHA 1910 Process Safety Management Standard.\r\n*Hazard reviews are conducted for all new processes and procedures.\r\n*All government standards for permits are met and maintained.\r\n*Safety controls, such as warning alarms and interlocks, provide an active defense.\r\n*Automatic shut-off valves and pressure relief devices protect against unexpected changes in temperature or pressure.\r\n*Equipment is routinely inspected through a Mechanical Integrity Program.\r\n*Standard operating procedures and engineering practices are kept updated and online.\r\n*Employees and contractors receive extensive health and safety training.\r\n\r\n\r\n5. Five Year Accident History:\r\n\r\nThis facility had an RMP/PSM accident on February 22,2021. A leak from an ammonia transfer line caused vapors to leave the site.  The duration of the event was 20 minutes. Approximately 793 lbs of Ammonia were released to the atmosphere. An additional 1400 lbs were absorbed by the firewater curtain and routed to wastewater treatment. This resulted in local roadways being closed. Five individuals received medical treatment for exposure to ammonia but returned to work later that day. Taminco updated training and procedures for maintaining ammonia in the transfer lines during unit shutdowns.\r\n                                                                                                                                                                                          \r\n6.The Emergency Response Program:\r\n\r\nThis facility's emergency response program is based on OSHA's"
