Hutchinson Technology Incorporated's (HTI's) accidental release prevention program involves policies and procedures that integrate technology, engineering, written procedures, and management practices to allow safe operation of the chlorine system.  HTI follows all applicable requirements of the U.S. Environmental Protection (USEPA) Prevention Program.  These are summarized in Part (d) below.  HTI's emergency response program includes response plans that are coordinated with emergency response activities available in the community.  The emergency response program, summarized in Part (f) below, is in compliance with the USEPA's Emergency Response Program requirements.\n\nb. HTI uses a chemical process for etching stainless steel and stainless steel/polyimide/copper clad (also called metal clad) sheets.  These sheets are eventually processed into computer suspension assemblies used in the hard disk drive industry.  HTI's Eau Claire facility uses only one chemical included in the regulations: chlorine.  It is used in the following process:  etchers use chlorine for oxidation purposes to improve the performance of its etchant.\n\nChlorine is supplied to the etching process to maintain the etchant solution (iron chloride) in optimal etching condition. The chlorine is received as a liquid in DOT specified metal tanks which are stored in two specially-engineered totally enclosed holding bunkers (half submerged below ground).  These bunkers can hold a total of eight 1-ton chlorine tanks (four in each bunker), but only one tank in each bunker feeds the system at a time.  The liquid chlorine flows from the tanks to a system that converts the liquid to a gas (vaporizer).  The chlorine gas then flows to the mixing/holding etchant tanks (called sumps) where it enters the solution to chemically maintain the etchant.  Chlorine is fed into the sumps in a controlled manner by sensors that determine the feed rate.  The storage bunkers, vaporizer, and delivery system contain mulitiple"

An emergency response team is on call 24 hours a day to respond should there be a leak.\n\nc.  The off-site consequences analysis includes consideration of two chemical release scenarios called \"worst case release\" and \"alternative release\".  The worst case scenario is defined by the USEPA as a scenario where the \"owner or operator shall assume that the... maximum quantity is the largest vessel... Is released as a gas over 10 minutes: due to an unspecified accident or failure.  The scenario does not depend on how or why it occurred and does not depend on whether it has ever been observed to have happened anywhere.  The requirements do not allow for any control of chlorine to be assumed except for a control that is passive (not human, electrical, or otherwise actively activated).  The alternative scenario is defined as \"more like to occur than the worst-case scenario,\" but there are no other requirements pertaining to defining the quantity released, except that active controls can be included thereby reducing the likelihood of a release occurring or reducing the quantity that could be potentially released.  Consequently, HTI determined the alternative release scenario for chlorine would be one that could reasonably occur (even if it had not been observed) and would be one where a chlorine release could be controlled.\n\nHTI's worst case scenario for chlorine is the release of one chlorine tank containing 2000 pounds.  HTI's alternative chlorine release scenario is a valve failure in the storage bunker releasing one pound of chlorine of which 0.75 pound is captured and controlled by the scrubber and 0.25 pound is released to the environment.\n\nThe USEPA requires that the release scenario quantities be used in the atmospheric dispersion models to determine the distance traveled by the released chemical before its concentration decreases to a defi"

The 3 ppm concentration for chlorine in air is defined by the American Hygiene Association as the \"maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects or symptoms which could impair an individual's ability to take protective action.\"\n\nThe atmospheric dispersion models have to include meteorological conditions that are \"worst case.\"  These worst case weather conditions include a low speed but steady wind and conditions that do not promote vertical atmospheric mixing (no turbulence) but keep the chemical low to the ground and minimally dispersed and diluted.  The distance traveled is used to determine a circle with a radius corresponding to the extent of the toxic endpoint within the worst case weather conditions.  The radius of influence is used to determine the residential population, schools, national/state parks and monuments, officially designated wildlife refuges and sanctuaries, and other sensitive receptors that could be affected at the defined level by a release.\n\nChlorine is held in two storage bunkers that have containment walls, retractable lids or roofs, and numerous engineered safety features.  The moveable sealing lids aid in keeping chlorine vapors contained.  The storage bunkers and building that houses the vaporizers are vented to a chlorine scrubber if a leak is detected or a pull station alarm is activated.  Air in the storage bunkers is automatically evacuated and scrubbed when a person a person enters a bunker.  The scrubber will contain the chlorine and neutralize it.  Other control measures include safety valves, special venting equipment for areas where the etcher tanks are located, and monitoring systems tied into alarms and chlorine shutoff valves.

At 0.5 ppm chlorine in the air, specially trained personnel are immediately alerted and alarms are activated.

The HTI accidental release prevention program is part of a long-established operating management system.  Even though the chlorine process operated for five years in Eau Claire until this particular process ceased operations in April 2000, the prevention program has been in use in HTI's Hutchinson, Minnesota facility for numerous years.  The prevention program contains the following key components:\n--  High level of training  for personnel involved in the chlorine system and operators of the etchant\n--  Predictive preventive maintenance programs for all components of the chlorine system\n--  Use of state-of-the-art safety equipment, including chlorine monitors and control systems\n--  Use of chlorine monitoring equipment and alarms\n--  Use of accurate and effective operating procedures, written with the participation of employees\n--  Regular process hazard analysis of equipment and procedures\n--  Use of an auditing and inspection program\n\nThe prevention program also includes chorine-specific exposure prevention steps including: (1) awareness training of the hazards and toxic properties of chlorine, (2) presence of chlorine detectors, (3) special ventilation systems than can be manually activated when chlorine is detected.
