If an emergency were to occur,  \nit is our policy to notify the Newhall Fire Department and request that they respond to our emergency.\n\nFacility description and regulated substance handled:\nThis facility ia a farm fertilizer plant. We sell and apply dry and liquid fertilizer. Our Anhydrous Ammonia \nplant consists of two storage tanks (30,000 and 26,000 gal.) and associated piping, pump, valves, vents,\nnurse tanks, and other miscellaneous equipment.\n\nWorst-Case release scenario:\nOur worst case scenario is a sudden failure of our largest storage tank when filled to maximum allowed\n(SOP 85% full), resulting in a toxic gas cloud.  According to EPA look-up tables, the distance to the\nendpoint is 4.4 miles. Within the distance to the endpoint are private residences, a recreation area, \nand some small businesses, including farms. Population within the endpoint is 1,614.\n\nGeneral accidental release prevention program and Chemical specific prevention steps:\nThis facility complies with EPA's accident  prevention rule as well as all applicable local and state codes\nand regulations. This Anhydrous Ammonia plant is designed, built, and maintained according to OSHA\n(29 CFR 1910.111) and state regulations.\n\nFive-year accident history:\nNo accidents involving NH3 that caused death, injuries, environmental or property damage, or evacuations.\n\nEmergency response program:\nIt is our policy that in the event of an emergency involving NH3, the Newhall Fire Department be notified of,\nand requested to respond to the emergency. We have discussed this with the fire department and they have a copy of our Emergency Action Plan. In addition the fire department inspects our facility on a yearly\nbasis.\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety: None\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          "
