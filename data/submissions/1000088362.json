Risk Management Plan Executive Summary\r\n\r\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at the stationary source -- Real Alloy Specification LLC. (Real Alloy) has implemented a Risk Management Program in accordance with the requirements of the Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions.  In the even of an emergency, Real Alloy has coordinated emergency response efforts with the Coldwater Fire Department and the City of Coldwater's Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).\r\n\r\nThe stationary source and regulated substances handled --  Real Alloy manufactures aluminum ingots, sows, and molten aluminum in crucibles from various types of recycled aluminum scrap.  At the time of this submittal, Real Alloy is subject to the requirements under the Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions since the facility maintains chlorine on-site in a quantity greater than the 2,500 pound threshold.  Chlorine is used at the facility to remove impurities from the recycled aluminum.\r\n\r\nThe worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario, including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario --  Real Alloy has administrative controls (operating procedures) which limit the amount of chlorine which can be stored on-site.  In addition, Real Alloy maintains passive mitigation measures by enclosing part of the chlorine operation within buildings.  The worst-case release scenario at the Real Alloy facility is based on the accidental release of the greatest amount held in a single vessel, as specified in the regulation.  Therefore, the worst-case release scenario is assumed to be the failure of a one-ton chlorine cylinder.  According to calculations performed using EPA guidance, the distance to the defined toxic endpoint of 0.0087 mg/L is 1.3 miles for the worst-case release.  The alternate release scenario is assumed to be failure of a gasket or transfer hose when connecting the c"

Additionally, Real Alloy has coordinated emergency response with both the Coldwater Fire Department and the City of Coldwater's LEPC.  In the event of an emergency, Real Alloy will follow the procedures outlined in the emergency response plan.\r\n\r\nPlanned changes to improve safety --  Real Alloy is currently evaluating and processing recommendations from a recent process hazard analysis performed for the chlorine operation."
