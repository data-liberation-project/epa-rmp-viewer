Describe the Accident Release Prevention and Emergency Policies\n\nIt is the intent of Nestle to provide a safe work environment for every employee and to protect them from injury and illness resulting from unsafe acts or conditions during hours of employment.  Nestle will also comply with all federal, state and local laws.  The Plant Manager has the responsiblity for leadership of the safety and health program, for its effectiveness and improvement and for providing the safeguards required to ensure safe conditions.\n\nAmmonia safety programs are key items in the plant safety and health program.  Nestle takes many precautions to prevent or minimize accidental releases of ammonia.  These precautions include safety controls (alarms and automatic shutdown devices) which are designed to identify and prevent potentially unsafe conditions like pressure increases that could cause a system failure, a preventive maintenance program designed to maintain the on-going integrity of the systems, a training program designed to ensure that the systems are operated by qualified personnel, and emergency response procedures which enable trained personnel to respond quickly to system upsets.\n\nThe Facility Maintenance Supervisor is responsible for the management of the ammonia safety programs.\n\n\nB.   Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nNestle's Springville Plant produces frozen food products for sale to the public.   The facility operates an ammonia refrigeration system to cool and freeze the food products in the production areas.  The maximum ammonia inventory at the plant is approximately 160,000 pounds.  Ammonia is the only regulated substance handled at the Springville Plant.\n\n\nC.   Summary of Worst-Case and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nThe worst-case toxic release scenario at the Springville Plant involves the release of 26,200 pounds of ammonia over a 10 minute period due to the failure of an ammonia receiver.  This maximum inventory reflects the written administ"

Under worst-case conditions, the resulting vapor cloud could have off-site impacts.\n\nThe alternative toxic release scenario at the Springville Plant involves the release of 6,910 pounds of ammonia over a 10 minute period due to a release from a pressure relief valve. The release duration was assumed to be limited by the response of the Mechanics to the ammonia detector in the relief valve discharge line.  Under alternative release conditions, the resulting vapor cloud could have off-site impacts.\n\nThe worst-case and alternative toxic release scenarios are unlikely for the following reasons:\n\no The weather conditions that were used for the worst-case release scenario do not occur, while those used for the alternative case are uncommon;\no Industry standards are followed for the design and manufacture of the equipment in the ammonia refrigeration system;\no The ammonia receivers are well protected from vehicular traffic;\no Pressure safety valves on the ammonia receivers should limit any pressure increases inside the receivers; \no Ammonia detectors should readily detect releases from the pressure relief valves on the ammonia receivers;\no Ammonia is not corrosive in this service; \no The facility has a preventive maintenance program in place to maintain the on-going integrity of the ammonia refrigeration equipment;\no The facility has a training program designed to ensure that the systems are operated by qualified      personnel; and, \no The facility emergency response procedures that enable trained personnel to respond quickly to isolate any potential releases.\n\nD.

Five-Year Accident History\n\nThere have not been any ammonia-related incidents at the Springville Plant during the previous five years that resulted in significant on-site or offsite consequences.\n\n\nF.   Description of the Emergency Response Program\n\nAn emergency response program has been implemented at the Springville Plant.  This program contains procedures describing how the facility will respond to fires, ammonia leaks and other emergencies, including evacuation procedures.  \n\nThe emergency response program includes the following elements:\n\no Fire Plan\no Ammonia or Gas Leak Procedures\no Evacuation Procedures\no Responsibilities of the Emergency Response Team\n\nThe program has been coordinated with the Springville Fire Department.\n\n\nG.   Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n 51 recommendations were identified to improve the equipment and the system operating procedures when the ammonia refrigeratrion system was analyzed in December 1998.  The recommended changes have been evaluated and will be implemented as required."
