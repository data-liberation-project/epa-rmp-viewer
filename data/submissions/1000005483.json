The facility utilizes Anhydrous Ammonia as a refrigerant to maintain the proper temperatures of Milk, Cream, and Ice Cream at 514 Division Street Madison, WI 53704.  Ammonia, a gas at normal atmospheric temperature and pressure, is used in an anhydrous form liquefied under pressure in a two stage process.  The refrigeration system consists of a High Pressure Receiver, Evaporators, Compressors, Condensers, Vessels, Piping and numerous types of Valves.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:  \nSchoep\u00c2\u00bfs Ice Cream Company is dedicated to promoting safe handling of hazardous materials for the sake of the Plant, Employees and Surrounding Community.  The facility is complying with OSHA\u00c2\u00bfs Process Safety Management standard (PSM), Title 29 Code of federal regulations (CFR) 1910.119, and the EPA\u00c2\u00bfs Risk Management Program regulations (RMP), Title 40 CFR Part 68.  The purpose of these regulations is to ensure that the refrigeration system is operated and maintained in such a way as to prevent releases of ammonia from the system.  Also, these programs ensure the development of procedures that serve to minimize the impact of releases in the event that they do occur, as well as outlining proper emergency response steps.\n\nWorst case Release Scenario: Removed per EPA amended RMP rule.\n\n\nAlternative Case Scenario:  Removed per EPA amended RMP rule.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps:\nAs a part of its PSM Program, Schoep\u00c2\u00bfs Ice Cream Co. has established numerous programs that serve to prevent accidental releases of ammonia.  These programs include:\n1)\tProcess safety information\n2)\tProcess hazard analysis\n3)\tOperating procedures\n4)\tEmployee training  \n5)\tMechanical integrity\n6)\tManagement of chan"

It consists of an automated computer based system that monitors system pressures and conditions it is equipped with an automatic notification system to let facility staff know if the system parameters deviate from normal operating conditions on a 24/7 basis.  The system automatically controls Ammonia Detectors, Sirens, isolation Fire Doors, Ventilation systems, King Valves and a Purging/Scrubbing System to reduce the amount of ammonia vapor expelled from the facility in the event of a major release in the main engine room.    \n\nEmergency Response Information:  \nAs a part of the PSM program this facility maintains an emergency action plan in order to improve responsiveness to an emergency and to improve the reliability of action taken to mitigate the incident.  The plan includes all information needed to respond to an emergency situation, as well as complete notification instruction for Local, State, and Federal emergency response agencies.  Local hazmat teams have been through a detailed tour of the facility and our procedures to ensure a rapid and complete response in the event of an emergency.  Employees are trained in ammonia awareness during new employee orientation and on an annual basis during employment.    \n\nFive Year Accident History:  This facility has had no reportable releases in the last five years\n\nPlanned Changes to improve safety:  \nIn addition to complying with EPA and OSHA regulation and standards, Schoep\u00c2\u00bfs Ice Cream Co. has worked closely with the Wisconsin Department of Commerce, Division of Safety & Buildings to comply with Wisconsin COMM 45, further ensuring the safety of our p"
