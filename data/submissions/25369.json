      "SummaryText": "The Burris Refrigerated Logistics facility in Lyndhurst, Virginia provides logistics services for customers throughout the East Coast of the USA, including the storage and distribution of nonhazardous packaged materials.  We are proud of our safety record and strive to ensure that we design and operate our facility so that hazards are minimized and risks controlled.\n\nWe use a refrigeration process to maintain appropriate temperatures at critical control points in our operation.  Anhydrous ammonia, the refrigerant used in this process, is regulated by EPA under 40CFR part 68 and by OSHA under 29CFR 1910.119.  We have specific programs and practices in place for controlling this process to help ensure that a harmful release of ammonia does not occur.  These programs and practices include:\n\n-\tUse of recognized good engineering practices in the design, installation and operation of our refrigeration equipment and ensuring this equipment meets applicable codes and standards.\n-\tContinual assessment of hazards and safeguards in our process, in order to reduce risks.\n-\tUse of release prevention practices that have been recognized as effective by Federal and State experts.\n-\tMaintaining preparedness and contingency plans for responding to any emergency that may occur and coordinating these plans with local response agencies.\n\nUsing EPA-approved methods and technology, we have determined that the worst-case release of ammonia from our Refrigeration Process, represented by loss of the full contents of our Freezer Recirculator would cause approximately 5,800 pounds of ammonia to be emitted to atmosphere.  Although very unlikely, if that release were to occur, it could impact a portion of a circular area with a radius of 1.0 miles surrounding our site that includes industrial sites, a residential population of approximately 500 people and part of a National Forest.  If a release occurred under normal operating conditions, despite our prevention practices, a portion of an area ab"

      "SummaryText": "out 1,100 feet radius surrounding our site could be impacted.  This area includes industrial sites and residences with approximate population of 50 people. No other public or environmental receptors would be impacted.\n\nOur release prevention program focuses on preventing hazardous releases of anhydrous ammonia.  Our equipment and management practices are consistent with OSHA regulations and recognized good engineering practices specified by ASHRAE, ASME and ASTM standards.  In the unlikely event that a release of ammonia were to occur, monitoring devices would immediately alert us so that quick action can be taken to minimize the impact.  These and other activities are part of our Emergency Contingency Plan that is coordinated with local Fire Department and Emergency Response agencies.\n\nWe are continually seeking ways to improve the safety of our operations.  Consistent with that policy, our facility has been designed to include the latest in safety and environmental protection advancements in place at similar facilities that we operate throughout the USA.  As evidence of this commitment, we completed a process hazard analysis in March 2002 and will resolve all recommendations from that analysis by the end of 2002.  Our Process Safety and Risk Management Procedures and Emergency Response Plan are in place and being used to manage hazards and control risks associated with hazardous materials at our facility.  Operating procedures and mechanical integrity practices are annually reviewed and updated.  We will continue to monitor our operations to identify ways to maintain a leadership position in environmental, health and safety practices."
