      "SummaryText": "The Buckeye Terminals, LLC - East Chicago Complex (East Terminal and West Terminal/District Office) is a bulk refined petroleum storage facility, including propylene storage and rail loading system. The Risk Management Program (RMP) covers the propylene storage and rail loading system, including the associated piping, two (2) storage tanks, 12 loading stations, and railcars.  This facility is adjacent to the butane RMP facility, but is operationally distinct.\n\n\n\nThe Buckeye Terminals, LLC - East Chicago Complex complies to the extent feasible with the American Petroleum Institute Standard 2510 for the Design and Construction of LPG Installation, and it is the facility's policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws/codes. If an emergency were to occur, it is the facility's policy to notify the East Chicago Fire Department as well as the Lake County LEPC, as necessary.  Medical emergencies will require notification to the local Emergency Management Services and Saint Catherine's Hospital. This facility maintains a trained incipient fire response and hazardous materials response team to respond to small or initial stages of an emergency. Additional hazmat capabilities are provided by the East Chicago Fire Department and contracted services.\n\n\n\nThe facility's worst case scenario is the failure of the system's largest tank when filled to the greatest amount allowed by the system (85%) resulting in a vapor cloud explosion. The facility's alternate release scenario is a BLEVE. This alternate scenario was based on an incident (other than a catastrophic tank failure) which would result in the greatest released quantity (fire situation) and have the greatest potential for off-site consequences.\n\n\n\nThe Buckeye Terminals, LLC - East Chicago Complex complies with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) accident prevention rules (40 CFR Part 68 Subpart D), the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standa"

This propylene system is designed, constructed, and maintained in accordance with API 2510 (to the extent feasible) and the manufacturer's instructions. The system is currently approved by the State/Local Fire Marshal.\n\n\n\nTo date, this facility has never had an accident involving propylene which has resulted in deaths, injuries, property/environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place.\n\n\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving the Buckeye Terminals, LLC - East Chicago Complex's propylene storage and rail loading system, it is the policy of the facility to initially contact the East Chicago Fire Department (initial response) and request their assistance. The facility maintains a trained incipient fire response and hazardous materials response team. The facility emergency response plans are coordinated with the fire department and the Lake County LEPC. The East Chicago Fire Department is anticipated to participate in the initial RMP/PSM training session for this system.  The facility maintains a vegetation control plan to minimize plant growth within 10 feet of storage vessels.\n\n\n\nBuckeye Terminals, LLC continually evaluates the process for opportunities to improve safety.  Also, Buckeye is considering a corporate-wide policy to include the local first responders in regular exercises and in all three year PSM/RMP training cycles.\n\n"
