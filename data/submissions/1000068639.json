EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\r\n\r\nThe Homestead Terminal has an Emergency Response Program (ERP) in place to respond to releases of hazardous material at the site.  All employees are instructed via the ERP and training on their responsibilities in case of a release.\r\n\r\nThe site works closely with the LEPC and the local fire department in responding to emergencies.  The local fire department tours the site at least once per year to determine what hazardous materials are present, the location of the materials, and the best responding procedures.  The site also keeps the LEPC and the local fire department informed of any new hazardous materials that are introduced into the workplace.  The other outside agencies that will be involved in responding to emergencies at the site include the County Sheriff, Highway Patrol, Beatrice Fire Department and outside contractors that are needed for such operations as containment, cleanup, material handling, etc.\r\n\r\nAll reportable releases of hazardous material will be reported immediately to the Local Emergency Planning Committee, State Emergency Response Commission and the National Response Center."

In addition, the PSI and OP will be updated to reflect the changes made.\r\n\r\nPre-Startup Review (PSR)\r\nWhen a change to the process is significant enough to require a change in safety information under the MOC, the site will conduct a PSR.

All PSR members will be knowledgeable about the process and trained in the area of change.\r\n\r\nContractors\r\nAgrium has developed and implemented safe work practices to control the entrance, presence and exit of contract employees in covered process areas.

INTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe Agrium U.S. terminal in Homestead, Nebraska transfers anhydrous ammonia from a pipeline and/or ammonia railcars into aboveground storage tanks (AST's) at the facility.  The anhydrous ammonia is subsequently loaded on to trucks for distribution to retail agricultural centers.\r\n\r\nB.   FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nDuring the past five years, there have been zero RMP reportable ammonia releases at the Agrium Homestead Terminal.\r\n\r\nC.   ACCIDENT RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\r\n\r\nThe Homestead Terminal has a Release Prevention Program (RPP) in place to prevent accidental releases of hazardous materials at the facility.  This RPP includes:\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information (PSI)\r\nThis facility has developed and is keeping current working copies of the PSI including information pertaining to the hazards of the process, the technology of the process, and equipment of the process.  All employees are trained in the area where they perform work and all contractors are given training before entry into the process areas is allowed.  The PSI will enable employees and contractors of Agrium to identify and understand the hazards posed by the process involving anhydrous ammonia.\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\r\nThis facility is committed to performing a PHA to identify, evaluate, and control hazards associated with processes at the site.  The PHA is used to analyze potential mishaps, identify mishaps that could occur, analyze the likelihood that mishaps will occur, evaluate the consequence of these mishaps, and analyze the likelihood that safety systems, mititgation systems and emergency systems will function properly to eliminate or reduce the consequences of a mishap.\r\n\r\nThe PHA will be revalidated at least every five years to assure the PHA is consistent with the current process.\r\n\r\nOperating Procedures (OP's)\r\nAgrium has developed OP's to assure safe work practices are maintained.
