      "SummaryText": "A.   INTRODUCTION\n\n\n\nThe Agrium U.S. terminal in Homestead, Nebraska transfers anhydrous ammonia from a pipeline and/or ammonia railcars into aboveground storage tanks (AST's) at the facility.  The anhydrous ammonia is subsequently loaded on to trucks for distribution to retail agricultural centers.\n\n\n\nB.   FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nDuring the past five years, there have been zero RMP reportable ammonia releases at the Agrium Homestead Terminal.\n\n\n\nC.   ACCIDENT RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe Homestead Terminal has a Release Prevention Program (RPP) in place to prevent accidental releases of hazardous materials at the facility.  This RPP includes:\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information (PSI)\n\nThis facility has developed and is keeping current working copies of the PSI including information pertaining to the hazards of the process, the technology of the process, and equipment of the process.  All employees are trained in the area where they perform work and all contractors are given training before entry into the process areas is allowed.  The PSI will enable employees and contractors of Agrium to identify and understand the hazards posed by the process involving anhydrous ammonia.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\nThis facility is committed to performing a PHA to identify, evaluate, and control hazards associated with processes at the site.  The PHA is used to analyze potential mishaps, identify mishaps that could occur, analyze the likelihood that mishaps will occur, evaluate the consequence of these mishaps, and analyze the likelihood that safety systems, mititgation systems and emergency systems will function properly to eliminate or reduce the consequences of a mishap.\n\n\n\nThe PHA will be revalidated at least every five years to assure the PHA is consistent with the current process.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures (OP's)\n\nAgrium has developed OP's to assure safe work practices are maintained.  The OP's are updated and certified annually to ensure they are current and accur"

Employees assigned to a process area are trained in all steps of the operating phases including startup, shutdown, normal operations, safety systems and functions, emergency operations and  operating limits.   Employees are provided refresher training at least every three years and more often if necessary.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity (MI)\n\nAgrium has developed a written program of maintaininig the MI of process equipment at the Homestead Termninal.  The MI program includes inspection and testing of pressure vessels and storage tanks, piping systems, and ancillary equipment, relief and vent systems and devices, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.\n\n\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nThe site has communicated to all employees that it is every employee's responsibility to report incidents and near misses.  After an incident is reported, an incident investigation is conducted.  Findings and recommendations are promptly addressed and resolutions documented.  The leader of the incident investigation team is knowledgeable of the site and trained in incident investigation.\n\n\n\nCompliance Audit\n\nA compliance audit of the Homestead Terminal will be conducted at least once every three (3) years to evaluate compliance of the process with the release prevention program (RPP).   The audit team will include one person knowledgeable in audit skills and techniques and team members with appropriate technical expertise.  Recommendations resulting from the audit are addressed and deficiencies documented and corrrected.\n\n\n\nManagement of Change (MOC)\n\nThe Homestead Terminal's MOC system was developed to ensure that changes at the"

The MOC system includes the following considerations before any process changes take place:\n\n-authorization requirement for the change\n\n-technical basis for the proposed change\n\n-impact of the change on health and safety\n\n\n\nAfter the changes are made, all affected employees will be informed about the change and training will be provided to the affected employees, prior to the startup of the modified process.  In addition, the PSI and OP will be updated to reflect the changes made.\n\n\n\nPre-Startup Review (PSR)\n\nWhen a change to the process is significant enough to require a change in safety information under the MOC, the site will conduct a PSR.  The PSR team leader will develop a checklist and assemble a team of key personnel to go over every element on the checklist during the PSR.  All PSR members will be knowledgeable about the process and trained in the area of change.\n\n\n\nContractors\n\nAgrium has developed and implemented safe work practices to control the entrance, presence and exit of contract employees in covered process areas.  It is Agrium's policy to select safe contractors, provide appropriate safety related information to contractors, develop safety work practices related to contractors and periodically evaulate contractors.\n\n\n\nAgrium will inform contractors of any known potential fire, explosion, or toxic release hazards related to the contractors work and the process.  Agrium will also explain to the contractors the applicable provisions of the site emergency response plan.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nAgrium is committed to involving employees and their representatives on the conduct and development of a PHA and on the development of other elements of plant safety management and risk management planning.  Agrium encourages employees to read, review and provide comments on all PSM/RMP documents.\n\n\n\nHot Work Permits\n\nHot work is defi"

A permit is required when hot work is to be conducted on or near Agrium's process.  This permit ensures that fire prevention and protection requirements have been implemented prior to hot work operations.\n\n\n\nD.   EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe Homestead Terminal has an Emergency Response Program (ERP) in place to respond to releases of hazardous material at the site.  All employees are instructed via the ERP and training on their responsibilities in case of a release.\n\n\n\nThe site works closely with the LEPC and the local fire department in responding to emergencies.  The local fire department tours the site at least once per year to determine what hazardous materials are present, the location of the materials, and the best responding procedures.  The site also keeps the LEPC and the local fire department informed of any new hazardous materials that are introduced into the workplace.  The other outside agencies that will be involved in responding to emergencies at the site include the County Sheriff, Highway Patrol, Beatrice Fire Department and outside contractors that are needed for such operations as containment, cleanup, material handling, etc.\n\n\n\nAll reportable releases of hazardous material will be reported immediately to the Local Emergency Planning Committee, State Emergency Response Commission and the National Response Center."
