As such, the information, procedures, policies, and documentation that make up this program must be made easily accessible and updated as necessary. To accomplish this, O'Neill Vintners & Distillers has elected to use PSMWriter, software developed and distributed by Resource Compliance, Inc. This software will assist us with updating, maintaining, scheduling, and tracking RMP-PSM related activities.\n\n \n\n1.1 O'Neill Vintners & Distillers, Risk and Process Safety Management Program\n\n\n\nThis is to inform all interested persons, including employees, that O'Neill Vintners & Distillers has developed their unified RMP-PSM Program. This program has been prepared to address the risks involved in operating and maintaining the following processes which have the presence of hazardous chemicals above threshold quantities: \n\n\n\nProcess Name               | Process Chemical               | Process Quantity(lbs.)\n\nP1 - Main Processing         Anhydrous Ammonia                27,000\n\nP2 - 900 Farm                Anhydrous Ammonia                15,000\n\nP4 - Sulfur Dioxide          Sulfur Dioxide                    8,000\n\nP5 - Remote 900              Anhydrous Ammonia                12,500\n\n\n\nNote: Process 3 (Trailer Package) was decommissioned in 2016 with the installation of Process 5. Process 5 was designed by Axiom Engineers and installed by Cold Storage Technologies.\n\n\n\nOur RMP-PSM program promotes overall plant, worker, and public safety. The program enab"

From the accumulators, low pressure liquid is circulated through heat exchanger. As heat is absorbed, the liquid ammonia vaporizes to form low temperature and pressure gas which is returned to the accumulator vessels. The suction gas is returned from the accumulators through a suction return line to the main suction accumulator.  From the main suction accumulator, ammonia is piped to the suction inlet on the compressors. The high pressure discharge from the compressors is sent to water-cooled evaporative condensers where the high pressure gas ammonia is cooled, liquefied and returned to the thermosyphon vessel and then to the high pressure receiver.\n\n\n\nEach system contains numerous safety devices including sensors which stop the compressors if temperatures or pressures exceed or drop below established limits, and pressure relief valves which vent to a diffusion tank if the pressure in the system exceeds their set point. \n\n\n\nThere is one ammonia detector installed inside the refrigeration machinery room"

Nevertheless, O'Neill Vintners & Distillers continually strives to improve in all areas, including safety.\n\nBy utilizing PSMWriter software, all necessary employees have access to every aspect of the RMP-PSM program. This has improved O'Neill Vintners & Distillers' ability to communicate hazardous situations to employees and contractors. In addition, PSMWriter tracks all RMP-PSM related events so that O'Neill Vintners & Distillers' management team can ensure that the RMP-PSM program is being implemented.\n\n\n\nO'Neill Vintners & Distillers has implemented all aspects of the RMP-PSM program. When a RMP-PSM program requirement is completed (i.e. mechanical integrity inspection, process hazard analysis, compliance audit, etc.) any specific action items related to that event are entered into PSMWriter, assigned a responsible person, and given a due date. Once the action item has been completed, the resolution can be documented using PSMWriter as well. A list of current or past due action items can be accessed at any time by those with access to PSMWriter.\n\n\n\nIn addition to utilizing PSMWriter to create, schedule, track, and document events, O'Neill Vintners & Distillers has also entered into a contract with Resource Compliance to obtain help with RMP-PSM program implementation.\n\nFor the future, O'Neill Vintners & Distillers now thinks of the RMP-PSM program as a \"living document\". It is an interactive framework that guides safe action for O'Neill Vintners & Distillers employees, but allows for feedback and continual improvement. Through the RMP-PSM program O'Neill Vintners & Distillers will continue to maintain overall plant worker and public"
