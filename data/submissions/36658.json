Although we take pride in that record, we also place daily emphasis on our prevention and safety programs to ensure this record continues.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nWe will continue to conduct emergency response preparedness activities and coordinate any emergency response actions necessary for the Longview Gas Plant with the Elderville Volunteer Fire Department.  Also involved in emergency response for the facility would be the Longview Fire Department, the Lakeport Police Department, the Gregg County Sheriff, the Good Shepherd Hospital, and the Texas Department of Public Safety.  The Longview Gas Plant manager is responsible for coordinating all emergency actions.  A specific Emergency Response Plan for the facility is in place and that plan has been coordinated with local officials, along with evacuation procedures, regular drilling, and training.  Our Emergency Response Program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nDiligent compliance with our RMP Prevention Program forms the framework on which we will continue to improve the level of safety at the Longview Gas Plant.

This philosophy involves making each and every employee and contractor accountable for their own safety as well as that of the community around them.  As a company we follow a close adherence to all applicable federal, state and local laws to ensure a safe and healthy environment for all. \n\nEmployees who enter the Longview facility complete a thorough training, both in the classroom and on-the-job, that enables them to address emergency issues as they arise.  This preparation includes standard operational, emergency operational, and release prevention training.  In addition, periodic refresher courses help to keep operators\u00bf problem solving abilities up to date and in sync with our recurring safety improvements.  Our regular internal audits provide an excellent checks and balances system for monitoring these high standards that we set.\n\nLongview Gas Plant is one of many facilities operated by Enbridge Energy Company.  At the facility, we receive wellhead gas from wells via pipeline.  We separate the liquid hydrocarbons out by employing the cryogenic/turbo-expander/demethanizer process.  The demethanized residue gas is either sold to customers as low-pressure gas or recompressed employing two turbine compressors for sale to customers as high-pressure gas.  The liquid hydrocarbons (Natural Gas Liquids) separated in the cryogenic/turbo-expander/demethanized process are fed into a 200,000-gallon per day capacity fractionation process.  In the fractionation process, the natural gas liquid (NGL) is fractionated into E-P Mix (mixture of ethane and propane) and the residue hydrocarbon liquid (Butane?) is stored in two 30,000-gallon storage tanks prior to distributio"

The E-P Mix is further treated in an amine system and a triethylene glycol system to remove carbon dioxide and water respectively prior to distribution by pipeline to the customers.  Two flammable mixtures are reported as present at the facility in greater than threshold quantities.  They are Butane+ (Butane and heavier hydrocarbons) and Natural Gas Liquids (or demethanized raw feed).  There are no toxic substances present at the plant.  The facility is classified as Program Level 3 under the regulation.  The purpose of this Risk Management Plan (RMPlan) is to provide information about our operations at the facility, our programs to prevent accidental chemical releases, our emergency response plans in case an accidental release should occur, our 5 year accident history, and our planned changes to improve safety at the facility.\n\nPrevention Program\n\nThe Longview Gas Plant has been operating under the strict guidelines of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Program since 1992.  Our ongoing analysis of the potential hazards of our process, detailed training of our employees, and constant emphasis on safety have helped us avoid any serious accident over the last 5 years.  Part of this program has also involved identifying and taking steps to avoid potential accidental chemical releases.  A few examples of the additional prevention features implemented at this facility include:\n\nWe provided manual emergency shutdown (ESD) buttons at several locations within the facility in order to shutdown the entire facility during emergency situations.  The ESD system will also isolate the facility from the incoming feed pipeline and outgoing product pipelines.\n\nWe installed Lower Explosive Limit monitors in the turbine cubicles in order to detect flammable hydrocarbon vapors. \n\nWe provided dual seals on the plant feed pumps with an alarm in the control room to detect any leakage from the primary sea"
