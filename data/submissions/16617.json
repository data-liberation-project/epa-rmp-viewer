It is the policy of this facility to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws.  Management, and employees are committed to the prevention of accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, county LEPC, EPA, and any other applicable authorities to mitigate the release and minimize its impact on people and the environment.\n\nA description of the facility and the regulated substance handled:  The primary activity at this facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, filled into nurse tanks, and sold to the customer for direct application as a crop production nutrient.  The maximum quantity stored is 84,000 pounds in 1/18,000 gallon storage tanks.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario:  The worst-case scenario is the release of the total contents of the largest storage tank or rail tank car released as a gas over a period of 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 84,000 pounds, which is the volume of the largest storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 0.96 miles (The Fertilizer Institute Worst-Case Anhydrous Ammonia Releases Table 1).  There are 95 private homes and a total population of 247 people within the distance to the endpoint.  \n\nThe alternative release scenario:  The alternative release scenario, based on the most likely potential incident, is a release from a transfer hose failure (1.5\" hose).  Based on The Fertilizer Institute Alternate-Case Releases of Anhydrous Ammonia Table"

All employees are trained in the equipment safety features and the safe handling of anhydrous ammonia.\n\nThe five-year accident history:  There has been no accidental release of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that has caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility.  Neither has there been a release that, to our knowledge, resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property or environmental damage.\n\nThe emergency response program:  The facility has a written Emergency Response Plan in accordance with OSHA standards, 29 CFR 1910.38 and 1910.120, including pre-emergency planning and employee training.  A copy of the Emergency Response Plan has been given to the local fire department, and to the Local Emergency Planning Committee.  The local fire department has been on site for safety and emergency response training.  The facility submits annual community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety:  Safety improvement is an on-going process at this facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed by company personnel and by the Oh"
