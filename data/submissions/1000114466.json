During these meeting we also discuss preventative measures, such as evacuation, in order to be prepared for a release.\nSun Pacific Tulare has also conducted an off-site consequence analysis of worst-case and alternative release scenarios for the ammonia refrigeration process. These are for the purposes of informing the public in the event of an accidental release. The results of the analyses are reported in PSMWriter and hard copy binders. \n1.3.2 Anhydrous Ammonia\nThe ammonia refrigeration process at the Sun Pacific Tulare facility is an integral part of the overall business and operates most of the year. It is extremely important that this process is maintained and operated in a safe and efficient manner. Management is committed to making sure that employees are made aware of the potential danger of an ammonia leak.\nOur refrigeration personnel monitor the ammonia refrigeration process and keep active records of all procedures and transactions that pertain to ammonia. In addition, the process is checked frequently by one of the outside refrigeration contractors that we use. These contractors also assist in performing the annual mechanical integrity inspection of our ammonia equipment. \n1.4 Five Year Accident History\nSun Pacific Tulare has had no accidental release within the last five (5) years.\n1.5 Emergency Action and Response Plan\nSun Pacific Tulare\u0092s emergency action and response program has been developed to satisfy the following requirements:\nCal/OSHA\u0092s Emergency Action Plan \u0096 Title 8 CCR \u00a73220\nU.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration\u0092s (OSHA) Emergency Action Plans \u0096 Title 29 CFR \u00a71910.38\nCal/"
