The process contains a storage vessel with the maximum capacity of  1,400,000 lbs. of 1-butene.\n\nSUMMARY OF MAJOR HAZARDS\n\nThe worse case flammable scenario would be the release of the entire contents of the 1-butene storage vessel with the potential subsequent vapor cloud explosion of 1 psi endpoint that would not  reach a residential area. The flammable alternate case scenario is a two inch butene -1 transfer hose at the truck unloading facility fails releasing butene - 1 with a potential subsequent vapor cloud explosion of 1 psi endpoint that would reach an industrial neighbor, but not a residential community. \n\nACCIDENT PREVENTION\n\nThe polybutylene process at the Shell Taft Plant is covered by 29 CFR 1910.119, the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard that requires Process Hazards Analysis (PHA).  A PHA has been completed for the polybutylene process and safety improvements have been implemented.  Any changes to processes (procedures, raw materials, process conditions, etc.) or plant equipment following the PHA must follow the Management of Change (MOC) procedure whereby a team, selected on  the basis of expertise and experience, reviews the change to determine if there is any impact on safety, health or environment as well as the technical feasibility.  MOC's are tracked and documented as required. All PHA's are revalidated at least every five years and documentation is retained for the life of the process.  \n\nThe PSM Standard requires that each employee presently involved in operating a process, and each employee before operating a newly assigned process, be trained in an overview of the process and operating procedures. This includes safety, health, emergency oper"

Written tests and field observation verify understanding of the training.  Maintenance and contract maintenance employees are trained, not only in the craft skills and repair procedures, but also in the safety and environmental aspects of their job.  Refresher training for operators and maintenance personnel is conducted at least every three years and more often if necessary. Training on certain safe work practices ( hot work, confined space entry, etc. ) is conducted annually.\n\nThe Polybutlene process Safety Design Criteria  is based on Industry Recognized and Generally Accepted Good Engineering Practices.  Pre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSR) are conducted to verify compliance prior to startup.  PSSR is also conducted as a step in the MOC process when there is an equipment change or modification.\n\nThe Taft Plant has a formal Mechanical Integrity Management System that defines the frequency and protocol of preventive maintenance which sustains the mechanical integrity of critical process equipment such as pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, pressure relief valves, pumps, emergency shutdown systems and control systems. \n\n\nEMERGENCY PREPADREDNESS\n\nThe Shell Chemical Taft Plant has a written Emergency Response Plan which details the responsibilities of employees during emergency situations including fire, explosion, chemical release and process deviations. Each shift has  Health and Safety Star Points that are trained in the  Incident Command System and receive annual Industrial Fire Training at Delgado Fire School.    All operations and maintenance personnel attend the Industrial Fire Training at Delgado Fire School. \n\nThe plant has an emergency alarm system that is sounded in emergencies, followed by the activation of the plants emergency action plan.  Emergency drills are conducted periodically to test the response to emergencies and drills are"

Employees involved in the transport of hazardous materials receive DOT training.\n\nThe Taft Plant has written procedures on emergency preparedness for other unusual situations such as hurricanes and bomb threats.  The process has a backup system to the instrument air system. This allows a safe shutdown in the event of an electrical power failure.\n\nShell is an active participant in the St. Charles Industrial Mutual Aid Organization which supports members with equipment in case of emergency situations.\n\nCOMMUNITY SAFETY\n\nThrough active participation in the St. Charles Parish Industrial Mutual Aid organization and close work with the St.Charles Parish Emergency Preparedness Department, Shell is involved in developing and maintaining the system designed to protect the community in the event of a chemical emergency.  A network of sirens is in place to immediately alert the community of an emergency and the need to monitor radio and TV for instructions from the Department of Emergency Preparedness.  \n\nINCIDENT HISTORY\n\n40 CFR  68.42, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) requires covered industries to report a five-year accident history in the Risk Management Plan based on the following guidelines: all accidental releases from covered processes that resulted in deaths, injuries or significant property damage on site, or known off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage.  The Shell Taft Plant has had no incidents in the past five years which meet these criteria. \n\nCOMMUNITY OUTREACH\n\nThe CMA requirements for achieving Practice In Place for the Responsible Care codes of management practice (which Shell Taft Plant has achieved) involves a lot of interaction with the community.

Examples of this are participation in the Lulling Elementary School  Partners in Education Program, building a wheel chair ramp for a handicapped person in the community, painting the St. Charles Parish senior citizen hall, cleaning-up and painting the St. Charles Association for handicapped & retarded citizens,  recognizing Jr. Fire-fighters,  judging science fairs for the schools, having blood drives, and participating in the United Way Program, etc.\n\nShell Taft has given educational seminars and tours to the St. Charles Parish Advisory Panel (CAP) and its partners in education teachers.  The plant has also hosted a teacher from another parish to follow employees for several days in order to gain a better understanding of what chemical plant workers do and what the academic requirements needede to obtain jobs in the chemical industry.\n\nShell Plant management is an active participant with the St. Charles Parish Community Advisory Panel (CAP).  Typical topics of discussion at CAP meetings are emergency preparedness, environmental concerns, community health concerns and transportation safety, etc..  In addition to scheduled presentations by plant representatives and technical experts (environmental, etc.) the CAP meetings provide an open forum for community members to question plant management about their concerns relative to plant operations and to provide feedback from the community at large.  \n\nPLANT HISTORY\n\nThe Taft Plant was owned and operated by Witco Chemical Company Inc. beginning production in 1974.  December of 1977 Shell Chemical Company Inc. purchased the plant. \n\nThe Taft Plant is Shell's only Polybutylene plant in the world.  It occupies 6.5 acres of land at 473 Hwy 3142, Taft,  La., 70057.  The Taft Facility employs fourty-nine full time employees and approximately eleven  contract employees.\n\nPRODUCT INFORMATION\n\nAt Taft, we manufacture polybutene resins (PB).  There is a"

Since PB is FDA approved for food contact and serum uses, it is found in medical applications such as blood and plasma bags.  PB can also be used to make packaaging such as  cereal bags and pudding containers easier to open."
