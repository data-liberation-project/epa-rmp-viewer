The worst-case release, as defined by EPA, is the greater of the following: (1) For subtances in a vessel, the greatest amount held in a single vessel, taking into account administrative controls that limit the maximum quantityA\u00bfA\u00bfas a liquid under pressure, the owner or operator shall assume that the quantity in the vessel or pipeA\u00bfA\u00bfis released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The alternative scenario is one more likely to occur than the worst-case release scenario.  The worst-case scenario for the Waccamaw Neck Water Treatment Plant evaluated the release of 2,000 pounds of chlorine as a gas within a 10 minute time span.  The release was modeled using the EPA modeling tool RMP*Comp to dtermine the distance to toxic endpoint.  The distance to toxic endpoint is the distance the vapor cloud will travel before the maximum airborne concentration reaches a level that nearly all individuals can be exposed for up to one-hour without experiencing or developing irrevesible or other serious health effects.  For the chlorine system at the water treatment plant, the release of one-ton cylinder (2000 pounds) would travel 2.2 miles before reaching its toxic endpoint.  This distance accounts for the EPA-mandated meteorological conditions, namely Stability F, wind speed of 1.5 m/sec, highest maximum daily temperature of 116 degreesF and average humidity of 65%.  Approximately 1, 300 people, recreation areas, and commercial/industrial areas would be affected.  The Waccamaw River is an environmental receptor for the worst-case spill.  The alternative release scenario involves a vapor release from tubing failure at a rate of 10.5 pounds per minute for 60 minutes.  The release was modeled in AWWA's Compli"

The resultant distance to toxic endpoint was 0.56 miles.  Approximately 130 people, and a recreational area would be affected.  No passive mitigation has been considered at the water treatment plant.  The installation of chlorine detectors and alarms in conjuction with a trained emergency response team have prepared the Georgetown County Water and Sewer District for a chemical release.  In the event of a release, the response team can evaluate and contain the situation.  The District has on-site Chlorine Institute Emergency Repair Kits for the chlorine cylinders to aid the team in controlling the release.\r\n4.  The Georgetown County Water and Sewer District follows the EPA guidelines for Risk Management and the guidelines established by OSHA for Process Safety Management.  The two codes require the Georgetown County Water and Sewer District to evaluate the on and off site risks associated with a highly hazardous chemical and ensure that proper precautions and plans are implemented to minimize the impact of such release.  The District completed a Process Hazard Analysis to review the causes and effects of a chemical release.  To aid in the prevention of a leak, the District has established a preventative maintenance program to keep the chlorine equipment in optimum condition.  Any equipment not in proper working order is immediately evaluated for repair or replacement.  In addition to a preventative maintenance program, the District has established standard operating procedures in conjunction with the Chlorine Institute and manufacturer's recommendations.  Employees are required to follow the standard procedures at the plant, especially near a highly hazardous chemical area.  All employees are trained proir to exposure to equipment and provided refesher training at least every three years.  Chemical awareness is discuss"

      "SummaryText": "1. The Georgetown County Water and Sewer District (GCWSD) owns and operates the Waccamaw Neck Treatment Plant on Sandy Island Road in Pawleys Island, in South Carolina.  The District is committed to providing Georgetown County employees a safe working environment.  To ensure this environment, the District has established safe working practices, standard operating procedures, and accident prevention programs.  Management is dedicated to training employees on proper operating procedures, emergency reponse, and equipment use.  To prevent accidental releases of chemiclas, the District follows all applicable sections of the United States Environmental Procetion Agency (EPA) Prevention Program.  In the event of a release, the District has an in-house emergency response team.  The team is equipped with all items necessary to respond to a chlorine spill or leak.                                                                  2. The Waccamaw Neck Water Treatment Plant treats surface water from the Waccamaw River for distribution within Georgetown County.  The water treatment process begins at the raw water intake structure at the Waccamaw River.  The intake pumps surface water from the river to the head of the plant.  The water enters a flocculation and sedimentation basin before it is routed through gravity filters.  The water is treated with chlorine as it enters the plant, as settled water and as finished water for disinfection.  The chlorination system is housed in the operations building where the chlorinators, safety equipment and instrumentation are located.  The plant is equipped to use chlorine from one-ton cylinders under normal operation.  The chlroine is fed as a gas from one-ton cylinders to a chlorinator which mixes the gas with a stream of water.  The resultant chlorine solution is fed into the system at three locations.  The Waccamaw Neck Treatment Plant typically has 4 one-ton cylinders for a total of 8,000 pounds of chlorine."
