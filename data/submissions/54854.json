Senior mangement has appointed a PSM Coordinator to monitor and maintain overall compliance with both OSHA's PSM and EPA's RMP regulations.  Facility and Reguated Substances: The stationary source subject to this RMP is Cargill's further processing facility located in Albert Lea, MN.  The regulated substance that is the subject of this RMP is anhydrous ammonia used in the refrigeration system.  General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Spcific Prevention Steps: In accordance with RMP regulations, the general accidental release prevention program for this facility's ammonia refrigeration system is comprised of the following components: process safety information, process hazard analysis, operation procedures, operator training, procedures for maintaining mechanical intergrity, procedures for managing system changes, pre-start up safety review procedures, procedures for investigating release incidents, and hot work permit protocols.  This program was developed with the participation of the affected employees, and will be periodically audited for compliance as required by the RMP regulations.  In addition, the facility has in place procedures for notifying contractors and their employees of the hazards of the system.  Chemical specific prevention steps are included within the program, including engineering and administrative control designed to prevent and minimize accidental releases.  Five Year History:  In the previous five years, this facility has not had any acidental releases of ammonia which have resuted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or"

Emergency Response Program:  This facility has developed an Emergency Action Plan (EAP) which addresses accidental releases of hazardous substances and has coordinated with the Albert Lea Joint Local Emercency Planning Commission (LEPC).  The facility is included in the LEPC's community emergency response plan.  The facility is currently deemed a non responding facility under the RMP regulations and the facility's RMP, which means responders have primary responsibility for responding to accidental releases of ammonia which pose a health or safety hazard to persons or property located on site or off site.  Planned Canges to Improve Safety:  The most recent process hazard analysis was performed 7-19-2006.  The last MOC was conducted on 2/1/2009.  The facility continues to monitor and maintain its PSM/RMP program through an organized PSM team chargered to ensure all elements of the PSM/RMP program are in place.
