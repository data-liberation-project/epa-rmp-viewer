      "SummaryText": "RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n1.  Facility Description and Regulated Substance\n\nM&M/Mars, a division of Mars, Incorporated (hereinafter \"the Company\"), operates a facility in Burr Ridge, Illinois.  Premium ice cream products and other confectionary products are produced at the plant. The production of ice cream products requires the use of sophisticated refrigeration technology.  The plant utilizes anhydrous ammonia, the most widely used refrigerant in production-scale facilities that require reliable, refrigeration-based technologies.  The facility utilizes more than a threshold quantity of ammonia, as specified in the Risk Management Plan (\"RMP\") regulations adopted by the Environmental Protection Agency (\"EPA\").  \n\n2.  Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe Company is committed to the safety of all persons that work in its facilities, to the protection of the environment, to the communities which surround the facilities, and to the advancement of human health and safety.  Substantial resources were committed to the engineering and design of this facility's refrigeration system to minimize the likelihood of accidental releases and to minimize the risk to employees, the facility, the surrounding environment and the community.  This commitment is also demonstrated by the facility's comprehensive accidental release prevention program.  If a release does occur, plant personnel are trained and equipped to provide an almost instantaneous response, and when necessary, to coordinate with local emergency response teams to control and mitigate the effects of the release.\n\n3.  Offsite Consequence Analysis.  \n\nIn accordance with EPA's RMP requirements, the facility's offsite consequence analyses were developed under the hypothetical assumption that all proactive mitigation systems not be considered, regardless of the extent of the facility's control systems, the proven nature of technologies employed, and system redundancy.\n\nThe worst-cas"

The distance to the endpoint from the release extends offsite.  Public receptors are within the distance to the endpoint, but environmental receptors are not.\n\nThe facility's alternative release scenario is the failure of a 20,000 pound vessel, resulting in an airborne mixture of vapor and liquid droplets of ammonia.  The resulting distance to the endpoint extends offsite.  Public receptors are within the distance to the endpoint, but there are no environmental receptors.\n\n4.  Prevention Program\n\nThe facility complies with all applicable accident prevention rules and all applicable state and local codes and regulations.  Both the safety information and the process hazard analysis were last reviewed and updated June 1, 1999.  \n\n5.  Five Year Accident History\n\nThe facility's five year accident history is exemplary.  During this period, there has not been a release in excess of a reportable quantity or one that has caused death or serious injury, property damage or adverse environmental consequences.\n\n6.  Emergency Response Program\n\nThe facility has a written emergency response plan to respond to accidental releases of a  hazardous substance.  The plan is designed to minimize the potential for adverse effects of chemical exposure on human health through a combination of containment, control, evacuation procedures, and the use of personal protective equipment.  It further directs appropriate personnel to provide any required notifications to regulatory agencies and the public.  Employees of the facility have established and maintained a strong relationship with the Local Emergency Response Committee.\n\nA substance-specific response plan for ammonia has been developed.  To respond to emergencies, the facility's Plant Emergency Organization has been staffed, trained, and equipped to safely and effectively perform the tasks assigned to it.  As"

      "SummaryText": " appropriate, emergency management agencies, local hazardous materials teams, and private emergency response contractors can  provide primary response, support, or back-up to the facility's response team.  \n\n7.  Future Safety Plan\n\nSeveral developments and findings have resulted from the implementation of the various elements of our accidental release prevention program.  The Company is committed to constant improvement in this area.  No changes to current plans and procedures are contemplated at this time.  Regular, periodic reviews of safety and release prevention and preparedness measures are and will continue to be undertaken."
