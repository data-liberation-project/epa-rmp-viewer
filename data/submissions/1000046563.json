We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help provide for the safety of our employees and the public, as well as protection of the environment.   \r\n\r\nThe Chaco Cryogenic Plant is owned by Enterprise Field Services LLC, and is operated by Enterprise Products Operating LLC.\r\n\r\nThis document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that have been designed and implemented, including:\r\n\r\n* A description of our facility and use of substances required by EPA's RMP regulation and the processes involved.\r\n* A summary of results from our assessment of the potential offsite consequences from accidental chemical releases.\r\n* Emergency Response Programs.\r\n* General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps.\r\n* A five-year accident history for accidental releases of chemicals at the Chaco Cryogenic Plant that are regulated by EPA's RMP rule.  \r\n\r\nFacility Description\r\n\r\nThe Chaco Cryogenic Plant consists of two cryogenic gas processing trains which process gas from the surrounding gas field and remove recoverable natural gas liquids from the raw field gas.  This is accomplished by changes in the temperature and pressure of the inlet natural gas stream which causes the liquids to condense out of the natural gas stream.  The condensed NGL is treated to remove Carbon Dioxide, dehydrated and then shipped via pipeline to Mont Belvieu Texas for fractionation.  The residue gas stream is re-compressed and shipped via pipeline to distribution by others.\r\n\r\nIn our process we use the following chemicals/flammables that the EPA has identified as having the potentia"

The details of the offsite consequence analysis will not be reflected in the executive summary but rather is reflected in the data components of the RMP.  There are no receptors in the Worst Case Scenario distance, so the facility is eligible and is being registered as an RMP Program 1 facility.\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program\r\n\r\nEnterprise Chaco Plant maintains an Emergency Response Plan (ERP) in compliance with local emergency response agencies.  Chaco Plant's Emergency Shutdown System (ESD) has been designed to provide a means to rapidly shutdown the total plant and to quickly put the facility in a safe condition in order to minimize the possibility of a catastrophic occurrence.  The ESD System performs three important functions: 1) It deactivates equipment in the area 2) It blocks gas and other combustible material from entering the area 3) It vents, either automatically or manually,  the contained combustible products to a remote, safe location or flare stack.  The ESD system can be initiated manually at"

A training program has been developed in which Operations and Maintenance personnel are specifically trained in the operation of the facility, the operating procedures, maintenance procedures, and specific other regulations and policies, as well as in all areas of emergency response.  Employees are trained on, use, and apply the guidelines of our PSM program, which include all of the above-listed areas.  All of these programs come under scheduled scrutiny and critique.\r\n\r\nThere is an on-going inspection program designed to search out and find deficiencies with the process equipment prior to any incident, and to insure that equpment receives peri"
