The facility is located in Little Rock, AR and stores and distributes petroleum products such as gasoline and diesel while encompassing 41 acres with above ground storage tanks and pressure vessels.  In addition to petroleum storage, Magellan stores butane onsite for blending into gasoline which requires compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations as greater than 10,000 lbs are stored onsite.  \n\nThe regulated substance at this facility is butane and a smaller quantity of propane.  The equipment which handles butane includes six pressure vessels and associated piping.  The pressure vessel and associated piping may contain over 2,070,000 lbs of butane while the single storage tank of propane stores 77,000 lbs without taking into account any controls.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\nThe North Little Rock Terminal has a strong commitment to worker and public safety, along with resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and contractors in design, installation, operations, and maintenance procedures.  If an emergency were to occur, it is the company's policy to notify the North Little Rock LEPC and request that they respond to the emergency.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND MAINTENANCE PROGRAM\nThe regulated butane/propane storage and blending process in the facility is compliant with the fourteen (14) elements of Process Safety Management and other employee training programs, along with operating and maintenance procedures.  The process controls listed in Section 7.4e were chosen based on whether or not they were used as safeguards in the most current PHA for this facility or if they were recommende"
