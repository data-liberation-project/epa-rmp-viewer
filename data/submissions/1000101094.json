The procedures are for the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released. The procedures address notification of local emergency response agencies if a release occurs. Employees receive training in emergency procedures.  The emergency procedure is updated when necessary based on modifications made to the plant facilities.\r\n\r\nThe overall emergency procedure program for the Enterprise Harford Mills Terminal is coordinated with the Cortland County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC). This coordination includes periodic meetings of the committee, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials and industry representatives.  The Enterprise Harford Mills Terminal has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., fire department).  This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident. In addition to periodic LEPC meetings, the Enterprise Harford Mills Terminal conducts periodic emergency drills that involve the LEPC and emergency response organizations, and also provides periodic refresher training to local emergency responders regarding the hazards of regulated substances in the plant.\r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\r\n\r\nThe Harford Mills Terminal resolves all findings from PHAs, some of which result in modifications to the process.  Other recommendations for possible changes to improve safety come from periodic accident prevention program audits, incident investigations, or employee suggestions and recommendations.  The following changes are p"

      "SummaryText": "the Harford Mills Terminal facility.  As part of the Enterprise safety program, the facility utilizes procedures that are included in the Enterprise program, but may not specifically be required at non-PSM and/or RMP Program 1 facilities (e.g. Safe work practice training; safe work permitting and hot work permitting).\r\n\r\nUniversal Prevention Activities\r\n\r\nThe accident prevention program summarized previously is applied to all RMP covered processes at Harford Mills Terminal.  Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human errors.\r\n\r\nSpecialized Safety Features\r\n\r\nThe Harford Mills Terminal has safety features on many units to help contain/control a release, to quickly detect a release and reduce the consequence of a release.  The following types of safety features are used in the covered processes:\r\n\r\nRelease Detection\r\n\r\n* Hydrocarbon (hazardous gas) detectors and alarms\r\n* Flame detection equipment in the storage and loading areas\r\n* Terminal video surveillance system\r\n\r\nRelease Containment and Control\r\n\r\n* Valves to permit isolation of the process (manual or automated).\r\n* Automatic shutdown systems for specific process parameters (e.g., high pressure).\r\n* Redundant equipment and instrumentation where advisable\r\n* Storage tank internal emergency shut down and excess flow valves\r\n* Well and equipment emergency shutdown (ESD) systems.\r\n* Atmospheric relief devices\r\n\r\nRelease Mitigation\r\n\r\n* Hand-held fire extinguishers\r\n* Personnel trained in emergency response and procedures.\r\n* Personnel protective equipment (e.g., chemical protective clothing, self-contained breathing apparatus, etc.)\r\n\r\nFive Year Accident History\r\n\r\nRecords are kept for all significant accidental chemical releases that occur at our facility.  The following is a brief summary of accidental chemical releases involving materials covered under EPA's RMP rule during the past five years:\r\n\r\nThis facility"

      "SummaryText": "is on site to provide mercaptan inventory, but the amount of odorant stored at the terminal is below the threshold quantity specified in the RMP regulation. The facility also has a 12- spot railcar loading and unloading rack that can be used for the receipt or delivery of propane by pressurized tank cars, as noted above.\r\n\r\nThe LPG Storage & Loading process is regulated by Federal OSHA 29 CFR 1910.119 and 40 CFR Part 68.  We have entered the facility as an RMP Program Level 1 facility.\r\n\r\nToxics\r\n\r\nThere are no toxic materials contained on site above the threshold limits.\r\n\r\nFlammables\r\n\r\nThe Harford Mills Terminal was evaluated to determine if any regulated flammable or toxic substances exceeded the threshold quantity.  Enterprise identified the regulated substances and quantities kept on site based on facility knowledge.  Propane and ethyl mercaptan is the only listed flammable substances which are stored above the threshold quantities at the Harford Mills Terminal.\r\n\r\nOffsite Consequence Analysis Results\r\n\r\nThe offsite consequence analysis will not be reflected in the executive summary but rather is reflected in the data components.  There are flammable substances on site and no toxic substances above the threshold quantity.\r\n\r\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program\r\n\r\nThe following is a summary of the accidental release prevention program in place at Harford Mills Terminal.  The process at the facility is regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) regulation (Program 1).  Release prevention is provided through the use of written operating procedures, employee training in written procedures, including normal operation and emergency release procedures, and in the design of safety and release prevention equipment installed at the terminal site.  In addition, a written safety program designed to comply with all applicable OSHA safety performance regulations is strictly enforced at all Enterprise facilities, including"
