              "Description": "Ethyl Mercaptan\n\n\n\nSafeguards for the handling and storage of ethyl mercaptan tank cars (railcars) include:  (1) operator training and ceertification;(2) maintenance of railroad tracks;(3) monthly trackmobile inspection; (4) plant security procedures; (5) operating procedures & administrative controls; (6) plant unloading procedures including visual inspection of all related equipment and tanks.  The tank cars are maintained by the vendor(s) of this raw material.  Car design and construction must meet Federal Railraod Commisson regulations.  Railcars are also inspected by railraod authorities.\n\n\n\nThe unloading of ethyl mercaptan delivery vehicles and its storage and handling are governed by well documented operating procedures and administrative controls which limit the amount of the ethyl mercaptan held in the storage tank.  Operators are trained and certified.  \n\n\n\nThe storage tank is housed in a concrete diked area.  The tank vents via a conservation vent to a seal pont and then to an incinerator where the fumes are destroyed.  Two flare systems are used to back up the incinerator for odor control.  The tank is equipped with emergency relief devices to protect against overpressurization.  Redundant level instruments and a high level switch are used to monitor and control tank levels.  During railcar unloading, an excess flow switch in the unloading system is used to close the automatic valve if high flow is detected.  Remote emergency shut off stations close the unloading valve if activated.\n\n\n\nThe mercaptan is pumped from the storage tank to the chemical processing equipment used to produce an agricultural product.  This equipment is equipped with a high level alarm and a high level switch that is interlocked to shutdown the feed and close the automatic valve.  The reactor fumes are vented via a seal pot on their way to the incinerator for destruction.  This system is also governed by operating procedures used by certified operators.  \n\n\n\nAll changes fall under the Plant's process safety management of change procedure.  PHAs are conducted for all changes.\n\n\n\nThe entire mercaptan handling system undergoes annual maintenance and inspection, as well as, five year, venssel and piping thickness testing program and a 20 year internal inspection.  \n\n\n\n",

This compound is ethyl mercaptan and is a flammable material.  Ethyl mercaptan is used as a raw material to produce agricultural products.\n\n\n\nEthyl Mercaptan\n\nEthyl mercaptan is typically received by railroad tank car (about 180,000 pounds per car).  Up to two tank-cars may be in the receiving area on the Plant site waiting unloading into the dedicated ehtyl mercaptan storage tank.  The maximum total inventory for the two tank cars is 360,000 pounds.  Trained, plant personnel move the tank car to the unloading area using a Trackmobile when needed.  The railcar is positioned inside a concrete secondary containment system in the unloading area and is then connected to the ethyl mercaptan storage tank to unload.  \n\n\n\nThe ethyl mercaptan storage tank is located inside a concrete secondary containment system.  The mercaptan is pumped from the storage tank to the chemical processing equipment used to manufacture an agricultural product.  The total inventory for the storage tank, chemical processing equipment and pipes is about 180,000 pounds.  Transporation, unloading, and use of mercaptan are managed under plant operating procedures.\n\n\n\nThe Hannibal plant has a well-established accident prevention program.  The primary purpose of the program is to eliminate those events which have the potential to result in personal injury, property loss, and environmental or community impact.  The secondary purpose of the program is to ensure reliable and predictable operations.  The objective of the program is to eliminate all unexpected events.

The procedures are implemented using administrative, engineering and personal protective equipment controls.  The procedures receive periodic review and are revised as necessary.\n\n(2)  The training element includes job specific safety, emergency response and hazard awarness training.  Training plans are spcifically developed for various employee groups.  The frequency of the training varies within a three-year cycle depending upon the employee group and the topic.\n\n(3) The auditing activities include both internal and external audits.  Internal audits are completed using a wide range of plant resources.  Plant personnel conduct routine general inspections of plant facilities on a regular basis (e.g. daily/weekly/monthly).  Facility personnel conduct extended plant-wide audits at a minimum of three-year frequency.  These audits include safety, housekeeping, trnsportation, ergonomics, emergency systems, industrial hygiene, process safety management and mechanical integrity inspections.  Corporate and Divison staff, state and federal agencies, insurance companies, etc. conduct external audits.  \n\n(4) Process Hazard Analyses are completed for each manufacturing and related support facilities on a 5 year cycle in accordance with appliable OSHA Process Safety Management regulations.  Selected management of change activities also requires a hazard analysis.  The analyses evaluate the impact of unexpected events to both in-plant and off-plant receptors.\n\n\n\nFive year accident history:  The plant maintains records of all chemical releases.

The plan's objective is to provide a coordinated response to potential plant emergencies that could threaten employee health and safety, the local community, the environment or plant property.\n\n\n\nThe plant maintains experienced personnel who are fully trained to respond to potential emergencies arising from fires, hazardous material releases, and medical emergencies and confinded space incidents.  The various teams are equipped to respond to plant emergencies.  The plant recognizes the potential need to utilize community emergency response agencies during some emergency situations.  Therefore, plant emergency response teams work closely with members of the Palmyra, Hannibal, Quincy, and Hannibal Rural Fire Departments sharing plant response information, conducting joint training exercises, providing emergency response support to the communities for incidents not related to plant activities, and in many areas particpating in local voluntary response agencies.  \n\n\n\nThe Hannibal Plan has an effective safety program as indicated by its excellent safety performance record.  The plant has implemented effctive programs to minimize the potential for off-site releases.  At this time, there are no specific changes planned for the safety program related to the RMP activities.  The Plant's Central EHS Committee meets on a regular basis to evaluate performance and to modify and improve the Safety and Environmental program as needed."
