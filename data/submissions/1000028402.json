The AMVAC site at Hannibal, MO was formally owned and continues to be operated by BASF, The Chemical Company employees.  It is considered a Resident Tenant facility at the BASF Hannibal MO plant.  Other than formal company ownership, no other changes in operating procedures or management systems relating to the RMP for ethyl mercaptan at this site location are planned.  At this plant, we are very concerned with protecting our employees and our environment.  We are also concerned with protecting our families that live in nearby communities.\r\n\r\nWe have designed our facility to safely manage the chemicals used and produced by our production facility.  It is our policy to not only comply with all applicable federal, state, and local rules and regulations, but also to voluntarily go behyond these requirements to ensure our continued successful and safe operations.  We have developed and implemented the following to achieve our goals:\r\n\r\n*State of the art process equipment and process control design incorporating safety devices and systems needed to properly handle, store or use materials in our processes.\r\n*Well-defined and documented operating procedures and control systems\r\n*An extensive safety, health and process safety management system\r\n*Well-trained production employees coupled to a trained technical staff\r\n*An extensive preventive maintenance and equipment inspection program\r\n*Plant site access is restricted to authorized employees, management personnel, and authorized contractors\r\n\r\nIn addition to these preventative programs and as a Resident Tenant at the BASF Hannibal Site, there is a mutual aid agreement to assure the site maintains an up to date emergency response plan and trained personnel and response equipment to be prepared to respond to potential emergeices involving fire, releases of hazardous material, medical emergencies, and confined space rescue.

The secondary purpose is to communicate to the surrounding communities and area response agencies how the facility intends to respond to potential emergency situations.  The plan's objective is to provide a coordinated response to potential plant emergencies that could threaten employee health and safety, the local community, the environment or plant property.\r\n\r\nThe plant maintains experienced personnel who are fully trained to respond to potential emergencies arising from fires, hazardous material releases, and medical emergencies and confinded space incidents.  The various teams are equipped to respond to plant emergencies.  The plant recognizes the potential need to utilize community emergency response agencies during some emergency situations.  Therefore, plant emergency response teams work closely with members of the Palmyra, Hannibal, Quincy, and Hannibal Rural Fire Departments sharing plant response information, conducting joint training exercises, providing emergency response support to the communities for incidents not related to plant activities, and in many areas particpating in local voluntary response agencies.  \r\n\r\nThe Hannibal Plan has an effective safety program as indicated by its excellent safety performance record.  The plant has implemented effctive programs to minimize the potential for off-site releases.  At this time, there are no specific changes planned for the safety program related to the RMP activities.  The Plant's Central EHS Committee meets on a regular basis to evaluate performance and to modify and improve the Safety and Environmental program as needed."

This compound is ethyl mercaptan and is a flammable material.  Ethyl mercaptan is used as a raw material to produce agricultural products.\r\n\r\nEthyl Mercaptan\r\nEthyl mercaptan is typically received by railroad tank car (about 180,000 pounds per car).  Up to two tank-cars may be in the receiving area on the Plant site waiting unloading into the dedicated ehtyl mercaptan storage tank.  The maximum total inventory for the two tank cars is 360,000 pounds.  Trained, plant personnel move the tank car to the unloading area using a Trackmobile when needed.  The railcar is positioned inside a concrete secondary containment system in the unloading area and is then connected to the ethyl mercaptan storage tank to unload.  \r\n\r\nThe ethyl mercaptan storage tank is located inside a concrete secondary containment system.  The mercaptan is pumped from the storage tank to the chemical processing equipment used to manufacture an agricultural product.  The total inventory for the storage tank, chemical processing equipment and pipes is about 180,000 pounds.  Transporation, unloading, and use of mercaptan are managed under plant operating procedures.\r\n\r\nThe Hannibal plant has a well-established accident prevention program.  The primary purpose of the program is to eliminate those events which have the potential to result in personal injury, property loss, and environmental or community impact.  The secondary purpose of the program is to ensure reliable and predictable operations.  The objective of the program is to eliminate all unexpected events.

The frequency of the training varies within a three-year cycle depending upon the employee group and the topic.\r\n(3) The auditing activities include both internal and external audits.  Internal audits are completed using a wide range of plant resources.  Plant personnel conduct routine general inspections of plant facilities on a regular basis (e.g. daily/weekly/monthly).  Facility personnel conduct extended plant-wide audits at a minimum of three-year frequency.  These audits include safety, housekeeping, trnsportation, ergonomics, emergency systems, industrial hygiene, process safety management and mechanical integrity inspections.  Corporate and Divison staff, state and federal agencies, insurance companies, etc. conduct external audits.  \r\n(4) Process Hazard Analyses are completed for each manufacturing and related support facilities on a 5 year cycle in accordance with appliable OSHA Process Safety Management regulations.
