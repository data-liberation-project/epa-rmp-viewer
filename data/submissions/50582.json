      "SummaryText": "1 Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nLeprino Foods Company is strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety. This\ncommitment is inherent in its comprehensive accidental release prevention program in place that covers areas\nsuch as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the\nprocesses at our facility. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of\nregulated substances. If such a release does occur, our highly trained emergency response personnel are at\nhand to control and mitigate the effects of the release. We are also completely coordinated with the San\nJoaquin County OES and Tracy, CA Fire Department, which provide additional emergency response expertise.\n2 The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities encompass Cheese Manufacturing. The plant is located at 2401 MacArthur\nDrive in Tracy, CA. We have one RMP-regulated substance, Anhydrous Ammonia, at our facility, which is used to provide\nrefrigeration for the manufacturing of cheese. The maximum inventory of Ammonia at our facility is\napproximately 84,387 lbs.\n3 The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set\nforth by the EPA under 40 CFR part 68. The ammonia refrigeration system is also subject to the OSHA PSM\nstandard under 29 CFR 1910.119, and to EPCRA Section 302 notification requirements. The following sections\nbriefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\nProcess Safety Information\nLeprino Foods Company maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards,\noperating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducts compreh"

The methodology used to carry out these analyses is a What If/Checklist.\nThe studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process\noperations and are revalidated at a regular interval of (five years or when changes dictate). Any findings related\nto the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Leprino Foods Company\nmaintains written operating procedures. These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial\nstartup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal\nshutdown and startup after a turnaround. The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to\noperators involved in the processes.\nTraining\nLeprino Foods Company has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are\noperating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with those processes. Refresher\ntraining is provided at least every three years, and more frequently if needed. All training will be documented\nand validated by employees on the LFC Training Tracking System.\nMechanical Integrity\nLeprino Foods Company carries out documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper\noperations. Process equipment examined by these checks includes, among others, pressure vessels, storage\ntanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.\nMaintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.\nFurthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed. Any equipment deficiencies identified\nby the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\nManagement of Change\nWritten procedures are in place at Leprin"

Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee\nwhose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered\ntraining to deal with the modification.\nPre-startup Reviews\nPre-startup safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are\nconducted regularly at Leprino Foods Company. These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction,\nequipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into\noperation.\nCompliance Audits\nLeprino Foods Company conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under\nthe RMP rule are being implemented. These audits are carried out at least every 3 years and any corrective\nactions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\nIncident Investigation\nLeprino Foods Company promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a\ncatastrophic release of a regulated substance. These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation\nleading to the incident, as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.

Due to\nour stringent release prevention policies, no reportable quantity (RQ) releases have occurred.\n5 Emergency Response Plan\nLeprino Foods Company carries a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of\nhazardous materials. The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and\nmedical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as\npost-incident decontamination of affected areas.\nTo ensure proper functioning, our emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced. In\naddition, the plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within our processes that\nwould require a modified emergency response.\nThe Leprino Foods Tracy, CA facility coordinates its emergency response plan with the San Joaquin County\nLEPC and Tracy Fire Department.\n6 Planned Changes to Improve Safety\nSeveral developments and findings have resulted from the implementation of the various elements of our\naccidental release prevention program. Completion of the most recent PHA recommendations will done by March 31, 2009.\n\nNote: When estimating the Population for the Alternate Release Scenario we attempted to use the 2000 Census data in the Landview Software, however, it estimated 0 as the population and we know that to be incorrect so we provided an estimate based upon visual observation."
