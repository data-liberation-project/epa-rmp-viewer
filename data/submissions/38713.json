(Publix) Atlanta Bakery, purchased in 2003, is located at 5475 Bucknell Drive SW, Atlanta, Fulton County, Georgia.  Publix requires each facility to develop and maintain accident prevention programs and an emergency response plan appropriate to the site.  Each site is also responsible for regulatory compliance issues that apply to the site.  Publix 's corporate and division environmental and safety personnel provide assistance in training for site employees and in budgeting and procurement of safety and training services.\n\n2. Description of Stationary Source\n\nThe facility is situated on 7.22 acres at 5475 Bucknell Drive, SW in the city of Atlanta, Fulton County, Georgia.   The Atlanta Facility has an ammonia refrigeration system which exceeds the 10,000 lb. RMP threshold quantity.  The largest storage vessel is located inside the building and is capable of holding approximately 10,958 lbs. of ammonia.  \n\n3. Prevention Program\n\nThis Atlanta Bakery Facility exceeds the ammonia threshold quantity for the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard, 1910.119, and the process is therefore subject to the PSM requirements.  For RMP compliance purposes, this places the refrigeration process in the Program 3 level.  The Atlanta Bakery Facility will use its PSM program as the required Program 3 Prevention Program.  The PSM Coordinator at Publix Dacula facility serves as the PSM Coordinator for the Bakery.  In 2001, Publix appointed a PSM Coordinator at each of their ammonia refrigeration facilities. \n\nThe Atlanta Facility has a program in place to comply with the OSHA Process Safety Management Standard, 29 CFR 1910.119.  It includes a preventative maintenance plan which requires all ammonia refrigeration equipment to be periodically inspected and serviced.  This will ensure that the equipment remains in good operating condition and will minimiz"

      "SummaryText": "e the probability of accidents due to faulty equipment.  \n\nIn developing the PSM Program, the Atlanta Facility also developed written operating procedures for the refrigeration process.  These procedures cover all phases of operation and include information on safety devices.  These procedures are used to train all operators and mechanics who work on the ammonia refrigeration processes to ensure consistency of operation and minimize human error. These measures ensure that all refrigeration operators and mechanics are properly trained.  Existing safe work practices such as Lockout/Tagout and Hot Work Permit, were reviewed and updated to ensure that all non-routine work can be performed safely.\n\nOther components of the prevention program include collection and periodic review of all equipment information, including Piping & Instrumentation Diagrams (P&IDs).  The staff ensures that if equipment design deficiencies are identified that they are corrected.  These actions will ensure that the equipment meets all refrigeration industry standards and that accurate equipment information will be available when needed.\n\nTo ensure that the Atlanta Facility's refrigeration staff has the skills necessary to identify unsafe conditions, the training program includes Process Hazards Analyses, Operating Procedures, Maintenance Procedures, Emergency Response, and Safe Work Practices.  Additional PSM procedures, including Management of Change, Pre-Startup Safety Review, Compliance Audits, and Incident Investigation also ensure the continued safe operation and prompt correction of deficiencies.   The Ammonia Refrigeration Staff, with the assistance of a consultant, performed a PHA of the process in 2003, prior to Publix beginning facility operations.    The PSM Program receives full support of plant management and involvement of employees at all levels.  \n\n4.
