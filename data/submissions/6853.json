This safety commitment is demonstrated by a comprehensive accidental release prevention program, covering all areas of Plant operations, from the design and installation of equipment to the operating procedures, maintenance practices, and employee training.  Rhodia's policy is to implement appropriate controls to prevent the accidental release of regulated substances.\n\nSafety and environmental excellence is one of the values that define Rhodia's culture.  All Rhodia employees are challenged to commit themselves to safety and environmental excellence and to integrate total safety into all work practices.  Every job, activity, and routine operation at the Plant is conceived, planned, and implemented in a manner that will ensure the health and safety of all involved and comply with all local, state, and federal regulations.  Rhodia's \"Stop Work Policy\" empowers and obligates all employees and contractors to immediately stop work if there is a health, safety, or environmental concern.  At no time is any Rhodia employee, contractor, or visitor compelled to undertake any action that he or she feels may endanger anyone's health or safety.\n\nIf an unexpected release of a hazardous chemical were to occur, trained emergency response personnel are prepared to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  In addition to the emergency response team, all Plant employees are trained as hazardous material technicians requiring 40 hours of initial training and 8 hours of refresher training annually.  Rhodia's corporate nationwide Distribution Assistance Response Team (DART) is also trained and equipped to handle chemical emergencies and includes a network of experts such as toxicologists and other technical professionals who are available to assist the Plant, as well as provide informat"

The Plant has coordinated emergency response planning with the Hammond Fire Department, the Hammond Department of Environmental Management, and the East Chicago Fire Department, who provide additional emergency response expertise.\n\n2.0    THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\nSince the industrial revolution, sulfuric acid has been the most widely consumed industrial chemical.  In the late 1800's, Stauffer Chemical began producing sulfuric acid from sulfur.  When World War II caused a sulfur shortage, Stauffer pioneered technology for recycling used or \"spent\" sulfuric acid.  In the recycling process, waste acids and other sulfur derivatives are regenerated into high purity commercial grade sulfuric acid, and returned for re-use.  Refiners use sulfuric acid in the production of \"clean burning\" gasoline with less vapors, and no lead.  A single refinery can produce as much as 500 tons per day of spent sulfuric acid.  In the late 1980's, Rhone-Poulenc acquired Stauffer Chemical and became the world leader in the regeneration of spent sulfuric acid with seven U.S. plants and three in Europe.  With operations in more than 140 countries, Rhone-Poulenc is the world's seventh largest chemical and pharmaceutical company.\n\nJohn Stauffer built the Hammond Plant in 1929 to produce sulfuric acid for neighboring Shell Oil Company and other nearby industries.  In 1957, a sulfuric acid regeneration unit was built at the Hammond site.  Today, the Hammond Plant still makes sulfuric acid from spent acid and sulfur.\n\nSulfuric acid regeneration requires thermal decomposition (\"burning\") of the acid to sulfur dioxide, and remaking the acid through chemical reaction.  The sulfuric acid regeneration furnace is the ideal place to process pumpable industrial wastes for their energy value.  The waste products are destroyed and heat is produced for efficient operation of the regeneration furnace.  The facility has "

Rhodia is no longer in the sulfur dioxide and sulfur trioxide business, therefore, we do not store or transport either of these inorganic chemicals.\n\nThe Hammond Plant's primary activities encompass regeneration of sulfuric acid, as well as the thermal destruction of hazardous and nonhazardous wastes.  The only substance regulated by the Risk Management Program (RMP) for Accidental Chemical Release that may, at times, be present at the Plant in a quantity that exceeds the threshold quantity (TQ) is chloroform.  The chloroform is part of a mixture of waste organic solvents that are processed for their energy value and for thermal destruction in the industrial furnace.  These waste solvents are stored on site in low pressure tanks or tank trucks for a short period of time for testing before they are burned in the industrial furnace.  Chloroform may exceed the TQ of 20,000 pounds while in storage.  The maximum inventory of chloroform that is expected to be present in this facility is 28,600 pounds.\n\nBecause Rhodia thermally destroys mixtures of hazardous and nonhazardous industrial wastes to produce heat, many other organic compounds may be encountered.  These mixtures may contain other RMP-regulated chemicals; however, none of these chemicals is present under conditions such that its TQ is exceeded.  These other regulated chemicals may be present in the mixtures at a concentration less than one percent, possess low vapor pressures, or may not represent a serious fire hazard (e.g., NFPA1 rating below 4).  In these situations, EPA has determined that the risk posed by the substance is sufficiently low and that inclusion in the Plant's RMP is not required.  However, Rhodia's accidental release prevention and emergency response policies are applied to all of the substances handled at the Plant, whether or not they are required to be included in the RMP.\n\n3.0  WORST-CASE RELEASE AND ALTERNATIVE-R"

Historically, releases of waste solvents from storage systems most often occur from leaking pump seals or valves, leaks at piping connections, or inadvertent releases during loading or unloading activities.  While these incidents can impact employees, they seldom lead to a release of a reportable quantity or result in an off-site impact.\n\nConsistent with the RMP rule requirements, two specifically defined release scenarios (a worst-case release and an alternative release) were analyzed to determine the maximum distance to an endpoint where the chloroform concentration is 0.49 milligrams per liter (mg/l) in air, which equates to 100 parts per million, or 0.01 percent.  This endpoint represents the maximum airborne concentration below which nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to 1 hour without experiencing or developing irreversible effects or symptoms that could impair their ability to take protective action.\n\nThe release scenarios analyzed are based on the guidance contained in the USEPA's Risk Management Program Guidance for Offsite Consequence Analysis (the \"OCA Guidance\"), dated April 1999.  This guidance document includes \"lookup\" tables that relate the quantity and rate of chloroform released to the distance to the endpoint.\n\n3.1    Worst-Case Release\n\nThe worst-case release is defined by the catastrophic rupture and complete loss of the maximum contents of one of the 55,000-gallon storage tanks when it is full of the waste containing the maximum concentration of chloroform (approximately 28,600 pounds of chloroform).  The liquid waste from the tank is considered to spread instantaneously to cover the area inside the dike around the storage tanks.  The chloroform is then considered to evaporate from the surface of t"

Design, construction, and operation of the storage tanks are such that catastrophic failure is extremely remote.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario is unlikely for the following reasons:\n\n* The tank is vented to a control device to maintain the tanks at basically atmospheric pressure, so internal pressure would not be able to increase to a level great enough to rupture the tank.\n \n* Rupture of the vessel from the outside as a result of inadvertent vehicular contact is unlikely since the unit is surrounded by a 3-foot high dike.\n \n* The worst-case weather conditions which were used for the atmospheric dispersion modeling of this scenario are uncommon;\n \n* Industry standards were followed for the manufacture and quality control of the storage tanks;\n \n* Atmospheric vents limit operating pressures;\n \n* The facility has a preventive maintenance program in place to maintain the ongoing integrity of the storage tanks;\n \n* The facility has a training program designed to ensure that the process is operated by qualified personnel;\n \n* The facility has emergency response procedures which enable trained personnel to respond quickly to isolate any potential releases.\n\n3.2    Alternative-Case Release\n\nThe alternative, or \"more likely\", scenario is considered to be defined by a release of the waste solvent mixture containing chloroform due to a line break in the 1-inch pipe carrying the mixture to the industrial furnace.  The pump delivers 1,200 lbs./min. of the mixture and the release would be stopped within 15 minutes, resulting in 18,000 pounds of the mixture or 1,170 pounds of chloroform being releas"

Active mitigation3 was also considered, because it is believed that emergency responders could identify and stop the leak in less than 15 minutes.

The facility was designed and constructed in accordance with RCRA (40 CFR 264) and NFPA Standard 58, Liquefied Petroleum Gas Code, 1967 edition.  To help minimize the probability and severity of an accidental chemical release, a prevention program that satisfies the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals standard (29 CF"

The key components of the prevention program are summarized below:\n\n* Critical process safety information regarding chemical hazards, the design basis of the process, and the equipment has been developed and documented.  This information is available to all process operators and used to fully understand and safely operate the process.\n \n* An employee participation program, which includes employees from all levels of the organization and from all areas within the plant (i.e., production and maintenance) has been developed.  The employees that are most knowledgeable about the processes are best able to easily, effectively, and regularly recommend changes or improvements that enhance safety.\n \n* The performance of a formal process hazard analysis (PHA) using the \"What-if...\" technique.  A team with expertise in engineering, operations, maintenance, and safety evaluates the existing process in depth and develops recommendations to improve the safety and operability of the processes.  The PHA addresses:  (1) process hazards, (2)  previous incidents, (3) engineering and administrative controls applicable to the hazards, (4)  the consequence of control failure, (5) facility siting, (6) human factors, and (7) a qualitative evaluation of possible safety and health effects of control system failures.  The PHA generally results in multiple procedural and/or hardware recommendations to improve the safety and operation of the system.  These recommendations are then implemented in a timely manner.  The PHA is updated and revalidated every five years.\n \n* Written operating procedures (OPs) are maintained to provide the basis for proper and safe operation of the process.  The OPs include procedures for normal operation, startup, shutdown, emergency operation, and emergency shutdown.  They also describe safe operating limits for temperature and pressure, the consequences of operating outside these safe operating limits, and a description of safety "

The training content is based upon the process safety information and operating procedures.  The training program ensures that the operators understand the nature and causes of problems arising from process operations and serves to increase awareness with respect to the hazards particular to chloroform.\n \n* Documented maintenance checks are performed on process equipment to ensure proper operations and mechanical integrity.  Process equipment examined by these checks include pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls, and pumps.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n \n* Formal authorization systems (i.e., management of change procedure, pre-startup safety review) are in place to ensure that process changes or expansions are as safe as the original design and that an independent recheck, prior to start-up, confirms that the changes are consistent with the engineering design and safety requirements.  Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of the changes and offered training to deal with the modification.\n \n* Events that might (or did) cause an accidental or unexpected release of hazardous chemicals are subjected to a formal investigation.  The objective of the investigation is to correct deficiencies in such a way as to prevent recurrence.
