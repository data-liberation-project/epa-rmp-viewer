Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nWe at Material Logistics & Services are strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety. This commitment is demonstrated by our activities to prevent accidental releases from the chemical storage and handling processes at our warehouse facility. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. We coordinate with the local Fire Department and spill response contractors which provide emergency response expertise.\n\n\n\n2. The regulated substances handled in our facility's primary activities encompass the storage and handling of chemicals. We have one regulated substance present at our facility.  The substance is a mixed isomer containing 2,4 toluene diisocyanate and 2,6 toluene diisocyanate in various mixtures.  The chemical is used in the manufacturing of flexible polyurethane foams and other elastomers at customer sites. (No manufacturing or processing is done at this warehouse operation).\n\n\n\n3. The General Accident Release Prevention Program\n\nOur facility has developed and implemented a prevention program to prevent any accidental releases. This program incorporates the following elements: safety information, hazard review, operating procedures, training, maintenance, compliance audits, and incident investigation.\n\n\n\n4. The 5 Year Accident History\n\n- This site has no reportable accidents during the past 5 years.\n\n\n\n5. Emergency Response Plan\n\nThis facility has a written Emergency Action Plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials. All employees are trained on this plan and that training is documented. The Emergency Action Plan is available to all employees at all times in the workplace.\n\n\n\n6.
