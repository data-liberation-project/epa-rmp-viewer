Employees participate on Process Hazards Analysis (PHA) teams and have access to all hazard and operability (HAZOP) information and recommendations. This information along with updated Operation Manuals are available in assigned locations throughout the facility. Operation manuals are developed, updated, and reviewed by Operations personnel and the Training Department. These Operation Manuals assist employees in refresher training and Operator Recertification Programs.\n\n\n\nSafety meetings are held on a regular basis for Operations, Maintenance, Terminal, Administration, and Contract personnel. Topics chosen are relevant to respective personnel assigned duties, and general and specific information is provided as informational instruments to enhance employee participation in facility-wide safety performance.\n\n\n\nPROCESS SAFETY INFORMATION\n\n\n\nShintech keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe process operations. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information. Specific departments within Shintech are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.\n\n\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in safety data sheets.

This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, etc. This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to enhance safety features in the process.\n\n\n\nPROCESS HAZARD ANALYSIS\n\n\n\nShintech has a comprehensive PHA program to recognize and control hazards associated with the process. Within this program, the existing covered processes and potential future processes are systematically examined.\n\n\n\nShintech primarily uses the HAZOP analysis technique to perform these evaluations. HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques available. The analyses are conducted using a team of personnel who exhibit operating, maintenance, and process engineering experience and expertise. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as recommends accident prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are warranted.\n\n\n\nShintech periodically updates its PHAs of affected units. These periodic reviews will be conducted at least every five years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating. \n\n\n\nOPERATING PROCEDURES\n\n\n\nShintech maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process.

In addition, the Shintech operating procedures provide guidance on how to respond to events that result in exceeding safe operating limits for specific process or equipment parameters. The written operating procedures are readily available to operators in the process units and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\n\n\nTRAINING\n\n\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, Shintech has implemented a training program for all employees involved in operating a process. New employees receive basic training in Shintech operations. After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks. After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration, etc.) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently. In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures in order to maintain skills and knowledge at an acceptable level. \n\n\n\nCONTRACTORS\n\n\n\nShintech uses contractors to supplement its work force during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities. Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, Shintech has procedures in place to provide that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform Shintech personnel of any hazards that they find during their work. This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, (4) safe work practices, and (5) a work permit process (i.e., for hot work, confin"

Shintech personnel monitor contractor performance to evaluate the level at which contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\n\n\nPRE-STARTUP SAFETY REVIEWS\n\n\n\nShintech conducts a pre-startup safety review for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information. This review provides that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service. This review provides one additional check to corroborate that construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready. The review team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness. A review involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function.\n\n\n\nMECHANICAL INTEGRITY\n\n\n\nShintech uses established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition. The basic aspects of this program include: \n\n\n\n*Conducting training.\n\n*Developing written procedures.\n\n*Performing inspections and tests.\n\n*Correcting identified deficiencies. \n\n*Applying quality assurance measures. \n\n\n\nIn combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process equipment.

Shintech incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs. This practice assesses suitability of new equipment for its intended use and establishes that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.\n\n\n\nMANAGEMENT OF CHANGE\n\n\n\nShintech has a comprehensive system to manage process changes. This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented. Changes are reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards, and (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change. Affected chemical hazard information, process technology information, equipment information, and procedures are updated to incorporate these changes. In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided with any necessary training on the change.\n\n\n\nINCIDENT INVESTIGATION\n\n\n\nShintech will investigate incidents that resulted in, or could have reasonably resulted in, a fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury.
