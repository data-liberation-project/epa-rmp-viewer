KNC\u00bfs management philosophy goals are achieved through the implementation of the Environmental Health and Safety Management Systems, by the personal commitments of employees and contractors, and by open communication with employees, customers, neighbors, and regulators.\n\nThe purpose of this Risk Management Plan is to provide information about operations at the terminal, programs to prevent accidental chemical releases, emergency response plans in the event an accidental release should occur, the five-year accident history of the terminal and planned changes to improve safety at the terminal.\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance\n\nThe Huntington Terminal is one of many facilities owned and operated by KNC that supply anhydrous ammonia to the Midwest farming area where it is used primarily as a fertilizer. At the terminal, anhydrous ammonia is delivered by pipeline and stored until it is loaded on to trucks or railcars for distribution.  \n\nAnhydrous ammonia is the only toxic substance regulated under the Risk Management Program (RMP) that is present at the Huntington Terminal in amounts above threshold quantity.  Propane is stored at the facility; however, it is used strictly as a fuel and as such is exempt from RMP reporting.  The terminal is classified as Program Level 3 under the regulation. \n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response programs in place at the facility are part of the high standards striven for by KNC.  These high standards include:\n\n\u00b7Operating in compliance with required e"

Ongoing analysis of the potential hazards of the process, detailed training of employees, and emphasis on safety has helped avoid any serious chemical release accidents over the last 5 years.  Part of this program has also involved identifying and taking steps to avoid potential accidental chemical releases.  A few examples of the prevention features implemented at this facility include: \n\n\u00b7Minimizing the possibility that flare combustion of ammonia vapors would be interrupted by having continuous pilots.\n\u00b7Minimizing the possibility that combustion of ammonia vapors would be interrupted by having a backup generator.\n\u00b7Minimizing the possibility that combustion of ammonia vapors would be interrupted by having back up fuel (propane) for the flare.\n\u00b7Providing annual truck loading training to ensure driver safety.\n\u00b7Preventive maintenance and testing of vessels through the Mechanical Integrity program helps to ensure that structural failures do not occur in process equipment.\n\u00b7Providing emergency shutdown buttons at the truck loading area that can be activated by KNC personnel or the truck driver in case of an ammonia release.\n\u00b7Ammonia sensors in the process areas and on the property to detect ammonia and activate the Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) monitoring system if the threshold for ammonia is exceeded.\n\u00b7Monitoring level alarms and pressure in process vessels through SCADA to help prevent a release of ammoni"

The loading process was immediately shutdown by KNC personnel and the rail rack piping was isolated.  There were no injuries or deaths as a result of this incident.  Nearby businesses were evacuated as a result of this release.  The Huntington Terminal employees followed proper emergency response procedures to ensure that on-site and off-site impacts were minimized.  \n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nThe terminal will continue to conduct emergency response preparedness activities and coordinate any emergency response actions necessary for the Huntington Terminal with the Huntington City Fire Department.  Also involved in emergency response for the facility would be the Huntington County Sheriff and, as appropriate, the Memorial Hospital located in Huntington, the United REMC Utility Company and the Allen County HAZMAT Team.  The Huntington Terminal Manager is responsible for coordinating the emergency actions.  A specific Emergency Response Plan for the terminal is in place and that plan has been coordinated with local officials.
