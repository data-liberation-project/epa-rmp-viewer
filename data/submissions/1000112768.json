The Facility Policy:  The owners, management and employees of AgState facility are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia by utilization of proper equipment, regular inspections and maintenance, and training of all persons that work with the material.  Should an accidental release occur, the facility has oriented the local fire department and the local emergency planning committee so they can plan for response to any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\r\n\r\n2.  Facility Information:  The primary activity at the facility is the storage of anhydrous ammonia for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient.  \r\n\r\n3.  The worst case release scenario is not listed in the executive summary for security reasons.  The alternate case release scenario is not listed in the executive summary for security reasons.\r\n\r\n4.  The Accidental Release Program:   AgState  complies with Iowa Administrative Code Part 21, Chapter 43, Rule 43.6(200) relating to the storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia. These regulations administered by the Department of Agriculture are consistent with industry standard ANSI/CGA G-2.1-2014 (previously ANSI K61.1) and OSHA 29 CFR 1910.111 regarding the storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia.\r\n\r\n5.  The Five Year Accident History:  There has been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia for the covered process in the past five years that has resulted in offsite evacuations.  \r\n\r\n6.  The Emergency Response Program: AgState  has a written emergency action plan in accordance with OSHA Standard 29 CFR 1910.38 and provides state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III of EPCRA.  Our emergency response action plan has been reviewed with the local fire department and provided to the local"
