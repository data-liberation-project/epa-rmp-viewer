      "SummaryText": "    SouthernGate Terminal, LLC. is a wholesale distribution facility for propane and butane.  SouthernGate receives propane and butane by way of rail, unloads the products, and then provides  loading services for transport (tractor-trailer) trucks.  The facility consists of  above-ground storage tanks, a 12 spot tank-car unloading rack, and a total of 3 loading stations for trucks.\n     This facility complies with NFPA-58 requirements for LP-Gas storage, and it is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws.  If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to notify the Bear Pond Volunteer fire department and request that they respond to the emergency.\n     Our worst-case scenario is the failure of our largest tank, a 90,000-gallon tank filled to the greatest amount allowed(85% @ 60F), resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  According to EPA's look-up tables, the distance to the endpoint is 0.5mi.  The worst case scenarion could affect as many as 40 local residents.\n     This facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule and all applicable state and local codes and regulations.  The facility was designed, installed, and is maintained in accordance with NFPA-58 and state law.\n    SouthernGate Terminal, LLC. has never had an accident involving propane or butane  that caused deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage.\n     In the event of an emergency involving our  facility, it is our policy to notify the Bear Pond Volunteer fire department and request that they respond to the emergency. Members of the fire department have inspected our facility during training seminars."
