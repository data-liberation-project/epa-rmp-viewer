Staff, support all the activities and proper actions required in order to comply with the regulations of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency the Department of Transportation and the Local Fire Department.\n\n\n\nOur prevention program was developed mostly with information gathered from the different Chlorine Institute pamphlets and from our suppliers of Chlorine (Jones Chemical), and Caustic Soda (PPG). Our emergency response plan includes the participation of the Plant Operators, the Engineer in Charge, the Fire Department and the Local Civil Defense Office. All safety, heath, prevention and emergency information is available to the public in the Fire Department, Civil Defense Office and the Local Health Department. We consider that the most important element related to the accident prevention program and the emergency response plan, is the employee's knowledge of the, product-process-equipment (operational & safety), involved in this operation. We expect to accomplish this through continuous training and practice. \n\n\n\nII- The sodium hypoclorite\n\nManufacturing facility at our site, started in July 1997. Our products is registered and regulated by the EPA and the Agricultural Dept. As a pesticide. Recently it was certified by the National Standard Foundation for drinking water disinfection and can be used also for waste water disinfection. The plant location is outside-north\n\n(Road # 185) the urban zone of the city of Juncos, PR.  The manufacturing process combines the use of tanks, pumps, pipes, valves, heat exchangers, chillers and process control devices. Raw materials used are: Caustic Soda (50% liquid), and Chlorine (liquified gas) in 2000 lbs. containers.  We store some 150 lbs. Chlorine cylinders for resale. Chlorine is a toxic gas that can cause damage to human, anim"

      "SummaryText": "al and vegetation. There are always two persons in the plant when in operation. The process of manufacturing sodium hypoclorite is by the injection of chlorine to diluted caustics soda, at the required level. We store approximately 45 tons containers and 22 cylinders  (150 lbs.)  We have two chlorine sensors with alarms and the proper safety equipment available in the plant. Plant operators are well trained in the use of both process and safety equipment.\n\n\n\nIII - We used the RMP* Comp version 1.06 to determine the distance endpoint for both, Worst Case and Alternative Release Scenarios. The WCS assumes the complete failure of the largest vessel at the facility, in the case a 2,000 pounds cylinder, in 10 minutes. The release rate of 200 pounds per min. With no mitigation measures in a rural zone was used. Estimated distance to endpoint is 3.0 miles for toxic level of 0.0087 mg/L (ERPG-2).\n\nOther assumptions were: wind speed of 1.5 meters/sec., stability class - F and temperature of 77 egress F.\n\nThe estimated residential population to toxic endpoint obtained was 24,400, using the 1990 US Census.\n\nPublic receptor includes, schools, residences, hospitals, recreation, commercial, office and industrial areas.\n\nThe ARS assumes the venting of 50 lbs of excess chlorine from the top of a reactor with no migration measures in a rural zone was used. Estimated distance to toxic endpoint is 1 miles for 0.0087 mg/l (ERPG-2). Other assumptions were speed of 3 meter/sec., stability class D and a temperature of 77 degree F. The estimated residential population to toxic endpoint obtain was 1,100 using the 1990 US Census. Public receptors in both cases, environmental receptors include National Forests and Wilderness areas. \n\n\n\nIV - The most important practices in our accident release prevention program are as following: We will always use containers, hose, clamps, adapters, valves, pipes, emergency kits, wrenches, SCBA and other related equipment to handle Chlorine, that are approved"

      "SummaryText": " by the DOT, OSHA and the Chlorine Institute. - Operators will be continuously trained in the use of above equipment. There will always be two operators when chlorinating. We will keep periodic inspections and corrective actions to our containers, process control devices and operational and safety equipment. Unauthorized personnel will be restricted to the plant. Hot works are forbidden in the presence of cylinders, areas will be cleared of chlorine cylinders previous to work. No more than one ton container connected at a time. Chlorine injection rated of no more than 30 pounds per minute. Safety equipment like SCBA, type B suits and Emergency Kits will be in working conditions and available at any time. We will work in accordance with the recommendations of the Chlorine Institute. Chlorine alarm detectors to be in working conditions all the time. We monitor vessel conditions and hydrostatic compliance. V - No accidental release of chlorine have occurred since the start up of the operation 1997. \n\n\n\nV - One accidental release of chlorine occurred in February 2, s009, when an estimated 50 lbs. of excess chlorine were vented over 30 minutes from the top of a reactor tank.  The incident was reported to the NRC and produced no injuries. We have an emergency response program in place since July 1997 that includes the support from various local agencies like the Fire Dept. and the Civil Defense. We review it every year and include trainings on the use of SCBA and Chlorine Institute Emergency Kits \"A\" and \"B\". We perform drills with our own operators. We will conduct a drill every year in coordination with the local agencies starting in June 1999.\n\n\n\nEPA FACILITY ID: 100000038915 Laser Products Inc. Current 04/17/2012\n\n"
