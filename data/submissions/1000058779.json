The Crude Loading Facility loads rail cars through one loading rack, and the NGL Loading Facility loads natural gas liquid (NGL), propane and butane through another loading rack. Only the NGL Loading Facility is OSHA PSM covered and contains materials covered in the EPA RMP list of flammables.\r\nThe TRT Natural Gas Liquids (NGL) Loading Facility identified potential candidates for worst-case scenarios and utilized the services of Baker Engineering and Risk Consultants, Inc., of San Antonio, Texas to perform consequence analyses using the SafeSite computer code, which is a combination of the PHAST and Baker-Strehlow-Tang (BST) methodologies for determining the RMP worst case scenario, which is the 1 psi overpressure contour. According to the analyses, the greatest maximum end point for a 1 psi vapor cloud explosion (VCE) is 360 feet from the center of the explosion, resulting from the instantaneous release of the inventory contained in one rail car filled to the greatest amount allowed (85% of total car volume, 153,000 pounds) with butane. This worst-case release would not affect any public or environmental receptor. \r\nWithin the past five years, the Tioga Rail Terminal (the NGL Loading Facility initiated operation in July, 2014) has had no accidental release that caused offsite impacts as defined by the Risk Management Program rule (40 CFR 68.10(b)(1)). No additional measures are necessary to prevent offsite impacts from accidental releases. In the event of fire, explosion, or a release of a regulated substance from the process, entry within the distance to the specified endpoints may pose a danger to the local volunteer fire department and other emergency responders. Therefore, the local volunteer fire departmen"
