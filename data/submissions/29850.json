Are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonnia. In the event of a release, we are prepared to work with the local fire department and minimize the impact of the release on the employees, local residents, and the environment of the area.\n\nAg Service Inc. Is an ag retail business that sells fertilizer & chemicl for use in crop productionto local farmers. The primary activity at the facility is the blending of ag fertilizer for use by local farmers. Anhydrous ammonia is purchased at our plant to be used for blending into mixed grade fertilizers for crop production nutrients.\n\nThe maximum amount that can be stored at our facility is 44,000 lbs or approximately 8500 gallons of anhydrous ammnia.The maximum amount unloaded or present at our facility at any one time would be 44,000 lbs. Or one semi-trailer load of anhydrous ammonia.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of the storage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes. The maximum amount released would be 44,000 lbs. Which is 85% of our storage tank capacity. The distance to the end-point is 1.5 miles with residential population within distance at 25 people.\n\nThe most likely potential release incident would be from a break in a transfer hose. The distance to the end-point is.8 miles with residential population within distance at 12 people.\n\nWe have implemented and have posted at our anhydrous plant our emgergency response guidelines for handling of anhydrous ammonia. These guidelines include reponses in case of fire, spills or leaks, and first aid. Employees have been trained in regards to all of these emergencies. Ag Service has a written emergency action plan in accordance to OSHA standards. We also have provided the Hillsboro Fire Department and the Marion County Emergency Planning Commision with our community "
