Bayway Chemical Plant\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Response Policies\n\nThe Infineum USA L.P.Bayway Chemical Plant has had a long-standing commitment to protecting their employees, the public, and the environment. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention such as: providing comprehensive initial and refresher personnel training, considering safety in the design, installation, operation, inspection, and maintenance of our processes, and conducting drills to respond to simulated emergencies. Our objective is to implement controls to minimize the potential for releases. However, if a release occurs, our trained personnel will respond to control, contain, and mitigate the leak.\n\nWe prevent accidents using a structured safety management system entitled OIMPS, Operations Integrity Management PracticeS, and a Total Safety Culture in which all employees play a role in the prevention of incidents. Our Operations Integrity Management Systems are the cornerstone for continuous improvement in our safety-related systems.  These systems are evergreen and are in a continuous state of improvement, usually through many small improvement steps.  Some examples are the recommendations from our hazard reviews and any incident investigations.\n\nThe Bayway Chemical Plant has been recognized by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) as a VPP STAR Facility (Voluntary Protection Program - Safety Through Accountability and Recognition) for its effective safety and health management programs. Our plant has also mentored four other Linden businesses in achieving this select status.\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nThe Infineum Bayway Chemical Plant, located in Linden, N. J., operates several processes to produce additives for engine oils and transmission fluids. While the additive products are not regulated as hazardous by the EPA, some of our start"

Our regulated toxic materials are: ammonia, chlorine, hydrogen chloride, and vinyl acetate. In addition we have hydrogen sulfide and sulfur monochloride that are regulated substances under the New Jersey Toxic Catastrophe Prevention Act.\n\nHazard Assessment Results\n\nThe worst case scenario defined by the EPA for the toxic substances used at the plant is a release of a 90 ton railroad tank car of chlorine. Using the EPA modeling tool RMP Comp, this scenario would have offsite impacts. Although we have numerous layers of protection to prevent and mitigate such a release, no credit was taken for them in evaluating this scenario.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for chlorine is a leak from the railroad tank car unloading pipe. Using the EPA modeling tool RMP Comp, this would have an offsite impact. We have automatic valves that close to stop an unloading pipe leak when area leak detectors alarm or when operators signal them to close. Although these valves will limit the impact distance of a leak, the offsite distances reported in the submission take no credit for limiting the release in order to be conservative.\n\nThe worst case scenario defined by the EPA for the flammable substances used at the plant is a vapor cloud explosion (VCE) of the largest process vessel, 5100 ft3, with a 60% level of mixed butanes/butenes. The full inventory is assumed to release, completely vaporize, ignite, and cause an explosion that would have an offsite impact, using the EPA modeling tool RMP Comp. Although we have numerous controls to prevent such a release and mitigate its potential consequences, no credit was taken for them in evaluating this scenario.\n\nThe alternative flammable release scenario is a leak of mixed butanes/butenes from process piping which vaporizes, ignites, and explodes.

This system was developed by Exxon Chemical Company in 1992. Although the plant became part of a new company, Infineum, in 1999, OIMP continues to be the formal Operations integrity Program at the Bayway Chemical Plant. In 1997, Lloyd's Register Quality Assurance reviewed OIMP and evaluated it against the international standard for Environmental Management Systems (ISO 14001). After an extensive review, which included a number of Exxon facility audits, Lloyd's concluded that the \"environmental components of OIMP are consistent with the intent and meet the requirements of the ISO 14001 Environmental Management Systems Standard.\" They went on to say, \"We further believe Exxon to be among the industry leaders in the extent to which environmental management considerations have been integrated into the ongoing business process.\" \n\nThe OIMP system meets all the requirements of OSHA Process Safety Management, The EPA Risk Management Program, and the New Jersey Toxic Catastrophe Prevention Act. The system also exceeds all regulatory requirements by incorporating periodic management review of performance measurements for each practice to evaluate whether each practice is working as planned and what improvements might be made. Our plant has received OSHA VPP STAR status in 1994. This coveted recognition is given to those plants who go through a rigorous OSHA audit and demonstrate that they both meet and go beyond the regulations. OSHA has awarded VPP Star status to only 300 facilities out of over 3 million that are subject to regulation.\n\nEach of the EPA RMP areas is described in greater detail below and in the Data Element Section.

Consequently, most of the reviews conducted after this date are not reflected in the Data Element information.\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nInfineum encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention. An annual plan is developed for employee participation. This includes weekly safety meetings for operations and maintenance personnel, weekly safety audits, and meetings of the Operations Integrity Committee (OIC). Employees also participate in the development and updating of operating and maintenance procedures and conducting Process Hazard Analyses (PHA). PHA's are also reviewed by the OIC, the results are available to employees, and follow-up is stewarded by the OIC.\n\nThe OIC reports directly to the plant manager and is the final review on \"safety\" matters relating to facilities and operations.  \"Safety,\" in the current environment, encompasses a broad range of issues.  Not only is it necessary to provide for the well-being of the plant workers and equipment, but also to protect the community from any harm resulting from an in-plant incident.  The role and objectives of the OIC recognize this broader involvement.  The chairman of the OIC is the Manager of the Safety, Environmental and Risk Management (SERM) Department. OIC membership consists of representation from senior process design and technical personnel, industrial hygiene, environmental compliance, maintenance, plant operations, inspection and the plant safety coordinator.\n\nThe general objectives of the OIC are as follows:  \nHelp anticipate hazards and work with operations to avoid them. \nPromote improvements in \"safety\" matters throughout the plant.  \nHelp develop and maintain a realistic and credible plant-wide Safety, Health and Environmental policy that reflects this broader definition."

Accidents are events that resulted in personnel injury, a reportable release/discharge or equipment damage.  Incidents are events that had the potential to be an accident (near miss). The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident, or a similar one. All accident and incident reports are documented and provided to the chemical plant management for resolution. All incident and accident reports, minor or major, are reviewed by the OIC. Corrective actions taken in response to an investigation are tracked until complete. Investigation results are reviewed with employees and contractors who could be affected by the findings. Reports are retained for at least five years to be reviewed during future PHAs and PHA revalidations.\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nThe Bayway Chemical Plant periodically conducts an audit of their accident prevention program, the Operations Integrity Management Practices (OIMP), to determine whether the procedures and practices of the program are being utilized. Audits are conducted at least every three years. Audit team findings are provided to the chemical plant management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the findings are tracked until they are complete. The resolution of each finding is documented and at least the two most recent audit reports are retained.\n\nChemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe above accidental release prevention program applies to all facilities at our plant, not just those covered by the EPA RPM. Collectively these prevention programs help prevent accident scenarios that could be caused by either equipment failures or human errors.\n\nIn addition, specific features are incorporated in each process to prevent the release of regulated f"

The site maintains extensive fire-fighting equipment, a command post vehicle, two ambulances, numerous self-contained breathing systems and back-up air supplies, acid suits, rescue equipment, medical supplies, etc.  A well-equipped Chemical Plant team is trained to respond to site emergencies as well as transportation emergencies in the community as part of the CMA Chemnet/Chemtrec Programs.  The site Emergency Manual is very comprehensive.  It includes very specific procedures to deal with site-wide emergencies.  It also includes specific external notification instructions.\n\nMembers of both staffs are trained in various phases of emergency response procedures and take part in competitions to test their skills against the best in the country.  A separate staff of trained emergency medical technicians are available 24 hours/day and trained medical resources is the Medical Departmen"

Arrangements are in force with Elizabeth General Hospital to provide medical services at other hours.\nPeriodic meetings are held with the Linden Fire Department to coordinate procedures and educate LFD officers about the site.  The LFD Commander who arrives at the site for any emergency will be escorted to the scene to communicate with the Bayway Commander, give advice and render an independent judgment of the situation.\n\nThe Chem Plant Component I/Blending Shift Team Leader is in charge of any Chemical plant emergency until operations management arrives.  He has been trained to identify incidents that require agency notifications and has the authority to call out the Chem Plant Emergency Response Organization (ERO).  Assistance is available on-site from the Refinery Shift Superintendent and Refinery emergency resources, if needed.\n\nThe ERO consists of the plant management and senior staff people in Risk Management, Environmental, Technical, Medical, Industrial Hygiene, Public Affairs, Human Resources, Legal and Personnel Safety.  A manual is available to guide this group to the proper agency contacts.  It supplements the material in the site-wide Emergency Manual with additional information specific to chemical accidents.  Infineum is a member of the Linden Industrial Mutual Aid Council (LIMAC) through which it can obtain backup material in a major incident.\n\nAn on-site meteorological station is available to provide data to help evaluate the consequences of any release of a regulated substance.\n\nSpecial communication systems and procedures are in place and are periodically updated to ensure that accurate information is available to both decision-makers and the public.\n\nEmergency response teams are exercised often.
