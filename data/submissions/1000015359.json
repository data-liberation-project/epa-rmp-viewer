It is important to recognize, however, that the regulations require the identification of the potentially impacted population using a circle with a radius that is the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint. In reality, the released material would most likely take the form of a cloud or plume, impacting only a portion of the circle located in the downwind direction from the source.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe facility has an aggressive accidental release prevention program that is based upon employee training, chemical safety awareness, equipment and facility management.\n\nTraining includes both the classroom environment and observation by management to verify competency. Classes are designed to achieve maximum results within the time period and knowledge is determined by verbal and written test. Management follows a yearly schedule issuing course work on a weekly basis to the facility manager. Classes are held at the facility on a weekly basis for one to two hours. Attendance is mandatory for all employees including drivers and warehouse personnel and is verified by the Compliance Department\n\nNew employees are required to receive an extensive orientation to the operating procedures for each phase of the operation including material handling equipment, transportation vehicle loading and unloading, transportation equipment operations, liquid material transfers, personal protection, hazard recognition and safe work practices.\n\nEmployees not having worked in a process receive an introduction by thorough procedural documentation review and pairing the employee with a person familiar with the process for an unspecified period. Management, within the guidelines of the program, verifies competency of safe operating practice"

A release occurring during the loading or unloading of packages can be contained to this area.\n\nMaterials stored within buildings are located in areas specific to their hazard class to prevent one group of hazard class from impacting another during an incident.\n\nAll buildings are constructed of poured concrete floors to minimize the possibility of a release contacting the ground and impacting the environment. Equipment used in the areas to move containers is designed for their intended use.\n\nStorage areas are routinely inspected according to a schedule to minimize risks associated with improper material storage.\n\nBuildings are equipped with 24 hour monitoring systems to alert authorities of high heat smoke and fire conditions. Emergency responders are dispatched to the scene by a monitoring service. Intrusion is monitored after hours to prevent unauthorized access to the property.
