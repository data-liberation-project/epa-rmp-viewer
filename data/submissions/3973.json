Box 52\nLazbuddie, TX  79053\n(806) 965-2921\n\nFor futher information contact:  Steve Foster, President - Plant Manager\n\nRisk Management Plan - Exectutive Summary\n\n1. The Facility Policy.\n\n     The owners, management, and employees of Foster Fertilizer, Inc. are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydroyus ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire company, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the enviornment.\n\n2.  Facility Information.\n\n     - The primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers\n\n     - Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for both direct application and for blending into mixed-grade fertilizers for crop production nutrients.\n\n     - The maximum quantity stored would be 33,000 pounds in our 18,000 gallons storage tank and other 1,000 gallons nursing tanks.\n\n3.  The worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario.\n\n     The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank release as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity release would be 71 pounds, which represents the voulume of the largest storage tank at 80% capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the endpoint is 0.84 miles.\n\n4.  The Five-Year Accident History\n\n     There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that:\n          - have caused any deaths, injuries, or signficant property damage at the facitility; nor\n\n          - to our knowledge, have relsulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place,            property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n5.  The emergency response program.\n\n     - The facility has:\n\n     a. a written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.38\n\n     b. provided state a"
