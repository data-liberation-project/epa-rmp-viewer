      "SummaryText": "The Risk Management Plan for the Ocmulgee River Water Treatment Plant (WTP) minimizes the likelihood and effects of a chemical accident involving chlorine by identifying and reducing potential hazards, as well as preparing employees and responders to handle a chemical emergency.  This is accomplished by establishing a program in accorance with the EPA\"s requirements outline in 40 CFR Part 68 providing for employee and public safety.\n\nThe importance dedicated to the safe operation of the Ocmulgee plant is reflected in its record of no reportable releases or accidents involving chlorine over the past 10 years.  The continued safety of the plant's employees and  the surrounding community will be further ensured through ongoing implementation of the Risk Management Program.\n\nThe Ocmulgee River WTP, located below Jackson Lake east of Jackson, Georgia, uses chlorine to disinfect water taken from the nearby Ocmulgee River as part of the treatment process necessary to provide drinking water for Butts County.  The plant stores as much as 8,000 lbs. Of chlorine in one ton containers thtat hold 2,000 lbs. Each of liquified chlorine under pressure.  The chlorination process involves a system where chlorine gas is piped from these containers and then controlled and metered until being applied as a solution to the raw water.\n\nAtmospheric dispersion modeling was conducted, using software provided by the EPA for this purpose called RMP*Comp, to assess the potential off-site area at risk given an accidental release of chlorine from the plant were to occur.  To lessen the likelihood and mitigate the effects of a potential release of chlorine, the Ocmulgee River  WTP's Risk Management Program covers the following subjects:\n\n1.  Chlorine hazard and safety\n2.  Operating procedures for safely operating the chlorine system\n3.  Operator training on operating procedures and emergency response\n4.  Preventive maintenance\n5.  Emergency action and emergency response\n\nThe Emergency Response Pla"

      "SummaryText": "n (ERP) incorporated into this program has been coordinated with Butts County Emergency Services, Jasper County, the Jackson Fire Department, and is incorporated into the community's emergency response plan.  The ERP includes the area most likely to be at risk in the event of a chlorine release, a list of residents in this area to be notified, and instructions for establishing appropriate roadblocks.\n\nEffective emergency action and response are ensured through ongoing training concerning emergency response procedures.  Plant operators are trained on chlorine hazards, stopping chlorine leaks, and emergency procedures and equipment.\n\nThis Risk Management Program is designed so that each element may be easily maintained.  Potential hazards are mopnitored regularly, operators stay sufficiently trained, and emergency situations will be handled as efficiently as possible."
