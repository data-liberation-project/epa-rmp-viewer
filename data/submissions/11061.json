If an emergency were to occur, Unilever/DSC Logistics would coordinate with the San Joaquin County Office of Emergency Services and other agencies in San Joaquin County should they be requested to respond to an emergency.\n\nA description of your facility and the regulated substances handled. This facility warehouses consumer aerosol products in their Stockton, California warehouse containing a mixture of the following regulated substances under 112(r) stored above the threshold quantity: \n\n* Propane \n* Butane \n* Isobutane \n* Methyl Ether \n* Difluoroethane \n\nThe worst-case release scenario. The worst-case scenario is failure of one 14-ounce aerosol container (this contains 0.30 pounds of propellant). The worst-case scenario would affect a radius of 0.005 miles, which does not affect any off-site receptors.  Due to limitations of RMP*Submit, the input parameters were 1 pound and 0.01 miles.\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps. This facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule and all applicable state and local codes and regulations. \n\nFive-year accident history. No accidents involving the aerosol products stored at this facility have caused deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or shelterings-in-place at this facility.\n\nThe emergency response program. If an emergency were to occur, Unilever HPC USA would coordinate with the San Joaquin County Office of Emergency Services.  \n\nPlanned changes to improve safety. None."
