The system includes one-ton storage containers delivered by truck and feed piping downstream of the containers.  Safeguards are in place and are used throughout the system.  These were cited in the hazard review sessions and include: Administrative controls, such as operating procedures,operator inspection rounds, lockout/tagout procedures, maintenance procedures, employee training, experienced personnel, and reliable vendors.  Sensors and alarms for the presence of chlorine; and Design safeguards such as relief valves, excess flow valves and manual isolation valves.  The prevention program contains all the elements required for program level 2 processes, including safety information, hazard review, operating procedures, training, maintenance, compliance audits and incident investigations.",

This facility complies with industry-standard requirements for water treatment plants that use\nchlorine in ton containers.  The policy at this facility is to adhere to all applicable federal, state and local laws.\nIf an emergency were to occur, the policy is to notify the City of Arkansas City Fire Department and request that\nthey respond to the emergency.\n\nFacility and regulated substance\nThis facility is a water treatment plant located in the City of Arkansas City, Kansas.  The facility employs a\nseries of physical and chemical treatment operations that include: lime softening, gravity filtration, and \ndisinfection.  The covered process includes the storage, feed, and use of chlorine chemicals.  This chemical is \nused in the disinfection and chlorination process that is used to destroy pathogenic microorganisms.\n\nThe chlorine is provided through truck-delivered one-ton containers and the maximum intended inventory at the\nfacility is 6,000 pounds.\n\nAccidental release prevention program\nThe facility's prevention program complies with the corresponding sections of EPA's 40 CFR part 68 accident\nprevention program rule for program level 2 processes.  The chlorine system was designed, installed, and \nmaintained in accordance with state and local laws.  To achive and maintain this compliance, the City has in\nplace procedural and technological safeguards.  The procedural safeguards include an employee training\nprogram and operating and maintenance procedures for those employees involved in operating the covered\nprocess.  The technological safeguards include sensors, alarms, relief valves, and industry standard systems.\nAll of these serve to prevent unintended releases of chlorine, or at least minimize the effects of a release.\n\nFive year accident history\nThis facility has not had an accident i"

City employees handle incidential releases of chlorine\nand are trained and equipped to do so.\n\nThe emergency action plan includes disaster and emergency situation identification, procedures for reporting\nemergencies, notifying the public, evacuation, system shutdown, communications directory, and a \ncommunications program summary.\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety\nThe maintenance and improvement of safety is an ongoing job at this facility.  Safety training takes place\nthroughout the year.  Safety-related recommendations from employees, whether made during formal sessions\nlike the hazard review or upon observation of a potential hazard, are always considered carefully for\nimplementation.  This process is continuous and, even at times when no major process changes are\nanticipated, existing safety systems and procedures are fine-tuned as a matter of course.  Currently, the\nrecommendations made during the recent hazard review are under consideration."
