The Corporate Environmental Compliance Team administers the facility's safety and environmental policies.  The Corporate Environmental Compliance Team periodically evaluates the health and safety practices of facility employees to ensure compliance, and oversees implementation of the safety and environmental programs.  These programs include forklift safety, hazard communications, lockout/tagout, Hazardous Materials Emergency Business Plan, employee safety manuals, manufacturer's documentation, Emergency Response, as well as the Risk Management Plan.\r\n\r\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\r\n\r\nC&S - North Hatfield is located at 95 North Hatfield Road in Hatfield, Massachusetts, which is approximately 3/4 miles east of the I-90.  The area immediately surrounding the facility is rural.\r\n\r\nThe primary business of C&S is to provide refrigerated warehousing and storage for various food products.  In order to conduct operations, the facility maintains a refrigeration system containing approximately 58,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia, a regulated substance.  The refrigeration system, consisting of piping, valves, and equipment, cycles ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, and then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration for glycol chilling, dock operations, cold and freezer storage.  Typical operating conditions range from 25 psig on the low pressure side of the system to 165 psig on the high side of the system.  \r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\n\r\nIn order to operate the ammonia refrigeration system, the facility com"

The following summarizes the key compliance programs that have been implemented by C&S to prevent the accidental release of ammonia from the facility.  The Operating Procedures program ensures that the ammonia system is operated in a safe manner.  The Training program ensures that personnel fully understand how to perform their jobs in a safe manner.  The Mechanical Integrity program ensures that the ammonia system is in proper working condition based upon routine testing, inspections, and maintenance according to manufacturer's specifications and industry standards.  The Management of Change program ensures that process modifications are implemented in a safe manner.  The Pre-Startup Safety Review program ensures that adequate safety measures are in place before ammonia is introduced into a process.  The Hot Work Permit program ensures that C&S's employees and contractors perform hot work (e.g. welding) in a safe manner.  The Contractor Safety program ensures that contractors understand the hazards of ammonia and must take specified precautions to safely complete job requirements.\r\n\r\nIt is important to note that the refrigeration system has been designed with several safety features to prevent the accidental release of ammonia.  For example, the compressors are equipped with safety mechanisms that will cause the units to shut down if operating conditions exceed designated safety limits.  Also, level indicators, alarms, and switches are installed in key points within the system to monitor the supply of liquid ammonia and to ensure that a vessel is not overfilled.  The facility has also installed two ammonia sensors in the Engine Room which will alert operators in the event of an ammonia detection. An"

In the event of a release while the facility is unmanned, the off-site alarm company will notify the C&S Refrigeration Technicians.\r\n\r\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nThere have been no significant releases of ammonia at the Facility in the last five years (July 2013 - July 2008) of ammonia that exceeded the Federal Reportable Quantity of 100 pounds. In addition, there have been no injuries resulting from an ammonia release.\r\n\r\nThere was a reportable release which occurred at the facility in 2007, which is outside of the five year limit. The release was caused by a condenser fan failure which increased the pressure in the compressors and caused a relief valve to unseat. The release was an estimated 860 pounds of ammonia. A number of changes have been made under the agreement between the Department of Justice outlined in their Consent Decree, (which was approved by the EPA), over the past six years. These changes are included in the PSM and RMP.\r\n\r\nThere was a release which occurred in January 2012 that did not meet or exceed the federal reporting thresholds, nor did it result in any injuries. The incident was reported to the state of Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection (MassDEP). The release was appropriately investiagted and all necessary mechanical changes and employee training was completed.\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\r\n\r\nThe facility has an Emergency Response Plan (plan) in effect at the facility.  This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:  \r\n\r\n- save lives;\r\n- minimize and avoid injuries;\r\n- protect the environment; and\r\n- minimize property damage.\r\n\r\nThe Plan provides the notification procedures and evacuation routes for emergencies that may arise at the facility as well as detailing the training, procedures, and members of the Refrigeration Team.

In addition, three Revalidations of the Process Hazard Analysis have been conducted.  The first in October 2003, the second in October 2008 and the most recent in July of 2013.  The PHA Revalidations consisted of:\r\n\r\n- Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) study revalidation;\r\n- What-If / Checklist study (most recent);\r\n- series of safety checklists; and\r\n- facility inspections.\r\n\r\nThe mitigation measures include additional training, key maintenance-related tests/inspection, and enhanced emergency response policies and procedures.  All recommendations resultant from the most recent revalidation study are due to be completed by July 2014."
