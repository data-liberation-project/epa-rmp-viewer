      "SummaryText": "Griffith Micro Science, Inc. (GMSI) submitted the Risk Management Plan on June 18, 1999, in compliance with 40 CFR 68.  Following a detailed annual review of the plan and the facility, it was determined that the off-site consequence analysis submitted in the RMP accounted for an indoor staging area rather than the outdoor staging area that is present at the facility.  GMSI has therefore revised the plan accordingly.  GMSI has also updated the remainder of the submittal as well to account for the recent safety inspection and review, emergency response plan review, and various training activities.\n\nIntroduction\n\nFacilities that use or store more than 10,000 lbs. of ethylene oxide are required to prepare and submit a Risk Management Plan (RMP) to the US EPA.  The RMP consists of several elements, including an evaluation of potential accident scenarios and a comprehensive program to prevent accidental releases of regulated chemicals. \n\nThe RMP summarizes the management, administrative, procedural, and technological controls that work together to minimize the risk of hazardous chemical releases to the community.  The RMP includes the following information:\n? Introduction;\n? Facility identification and regulated substances;\n? Policies to protect health, environment, and safety;\n? Hazard Assessment;\n? Prevention Program;\n? Five-Year Accident History;\n? Emergency Response Plan; and\n? Planned Changes to improve safety\n\nFacility Identification and Regulated Substances\n\nGMSI operates a contract sterilization facility located Salt Lake City.  The facility is engaged in the sterilization of medical equipment and spices using ethylene oxide.  Ethylene oxide is listed as a regulated toxic substance under U.S. EPA's Risk Management Program regulations (40 CFR 68). \n\nPolicies to Protect Health, Safety and the Environment\n\nRisk management and safety are important concerns at GMSI.  This RMP formalizes and documents these activities.  GMSI is committed to conducting its operations in "

The prevention program provides a structured approach to preventing accidents. Some of the specific activities in the prevention program include:\n\n? Process safety information accessible to employees at all times.\n? A hazard review was conducted as part of the preparations for RMP compliance.\n? Computerized process controls prevent unsafe conditions in the sterilizers.\n? Written operating procedures are used for training and guiding the work of operators.\n? Training is provided to all employees that operate the system.\n? A program is in place to properly maintain the system and equipment.\n? Incidents are investigated and actions are taken as part of a continuous improvement effort.\n? Routine audits are conducted to assure that safe practices are being followed.\n? A thorough Preventative Maintenance program helps ensure equipment is in proper working condition.\n\nThe sterilization process subject to the Risk Management Program at the GMSI - Salt Lake City facility is designed with extensive safeguards to protect against the accidental release of ethylene oxide. Examples of safety equipment in place include pressure relief devices, leak detection and alarm systems, electronic interlock safety systems for sterilization chambers, and explosion proof electrical systems.  \n\nIn addition, process operators receive extensive training in the safe operation of the process, and are required to follow detailed operating procedures to help ensure safety.  GMSI also has implemented a mechanical integrity program to monitor the physical condition of process equipment, and replace or repair equipment before it fails.\n\nIn the unlikely event of a spill or release involving a hazardous ma"

      "SummaryText": "terial, GMSI has developed an emergency response plan providing procedures to be followed to minimize the potential impacts of a fire or release from the facility. \n\nHazard Evaluation\n\nUnder the EPA regulations, GMSI is required to evaluate the potential consequences of a worst case release and an alternate release scenario.  The following paragraphs provide a description of the worst case and alternate scenarios for the facility. \n\nThe RMP regulations define a worst-case release as \"?the release of the largest quantity of a regulated substance from a vessel or process line failure that results in the greatest distance to an endpoint\" (40 CFR 68.3).  The worst-case scenario for toxic gases is assumed to be the total release of the single largest container in the process over a 10 minute time period.  Thus, for the GMSI - Charlotte facility, it is assumed that 400 lbs. of ethylene oxide is release over a 10 minute time period. The ethylene oxide cylinders are maintained in a 3-walled staging area prior to use. The staging area is directly exposed to the surrounding atmosphere therefore it is assumed that the entire contents of the cylinders are release to the atmosphere.  The release rate was then calculated and the distance to endpoint was determined.\n\nAlthough GMSI recognizes the maximum potential impacts resulting from a release of ethylene oxide, it believes this scenario to be unlikely.  GMSI has implemented extensive safeguards to prevent such a release such as:  computer controls on all sterilizers, interlock alarms associated with each sterilizer, and installation of process area monitors to detect any leaks.\n\nIn accordance with the US EPA OCAG Document, the alternate scenario evaluated was assumed to consist of a leaking valve on a cylinder of ethylene oxide. The leaking valve results in a release of ethylene oxide to the inside of the building, and the vapor cloud is assumed to travel outside and downwind.  This release is assumed to result from a quarter-i"

The staging area is contained within a permanent structure, therefore a 55% mitigation factor was taken into account.  The release rate from the building to the outside atmosphere was then calculated and the distance to endpoint was determined.  This distance is beyond the facility fenceline.\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nOnly accidents occurring in the past five years meeting the following requirements must be included:\n1. The release must be from a covered process and involve a regulated substance held above its threshold quantity in the process.\n2. The release must have caused at least one of the following:\n? On-site deaths, injuries, or significant property damage; or\n? Known offsite deaths, injuries, property damage, environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place.\n\nGMSI - Salt Lake City has not had any accidental releases from the ethylene oxide process within the last five years that meet this definition.\n\nEmergency Response Plan\n\nThe RMP regulations require that \"response actions be coordinated with local emergency planning and response agencies\" (40 CFR 68.12(b)(3)).   Emergency response activities at the GMSI - Salt Lake City facility are coordinated with the Local Emergency Planning Committee and the Fire Department.\n\nDepending on the quantity and chemical involved in a \"reportable spill,\" GMSI - Salt Lake City also notifies certain local, state, and federal emergency planning and response agencies. \n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nSafety and Emergency Preparedness is a part of GMSI's activities.  Exposure risks to employees and the public have been minimized through ongoing inspections and regulatory requirements.  At this time, no further improvements have been identified.  GMSI is in the process of upgrading their safety procedures and training programs.\n\nChemical-Specific Safety\n\nE"
