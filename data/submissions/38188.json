      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\n\nDescription of Paramount Refinery\n\nParamount Petroleum Refinery (Paramount) operates a 50,000 barrels per day (BPD) petroleum refinery located at 14700 Downey Avenue, Paramount, California.  The Refinery occupies approximately 63 acres of land located in the city of Paramount in Southern California.  The site is bordered on the north by Contreras Street, on the south by Somerset Boulevard and Southern Pacific Railroad track, on the east by Lakewood Boulevard and on the west by Downey Avenue.  On the north side of the refinery, a trailer park, a shopping center, Wirtz Elementary School and single-family houses are located. On the west side, Paramount High School and a housing development are located. On the east side, there are single-family homes and mobile home development. Across the railroad tracks on the south side is an apartment complex.\n\nThe primary business of Paramount is the processing of local crude oils to finished hydrocarbon products, primarily asphalts for road construction and roofing materials. The present rated capacity of the refinery is 50,000 BPD of crude.  In its current operating mode, known as \"topping mode\", Paramount does not operate its hydroprocessing units, but sells the intermediate feedstocks that would have been processed in these units to a neighboring refinery.\n\nRegulated Substances Handled\n\nParamount processes crude oil and hence handles all the hydrocarbons that comprise crude oil.  In addition, there are hazardous substances that are utilized in or generated by the process.\n\nBased on the EPA and CalARP definitions of flammable hydrocarbons, the quantities of regulated flammable hydrocarbons in covered processing areas at the facility are as follows (expressed as quantities of normal paraffins):\nEthane: 750 lbs\nPropane: 26,000 lbs\nButane: 30,000 lbs\nPentane: 57,000 lbs\n\nThe maximum quantities of regulated hydrocarbons in covered storage areas at the facility are as follows (assuming all covered tanks are 100% fu"

In the past 5 years, Paramount has had only one accidental release of regulated substances (flammables) from covered processes in operation that caused any injuries, deaths, significant property damage, or required any evacuations.  That accident occurred in 2001 and involved the precautionary evacuation of the Albertson's grocery store on the northeast side of the refinery due to odors when one of the naphtha storage tanks overflowed; no injuries, deaths, or significant property damage were realized.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nParamount Petroleum is committed to providing a safe and healthful work environment for its employees, the surrounding community and the environment.  The prevention of accidents, injuries, fires, emergency releases and other emergency situations is of utmost importance and shall be the first priority for all persons working at the refinery.\n\nIt is anticipated that accidents, injuries and emergency situations may still occur.  The Emergency Response Plan (ERP) will provide guidelines for a coordinated emergency management system in the refinery to respond to such situations.  The Plan utilizes proven techniques of the Incident Command System.  When situations dictate, the system will utilize the combined effort from all departments, mutual aid groups and municipal agencies in order to mitigate emergency incidents in a safe, effective and timely manner.\n\nThe ERP is implemented through an Incident Command System (ICS).  The ICS has two levels of application.  Small emergencies are responded to by an Emergency Response Team (ERT) consisting of a Shift Incident Commander, Team Leader, and a team of members responsible for coordinating issues related to offsite releases, rescue, and hazardous materials spills.  \nThe Shift Incident Commander also coordinates with the Los Angeles County Fire Department (LACoFD) via telephone.\n\nFor larger emergencies an Emergency Management Team (EMT) i"

Other members of the EMT are members of the refinery senior management.  The ERT, which may have initially responded to the emergency, relinquishes incident management to the EMT when the latter assumes command and then provides support to the EMT.  The EMT Incident Commander communicates with the LACoFD and other outside agencies by telephone.\nRefinery personnel assigned to ERT or EMT responsibilities receive continued training.  The plant emergency alarm system is tested weekly.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nParamount has a tracking system for implementing recommendations that result from Process Hazard Analyses.  There is a continuing training and certification program in place.  A comprehensive seismic assessment of equipment in covered processes was performed in accordance with 1999 seismic design guidance criteria. The recommendations from that study were evaluated and addressed.  An additional seismic evaluation was conducted in 2004 for selected process equipment and to confirm conformance with revised guidelines published in 2000.\n\nAn audit of the process safety management program and risk management plan was completed in June 2002.  Findings and recommendations from that audit are being evaluated for implementation of program improvements.  The next compliance audit is scheduled for June 2005."
