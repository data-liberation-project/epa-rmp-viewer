The facility consists of a processing plant used for manufacturing, storage, and freezing of bakery products.  The facility maintains approximately 800 full time employees.\n\nProtecting the health and safety of our employees, neighbors, and the surrounding environment is our top priority.  One component of these efforts is the risk management program (RMP) that helps manage the risks involved with using hazardous substances at our facility and that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) regulation 40 CFR Part 68.\n\n1.  Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Action (?68.155(a) and ?68.155(d)):\n\nProtecting the health and safety of our employees and neighbors, and of the surrounding environment, is our top priority, and we have a comprehensive program in place to reduce risks associated with our process.\n\nHazard Assessment and Reduction - We regularly assess the risks associated with the use of anhydrous ammonia in our manufacturing processes and seek out ways in which to reduce those risks.\n\nAccident Prevention - We engineer and construct our manufacturing processes and equipment to minimize the possibility of accidental chemical releases.  We also provide our employees with extensive training in the safe operation of those processes and equipment.\n\nEmergency Action - We have developed an OSHA Emergency Action Plan.  This plan outlines specific procedures for evacuations, incident alarms and alerting.  Depending upon a given situation, the Ogden Fire Department will be called to provide emergency responders and equipment and for all fire related emergencies.  The facility has communicated the hazards of anhydrous ammonia with the Ogden Fire Department and the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  The incident commander has ultimate control of the implementation of the emergency response.\n\nOur internal emergency communications pro"

Stationary Source and Regulated Substances (?68.155(b)):\n\nRalcorp Holdings Inc. - Ogden, UT is a processing plant located at 215 North 700 West in Ogden, UT.  The facility utilizes anhydrous ammonia for refrigeration and freezing of the bakery products manufactured and stored at the facility.\n\n3.  Worst Case and Alternative Release Scenarios (?68.155(c)):\n\nRMP*Comp was utilized to calculate the worst case and alternative release scenarios for the ammonia refrigeration process.  The RMP identifies the impact to the surrounding community in Sections 2 and 3 of the plan.\n\n4. Five-Year Accident History (?68.155(e)):\n\n\n\nThere have been no reportable incidents during the past five years.  However, the facility maintains records of all incident investigation reports regardless of the amount of anhydrous ammonia released into the atmosphere.\n\n5. Emergency Action Plan and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps (?68.155(f)):\n\nWe have developed and implemented an OSHA Emergency Action Plan for anhydrous ammonia.  The plan outlines specific procedures for evacuations, incident alarms and alerting.  The emergency action plan includes procedures for:\n\na) Informing the National Response Center (NRC), LEPC, Fire Department, Police, etc. about accidental releases that could reasonably result in offsite consequences.\n\nB) Providing proper first aid and emergency medical treatment for accidental human exposure to anhydrous ammonia.\n\nWe have an Emergency Action Program that identifies the actions to be taken during an emergency, and the Plant Manager is in charge of coordinating emergency actions as the Incident Commander.

      "SummaryText": " LEPC is responsible for notifying the public, if necessary.\n\n6. Planned Changes to Improve Safety (?68.155(g)):\n\nWe constantly strive to improve the safety of our processes using recommendations developed through the prevention program and a program soliciting safety suggestions from our employees.  Based on the most recent (January 2020) Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) for anhydrous ammonia, a list of action items was developed.  The status of these action items will be monitored to ensure that implementation of the safety improvements is accomplished.  Monthly safety training is conducted for all team members at this facility, in addition PSM meetings are held to review safety and PSM program elements.\n\n2020 Update: During March 2018,  the site added another freezer system.  The new system has an anhydrous ammonia  refrigerant capacity of 8,000 lbs. The system operates independent from the facility's existing freezer system but both systems vent their pressure relief valves to one diffusion tank.  Because the relief valve piping of both systems come in proximity of each other, the systems are one process according to the OSHA and EPA definition of process.   Therefore, the two freezer systems are considered one process and the total ammonia charge in each system is added together to compare to the PSM threshold of 10,000 lbs.  Thus, the total ammonia charge of both systems onsite is 22,000 lbs. which indicates both systems must comply with the OSHA PSM and EPA RMP regulations.   The new freezer system has complied with the OSHA / RMP programs by having similar safety procedures since start-up of the system.  This includes but is not limited to, Process Safety Information, Process Hazards Analysis, Management of Change, Incident Investigation, Mechanical Integrity and Emergency Planning & Response.\n\n"
