Planned Changes to Improve Safety (\u00a768.155(g)):\r\nWe constantly strive to improve the safety of our processes using recommendations developed through the prevention program and a program soliciting safety suggestions from our employees.  Based on the most recent (January 2020) Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) for anhydrous ammonia, a list of action items was developed.  The status of these action items will be monitored to ensure that implementation of the safety improvements is accomplished.  Monthly safety training is conducted for all team members at this facility, in addition PSM meetings are held to review safety and PSM program elements.\r\n2020 Update: During March 2018,  the site added another freezer system.  The new system has an anhydrous ammonia  refrigerant capacity of 8,000 lbs. The system operates independent from the facility's existing freezer system but both systems vent their pressure relief valves to one diffusion tank.  Because the relief valve piping of both systems come in proximity of each other, the systems are one process according to the OSHA and EPA definition of process.   Therefore, the two freezer systems are considered one process and the total ammonia charge in each system is added together to compare to the PSM threshold of 10,000 lbs.  Thus, the total ammonia charge of both systems onsite is 22,000 lbs. which indicates both systems must comply with the OSHA PSM and EPA RMP regulations.   The new freezer system has complied with the OSHA / RMP programs by having similar safety procedures since start-up of the system.  This includes but is not limited to, Process Safety Information, Process Hazards Analysis, Management of Change, Incident Investigation, Mechanical Integrity and Emergency Planning & Response."
