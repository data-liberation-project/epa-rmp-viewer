The maximum quantity released would be 51,000 lbs. The distance to the end 1.8 mile\n   The alternate release scenario a 1-inch hose is used as an altternate release followed by release of\n   ammonia for 2 min. The maximum quantity released would be 2,700 lbs. The distance to the endpoint\n   is .30 miles.\n\n4. Accidental Release Prevention Program.\n\n   The facility is in compliance with the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for Storage and Handling of\n   Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\" published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc. and the \n   standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration 29 CFR 1910.11, \"Storage and\n   Handling of anhydrous ammonia.\"\n\n5.
