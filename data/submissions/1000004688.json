Employees at all levels are accountable for assuring high standards of environmental, health and safety compliance and performance. Safety, health and protection of the environment will be maintained as integral aspects of all business activities.\n\nThe Richmond site has an emergency response plan that outlines the established responsibilities in the event of an emergency. The plan identifies how the local authorities, including the fire department and local emergency planning commission (LEPC), will be notified in the event of an emergency that may have off-site consequences.\n\nThis facility manufactures, packages, and stores paints for the automotive market.  In addition, this facility manufactures the resin that is used as a raw material in the automotive paint manufacturing process.  The RMP-toxic substance, acrylonitrile, is used as a raw material in the resin process and is stored on-site in excess of the threshold quantity.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario for the toxic substance acrylonitrile was determined by EPA to be a liquid spill of the entire stored quantity.  The results were modeled using the EPA model, RMP Comp.  The scenario assumes that the total quantity of the toxic substance stored in a vessel is released into a containment area and then evaporates.  The endpoint for the toxic substance acrylonitrile was determined by EPA to be 0.076 mg/L. The release scenarios evaluated show the potential for an offsite consequence.\n\nThe release hazards associated with handling acrylonitrile at this facility are associated with spills of the liquid material.  Numerous safety systems are in place to prevent the occurrence of a release.  Practices that are in place to minimize accidental releases include task specific training, work"

      "SummaryText": "instructions, job safety analyses, industrial hygiene monitoring programs and administrative controls including use of personal protective equipment, spill containment areas and preventive maintenance schedules.\n\nA substance-specific Acrylonitrile Emergency Response Plan exists.  In addition to the above listed safeguards, the unloading and storage for this material is protected by its own fire suppression system; dedicated hard-piping; metered, top-unloading; and specific work instructions and job safety analysis.  The containment area around the acrylonitrile storage vessel has been extended to 8 feet in height, providing containment solely for the entire contents of the tank in the event of a tank rupture. Initial and annual refresher training is provided to employees who work directly with the unloading process.\n\nNo accidental releases of acrylonitrile have occurred at this location in the past five years.\n\nThe emergency response program is contained in the Richmond Emergency Contingency Plan that incorporates guidelines for an Integrated Contingency Plan or core plan.  It consists of an internal notification structure, regulatory compliance reporting requirements, emergency coordinator responsibilities, equipment lists, incident-specific control and response actions, evacuation plan, employee training, arrangements with local authorities and disaster recovery plans.\n\nThe Richmond site has also included within this submittal an analysis of its stand alone warehouse distribution facility located on-site.  The warehouse facility stores and distributes finished paint products produced at the plant as well as finished aerosol products that are produced elsewhere and shipped to this warehouse prior to redistribution.  Propane, butane, isobutane and methyl ether (i.e. propellants) are the RMP flammable substances stored in the finished aerosol containers stored on-site.  The Sherwin-Williams Company is submitting information regarding the storage of aerosol containers"

Therefore, Sherwin-Williams reserves its right to withdraw, amend or alter this portion of the plan at any time and to refrain from any future filing under this rule.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario for a flammable material was determined by EPA to be a vapor cloud explosion.  The results were modeled using an EPA model, RMP*Comp.  This scenario assumes that the total quantity of the flammable substance in the site's largest storage vessel (an aerosol container) is released into a vapor cloud, which then explodes.  The endpoint for the impact zone was determined by EPA to be an overpressure level of 1 pound per square inch (psi) from the explosion of the vapor cloud. The release scenario evaluated does not show a potential for an offsite consequence.\n\nThere has not been an accident or incident that has met the RMP criteria involving propane, butane, isobutane or methyl ether at the facility during the last five years.  Criteria for RMP reporting are accidents that have resulted in death, injury, significant property damage, evacuation, sheltering in place, or environmental damage.  The warehouse has never had a release that caused off-site injury in its entire history.\n\nThe Richmond site trains employees at both the plant and warehouse locations to handle a variety of emergencies at the site including incipient fires and minor chemical spills. The site has also made arrangements for assistance from the local fire department and other emergency responders as well as third party contractors to respond to incidents of a larger scale.\n\nThe site continually reviews and, if necessary, improves the safety programs and systems at the facility."
