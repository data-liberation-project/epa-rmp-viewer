The Facility Policy\n     The owners and management are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accident release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire company or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n2.  Facility Information\n     The primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers.\n      - Anhydrous Ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application, only during the months of May,June and July.Sales are continually declining resulting in les storage every year.\n      - The maximum quantity stored would be 44,000 lbs. in our 12,000 gallon storage tank.\n3.  Worse case scenario and alternative release scenario\n     a.  The worst case scenario would be the release of the total contents of the storage tank released as gas for 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity release would be 44,000 lbs. which represents the volume of the storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the end point (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 1.1 miles.\n     B.  The alternative release scenario is based on the most likely potential incident, which is a release from a break in a transfer hose.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is .22 miles.This type of release is highly unlikely as of periodict inspection of hoses and continual training to prevent such an accurence. \n4.  Accidental release prevention program\n     The facility has implemented the provisions of Safety Requirements for the storage and handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-611 published by the American National Standards Institute Inc. and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, storage and handling of anhydr"

Five Year Accident History\n     There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor to our knowledge have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage.\n6.  Emergency Response Program\n     The facility has:\n     A.  A written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.38\n     B.  Provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right to know information as required under SARA title 111 (EPCRA).\n     C.  A written emergency response program, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.120, including pre-emergency planning and employee training.\n     D.  A hazardous security plan.\n7.  Planning changes to improve safety\n     Safety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of the safe conditions. WHR Services are using all saftey data as before even though much less product is being used.New and upcoming saftey information is always being added to our traing as are more changes made to detur theft of product.Another drill is being set up with local fire departments to teach all involved on the hazards of Anhydrous Ammonia and how to safley handle it in an emergency. There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
