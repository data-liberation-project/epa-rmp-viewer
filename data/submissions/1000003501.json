Describe accidental release prevention and emergency response policies.\n\nGandy's Dairies, LLC recognizes management's responsibility in protecting its employees, equipment, property, and the environment.  The safety and health of all personnel and the protection of the environment are very important.  The control of accidents has been and will continue to be a basic responsibility of all personnel in the facility.\n\nThe Company has a Plant Safety Program.  The primary objective of the Plant Safety Program is to achieve maximum efficiency and safety performance.  To accomplish this goal, the Company has developed and implemented a Process Safety Management (OSHA PSM, 29 CFR 1910.119) and Risk Management program (EPA RMP 40 CFR Part 68).  Emergency Action programs have been reviewed as well.  The objective of the PSM/RMP programs are to prevent accidental releases through use of good operating procedures and mechanical integrity of the refrigeration system.  The Plant Manager is responsible for the management of the acidental release prevention and emergency action programs.\n\nB. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nGandy's Dairies, LLC operates a production facility where fluid milk products are processed, packaged, and distributed from this facility.  We do not produce ice cream at this facility, however we do receive, store, and distribute it from this facilty.  An important part of the processing and handling involves a refrigeration system to provide cooling and freezing during processing and storage at this facility.  The maximum intended inventory of the refrigerant contained in the system is 18,535 pounds.\n\nThe refrigeration system is a closed loop system whereby liquid refrigerant from the high pressure receiver located outside the building is piped in special piping to refrigeration equipment used for cooling and freezing.  During cooling and freezing, the pressure of the refrigerant is reduced so that the refrigerant can take away heat from "

      "SummaryText": "the milk cooler and cold storage rooms being cooled as well as ice cream being stored in freezer fooms.  The refrigerant returns in vapor form at a low pressure to the ammonia compressors where the vapors are compressed and piped to the condensers located outside.  Forced air and recirculated water cool and condense the vapors in the lines.  From the condensers, the refrigerant flows by gravity back to the high pressure receiver, thus completing the loop.   The refrigerant is a non-corrosive chemical; therefore, does not deteriorate the inside of vessels, lines, or valves.  It also carries a small amount of oil from the compressors.  All vessels containing refrigerant are ASME pressure rated above the maximum operating pressure.\n\nC. Description of the Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe program consists of the following elements:\n\n1. Employee Participation:  The purpose of the employee participation is improved safety for all employees.  Process Safety Management (PSM) will not be effective without the involvement of the employees and/or their representatives.  They can't be involved if they're not aware and informed.\n2. Management of Change:  Any facility or process is continually undergoing change.  Changes may be implemented to improve the efficiency of the operation, improve the operability, improve safety or to replace mechanical equipment.  The objective of this procedure is to help ensure that all changes are properly reviewed and that any hazards introduced by the implementation of the change are identified and controlled prior to placing the change in operation.\n3. Incident Investigation:  The purpose of investigating serious incidents and near-misses is to understand what happened (or could have happened) and then to prevent any recurrence of similar incidents, thereby improving the safety of the process.\n4. Hot Work Permits:  The purpose of this procedure is to ensure that Gandy's employees, contactors and company property are properly protected ag"

Contractor Requirements:  The purpose of this procedure is to help ensure that contractors and their employees are fully aware of the potential dangers involved with a system covered by Process Safety Management.  This awareness should lead to reduced risks for accidents, thus improved safety for both contractor and company employees.\n6. Pre-Startup Safety Review Guidelines:  The purpose of this review is to help ensure that certain important considerations have been addressed before refrigerant is introduced into the process.  This helps ensure that adequate safety measures are in place and are operational.\n7. Mechanical Integrity Audits:  The purpose of the program is to ensure that the componenets used to process, store and handle refrigerant are operated and maintained so that they remain absolutely leak free unless a set of conditions arise where pressure containing componenets must be vented in a controlled manner.\n8. Process Hazard Analysis:  The objective is to develop a thorough, orderly, systematic approach for identifying, evaluating, and controlling potential hazards within a process involving potentially hazardous chemicals such as refrigerant.\n9. Standard Operating Procedures:  The purpose is to develop, implement, and maintain clearly written, detailed procedures, guidelines, rules and practices for the safe operation of the refrigeration process during all operating phases.\n10. Compliance Audits:  The intent of this program is to establish a procedure to self-evaluate the effectiveness of the Process Safety Management program by identifying deficiencies and ensuring corective actions.  These audits will be conducted every 3 years.\n\nD. Five-Year Accident History\n\nWe have had one accidental release of refrigerant in the past five years due to a contractor's employee error and contractor supervisor & contractor employee failure to communicate.

This program contains precedures describing how the facility will respond to ammonia spills and other emergencies, including evacuation procedures.  The program has been coordinated with the Lubbock Fire Department.\n\nF. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nWe will continue to train on the refrigeration system.  No major changes predicted."
