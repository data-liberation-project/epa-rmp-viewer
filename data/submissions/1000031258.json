              "Description": "This Prevention Program incorporates, by this reference, the OSHA PSM program titled \"Process Safety Management Plan.\"  Jacobson Distribution Company recognizes the difference between the two programs.  That is, EPA's mandate is protection of the general public while OSHA's is protection of employee safety and health.  In other words, EPA's authority is offsite while OSHA's is onsite.  As a practical matter for our purposes the two programs dovetail well.  That is, measures described to prevent accidents that could expose employees to ammonia would also prevent a release that could have effects offsite.  Differences exist in terminology and regulatory references.  These differences are set forth in the Prevention Program document.",

This commitment is demonstrated by our activities to prevent accidental releases from the refrigeration system at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of ammonia.  If such a release were to occur, our staff is trained on the appropriate response.  In addition we have a local 3rd party contractor trained to deal with ammonia systems including the control and mitigation of the effects of a release and are coordinated with the local fire department which will provide additional emergency response expertise.\n\n\n\n2.  The Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled.\n\nThis is a cold storage facility that uses an ammonia system to provide cooling throughout the temperature controlled storage areas.  This is a level 3 process.  \n\n\n\n3.  General Accidental Release Program\n\nOur facility has developed and implemented a prevention program to prevent accidental releases.  This program incorporates the following elements:  documented regular inspections, documented operating procedures, employee training, maintenance (performed by a qualified 3rd party contractor) and compliance audits.\n\n\n\n4.  The 5 Year Accident History\n\nThis site has had no reportable accidents within the past 5 years.\n\n\n\n5.  Emergency Response Plan\n\nThis facility has a written Emergency Action Plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous material.  All employees are trained on this plan and that training is documented.  The Emergency Action Plan is available to all employees at all times in the workplace.\n\n\n\n6.  Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nInternal safety audits are done at this facility annually.  Any exceptions found are followed up with documented corrective actions which are verified by management when completed.   During the past yearAA?s audit there were no findings regar"
