This facility has a thorough emergency \ntraining program for on-site emergency responders.

There are also adequate provisions for \ncoordination with outside agencies, such as with the Springfield Fire Department in the \nevent of an emergency. \n\n*From this point in the Executive Summary, anhydrous ammonia will be synonymous with \nammonia.\n\n2.0    Process Description and Regulated Substances\n\nAt this location Kraft Foods manufactures and processes dairy products.  The SIC code \nfor the primary process at this facility is 2023.  This facility is capable of producing various \ndairy products including cheese for consumer intake.  Many areas of the plant are \nrefrigerated to preserve the dairy products. Some of these areas include coolers, chillers, \nstorage tanks and some processes.  The plant also produces some pasta products. \n\nKraft Foods has one regulated substance under 40 CFR 68, anhydrous ammonia, at this \nlocation.  Ammonia is used as a cooling agent for the refrigeration of the food products in \nthe various areas described above.\n\nThe ammonia threshold for triggering applicability to 40 CFR 68 is 10,000 pounds. The \nquantity of ammonia stored on-site is approximately 115,300 pounds. Thus, 40 CFR 68 is \napplicable to Kraft Foods in Springfield, MO.\n\n\n3.0    Worst-case and Alternative Release Scenarios\nThe ammonia refrigeration system has associated hazards that can potentially affect on-site \nemployees and the general public if there is a release from the system. Although the \nalternative release scenario is more likely, the US EPA requires one worst-case and one \nalternative release scenario be reported for each regulated chemical. Described below are \nthe associated hazards and the worst-case and alternative release scenarios for each \nregulated chemical.\n\nAmmonia \n\nAmmonia is classified as a Group 2 Refrigerant per ASHRAE Standard 34-1989.  The \ndominant characteristic of this chemical is its toxicity.  It is a self-alarming chemical by its \ndistinctive pungent odor.  Due to this odor, persons exposed to ammonia vapor will not \nvoluntarily s"

It is not \npoisonous, but it is corrosive to human tissue.  Ammonia is readily absorbed into the \nmoisture of the skin, and at high concentrations can cause severe burns.\n\nThe risks to persons in an accidental release of ammonia include:\n\n1.    Irritation of respiratory tract,\n2.    Corrosive attack of skin and other tissue,\n3.    Freezing of skin and other body tissue when contacted by liquid ammonia.\n\nBelow is a description of the release scenarios for ammonia and their off-site \nconsequences:\n\nWorst-case scenario - The largest potential release of ammonia will occur with a \none inch diameter puncture in the high pressure receiver located on the \nnorthwestern portion of the outside of the plant.  The release would occur during \nsystem pumpout.  Ammonia from the high pressure receiver during pumpout will \nrelease a total of 17,725 pounds of ammonia without any administrative controls. \nIt is assumed that all 17,725 pounds is released to the atmosphere in 10 minutes.\n\nUnder Section 68.25(c)(1), a regulated substance such as ammonia, which is \nnormally a gas at ambient temperature and handled as a liquid under pressure, shall \nbe considered to be released as a gas over a 10-minute period.  Thus, ammonia's \nphysical state in the worst-case release is a gas.\n\n The ammonia worst case scenario was modeled using SLAB (June 1990 version) \nto obtain the distance to endpoint.  The endpoint is defined by the US EPA as the \nEmergency Response Planning Guideline, Level - 2 (ERPG-2) which was \ncalculated to be 0.53 miles.  The ERPG-2 was developed by the American \nIndustrial Hygiene Association and is applicable to human exposures for up to one \nhour.  The ERPG-2 is intended to protect individuals from health threatening or \nescape impairing injury and is not generally considered fatal.\n\nSLAB is a computer model developed (1983) by Lawrence"

The model solves the conservation equations of mass, momentum, \nenergy, and species.  It can simulate continuous, finite duration, and instantaneous \nreleases.\n\nUrban dispersion coefficients (0.9 surface roughness) were used during modeling \nruns for the Springfield facility in accordance with Appendix W to Part 51- \nGuidelines on Air Quality Models Section 8.2.8.\n\n     The estimated affected residential population is 2,690 people.  The types of \naffected receptors are listed in the Data Elements section.\n\n    Alternative Release Scenario - The worst-case release is less likely to occur \n    than the following scenario:\n\n     Alternative Release Scenario Description \n\nThe alternative release scenario that meets both selection criteria is an ammonia \nrelease from the PRV on the high pressure receiver, which is, located \napproximately 200 ft from the fenceline.  The actuation of the PRV will produce a \nhorizontal jet release. There are no applicable administrative controls or passive \nmitigation associated with the PRVs.

Ammonia falls under the RMP Program 3 prevention program, which is identical \nto the OSHA PSM program.  EPA has stated that if the process is in compliance with \nOSHA PSM, it is in compliance with RMP Program 3.  Thus, Kraft's ammonia PSM has \nbeen reviewed and determined to be complete for the RMP document. \n\nThere are several aspects of the prevention program that are key:\n\n1.    The Utility Service Area design (USA) serves as an excellent safeguard for \nplant personnel because it greatly reduces the amount of ammonia piping \ninside occupied rooms.  Since most of the pipe work is out of the way of \npeople and the machinery and so there is less of a chance of an ammonia \nrelease.\n\n2.    The plant maintains good training, certification and employee awareness of \noperating procedures. \n\n3.    An electronic control monitoring system is in place for monitoring the \nentire engine room process.  \n\n5.0    Five-year Accident History\n\nThe review of this facility's accident history includes the following range of dates: June 22, \n1994 - June 21, 1999.  There have been no releases at this facility as defined in 40 CFR \nPart 68.42(a).\n\n6.0    Emergency Response Program \n\nAs mentioned earlier, this facility has developed an emergency response in which plant \nemployees are divided into various management and response teams.  There are eight in-\nplant contacts for an emergency, a list of these contacts can be found in the Emergency \nResponse Plan.  There are also back-up personnel in the event that the primary incident \nresponse personnel cannot be contacted.  The emergency response plan includes \ninformation about the frequency of employee emergency response training, as well as a \ndetailed description of the training content.  There are also specific procedures to follow in \nthe event of"

The Springfield Fire Department \nwill also be called for all fire related emergencies.  In all cases where an ambulance is \ncalled, the fire department is also called to the scene. \n\n\n7.0    Planned Changes to Improve Safety -\n\nBased on the PHA completed for ammonia, a list of action items was developed and is \nbeing monitored to determine if implementation was accomplished. The \"What-If\" method \nis used for each component of the ammonia system.  There are numerous examples of \nsafety improvements as a result of the PSA results.  These improvements include:\n\n1.    During the ammonia PHA, it was revealed that a 5 year PRV replacement \nprogram needed to be instituted to ensure their safe operation.
