The facility has three covered processes that use regulated chemicals above the applicability threshold: the organic monomer manufacturing process contains a diked allyl alcohol bulk storage tank (RMP toxic chemical); an organic peroxide manufacturing process contains a diked 2-methyl-1-butene bulk storage tank (RMP flammable chemical); and another organic peroxide manufacturing process utilizes a refrigerated building for drum storage of isopropyl chloroformate (RMP toxic chemical).\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION and EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nSenior management is committed to chemical, employee, and plant safety at our facility.  Their commitment is demonstrated by:\n\n       Maintaining a staff of onsite safety professionals to properly manage all aspects of safety;\n       Providing a dedicated Safety Trainer for monthly employee training;\n       Supporting the facility's Behavioral Based Safety Management System; \n       Requiring facility to obtain American Chemistry Council?s Responsible Care RC 14001 Certification; an Environmental, Health, Safety, and Security Management Systems that addresses various aspects of pollution prevention and process safety management;\n       Requiring facility to undergo periodic internal and third party environmental and safety compliance audits;\n       Availability of corporate health & safety professionals for consultations;\n       Encouraging active participation in both the Local Emergency Planning Commission (LEPC) and the Channel Industry Mutual Aid (CIMA) Emergency Response Association, which is the local emergency response association that would respond to an emergency at our facility.\n\nOur organic manufacturing processes are subject to the United States Department of "

The Process Safety Management Standard, which is commonly referred to as PSM, requires subject facilities to perform specific accident prevention activities.  USEPA's Risk Management Plan (RMP) also requires applicable facilities to develop an accident prevention program; RMP essentially adopted all of PSM accident prevention program requirements as RMP program requirements.  The accident prevention program requirements that Akzo Nobel has implemented include:\n\n     *   Conduct comprehensive process hazard analyses to identify potential causes of accidents\n     *   Develop and maintain detailed operating procedures for all processes\n     *   Provide comprehensive employee training on subject processes\n     *   Periodically verify, through non-destructive testing, the integrity of key process components\n     *   Develop Management of Change written procedure for reviewing proposed process changes\n     *   Conduct pre-startup reviews whenever any qualifying modification is made to the subject process\n     *   Conduct PSM and RMP compliance audits every 3 years\n     *   Conduct incident investigations whenever an incident could have resulted in a catastrophic release\n     *   Employee participation in conducting process hazards analyses\n     *   Ensuring contractors are fully trained and periodic review of their performances\n\nSeveral different management systems have been developed to ensure that chemical, employee, and plant safety and environmental protection is a top priority in everything we do.  Akzo Nobel has received accreditation from the International Standards Organization (ISO) for both a Quality Management System (ISO 9001) and an Environmental Management System (ISO 14001).  Both management systems allow for safety and environmental reviews to be performed before any requested process change can be made at our facility.\n\nAkzo Nobel Polymer Ch"
