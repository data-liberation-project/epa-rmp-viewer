The Emergency Response Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year.  This Plan will be reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations, as well as to incorporate any facility changes. \n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\n\u00bf  The Super Store Industries facility chills and stores a variety of food products in the cold storage warehouse.  The refrigeration process, consisting of piping, valves, and equipment, cycles ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration for cold storage rooms.  The process is similar to a household refrigerator in that it is a closed system with no expected emissions or leaks.\n\n\u00bf  Anhydrous Ammonia is used as the refrigerant in the refrigeration process.\n\n\u00bf  The total ammonia inventory is 18,000 pounds.  \n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nAdministrative Measures:\nThe facility operates in accordance with the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) guidelines and standards including the following:\n\n\u00bf IIAR Bulletin 107, Suggested Safety and Operating Procedures When Making Ammonia Refrigeration Tie-ins\n\u00bf IIAR Bulletin 109, Minimum Safety Criteria for a Safe Ammonia Refrigeration System\n\u00bf IIAR Bulletin 110, Startup, Inspection, and Maintenance of Ammonia Refrigeration Systems\n\u00bf IIAR, A Guide to Good Practices for the Operation of an Ammonia Refrigerat"

This program is constantly being improved to more accurately describe the prevention programs in use at the facility.\n\nBuilding Codes:\nThe facility was constructed to comply with the current edition of all applicable codes, ordinances, regulations, and requirements of the local, county, state, and national bodies having jurisdiction.  Special attention is directed to but not limited to:\n\n \u00bf AHSI/ASHRAE 15-1989 - Safety Code for Mechanical Refrigeration\n \u00bf ANSI/IIAR 2-1984 - Equipment, Design, and Installation of Ammonia Mechanical Refrigeration Systems\n \u00bf ANSI BB31.5-1983 - Refrigeration Piping\n \u00bf ASME - Pressure Vessel Code, Section IX\n \u00bf UMC - Uniform Mechanical Code\n \u00bf UFC - Uniform Fire Code\n \u00bf NFPA - Fire Protection\n \u00bf UBC - Uniform Building Code, 1991, Seismic Zone 3\n\nEngineering Measures:\nThe ammonia system uses a computer system to bring equipment on-line, off-line, control the hot gas (compressor discharge) defrosting process, manipulate solenoid valves, and monitor the system for alarms.  Ammonia sensors are used throughout the facility and are connected to the computer system.  The high pressure receiver has a solenoid actuated king valve that is closed when any of the emergency shutdown buttons are activated.\n\nThere are two remote emergency shut off buttons at the SSI facility; one at the back door of the machine room and one in the hallway near the control room.  In the event that one of these switches is activated, all refrigeration system equipment will be shutdown.  This includes the compressors, ammonia pumps, defrost hot gas regulators, and King Solenoid Valve.  The programmable controller will however, continue to read all the system sensors.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nBased on the most recent Hazard Assessment, a review into the accident history of the facility revealed that the"

All refrigeration operators are OSHA Technician Level trained (24 hours) and all supervisors are OSHA First Responder Operations Level trained (8 hours).  The Super Store Industries' Emergency Response Plan, is designed to meet the requirements for Process Safety Management, and give our employees and community the maximum protection in the event of an ammonia release.\n\nThe contents of this plan is used in the Hazardous Materials Management Plan which is filed with the San Joaquin County Office of Emergency Services, as well as to update the existing plan in the Training Program Manual. The process for developing the best possible mitigation to any release large or small is through employee participation using the Process Safety Management Committee, and any site specific documented plan previously used. \n\nThe Response Plan, includes continuously changing scenarios that are discussed during those meetings to always improve Response Safety. An Emergency Response Team, located at this facility as well as First Responders Operational Program gives Super Store Industries both defensive and offensive protection.\n\nSuper Store Industries conducts on-site emergency drills to provide training and to evaluate employee response in the event of a potential release. Fire drills can be incorporated using the scenarios that the wind may have disrupted the designated area on occasion.  \n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThe Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) and Three-Year Compliance Audit provided mitigation measures to improve safety at the Super Store Industries facility located at 16888 McKinley Avenue in Lathrop, California 95330.
