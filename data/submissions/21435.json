      "SummaryText": "The Spoetzl Brewery, located in Shiner, Texas, is a subsidiary of the Gambrinus Company Breweries.  The facility produces and bottles Shiner beer.  The ammonia refrigeration system is a utility system supporting the plant by providing space conditioning for beer/intermediates tank storage and various brewing process areas.  The system also provides cooling to generate chilled water or glycol through flooded heat exchangers which in turn supplies secondary media and/or direct product cooling.\n\nAmmonia contained within the refrigeration system is a regulated substance under both the EPA and OSHA regulations.  At the Spoetzl Brewery the maximum inventory of ammonia exceeds the regulatory threshold of 10,000 pounds.\n\nThe Spoetzel Brewery is committed to protecting the public, its employees, and the environment from any accidental releases of hazardous materials used at its facilities.  We have implemented safety, environmental protection, and risk management programs to prevent hazardous materials releases. \n\nIf there is an accidental release, we will immediately call for emergency response to minimize the effect of the release and notify the public of any actions necessary to ensure public protection, through the Shiner Fire Department.\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario\n\nThe Spoetzl Brewery has conducted an offsite consequence analysis as required by the EPA regulations, including an extremely unlikely, worst-case release scenario (i.e., total release from the single largest container over a ten minute period, assuming worst case meteorological conditions followed by an explosion of the resulting vapor cloud).  Results of this worst-case event indicate that offsite receptors would be affected. \n\nThis type of release is not considered credible from the standpoint that an event of this nature would require the catastrophic failure of the container, resulting in a sudden release of the entire contents over a ten-minute period.  The ammonia system components are designed to wit"

A more reasonable potential release scenario for emergency planning is presented in \"The alternative release scenario(s)\" section below.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario\n\nA \"credible worst-case\" scenario, formulated in accordance with USEPA guidance, was selected as the Spoetzl Brewery alternative release scenario. This scenario involves a one-inch diameter hole from a break in the high pressure liquid ammonia piping on the roof of the facility.   Results of this credible worst-case event indicate that there are some offsite receptors that would be affected.  \n\nThe results of the process hazard analysis (PHA) and the facility's operating history suggest that even this credible worst-case is extremely unlikely to occur, but it can serve as the basis for emergency planning. \n\nAccidental Release Prevention Steps\n\nThe Gambrinus Company  is committed to public safety, personnel safety, continued reliable operation and regulatory compliance.  Based on this commitment, the Plant Engineer has assumed overall responsibility for the development and implementation of the Risk Management Program.  The Plant Engineer has also clearly defined accountability and responsibility for each of the prevention program elements to meet both EPA and OSHA Process Safety Management requirements.\n\nTo ensure that a worst-case or alternative release scenario does not occur, the Spoetzl Brewery maintains a release prevention program with the primary focus of protecting the public and plant employees from the hazards associated with an accident or release involving anhydrous ammonia.
