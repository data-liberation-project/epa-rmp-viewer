The RMP-regulated process/stationary source is limited to the Butane Blending Process inclusive of a truck transport offloading station, a single pressure vessel, a pump, piping and various appurtenances.\n\nSpeedway LP Terminal is committed to operating and maintaining the Butane Blending Process in a safe, reliable and environmentally sound manner. MPLX believes that excellent performance in health, safety, and the environment goes hand-in-hand with operating reliably.\n\nSpeedway LP Terminal is designed, operated, and maintained in a manner that protects the environment, as well as the health and safety of workers, contractors, and the community. This is accomplished through programs of awareness, compliance, prevention and protection. These programs include a combination of accidental release prevention, mitigation, and emergency response planning. This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that MPLX and the Speedway LP Terminal have designed and implemented, including:\n\nA. A description of the facility and the use of RMP-regulated substances (n-Butane);\nB. An overview of the accidental release prevention programs (Program Level 3);\nC. A five-year accident history for accidental releases of RMP-regulated chemicals;\nD. An overview of the emergency response program; and\nE. An overview of planned changes to improve safety.\n\nA. STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe Butane Blending Process has been classified as Prevention Program Level 3.  No Program 1 or 2 processes, containing RMP-regulated substances in excess of their respective threshold quantities, are identified.  By virtue of the flammable effects associated with butane, it is necessary to observe certain safety preca"

Safety at the Facility depends upon the manner in which butane is handled, as well as the various safety devices incorporated into the design of the process. Furthermore, comprehensive training is provided to employees which reinforces the safety policies and procedures of Speedway LP Terminal.\n\nThe facility maintains fixed inventories of butane. Butane is received by truck (transports) and stored in one (1) storage vessel under pressure.  The butane is pumped to a metered, blending skid for direct injection into blend grade and premium unleaded gasoline lines feeding the site gasoline truck-loading rack. The process retains the capability for limited gasoline tank (batch-type) injection.  Injection quantities are controlled via the blending skid utilizing auto-sampling for volatility properties. Process safety controls include vessel multiport pressure reliefs, excess flow valves, low-melting point fusible elements, fail-safe pneumatic control valves, fill protection/shutoff, manual emergency shut-off devices, line thermal/hydrostatic (pressure) reliefs, and grounding/bonding interlock devices.  The process is also monitored remotely \"24/7\".  Access to Speedway LP Terminal is restricted to authorized employees, management personnel and authorized contractors/visitors.\n\nB. GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION MEASURES\n\nThe Speedway accidental release prevention and emergency planning/response programs help MPLX effectively manage the hazards posed by hazardous substances to its employees, the public, and the environment. The covered process is regulated by the EPA RMP regulation in 40 CFR Part 68, as well as the OSHA Process Safety Management standard 29CFR 1910.119.

The company and its employees are committed to the standards required by these management programs. In addition to the above elements, Speedway LP Terminal utilizes specific prevention measures that are employed as part of its operating procedures along with engineering/administrative controls to help quickly detect, contain/control, and reduce the consequences of a release. These are briefly summarized as follows:\n\nGeneral Risk Reduction and Safety Measures\n\n-Engineering and construction in accordance with recognized industry and corporate standards (ex. NFPA 58);\n-Equipment properly designed with protection from overpressure (pressure safety relief valves, etc.);\n-Updated technical drawings, Piping & Instrumentation Diagrams and Process/Block Flow Diagrams;\n-Operating systems monitored and controlled by trained Operators (including \"24/7\" emergency shutdown capabilities);\n-Redundant control systems with UPS;\n-Automatic and manual shutdown devices for critical systems;\n-Scheduled inspection and testing of instruments, analyzers, safety devices, and other critical equipment;\n-Controlled facility access;\n-Regular safety meetings and safety awareness programs;\n-Routinely scheduled safety compliance inspections and audits; and \n-Frequent process surveillance by site operations.\n\nGeneral Release Mi"

In addition to the presence of appropriate release prevention controls, to prevent possible releases of butane, a Facility Response Plan (FRP or \"Smart Plan\") is in place with facility and response activities being coordinated with the Speedway Fire Department and Marion County/Indianapolis Department of Public Safety.  Note that the Speedway LP Terminal is identified as a \"non-responding stationary source\" utilizing municipal 1st Responders for non-incipient stage fires and releases which cannot be handled within the scope of the site HazCom program.\n\nC. FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nSpeedway LP Terminal has an excellent record of accident prevention. The terminal maintains records for all accidental chemical releases that occur at this facility.

Coordination events and notification exercises with members of local emergency response organizations are held every calendar year. These site tours, training and drills enable the public emergency responders to become familiar with butane hazards, equipment, resources and personnel in the terminal.\n\nE. PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nIn an effort to improve and promote system safety, the Speedway LP Terminal solicits employee input on process safety improvement ideas as documented in the MPLX Employee Participation Program.  All process safety events (as defined in API 754) are electronically recorded, reviewed and investigated.  The investigation may include a root-cause analysis (ex. TapRooT) per corporate policy depending on the nature and/or severity of the incident.  MPLX also continually communicates with the process business partner to improve RMP program implementation."
