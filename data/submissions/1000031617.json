This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Devon's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, facility trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release. \n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nNatural gas (methane) and associated condensate (pentane) is collected from the surrounding field and where the condensate is separated and sent to eventually be sold for domestic consumption. This gas contains impurities and must be brought into specification before residue companies will purchase this gas. \n\n\n\nGeneral Accident Release Prevention and Program Information\n\n\n\nSkillern No. 1 is regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) risk management program (RMP).  Skillern No. 1 is not considered to be a PSM facility.  Skillern No. 1 is classified as a \"normally unoccupied remote facility\" as per the definition found in 29 CFR 1910.119(b) and thus is not applicable to PSM requirements according to 29 CFR 1910.119(a)(2)(iii).  However, should this status change, Skillern No. 1 must be re-evaluated for PSM applicability.      \n\n\n\nDevon Energy encourages employees to participate in safety and accident prevention.  Employees have access to facility accident prevention program.  \n\n\n\nDevon Energy keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.  These documents will be located at the Carthage field office and address chemical properties and associated hazards.  \n\n\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment conside"

These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  These procedures are periodically reviewed.  \n\n\n\nDevon personnel are properly trained according to the facility operating procedures for process operations. Skillern No. 1 has implemented a training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  New employees receive basic training in facility operations.
