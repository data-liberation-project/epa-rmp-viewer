The Risk Management Program contains twelve elements in the prevention program.  Each element within this program will be tied together with the management system to ensure development, implementation and integration of the risk management program requirements.\n\nThese twelve elements consist of the following:\n\nProcess Safety Management, Process Hazard Analysis, \nOperating Procedures, Training, Mechanical Integrity,\nManagement of Change, Pre-Startup Review, Compliance Audits,\nIncident Investigation, Employee Participation, Hot Work Permit, and Contractors.\n\nThe Reddy facility is committed to operating a safe and compliant facility for the protection of its employees, the general public, and the environment.  The facility has multiple safeguards pertinent to the ammonia process.  These include an ammonia detection and alarm system, exhaust purge fans, sprinkler system, common sumps, floor drains, controls which shut down the compressors if operating limits are violated, and the capability of shutting the entire system down if required.  Administrative controls are in place which limit the utilization of vessels at approximately 50% of their intended capacities.\n\nThe company has developed an emergency response and action plan which includes notification of emergency authorities/agencies and the public, to evacuation and first responder duties.",

      "SummaryText": "\nThe Reddy Ice Austin facility located in Austin, Texas manufactures ice for wholesale/retail distribution.  The facility utilizes approximately 15,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant for ice manufacturing and storage.  The facility is a newly constructed, state-of-the-art ice manufacturing facility, beginning operations in June, 1999.\n\nThe Reddy Austin facility refrigeration system is a standard refrigeration design using anhydrous ammonia as its refrigerant.  The system has four compressors, two operating at -30 F and two operating at +10 F.  Each of the compressors has numerous protective controls (motor overload, high discharge temperature, high discharge pressure, low suction pressure, and low oil pressure) that will shut down the compressor if operating limits are violated.  The compressors are normally run and shut down through the computer.\n\nThe compressors receive anhydrous ammonia gas from one of two refrigerant recirculators (PRR1 and PRR2), compress it, and discharge the hot, high pressure ammonia through oil separators to three condensers located on the roof of the facility.  The evaporative condensers transfer the ammonia's heat to the atmosphere and return the condensed (liquid) ammonia to the high pressure receiver (V2). High pressure liquid ammonia is then transferred through a Phillips float to a controlled pressure receiver (V1).  Form V1 the low-pressure liquid ammonia is transferred to recirculators PRR1 and PRR2.  PRR1 pumps low pressure, low temperature liquid to the ice makers (IM1 through IM5).  PRR2 pumps to the refrigeration units AU4 through AU 12.\n\nAn outside supplier will deliver anhydrous ammonia to replenish the ammonia in the system, as required.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia, when properly used, has proven to be a safe and reliable refrigerant.  The sharp odor of ammonia provides its own warning agent.  Practically all accidents involving anhydrous ammonia are the result of a lack of knowledge, misunderstanding, carelessness or po"

A single person has been identified that has overall responsibility for developing, implementing and integrating the risk management program requirements.\n\nThere may be different levels of responsibility assigned, depending on the size and complexity of the facility.  A Risk Management Coordinator may be responsible for developing and implementing the overall risk management program, while other personnel may be responsible for developing and implementing the operating procedures element or developing a particular operating procedure.  The management system is, therefore, operating at each of these levels depending on the way these responsibilities are carried out.\n\nThe Risk Management Coordinator is responsible for all aspects of the development and update of the overall Risk Management Program.

For process safety to be a constant priority, the facility will remain committed to every element of the risk management program.\n\nTo maintain an integrated approach to managing risks, each RMP rule element will be implemented on an ongoing, daily basis and become a part of the way the facility operates.\n\nRisk Management Coordinator:    Robert Martinez\nTitle:    Assistant Plant Manager\nAdditional Responsible Personnel:    None at this time.\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT\n\nAs required by Risk Management Program regulations, the Reddy Ice Austin facility has conducted offsite consequence analyses relative to the potential accidental release of anhydrous ammonia.  The scenarios related to a worst case release scenario and an alternative release scenario.  This involved calculating worst case and alternative scenarios utilizing the RMP*Comp modeling program.\n\nThe facility considered worst case release scenarios relating to the receiver within the enclosed ammonia system, as it would house the largest mass of a regulated substance at any given time. The release model considered the potential release of 5,000 pounds of liquid ammonia from the vessel, during a 10 minute release.  The scenario endpoint was 1.2 mile.  This scenario generated a toxic endpoint of 200 ppm, the maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed nearly all individuals can be exposed "

However, if there is a potential loss of ammonia it would be due to a possible loss from a relief valve within the system.  The predicted release would consist of less than 100 pounds of ammonia released over a 2 minute period.  If the release were inside the facility building there would be no offsite consequence.  A potential relief valve release outside the building would have a potential 200 ppm endpoint of 0.1 mile."
