The facility is inspected yearly by what we consider two valuable indenties. These are the NC department of Enviromental Health, Public Water section and NC League of Municipalities. We fell that working closely with these agencies has provided us with the necessary information to continuously adhere to all appilicable federal and state regulations pertaining to chlorine C12. Our training involves local emergency agencies and it is a written policy of PSM of this facility to notify the Shelby Fire Department of any release in order for them to respond and investigate.                                                                                                                                                      FACILITY DESCRIPTION AND REGULSTED SUSTANCES HANDLED: THE Shelby Water Tratyment facility has the capability of trating 12 million-gallons a day of water which is fed by the Broad River.The regulated substance on site for water tratment pirposes is Chlorine C12 which is used as a disinfectant in water.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              WORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO: Our worst-case scenario is based on a liquid spill and vaporization of a one ton cyclinder filled with 2,000 pounds of chrlorine resulting in the total release of the entire cylinder product over a ten-minute period at a approximately 1.5m/csec wind speed. According to the EPA's OCA Guidance Reference tables, the distance to the end point is 1.33 miles of urban terrian."

      "SummaryText": "This release has the potential to spread in an area containing 2 schools, 3 convalescent centers, a 261 - bed unit hospital, and a prison annex facility. The projected population of the effected area is approximately 2,00 people. However, because of written procedures that comply with OSHA PSM standards and their enforcement along with training on such procedures and scenarios, a release of this magitude is highly unlikly. Also items in place such as leak detectors for the detection of product less than 1 part per million and a vacuum system that stops the flow of gass immediately if there is a breach in the chlorine feed lines are benefits to employee and citizens safety.  Employee's attitude toward safety and the understanding of the effects of such a release plays a major role in the prevention of such an event.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO: The alternative  scenario is based on a pipe leak with the release of 17 pounds of chlorine over a 60 minute period with the wind speed of approximatewly 1.5m/sec. According to EPA's OCA Guidance Reference tables, the distance to the end point is projected to be 0.90 miles. This has the potiential to spred in an area containing 2 convalescent centers, 1 school and an area residents effecting approxiately 800 in population. Due to enforced written procedures and poloicies and checklists that comply with OSHA PSM standard and state and federal guidelines a scenario to this effect is extremely unlikely. Detection systems and automatic shutdown devices in vital areas are other supports for this scenario being improbable."

PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY: Since iit started operating in 1953 the City of Shelby Water Tratment Plant has had several renovations to the facility to upgrade the safety of its operation. Recent renovations have brought with it a generator capable of providing power to the entire plant during emergencies. Also a new vacuum chlorinator has been installed that automatically stops the flow of chlorine gas if the vacuum is breached. This facility has a good working  and training relationship with the Shelby Police and Fire Departments along with the Local Emergency Planning committee. With technology constantly  changing the City fShelby will progressively continue to budget ways to improve ways to improve the safety and operations of its facility along with ways to reduce inventory of regulated substances."
