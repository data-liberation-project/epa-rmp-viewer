      "SummaryText": "Clarence B. Walker Water Treatment Plant\nThe Cartersville Water Department Risk Management Plan for the safe handling of chlorine involves a unified approach that integrates technologies, procedures, and management practices to monitor potential chlorine hazards and minimize the risk of accidental releases. The plan provides for employee safety, public health and response agency interaction.\n\nThe Clarence B. Walker Water Treatment Plant utilizes chlorine to treat both the raw water from Lake Allatoona and the finished water. The chlorination process includes gaseous chlorine, chlorination equipment and process safety equipment.\n\nFor the chlorination process, accidental release modeling was performed to determine potential consequences associated with an accidental chlorine release. The \"alternative case\" scenario is defined as the most likely release scenario. An accident history review was performed for the Clarence B. Walker Water Treatment Plant to determine the most likely case scenario.\n\nThe Cartersville Water Department Risk Management Plan includes the following key elements to mitigate the effects of potential chlorine release hazards:\n*Operator training\n*Preventive maintenance program\n*Process specific safety equipment\n*Safe and effective standard operating procedures, written with operator participation\n*Hazard review of equipment and procedures\n*Inspection program\n\nFurther, the Cartersville Water Department has an active safety program with the following elements supporting the safe handling of chlorine:\n*Respiratory protection (SCBA) program\n*Chlorine leak detectors\n*Chemical Right to Know program\n*Personal protective equipment program\n\nThe Clarence B. Walker Water Treatment Plant has a Chlorine Emergency Response Plan, which is being coordinated with the Cartersville Fire Department. Emergency response training and facility tours will be conducted annually.\n"
