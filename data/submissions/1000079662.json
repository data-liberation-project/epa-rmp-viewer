This commitment is reflected in a comprehensive accidental release prevention program. This program addresses the design, installation, operation, maintenance, and employee training associated with the ammonia refrigeration equipment at the Ruiz Food Products, Inc. facility. \n\n\n\nIt is the policy of Ruiz Food Products, Inc. to ensure that controls are in place to limit the risks of potential ammonia releases. If such a release does occur, the facility's emergency response personnel are trained to control and mitigate the effects of the release. The facility has coordinated emergency response activities with the Region 5 LEPC and the Dinuba Fire Department, who provide additional emergency response expertise and support.\n\n  \n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\n\n\nRuiz Foods is a family owned business with a legacy of making great food since 1964.  Our brands deliver convenience, value, and great taste to American families.  Our facility in Dinuba, California is our company headquarters and the largest in our supply chain.\n\n\n\nThe primary business activities at Ruiz Food Products involve the manufacturing and subsequent cold storage of frozen food products.  Located at 501 South Alta Avenue in Dinuba, California, the facility prepares, stores, and ships frozen food products.  Ammonia is the only RMP-regulated substance at the facility, and it is used as a refrigerant in the preparation and cold storage of various food products.  The maximum inventory of ammonia at the facility is approximately 75,000 pounds.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nThe Ruiz Food Products, Inc. facility is in full compliance with EPA's accidental release prevention requirements as defined in 40 CFR Part 68, the requirements for the California Accidental Release Prevention program (Cal"

The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that are in place at the Dinuba facility. \n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information \n\nRuiz Food Products, Inc. maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters, and equipment specifications associated with the ammonia refrigeration equipment and process.  This includes design parameters and safe operating conditions, as well as details of the many safety features incorporated into the design of the ammonia refrigeration system.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazards Analysis \n\nThe facility has conducted comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with the ammonia system are identified and effectively controlled.  The HAZOP methodology, Industry Checklists, and process inspections were used to carry out the process hazards analysis studies. The studies were undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations, and have been revalidated at least every five years.  Any findings or recommendations associated with the analysis of hazards are addressed in a timely manner.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures \n\nTo further ensure that activities are safely conducted regarding the ammonia refrigeration system, Ruiz Foods has developed written operating procedures to supplement the current on-the-job operator training.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operation, normal shutdown and startup, and emergency shutdown and startup. This information is regularly reviewed and readily accessible to operators and/or contractors who are involved in the routine operations of the ammonia process.\n\n\n\nTraining \n\nRuiz Foods has an on-the-job training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating ammonia process equipment are competent in the operating pro"

Refrigeration rounds are conducted daily that require visual observation of the various ammonia components and auxiliary systems.  Any issues noted during rounds are resolved as soon as possible.\n\n\n\nEquipment maintained under this program includes pressure vessels, piping systems, evaporators and other process equipment (chillers, heat exchangers, ice makers, etc.), condensers, compressors, pumps, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, and controls.  System maintenance is completed only by qualified personnel with training in maintenance practices, including in-house personnel and contractors as needed.  Specialized training is provided as needed to ensure maintenance personnel are fully qualified. Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner. \n\n\n\nManagement of Change \n\nWritten procedures are followed at Ruiz Foods to manage changes in the design of the ammonia process, technology, equipment, and procedures.  This ensures that ammonia operators, maintenance personnel, or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification.
