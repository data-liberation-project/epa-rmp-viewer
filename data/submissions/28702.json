      "SummaryText": "\nPlant Description\n\n Arvesta's facility in Perry, Ohio has produced a fungicide, Captan, at its current location for 49 years.  The facility is located on 77 acres in eastern Lake County in a generally rural area. \n  \nThe facility handles several chemicals in the manufacture of Captan, five of which are addressed by the RMP rule: 4-four toxics (chlorine, anhydrous ammonia, carbon disulfide and perchloromethyl mercaptan) and 1-one flammable (1,3-butadiene).\n\n\nRMP Summary\n\nThe RMP rule requires the reporting of a worst case scenario for one toxic and one flammable chemical.  In addition, an alternative scenario for each toxic and one flammable chemical  must be evaluated.  Below are the plant?s scenarios.  The worst case scenarios are defined in the RMP rule as the hypothetical release of the largest quantity of the material in 10 minutes from its container.  Only passive mitigation efforts such as those controls in place that do not require action by an employee to initiate are allowed to be considered (such as a dike or enclosure in a building).  The alternative release scenarios were determined using assumptions based on past experiences by experienced plant personnel.  These alternative release scenarios are more credible to real-world potential incidents.  For alternative release scenarios, facilities are allowed to include active mitigation which includes procedures and equipment that contain or minimize the impact of an accidental release.\n\n\nWorst Case Scenarios\n\nThe worst case scenario for toxics is a chlorine release from a 90 ton rail car that by regulation is assumed to be emptied in 10 minutes.  Under worst-case weather conditions, chlorine could travel 14 miles before reaching the toxic endpoint from the RMP regulation.  It is noted that this scenario assumes meteorological conditions that are uncommon to the area, specifically a wind speed of 1.5 mph that is far less than historical averages.  Average wind speed in this area as determined by the National"

Chlorine rail cars are fabricated, tested and inspected regularly by the chlorine car owner per Department of Transportation regulations.  If this scenario actually occurred, the plant?s fire protection system would be utilized via fire monitors which circle the plant to reduce the vapors generated from the spill; therefore, the theoretical distance a toxic cloud would travel is reduced.  The plant also has emergency equipment on site and personnel trained in its use to mitigate leaks from a chlorine rail car (for example,  Chlorine Institute?s C-Kit).\n\nThe worst case scenario for a flammable is a 1,3 butadiene release from a 35,000 gallon storage tank.  Given the constraints of the RMP rule, the estimated distance to the endpoint is 0.5 miles.  At this distance the effect would likely be limited to minor structural damage such as broken glass (1 psig overpressurization).  It is noted that a vapor explosion can only occur if the butadiene vapors come in contact with an ignition source.  By design, the area in the vicinity of the storage tank is void of such ignition sources by utilizing explosion-proof fixtures and equipment.  The same likelihood as the chlorine rail car applies to this scenario.  The storage tank is designed, constructed and tested per American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) specifications.  The tank is protected against accidental vehicle damage by its location within a concrete dike and is not located in an area likely to be subject to damage from maintenance activities or overhead work.  The other possible cause of this scenario is due to tank failure due to over-pressurization.  The tank is protected by dual relief valves and rupture disk combinations that are annually tested and are designed to relieve tank pressure prior to causing any damage to the tanks st"

This reduces the likelihood of a vapor cloud explosion.  There are also 4 fire monitors that can be directed on the tank to flood the tank with significant amounts of water.\nSimilar to the chlorine scenario, meteorological assumptions are not indicative of the region?s historical averages that would increase the dispersion and dilution of the vapors generated and significantly reduce the likelihood, severity and radius of damage from this hypothetical event\n\n\nAlternative Release Scenarios\n\nThe alternative release scenario for chlorine is a leak of a \"barco joint\" on the unloading line used to transfer chlorine from the rail cars to the process reactors.  This scenario assumes that the 1 inch joint leaks for 5 minutes under worst case weather conditions.  The estimated distance to the endpoint for this scenario is 0.4 miles.  The mitigating circumstances that would reduce the likelihood of this event include the presence of surveillance cameras continuously monitored by plant personnel, chlorine detectors on the unloading dock to detect leaks, emergency shutoff valves on the chlorine cars that can be actuated remotely and excess flow valves built into the rail cars that are designed and constructed to Chlorine Institute standards.  In addition, the barco joints are inspected annually to insure their integrity.   \n\nThe alternative release scenario for1,3 butadiene is a quarter inch hole in the liquid unloading hose used to off-load butadiene from the rail cars to the storage tanks.  This scenario assumes an off-loading rate of 300 pounds per minute under the same worst case weather conditions as the chlorine alternative release scenario.  It is assumed that the release would require 10 minutes to stop.  The resultin"

In addition, there is an emergency shutoff valve on the rail car that can be actuated remotely in the event of a leak and the unloading operation is continuously monitored by plant personnel.  Also, the unloading hose is tested annually to assure its mechanical integrity.\n\nThe alternative scenario for carbon disulfide is a gasket leak in the 2 inch unloading hose utilized for the off-loading of carbon disulfide from rail cars to the storage tanks.  An off-loading rate of 41 gallons per minute is assumed at 30 psig (pressure utilized to off-load the chemical).  A concrete pad/dike along with a roof and half building around the unloading area aids in the mitigation of the event and the resulting release goes off-site less than half a mile.  This event is also mitigated by several measures including a fire monitor in the vicinity,  constant monitoring of the area during the unloading operation by plant personnel and automatic shutoff valve on the car that can be actuated by several switches throughout the plant.  \n\nThe corresponding scenario for anhydrous ammonia is the lifting of a 3/4 inch relief valve in the refrigeration system due to pressure buildup in the system.  The capacity of the relief valve over a 10 minute duration results in an event that extends less than half a mile from the source.  After the system?s pressure drops below the 250 psig set point, the relief valve reseats and the leak stops.
