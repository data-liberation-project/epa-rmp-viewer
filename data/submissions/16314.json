      "SummaryText": "\n1.1  INTRODUCTION\n\nWelcome to Seafreeze Cold Storage and Seafood Processing. As you can see from our name, part of our business deals with cold storage. To keep the millions of pounds of product that are stored here frozen, we use Ammonia as a refrigerant. Since we use over 10,000 pounds (2000 gallons) of ammonia, we actively participate in 2 major government programs to control its use, with their primary function dealing with safety and emergency response. The first program is Processes Safety Management (PSM) from OSHA. It deals with how we handle ammonia inside our building. The second program is Risk Management Program (RMP) from the Environmental Protection Agency. RMP deals with what happens outside of our building.\n\nSeafreeze employees 200 members of our community. Although they are our primary concern, they are not our only concern. We realize that Ammonia is a hazardous substance and must always be handled in such a way as to prevent any release to the building, environment or the surrounding community. We do not take this responsibility lightly. Seafreeze has invested  (not just spent) a lot of money and time to comply with PSM and RMP. They are not small programs. These programs are not set up and forgotten, but constantly reviewed, updated and implemented. They are part of our day to day operation. It makes the quality of life better for all of us and that's the bottom line.\n\n\n\n1.2   WORST CASE SCENARIO\n\n\nThe worst case scenario does not deal with how a full release happens or with the likelihood that it may or may not happen. It deals only with the idea that it could and if it did, how would it be handled and controlled.\n\nIn our case, a full release in ten minutes would be 14,900 pounds of ammonia, the amount that our largest hi-pressure receiver can hold. Under normal operating conditions, this receiver contains approximately 5900 pounds. But since it is impossible to guarantee that this \"full\" condition (which in itself does not constitute a danger "

      "SummaryText": "of release) could not exist, we must treat it as a possibility. Hence the term \"worst case scenario\". Using the E.P.A.'s Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance for ammonia refrigeration facilities, we have determined using wind, temperature, humidity, topography and the building enclosure containing the receiver that the affected area around Seafreeze would be nine tenths of a mile. Inside this radius or \"toxic end point\" represents an exposure level, according to the EPA, that is believed a person could be exposed to for one hour without experiencing or developing irreversible health effects that could impair that persons ability from taking protective action. \n\n\n1.3  ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO \n\nThe alternative release deals with the type of situation we would normally expect to cause a release, such as a broken pipe or valve. For our scenario, we examined the effect a half-inch hole in a pipe from the condenser at 125 psi would have. A release of this nature running for 10 minutes before it was secured, would have a toxic end point of sixteen one hundredths of a mile. \n\n\n\n1.4  GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION\n\nIn order to prevent a worst case or alternate case scenario from happening, we have over 13 prevention programs in operation. These range from doing a Process Hazard Analysis of the entire refrigeration system, which looks for and corrects possible causes for a release, to obvious programs like Training and Lock-Out Tag-Out. Contractors doing work on our system even have their companies safety programs reviewed and welding certifications checked.  The City of Seattle licenses our 5 refrigeration maintenance employees for Ammonia. Training, testing, program reviews are done annually. As an added back up, an outside consultant is hired to do a complete audit of everything to ensure that we are doing it right.\n\n\n1.5 FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nSeafreeze Cold Storage has not had in the last 5 years or it's entire 20-year history, a recordable ammonia rele"

      "SummaryText": "ase. A Recordable release results in damage to property, an injury or death. \n\n\n1.6  EMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN\n\nOur Emergency Response Plan is activated by the ammonia detection system or first awareness by a Seafreeze employee. This awareness is communicated to the maintenance department by person, building phone, cell phone, P.A. or pager. An assessment is made as to the severity of the release. Above 300 Parts per Million (PPM) of ammonia and the building is evacuated along with calling 911 to alert the Fire Department and Hazardous Materials Team. Surrounding businesses are also contacted to inform them of the release. If the detector indicates below 300 PPM the area is ventilated and needed repairs are performed.\n\nThe ammonia detectors are directly connected to our 24-hour alarm monitoring company. The alarm system for refrigeration equipment and fire is backed-up by an automatic standby generator and batteries. After normal business hours, the alarm company contacts one of 5 maintenance employees that are trained to operate the refrigeration system. This employee responds to the alarm to make the initial assessment as to what should happen next. \n\nSeafreeze conducts evacuation drills twice a year involving all personnel on site. The Seattle Fire Department conducts an annual inspection of our facility. The Hazardous Materials Response Team accepted an invitation to tour our facility. At the end of the tour the team made some recommendations that have since been implemented.  Seven days a week a one and a half hour building wide inspection is made of the entire refrigeration system. Once a month we have a safety walk to identify and correct possible un-safe conditions. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.7  PLANNED CHANGES\n\nSeafreeze does not have any major changes planned for the ammonia system, although of course we are always looking for ways to improve its safe operation. Since the persons working on the system day to day will be the first affected by any release we have a keen inte"
