The site can accommodate an amount of DMA in excess of the threshold established by the EPA for Risk Management Planning. Drexel chemical believes that risks associated with DMA storage and use are well managed. \n\nOverall responsibility for RMP implementation for this site is assigned to the Environmental and Safety Manager. Drexel consults with employees on the conduct and development of process hazard analysis and on the development of other elements is this standard. Drexel provides all employees and contractors covered under the PSM program access to PSM program files and documents. Drexel makes use of a PSM team comprised of employees and supervisors that actively engages in the implementation of the PSM program. \n\nAccidental release prevention steps:\n\nDrexel develops and implements written operating procedures providing clear instructions for safely conducting all activities involved in the covered process. Operating procedures address the steps for each operating phase, operating limits, safety and health considerations, and safety systems. \n\nDrexel provides training to all employees when they are hired before they begin their work. Employees also receive safety training which includes familiarizing them with all exits and evacuation routes. An annual training session is conducted during a safety meeting.\n\nFive-year accident history:\n\nThere have been no accidents involving DMA in the last 5 years that caused the following onsite or known offsite consequences:\n\nDeath, injury, property damage, environmental damage, evacuation, or sheltering in place. \n\nEmergency response program:\n\nAn emergency action plan is included in the PSM documents. It establishes safe response actions for employees in case of fire and other emergencies. Potential chemical releases, including DMA, are addressed in the emergency action plan. Th"

The environmental and safety manager and production supervisor are responsible for ensuring operating procedures are reviewed and updated annually and informing process operators of changes to operating procedures. Operating procedures are reviewed as often as necessary to ensure that they reflect current operating practices. They are always to be reviewed in the event of management of change proceedings or an incident investigation in addition to the annual review. \n\nArrangements are established with the local emergency response agency, the fire department, and the local hospital. Evacuation drills are held at least once a year or when a change is made. After the drill, the plant manager or Environmental and Safety manager judges the effectiveness of the plan and reviews employee input. \n\nThe emergency action plan is reviewed by all employees. The employees review it again if any changes are made or if the employee's responsibilities change. \n\nPeriodic compliance audits will ensure the plan is kept up to date. \n\n"
