This commitment is demonstrated by the resources and efforts expended in accident prevention, including a comprehensive Process Safety Management (PSM) program. Management systems are in place at the Trainer Refinery to ensure safety is incorporated into the design, installation, operation, inspection, and maintenance of our processes. Our accident prevention program includes maintaining updated operating procedures and practices as well as extensive personnel training on safety. We also have highly trained and well-qualified emergency responders onsite 24 hours a day ready to respond to control and mitigate an incident should one occur.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n\n\nThe Trainer Refinery located in Trainer, PA processes raw crude oil into gasoline and other refining products including jet fuel, diesel fuel, heating oil, heavy fuel oil, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), and sulfur. The LPG products consist of butane and propane which are both regulated flammable substances. The refinery produces and/or uses other regulated flammables, such as hydrogen, methane, ethane, pentane, etc. In addition, the refinery uses and/or processes hydrofluoric acid, ammonia, and hydrogen sulfide which are regulated toxic substances. Hydrofluoric acid is the only regulated toxic substance that exceeds threshold reporting quantities and is subject to RMP reporting.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM STEPS\n\n\n\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at the Trainer Refinery. This summary addresses each of the elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\nEmployee Participation\n\n\n\nThe Trainer Refinery encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention.

Information on the refinery's accident prevention program is available to all employees and they are encouraged to suggest improvements to any of the programs. Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the refinery and addresses each accident prevention program element. In addition, the refinery has a number of initiatives to address process safety and employee safety issues. These activities include committees to promote and address both process and personal safety such as the Refinery Leadership Safety Team and Joint Management Labor Health & Safety Committee.. The committees typically consist of members from a broad cross-section of the refinery, including operations, mechanical, technical and plant management. Other means by which employees are solicited for input and feedback on various PSM programs are through safety meetings, Area Safety Team meetings and audits.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\n\n\nThe Trainer Refinery maintains a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, Safe Operating Limits (SOLs) of critical process parameters, specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information. A table summarizing the reference documents and their location, and updating procedure is readily available as part of the Process Safety Information section of the written Process Safety Compliance Plan to help employees locate any necessary process safety information.\n\n\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards, chemical reactivity/stability hazards, and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations"

For specific process units and operations, the refinery has documented safety-related limits for specific critical operating and key process parameters (e.g., temperature, pressure, level, and composition) as part of procedures for normal operations. The refinery ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\n\n\n\nThe refinery also maintains numerous technical documents including piping and instrumentation diagrams that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment. This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, etc. This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\n\n\nThe Trainer Refinery has a comprehensive program to identify and control hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled. Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\n\n\nThe Trainer Refinery primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations. HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques. The analyses are conducted using a team of highly experienced people who have operating, engineering, and safety expertise. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team "

LOPA is a risk assessment tool that was developed to semi- quantitatively evaluate the safety integrity of process operations. LOPA uses a simple numerical calculation to measure the adequacy of protection layers (alarms with operator response, relief valves, control loops, etc.) against the potential consequences of process deviations (loss of containment, personnel exposure, etc.). The LOPA results give order of magnitude approximation of the risk of a scenario.\n\n\n\nThe PHA team findings are presented to the Refinery Leadership Safety Team. Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team. This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive priority attention. All action items in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are complete or resolved. The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\n\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, Trainer Refinery periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results. These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years. The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained. \n\nOperating Procedures\n\n\n\nThe Trainer Refinery maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) normal operations, (2) temporary operations, (3) normal shutdown, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) unit startup and (6) initial startup of a new process.  Troubleshooting guidelines which provide guidance on corrective actions to be taken when responding to upper or lower limit exceedances for critical operating and key process parameters also exist.

The procedures are annually certified to be current and accurate. Written operating procedures are readily available to all personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\nTraining\n\n\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the Trainer Refinery has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process. New employees receive fundamental training in refinery operations. After successfully completing this training, a new operator receives unit-specific training. This training provides the skills and knowledge required to perform the duties of a specific job in operations, and is provided to both new hires who complete fundamentals, as well as incumbent operators who are cross training on other jobs. Job specific training provides detailed instruction on the process and process equipment. This phase of training includes hands-on demonstrations (or simulations) of start-up, shutdown and emergency operating procedures. It also includes the review and practice of routine, job-specific tasks performed by the operator (e.g. drawing and testing samples).\n\n\n\nAfter operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests & skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.

Because most contractors work on or near process equipment, the refinery has procedures in place so that contractors perform their work in a safe manner, are aware of the hazards in their workplace, understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, understand and follow site safety rules, and inform refinery personnel of any hazards that they find during their work. This is accomplished by providing contractors with site specific orientation, information about safety and health hazards, emergency response plan requirements, and safe work practices prior to their beginning work. In addition, the refinery evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor. Refinery personnel and/or contractor safety personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\n\n\nPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\n\n\n\nThe Trainer Refinery conducts a PSSR for new facilities or facility modifications to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and the equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service. This review provides a final check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready.. Checklists are utilized to verify all aspects of startup readiness. A PSSR includes field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\n\n\nThe Trainer Refinery has as well-established practices/procedures and uses original equipment manufacturers' (OEM) instructions to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent "

The drops were confirmed to be HF, and the treatment of the operator resulted in overnight hospitalization and observation.\n\n\n\nOn March 20th, 2014 a release of hydrocarbon occurred at the HF Alkylation unit. The leak originated from tubing leading to a flow transmitter on the HF Stripper Tower feed line. The leak was completely isolated within 30 minutes. When the release initially occurred, a nearby operator was potentially exposed to the ensuing vapor cloud and was transported to an area hospital for evaluation and treatment.\n\n\n\nOn 6/20/2019 at approximately 1:35 PM, a Monroe Energy Alkylation Unit Operator was working to de-pressure the Magtech level column on the Second Stage Acid Settler to prepare the instrument for maintenance. The column was isolated and the operator began to remove a bleeder cap so that a flex hose could be connected to the flare.  As he began to loosen the cap, the cap tilted indicating the threads were not secure.  Before the cap could be removed or retightened, it began to leak, indicated by puffs of \"smoke\".  As the operator prepared to back away from the area, he turned his head to locate the ladder to exit the platform when material contacted the left side of his face and he felt a burning sensation. The operator decended the ladder to grade and immediately entered a nearby safety shower.  He was assisted by another operator.  A 300 call was made immediately and Monroe Emergency Response Technicians responded and began treatment with calcium gluconate gel and a nebulizer. The operator was transported to the Alkylation Unit change house where treatment continued and then to Crozer Chester Medical Center (CCMC) where he was treated for minor burns. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\n\n\n\nThe Trainer Refinery maintains a written emergency response program, which is in place to protect worker and public safety a"
