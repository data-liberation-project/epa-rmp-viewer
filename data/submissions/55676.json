This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training and consideration of safety in the design, operation, and maintenance of the Aqueous Ammonia Storage System. Facility?s policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substance.\n2.    STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage, and sale of fertilizers, in addition to, the sale of pre-packaged agricultural chemicals to farmers.\nAqua ammonia (20% of ammonia by weight) is stored in one 9,000 gallon above ground tanks at the site. The maximum quantity of aqua ammonia handled is 59,000 pounds. The total quantity of ammonia present in the aqua ammonia, based on 20% active ingredient by weight, is 12,000 pounds. \n3.    HAZARD ASSESSMENT SUMMARY/OFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\nWorst-Case Release Scenario Results Summary\nScenario Description: Per the CalARP Regulations, one worst-case release scenario has been defined for the Aqueous Ammonia Storage.  The results can be found in the Hazard Assessment documentation.  \n \nAlternative Release Scenario Results Summary\nScenario Description: Per the CalARP Regulations, one alternative-case release scenario has been defined for the Aqueous Ammonia Storage.  The results can be found in the Hazard Assessment documentation  \nRisk Considerations\nAlthough the storage and use of aqueous ammonia has inherent potential risks and the release scenarios can potentially reach sensitive populations within the community, the facility has recognized these potential risks and structured its safety programs to make the worst case type of event non-credible.  In addition to the safety practices of the facility and plant personnel to make the worst-case event non-credible, it should also be recognized that there are inherent analys"

The facility utilizes  manual shutoffs, and emergency shutdown systems.\n \n4.    ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\nAs part of the implementation of CalARP Program 2, key Prevention Program elements were documented and implemented by the facility to manage process safety issues associated with the use of aqueous ammonia. Prevention program 2 elements are listed below:\n?    2755.1 Safety Information\n?    2755.2 Hazard Review\n?    2755.3 Operating Procedures\n?    2755.4 Training\n?    2755.5 Maintenance\n?    2755.6 Compliance Audits\n?    2755.7 Incident Information\n5.    FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nThere have been no CalARP-applicable releases of aqueous ammonia at the facility in at least the past five (5) years.  \n6.    EXTERNAL EVENTS ANALYSIS\nPursuant to the requirements of California Health & Safety Code, Title 19, Division 2, Chapter 4.5, ?2745.6(l); the following external events analysis information shall be submitted:  \n?    The types of natural and human caused external events considered in PHA Section 2760.2 or Hazard Review Section 2755.2.  \no    During the June 2009 PHA a broad list of external events was considered by the Team.  General events external to the plant that can conceivably cause a release of aqueous ammonia were addressed.  The External Events that were considered credible include, but are not limited to, earthquake, vandalism, sabotage, external fire, human error/misoperation, and vehicle impact.\n?    The estimated magnitude or scope of external events which were considered. If not known, the owner or operator of the stationary source shall work closely with the AA to determine what is required."

EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM \nEmployees are trained to evacuate and call 911 in case of an emergency.  Big Valley Ag Services will coordinate with local Fire Department and First Responders. The facility has filed a Business Emergency Plan to help coordinate with local responders.\nAn Emergency Action Plan (EAP) that meets the "
