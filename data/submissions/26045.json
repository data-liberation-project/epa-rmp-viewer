Chlorine and sulfur dioxide are used to chlorinate and dechlorinate the plant's effluent prior to discharge to the Red River.  On average, 6000 pounds of chlorine and 4000 pounds of sulfur dioxide are stored on site.  In case of a chlorine or sulfur dioxide leak, the City of Pineville has an emergency response policy which require City personnel to notify LA State Police Hazmat by calling the 911 Response Center.  Local fire and police departments are notified.  These emergency personnel are used to assist in the evacuation of citizens in the affected area.\n\nThe worst case incident used EPA's RMP Comp (TM) model which projected the release of 2000 pounds of chlorine or sulfur dioxide in ten minutes.  The affected area, 1.3 miles, included 2385 citizens.  A hospital is located in the potential affected area.  The alternative release model used EPA's RMP Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants Reference Tables or Equation.  The model was based on 150 pounds/minute release of chlorine affecting an area, 0.2 miles with 323 population.  Sulfur dioxide released at a rate 99.0 pounds/minute affected the same area and population.  Currently, the City uses daily inspections and a comprehensive preventative maintenance program to ensure the system is operating properly.  There is no active or passive mitigation used at the facility at the present time.\n\nPlant personnel have been properly trained to handle chlorine and sulfur dioxide stored in one ton cylinders.  Formal and on-the-job training ensures plant personnel have the necessary knowledge and skill to properly maintain the chlorination system.\n\nThe City of Pineville has no history of reportable release for chlorine or sulfur dioxide at this site.  There has been no injury or property loss associated with these chemicals.\n\nThe City of Pineville Wastewater Treatment Plant is included in"
