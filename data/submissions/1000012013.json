The regulated chemicals and the threshold amounts are listed in the regulations and a variety of guidance documents.  The Water Treatment Plant (WTP) of the City of Wheeling qualified for inclusion in the RMP due to the presence of chlorine stored on-site.\r\n\tThe threshold amount for chlorine is 2,500 lbs.  Those facilities with 2,500 lbs. or more are subject to RMP regulations. The maximum amount of chlorine present at the facility is 16,000 lbs. (8 - 1 ton cylinders can be stored at one time).\r\nRMP regulations require the owner to determine which program level that the facility falls under.  There are three levels.  Program 1 is for facilities where a worst case release would not have an effect on any off-site public or environmental receptors.  The WTP did not qualify for this program level.  Program levels 2 and 3 are for facilities where a worst case release would have an effect on any off-site public or environmental receptors.  Program 3 facilities are those that have either a specific SIC Code (a list of the codes that indicate a Program 3 industry are included in 40 CFR 68) or are subject to OSHA Process Safety Management Regulations.  The WTP was not included by SIC codes and is not subject to OSHA regulations and therefore qualified as a Program 2 facility.\r\n\tA worst case release scenario was conducted as required by the RMP.  The results of this scenario are not included in this executive summary.  \r\n\tThe regulations also require that the facility model an air release of a more likely release scenario. The results of this scenario are not included in this executive summary.   \r\nThe WTP has an active release prevention program in place.  Elements of the prevention program include automat"

There are notification procedures in place with detailed instructions for employees to call 911 whenever an uncontrollable release of chlorine occurs.  WTP employees are trained annually in the properties and safe handling of chlorine.  Employees are also trained in the use of safety equipment including SCBAs and leak repair kits.  \r\nRMP required prevention program elements also include a management system to be developed.  Safety information such as, Material Safety Data Sheets for chlorine, maximum intended inventory of regulated substances, safe upper and lower temperatures, pressures, flows and compositions of equipment used to store and handle the regulated substance, equipment specifications and codes and standards used to design, build and operate the process was compiled.  The above will be updated if a major change occurs that makes the information inaccurate.\r\nThe facility will conduct a hazards review of the regulated process at least every five years or whenever a major change to the system occurs.  Use of a checklist and 'what if' questionnaire facilitate the completion of the hazard review.\r\nOperating and maintenance manuals are available for personnel to use for reference purposes.  These manuals detail the proper and safe procedures for handling the regulated chemical as well as maintenance procedures and frequencies.  The operators log amounts of chemical used and operating adjustments made to the process.   Maintenance personnel log maintenance procedures performed on the process equipment.\r\nAll current employees have received training in the properties of the regulated chemical and the safe and proper operation of equipment used to store and handle the substance.  New employees are trained as above before they are permitted to operate or maintain the chlorine system.  Annual training updates are conducted.  All training activities are to be recorded on training logs.\r\nAt least every three years, the f"

A compliance audit checklist is used to conduct the compliance audit.\r\nWhenever an incident which resulted in, or could reasonably have resulted in a catastrophic release occurs the owner conducts an incident investigation. The owner promptly addresses and resolves the investigation findings and recommendations.  Resolutions and corrective actions are documented.  The findings of the investigation are reviewed with all affected personnel whose job tasks are affected by the findings.  Investigation summaries will be retained for five years. \r\n\tThe facility has had no accidental releases of chlorine which have resulted in on-site deaths, injuries or significant property damage or known offsite deaths, injuries, property damage, environmental damage, evacuations or sheltering in place in the last five years.\r\n\tThe WTP is included in the community's Emergency Response Plan.  The Water Treatment Facility does respond to incidental releases of chlorine that can be controlled at the time of release by employees in the immediate release area.  This does not constitute a response under OSHA's HAZWOPER Standard (29 CFR 1910.120) which was adopted by EPA for use in the Risk Management Plan Regulations. For releases where concentrations of the regulated chemical in the work area exceed relevant work place standards, such as OSHA Permissible Exposure Limit (1 ppm, Short Term Exposure Limit) or where the leak is clearly progressing so that a hazard is imminent, the release can no longer be considered incidental and emergency responders will be alerted. \r\nThe community's Emergency Response Plan has evacuation, shelter in place and vehicular traffic detour contingencies in place if a release of toxic material occurs.
