Facilities are encouraged to listen to the concerns of the community and to consider these concerns when designing and implementing process safety systems.  The AlliedSignal Buffalo Research Laboratory endeavors to accomplish this by our regular participation in the South Buffalo Community Forum, a local Community Advisory Panel.   \n \nThe AlliedSignal Buffalo Research Laboratory employs approximately130 employees including Ph.D. chemists, chemical engineers as well as industry experienced professional and hourly personnel.  We serve as the primary Specialty Chemicals business unit Research and Development facility in North America.  The Buffalo Research Laboratory is positioned to conduct R&D activities from bench through pilot scale.  Our Pilot Plant is utilized to transfer technology from laboratory scale methods to develop commercial scale chemical processes for our manufacturing sites, as well as engaging in small-scale production for pre-commercialization and market acceptance testing.   Historically, this site has focused on fluorine based chemistry, handling materials such as hydrofluoric acid, anhydrous hydrogen fluoride, chlorine and boron trifluoride.   Recently, the site has diversified and is conducting R&D work for our pharmaceutical and agricultural business enterprises.  The two chemicals on site included in the RMP Rule's list of regulated substances are boron trifluoride and ethyl ether.  The AlliedSignal Buffalo Research Laboratory uses boron trifluoride and ethyl ether in a \"covered process\" as defined by EPA.   Both chemicals are stored on-site above the Rule's specified threshold quantity and are therefore regulated under the RMP Rule. \n \nIn accordance with the requirements of the RMP rule, a description of the following seven elements is provided for the AlliedSignal Buffalo Research Laboratory: \n\n1.

The accidental release prevention and emergency response policy associated specifically with the laboratory's use of boron trifluoride and ethyl ether involves the integration of safety devices and technologies inherent in the design of the process, safe operational procedures and management practices, operator training, the preparation and testing of site emergency response plans, the maintenance of onsite emergency response equipment.  We have a professionally trained Emergency Response Team, which coordinates our efforts and resources with local emergency response services, and the community.\n \n\n2.  The regulated substance handled:\n\nThe AlliedSignal Buffalo Research Laboratory uses boron trifluoride and ethyl ether as the raw materials in our work on one of several boron trifluoride complexes.  They are stored and handled in quantities that exceed the threshold quantity specified in the RMP Rule.  Boron trifluoride is shipped in a multi-unit tube trailer, and is positioned in an area adjacent to our pilot plant, which is located in the Northwest corner of our site.  The ethyl ether is shipped in a tank trailer and is positioned in a diked area adjacent to the pilot plant.  Both the boron trifluoride tube trailer and ethyl ether tank truck are connected to independent distribution systems which deliver the materials to a reactor located on the second floor of the pilot plant.

Boron trifluoride is stored as a high-pressure gas in the tube trailer and transfer is accomplished by pressure difference between the reactor and the tube trailer.  \n\n\n3.  The worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario, including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distance for each reported scenario:\n\nEPA's Risk Management Program requires the AlliedSignal Buffalo Research Laboratory to prepare an analysis of a hypothetical worst case release of the chemicals covered by the RMP regulation.  EPA defines a worst case release as the release of the largest quantity of the chemical from a vessel or process line failure.  EPA also assumes that the failure takes place over 10 minutes and that all safety systems fail to operate.  In addition, the release must take place during the worst possible weather conditions.  For a number of reasons discussed in this submittal, it is extremely unlikely that this event would ever occur.  In addition, the AlliedSignal Buffalo Research Laboratory is required to analyze the impact of an alternative accidental release scenario for the chemicals covered by the RMP regulations. \n\nThe offsite consequence analysis for a \"worst-case toxic release scenario\" at the Buffalo Research Laboratory was performed for the largest single tube, containing 3,500 lbs. of boron trifluoride, on a multi-tube trailer.  The tube is a horizontal, cylindrical steel tube mounted on a trailer, which is located adjacent to our pilot plant.  The parameters used for the worst-case release scenario for the boron trifluoride source were those defined and pre-set by EPA in the RMP Rule for toxic gasses.\n \nIn accordance with the Rule, the maximum 3,500lb. full capacity content of a single tube was assumed to be released over 10 minutes.

Since the Buffalo Research Laboratory is located in an urban area, the vapors would reach offsite endpoints and public receptors. This endpoint concentration was selected by EPA and listed in the RMP Rule specifically for boron trifluoride.  \n\nThe offsite consequence analysis for an \"alternate-case toxic release scenario\" at the Buffalo Research Laboratory was performed based on an operational review of the process, which identified a leak in a process line.  The failure results in the release of 420 lbs. of boron trifluoride, stored at ambient temperature and 1,600 psi.  Active mitigation systems in the form of a water deluge system and an emergency shutdown system were considered in this scenario.  Since the Buffalo Research Laboratory is located in an urban area, the vapors would reach offsite endpoints and public receptors.  The endpoint concentration of 0.028 milligrams and the parameters used for the alternate-case release scenario for the boron trifluoride source were those defined and pre-set by EPA in the RMP Rule for toxic gas.\n \nThe offsite consequence for a \"worst-case flammable release scenario\" at the Buffalo Research Laboratory was performed for the entire contents of the ethyl ether tank trailer, which is 40,000 lbs.

Since this site is located in an urban area, the effects of an over pressurization above 1 psi would be experienced at offsite endpoints and by public receptors. This endpoint effect was selected by EPA and listed in the RMP Rule specifically for flammable liquids.\n\nThe offsite consequence for an \"alternate-case flammable release scenario\" at the Buffalo Research Laboratory was performed based on an operational review of the process, which identified a valve seal failure in a process line.  As a result of the valve seal failure, ethyl ether is released into the \"V\" shaped dike and confined to a 64 ft2 area, which ignites.  Modeling analysis indicates that the flammable vapors would be confined to an area relatively close to the spill so that over-pressurization associated with the ignition would be minimal.  Therefore, the only impact considered was thermal radiation from the pool fire.  Modeling analysis indicates the effects of the 5000 watt/m2 endpoint would not reach over the property line and therefore no offsite endpoints or public receptors would be effected.  The parameters used for the alternate-case release scenario for ethyl ether source were those defined and pre-set by EPA in the RMP Rule for flammable liquids.\n\n \n4.
