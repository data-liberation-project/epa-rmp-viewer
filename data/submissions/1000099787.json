The Mogadore Plant has a trained and properly equipped team of volunteer emergency responders capable of handling most foreseeable emergency situations. Importantly, coordination with local safety forces is a key element of the emergency response planning process. Specific plans are in place to respond to chemical emergencies within the Mogadore Plant.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY:\nAs part of our efforts to drive continued improvement in all areas of operation, our specific focus on safety improvements have included SIF and system redundancies, continued engagement of various stakeholders and operators with PSM processes.  Our site also has routine Safety Committee meetings where site team members from all parts of the Mogadore/Corporate organization collaborate, develop, and implement continued improvement efforts.  \nAdditionally, the Mogadore team has invested in additional Emergency Response Equipment and training, participates regularly with outside response agencies (Police, Fire Department, Community Leadership, Portage and Summit County EMA, LEPC's, SERC, etc..) to perform tabletop exercises, site inspections, and looks to develop this further to continue development for our stakeholders.  \nIntrinsic safety is a key element in the design of all process equipment at Synthomer's Mogadore Plant. All PSM-covered process equipment designs and modifications are subject to formal Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) procedures. During a PHA, recommendations are made for the improvement of the process.

Models such as RMP*Comp still result in highly improbable and, in some cases, physically impossible risk scenarios.\nSynthomer has also prepared alternative release scenarios which it believes are more accurate predictions of potential accidental releases from the Mogadore Plant. Alternative release scenarios are, by definition, more likely to occur than worst-case scenarios, but even they are still improbable because of engineering and administrative controls in place at the Mogadore Plant.\n\nWORST-CASE AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS:\n\nEPA regulations require facilities to develop one worst-case scenario to represent all toxic substances and one worst-case scenario to represent all flammable substances from lists of regulated materials. Additional worst-case scenarios are required if different public receptors (off-site residences, businesses, or community buildings within a possible impact radius) could be affected by the release of another regulated material. Synthomer is not subject to this additional requirement.\nDescriptions of the worst-case and alternative release scenarios have been removed from this Executive Summary consistent with the requirements at 40 CFR 68.155, as amended on April 9, 2004 (69 FR 18819).\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM:\n\nSynthomer began a formal PSM program at its Mogadore Plant in 1992 after OSHA promulgated regulations at 29 CFR 1910.119.

The RMP-regulated substances used to manufacture these products are 1,3-butadiene (CAS 106-99-0), acrylonitrile (CAS 107-13-1), and 28% ammonium hydroxide solution (CAS 7664-41-7 for ammonia). 1,3-Butadiene is the only regulated flammable substance on-site; acrylonitrile and 28% ammonium hydroxide solution are the regulated toxic substances on-site. Finished products are non-hazardous polymers and take the form of a low-viscosity, milky-white liquid emulsion.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\n\nEPA regulations require regulated facilities to provide information about all accidents in the last five years involving an RMP-regulated substance if the accident resulted in (1) death, injury according to the RMP definition, or significant property damage on-site, or (2) known deaths, injuries, or property or environmental damage off-site. The Mogadore Plant had no accidents meeting this regulatory definition within the last five years.\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENTS:\n\nEPA regulations, Process Safety Management (PSM) requirements under the Occupational Safety and Health Act, and the Responsible Care(R) Initiative of the American Chemistry Council require the Mogadore Plant to conduct hazard assessments of regulated processes.

The purpose of the RMP is to:\nThe following is an overview of the Mogadore Plant's accident prevention and emergency response programs:\n\nCOMMITMENT TO SAFETY:\nSynthomer and the Mogadore Plant are and always have been committed to safe operations as their number one priority. This commitment begins with highly qualified people and is reflected at all levels of the operation. All employees at the Mogadore Plant are provided with the training, tools, and authority to perform their duties in a safe manner. Strict operational procedures and controls are in place to ensure safety from the conceptual stage through product development, manufacturing, handling and storage, and delivery to customers. The Mogadore Plant has a staff of highly qualified safety and environmental professionals, engineers, and support personnel to assure implementation of, and an on-going commitment to, the highest standards of safe process management. Their experience and professional competence have resulted in many years of safe operation which consistently exceed industry averages.\nWithin the Synthomer Mogadore Plant, safety, health and environment (SHE) is a core value. As a part of the Synthomer organization we embrace the Synthomer Core Values, SHE Principles and Golden Rules. \n\nSynthomer has introduced SHE Principles and 10 Golden Rules across all sites to directly target and improve the safe operation of our plants. \n\nThe SHE principles are:\n\u0095\tLook after yourself\n\u0095\tLook after each other\n\u0095\tEffective last line of defense\n\u0095\tStop and think\n\u0095\tSafe workplace\n\u0095\tSafe vehicle, safe driver\n\u0095\tSafe processes and operations\n\u0095\tSafe systems of work\n\u0095\tNo change without assessment"
