Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at Farmers Union Oil Company are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental\nsafety.  This commitment is an inherent part of our comprehensive accidental release prevention\nprogram that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and\nemployee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement\nappropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a\nrelease does occur, our trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the\neffects of the release.    We are also coordinated with the Mahnomen Fire Department which\nprovides additional emergency response expertise.\n\n  2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities includes support services  for crop production.  We have Propane \nstored in one 25,300 gallon tank and two 18,000 gallon tanks located at our facility in Mahnomen,\nMN (Figure 1).  The maximum amount stored is 49,040  gallons (207,100 lbs.) at the maximum fill\ncapacity of 80%.\n\n  3. The Worst Case Release Scenario and the Alternative Release Scenarios\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we utilized RMP Comp \nprovided by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).  The following paragraphs provide details\nof the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario involves a catastrophic release of the entire contents of the\ninterconnected propane storage tanks (207,100 lbs.) in gaseous form over 10 minutes.   At Class F\natmospheric stability, 1.5 m/s windspeed  and urban topography, the maximum distance of 0.48\nmiles is obtained corresponding to a endpoint of 1 psi overpressure (Figure 2). This amount of\noverpressure can cause partial d"

Under neutral weather conditions, the\nmaximum distance to the lower flammability limit is 0.06 miles (316 feet) (Figure 3).\n\n\n  4. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention\nrequirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  The following sections briefly describe\nthe elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\nFarmers Union Oil Company maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the\nchemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes\n(Appendix E).\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are\nidentified and controlled efficiently.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a\ntimely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Farmers Union Oil\nCompany maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of\noperation and the information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved\nin the processes (Appendix B).\n\nTraining\nFarmers Union Oil Company has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that\nemployees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with\nthese processes (Appendix C).\n\nMechanical Integrity\nFarmers Union Oil Company carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process\nequipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes\namong others; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief"
