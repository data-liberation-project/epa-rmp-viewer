If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to notify the Holt County LEPC and request that they respond to the emergency.\n\nThis facility is a retail fertilizer plant.  We sell anhydrous ammonia to area farmers for fertilizing purposes.  This operation consists of one 18,000-gallon and five 6,000-gallon ammonia tanks interconnected, and associated piping, valves and compressors.\n\nOur worst case scenario is failure of the 18,000-gallon storage tank when filled to the greatest amount allowed.  According to EPA look-up tables, the distance to the endpoint is 3.2 miles.  Within the distance to the endpoint, there is a total population of 1,300 people.\n\nThis facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule and all applicable state and local rules and regulations.  The ammonia system is designed, installed and maintained in accordance with OSHA 29CFR 1910.111 and state law.\n\nWe have never had an accident involving ammonia that caused death, injury, property or environmental damage, evacuation or shelterings in place.\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving our ammonia system, it is our policy to notify the Holt County LEPC and request that they respond to the emergency.\n\nWith our ongoing safety training and maintenance programs, and under present regulations, we do not anticipate any changes needed in our safety program at this time."
