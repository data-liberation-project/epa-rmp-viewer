These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate. The procedures are maintained current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the Management of Change process.\n\nIn addition, Sweeny Complex maintains a Process Safety Information document that provides guidance on how\nto respond to upper or lower limit exceedances for specific process or equipment parameters. This information,\nalong with written operating procedures, is readily available to operators in the process unit and for other\npersonnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\nTraining\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, Sweeny Complex has implemented a\ncomprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process. New employees receive\nbasic training in plant operations if they are not already familiar with such operations. After successfully\ncompleting this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process specific duties and\ntasks. After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) that they have adequate\nknowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner, they can work independently. In addition, all\noperators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to confirm their skills and\nknowledge are maintained at an acceptable level. All of this training is documented for each operator, including\nthe means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\nContractors\nSweeny Complex uses contractors as part of its regular work force during periods of increased maintenance or\nconstruction activities. Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the plant has procedures\nin place to verify that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner,"

This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as\ntraining and consideration of safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.\nOur policy is to implement controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous chemicals. However, if a\nrelease does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\nChevron Phillips Chemical Company LP Sweeny Complex consists of eight operating units linked by multiple\npipelines. The complex, near Old Ocean, Texas, is at the intersection of State Highway 35 and FM 524, about\n60 miles southwest of downtown Houston. The complex also operates a terminal and storage facility, along with\nthe pipelines that connect this facility to the main plant and its markets. The complex produces 4.5 billion\npounds of ethylene per year. In our process, we use the following chemicals the EPA has identified as having\nthe potential to cause significant offsite consequences in the event of a substantial accidental release:\n\nToxics: Chlorine\n\nFlammables: n-Butane, Ethane, Ethylene, isobutante, isopentane, n-Pentane, Propane, and Propylene, along with smaller quantities of other covered flammable materials in mixtures,\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program Steps\nThe following is a summary of the General Accidental Release Prevention Program in place at the Chevron\nPhillips Chemical Company LP Sweeny Complex.

The Employee Participation Plan at the Sweeny Complex provides a structure for employees and contractors to review, participate in, and get training on process safety practices and procedures.  Employees and contractors periodically participate in Job Safety Analyses, emergency drills, Incident Investigations, MOCs, PHAs, PSSRs, audits and other process safety-related activities.  These provide an opportunity for employees and contractors to raise questions and provide input about the practice and methods used to comply with the PSM Standard.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nProcess Safety Information (PSI) is divided into three main categories, which include:  information pertaining to the hazards associated with the highly hazardous chemicals, the technology of the process, and the equipment in the process.  The Process Safety Information Plan at the Sweeny Complex provides a guideline of the process safety information available to employees and contractors and how it is maintained.  Process Safety Information is developed, compiled and updated by employees and contractors.  PSI should be accessible to employees and their representatives and all personnel responsible for compiling process safety information; assisting in the development of PHAs; or involved in incident investigations, emergency planning and response, or compliance audits.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nSweeny Complex has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various\nprocesses are identified and controlled.

HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation\ntechniques. The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance\nexperience as well as engineering expertise. The team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well\nas accident prevention and mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary. The\nteam employs a Layer of Protection Analysis (LOPA) approach to assist with this task.\n\nThe PHA Team findings are forwarded to local and corporate management for resolution. Implementation of\nmitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA Team\n(using LOPA). This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive\nimmediate attention. All approved mitigation options being implemented in response to PHA Team findings are\ntracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\nTo confirm that process controls and/or process hazards do not deviate significantly from the original design\nFeatures, Sweeny Complex periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results. These periodic\nreviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no\nlonger operating. The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained. Once again, the\nteam findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings is\ndocumented and retained.\n\nOperating Procedures\nSweeny Complex maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as: (1)\nUnit startup, (2) Normal operations, (3) Temporary operations, (4) Emergency shutdown, (5) Normal shutdown,\n(6) Emergency operation, and (7) Initial startup of a new pro"

This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a Process Overview, (2) information\nabout safety and health hazards, (3) Emergency Response Plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior\nto their beginning work. In addition, Sweeny Complex evaluates contractor safety programs and performance\nduring the selection of the contractor. Plant personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to help\nensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations. Contractors also regularly participate in facility\nemergency drills.\n\nPreStartup Safety Reviews (PSSR's)\nSweeny Complex conducts a PSSR for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the\nprocess safety information. The purpose of the PSSR is to confirm that safety features, procedures, personnel,\nand the equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service. This review\nprovides one additional check to make certain construction is in accordance with the design specifications and\nthat all supporting systems are operationally ready. The PSSR review team uses checklists to verify all aspects\nof readiness.
