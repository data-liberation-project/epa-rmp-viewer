This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training and consideration of safety in the design, operation, and maintenance of the Low Temperature Separation, Fractionation, Propane Storage, and Natural Gas Liquids Storage Systems. The Stearns Gas PlantA?s policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substance.\n\n2. STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE The gas plant is designed to convert sweet field gas into pipeline quality sales gas and natural gas liquids (natural gas liquids and propane). One LPG bullet has a working capacity of 24,000 gallons. The product storage tank has a working capacity of 48,000 gallons. \n\n3. HAZARD ASSESSMENT SUMMARY/OFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS Worst-Case Release Scenario Results Summary Scenario Description: Per the RMP Regulations, one worst-case flammable scenario has been defined for the Low Temperature Separation, Fractionation, Propane Storage, and Natural Gas Liquids Storage System. The results can be found in the Hazard Assessment documentation. Alternative Release Scenario Results Summary Scenario Description: Per the RMP Regulations, one alternative-case flammable scenario has been defined for the Low Temperature Separation, Fractionation, Propane Storage, and Natural Gas Liquids Storage System.  The results can be found in the Hazard Assessment documentation. \n\n4. ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM As part of the implementation of RMP Program 3, key Prevention Program elements were documented and implemented by the Stearns Gas Plant to manage process safety issues associated with flammables. Prevention Program 3 elements include: \n\nPrevention Program 3 Elements \nProcess Safety Information (PSI) Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) Operating Procedures (OP) Training (TRN) Mechanical Integrity (MI) Management "

The External Events that were considered credible include, but are not limited to, earthquake, external fire, and human error/misoperation. The facility also conducted a separate Seismic Assessment report that was submitted to LA County Fire Department. \n\n-The estimated magnitude or scope of external events which were considered\nIf not known, the owner or operator of the stationary source shall work closely with the AA to determine what is required. If seismic events are applicable, the parameters used in the consideration of the seismic analysis and which edition of the Uniform Building Code was used when the process was designed. --The magnitudes of the external events considered are detailed within the PHA Worksheets and were \nqualitatively risk-ranked by the PHA Team. \n-For each external event, with a potential to create a release of a regulated substance that will reach an endpoint offsite, apply 1) The expected date of completion of any changes resulting from the PHA; 2) Major hazards identified; 3) Process controls in use; 4) Mitigation systems in use; 5) Monitoring and detection systems in use; and, 6) Changes since the last Hazard Review (HR) or PHA -"

EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM The facility maintains an ERAP onsite that meets the requirements of the CCR Title 8 A?3220.  The facility has filed a Business Emergency Plan to help coordinate with local responders. \n\n8. PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY The Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) study has been conducted to examine mitigation measures to improve safety at the facility.  Planned changes to improve safety are listed as recommendations in the July 2006 PHA Report. "
