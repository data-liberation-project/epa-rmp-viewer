This philosophy involves making each and every employee and contractor accountable for their own safety as well as that of the community around them.  As a company we follow a close adherence to all applicable federal, state and local laws to ensure a safe and healthy environment for all. \n\nEmployees who enter the Bazor Ridge facility complete a thorough training, both in the classroom and on-the-job, that enables them to address emergency issues as they arise.  This preparation includes standard operational, emergency operational, and release prevention training.  In addition, periodic refresher courses help to keep operators\u00bf problem solving abilities up to date and in sync with our recurring safety improvements.  Our regular internal audits provide an excellent checks and balances system for monitoring these high standards that we set.\n\nBazor Ridge Gas Plant is one of many facilities operated by Enbridge Energy Company.  The plant is a natural gas liquid extraction LP-Gas processing facility with LP-Gas mixture and LP-Gas storage and sales to wholesale markets.  The facility consists of propane storage tanks, butane storage tanks, and LP-Gas mixture storage tanks with their associated pipeline, valves, pumps, and compressors on site.  Propane, the butanes (LPG), and the NFPA-4 LP-Gas mixture are the regulated substances handled as part of the LP-Gas storage and sales process.  Concentrations of Hydrogen Sulfide is a toxic substance present in the gas at the plant.  The facility is classified as Program Level 3 under the regulation.

Because the processes at the plant regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency\u00bfs (EPA\u00bfs) Risk Management Program (RMP) and are also subject to the OSHA PSM, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\nEmployee Participation: Active employee participation and involvement in the development and implementation of Bazor Ridge Gas Plant\u00bfs PSM program is an important step toward achieving the objective to prevent or minimize the consequences of catastrophic releases of toxic, reactive, flammable, or explosive chemicals.  Employee involvement will help to ensure that all perspectives regarding PSM are considered, and that the best ideas are implemented.  Open communications are encouraged between supervisors and employees regarding all safety and health issues.  Bazor Ridge Gas Plant strongly promotes employee involvement in safety issues through existing programs.  These programs include Unit Safety Teams (which are made up of a cross section of employees and supervision), regularly scheduled safety meetings, tail-gate safety meetings, Hazard Communication, Safety Suggestion Forms, and special training programs (emergency response training, first aid, etc.).\n\nProcess Safety Information: Complete and accurate written process safety information (PSI) concerning process chemicals, process technology, and process equipment is essential to an effective PSM and RMP program and to completing and maintaining a process hazard analysis (PHA).  The PSI will be useful to the operators; the team performing the PHA; those in charge of training; contract"

The review and certification process involves both operators and technical staff.\n\nTraining: In addition to training on operating procedures, the facility has a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating the process.  New employees receive basic training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years.  All of this training is documented for each operator including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\nContractors: Bazor Ridge uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods for increased maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the gas plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have appropriate skills, (3) are aware of the hazards of their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site specific safety rules, and (6) inform gas plant personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.  This is accomplished by providing contractors with orientation sessions pertaining to these key points.\n\nPre-startup Safety Review (PSSR): Bazor Ridge Gas Plant conducts a PSSR on any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in process safety information.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with design specifications and that all-supporting systems are operationally ready.  The PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves as a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemen"

The basic aspects of this program include (1) training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting equipment deficiencies when identified, and (5) applying quality assurance measures.  In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process.\n\nSafe Work Practices: Bazor Ridge has long standing safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety.  Examples of these include (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous substances before process piping and equipment is opened, (4) a permit and procedure to control spark-producing activities (i.e. hot work), and (5) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space.  These procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\n\nManagement of Change: Bazor Ridge Gas Plant has a comprehensive system to manage changes to all covered processes.  This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented.  Changes are reviewed to ensure that adequate controls have not been compromised by the change. Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on the change.\n\nIncident Investigation: Bazor Ridge Gas Plant promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in or reasonably could have resulted in,"

The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a reoccurrence, and forwards these results to the business management team for resolution.\n\nCompliance Audits: To help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, the Bazor Ridge Gas Plant periodically conducts an audit to determine whether procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented.  Compliance audits are conducted at least every 3 years.  Both hourly and staff personnel participate as audit team members.
