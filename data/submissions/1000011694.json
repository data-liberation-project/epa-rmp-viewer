The average amount of chlorine used is 550 pounds per day at the water treatment plant and 125 pounds per day at the wastewater treatment plant. The feed system consists of five (5) W & T V-Notch type chlorinators at the water treatment plant and two (2) W & T V-Notch chlorinators at the wastewater treatment plant. During normal operation, ten (10) cylinders (1 ton each) are connected in parallel to the manifold system at the water treatment plant with two (2) cylinders (1 ton each) connected at the wastewater treatment plant. The manifolds are a split type with\nautomatic switchover systems allowing selected amounts of cylinders to be used at a given time.\nStorage room capacity at the water treatment is sixteen (1 ton cylinders) and six (1 ton cylinders) at the\nwastewater treatment plant. Normal operation would be three (3) cylinders in service with three (3)\ncylinders ready to switch over for use at the water treatment plant.

There are Safety Officers at the Treatment Plants, with their primary job consisting in Plant Operations and then secondary as Safety, in which they coordinate all inspections, safety equipment and employee assistance in safety at the Treatment Plants.\nPROGRAM ADMINISTRATION\nBowling Green Municipal Utilities on April 27, 1989 hired a full-time Safety Director so that BGMU could\ndevelop and implement a written Safety Program. With the hiring be completed, the major obstacle was\nachieving compliance in the OSHA, EPA and DOT regulations so that BGMU and all the employees would have a safe and healthful work environment. To this date the Safety Department now handles all of the\ncompliance programs in the Electric, Water and Sewer Divisions, with the only exception being environmental issues that directly involve the Industrial Wastewater Pretreatment Program, which the Industrial Pretreatment Director handles. Bowling Green Municipal Utilities initialized a Safety Committee on October 26, 1994 starting with a member from each work area for a total of 10 members. This committee makes its recommendations for health and safety issues that include investigations of injuries/accidents. Bowling Green Municipal Utilities insures that each employee upon being hired is issued an employee handbook, in which this book explains many benefits, employment rules, insurance plans, work hours and policies. On March 3, 2008 Bowling Green Municipal Utilities hired a Safety Coordinator to assist the Safety Director with all health and safety issues within the company.\nTRAINING\nBowling Green Municipal Utilities Safety Department develops an"
