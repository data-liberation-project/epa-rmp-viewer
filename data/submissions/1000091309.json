The facility was originaly constructed  in 1995 and the capacity was increased in 1999.  The facility uses chlorine to disinfect the effluent.  There is never more than 6000 pounds of chlorine in the process at any given time.  The District has implemented many safety precautions to prevent and mitigate any chlorine release.  Additionally, the plant location is rather remote.  Most accidental releases would not be a threat to the populace.  Our personnel are, and will continue to be trained in emergency procedures.  The Lumberton Fire Department would respond in the event of an emergency.  We are very proud of the fact that there has never been a reportable chlorine leak at this facility.  We believe, because  of our dedication to safety awareness, operating and handling procedures, the possibility of a problem chlorine release is at it's minimum."
