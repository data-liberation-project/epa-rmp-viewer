Box 291, Cozad, NE  69130\n\nRISK MANAGEMENT PLAN - EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nFACILITY POLICY:\n\nThe management and employees operating each of our facilities are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of hazardous material transported or stored on our locations.  In the event an accidental release should occur, we are prepared to work with our Local Fire Company, Emergency Response Personnel and other appropriate authorities deemed applicable depending on the specific incident, to best mitigate any release and to minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\nFACILITY INFORMATION:\n\nThe primary activity of our company is NAICS code 422510, \"establishments primarily engaged in operating country or terminal grain elevators\" however, we are also engaged in providing \"agricultural inputs\" that include the recieving, storage and reloading of Anhydrous Ammonia for delivery to farmers in our area.  The NAICS code we feel most applicable for receiving, storing and reloading is #493130 \"farm product warehousing and storage\".  Although Anhydrous Ammonia is the only product subject to the EPA Risk Management Plan at this time, it should be noted that we also handle crop protectants and petroleum products which are included in our planning, training and maintenance programs, however only the Anhydrous Ammonia facilities will be included in this report.\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application to farm fields during the early spring and fall months.  During the balance of the year, little if any product transfer occurs.  For approximately one week per year, Anhydrous Ammonia may be included in a process ( T-reactor ) of blending to make a 10-34-0 star"

      "SummaryText": "ter grade of liquid fertilizer.   The maximum quantity stored in pressurized permanent storage vessels at the location described is 260,000 Lbs. however, it should be noted that during the month of April, there could be as much as 624,000 lbs. in railcars at the site.  Only one car will be connected to the offloading plumbing at any given time.  The maximum on site vessel size is 30,000 Gallons, storing 130,000  Lbs.  The maximum quantity handled at a given time would be the off loading of a rail tank car (ranging from 156,000 to 198,000 lbs)., or a semi-trailer vehicle tank holding 40,000 to 42,000 lbs.\n\n\n\nThe facility is operated on an \"as needed\" basis with staff present only during the receiving and reloading of product for delivery.  Total annual hours for these needs do not meet the 2,080 hour rerquirement to qualify as a \"full time employee\" on site, therefore item number 1.11 is Zero.  Our facilities have adequate lighting and are inspected at various times of day and night throughout the year.  Time expended for these inspections is not included in our staffing calculations.\n\nWORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO:\n\nThe \"worst-case release scenario\" is considered to be the release of the total contents of our largest Anhydrous Ammonia tank.  The maximum quantity released based on 85% tank capacity as limited by design standards, the distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) miles based on EPA's RMP-Comp Program (Version 1.06) as well as possible public and environmental receptorswithin the area have been provided to the County LEPC (Local Emergency Planning Committee) to assist them in their planning.\n\nALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO:\n\nThere has not  been an actual release of Anhydrous Ammonia during the last 5-years at the site.  We believe the most likely release would be caused by a break in a transfer hose.  Transfer hoses are protected by manual and self-closing excess flwo valves, so our alternative release scenario is based on the loss of contents"

(ANSI) K-61.1 \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\"; the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) standard 29CFR1910.111 \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\".

We also maintain routine contact with our local fire department and emergency response personnel and have provided and/or participated in safety training exercises on Anhydrous Ammonia.  We have developed an Emergency Action Plan for employees, customers and visitor protection in event of fire, explosion, tornado and other acts of god that initiates evacuation, emergency medical care, contacts for assistance, etc. for all areas of our company including the Anhydrous Ammonia Facility included in this plan.

We also include these materials in our own Emergency Action Plan in accordance with OSHA Standard 29CFR1910.38.

We actively encourage participation in our Anhydrous Ammonia training programs by the local fire department, local emergency team, communithy planners, etc. that may be expected to respond to an incident at our site.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY:\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at all of our facilities.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no additional specific recommendations for implementation at this time.\n\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION:\n\nFor additional information, response to questions or comments, please contact:\n\nArlan Ronnekamp at 308-537-7145"
