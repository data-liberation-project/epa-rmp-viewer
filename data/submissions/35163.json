Our Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nWe at Rhodia, Inc., Baton Rouge, LA, are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, hazard analysis, installation, operating procedures, mechanical integrity, management of change, incident investigation and employee training associated with the processes at our Baton Rouge facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. The Rhodia Baton Rouge site has also established an Emergency Response Team, consisting of plant personnel, that is well trained and prepared to respond to emergency situations.\n\n\n2.  Our Facility and the Regulated Substances handled\n\nOur Baton Rouge facility produces Sulfuric Acid, Oleum, Sulfur Dioxide, Hydroquinone, Catechol, Vanillin and Ethyl Vanillin. Our facility\u00bfs manufacturing activities encompass Sulfuric Acid Regeneration from Spent Acid, Oleum and Liquid Sulfur Dioxide Production, Diphenols Ethers Production and Hazardous Waste Incineration. There are 6 RMP-covered processes at our facility that together handle 11 regulated substances. These substances, in alphabetical order, are Allyl Alcohol, Carbon Disulfide, Epichlorohydrin, Ethyl Chloride, Methyl Chloride, Methyl Mercaptan, Oleum, Propionitrile, Sulfur Dioxide, Toluene Di-Isocyanate and Vinyl Acetate.  \nOleum is produced in two process areas and stored at a third area at the site for use as a chemical intermediate, as a drying agent and as a raw material for dyes and detergents.  Sulfur dioxide is produced and stored in one process area at our site for use as a chemical intermediate, refrigerant, bleaching and food processing."

      "SummaryText": "The maximum inventories of Oleum and Sulfur dioxide at our facility could be as high as 16.0 million\u00a0lb and 2.8 million\u00a0lb respectively. \nEthyl Chloride and Methyl Chloride are stored and used as raw materials in another process area at our site to produce various diphenol ethers. The maximum inventories of Ethyl Chloride and Methyl Chloride at our facility could be as high as 102,000 lb and 95,000\u00a0lb respectively. \nPropionitrile, Vinyl Acetate, Carbon Disulfide, Epichlorohydrin, Methyl Mercaptan, Toluene Di-Isocyanate and Allyl Alcohol could each be received in another process area at our site as individual waste streams that would be incinerated on site for energy recovery and/or raw material value.  The maximum inventory on site of the Propionitrile-containing waste stream could be as high as 512,500 lb. The maximum inventory on site of the individual waste streams for Vinyl acetate, or Carbon Disulfide or Allyl Alcohol could be as high as 51,000 lb each (at 100% conc'n). The maximum inventory on site of the individual waste streams containing Epichlorohydrin (at 50% conc\u00bfn), or Methyl Mercaptan (at 10% conc\u00bfn) or Toluene Di-Isocyanate (at 35% conc\u00bfn) could be as high as 48,000\u00a0lb, 158,000\u00a0lb and 40,000\u00a0lb respectively. \n\n\n3. Our General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe Rhodia Baton Rouge facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR 68 of the EPA RMP regulations. The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our facility.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nRhodia, Inc., Baton Rouge Facility maintains detailed records of safety information that describes the properties and hazards of the chemicals used in our manufacturing units, the process technology employed, safe operating parameters and safety instrumented systems, and equipment specifications and designs associated with al"
