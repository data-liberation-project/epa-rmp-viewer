      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nGRELTON ELEVATOR, Inc.\n\nPropane Storage for Grain Dryer Fuel\n\nCOMPANY ATTITUDE TOWARD EMPLOYEE AND COMMUNITY SAFETY\nGrelton Elevator is owned, managed, and operated by local families living in close proximity to the operation.  The facility is located in the small community of Grelton, Ohio, populated by some of the same people associated with the elevator.  The point is, the operation, the community, and local families are very closely entwined.  The operation has a very high vested interest in a safe operation.  Secondly, the owners are local, well-known, and highly visible in the community.  Being family operated, they have a deep-felt and personal responsibility for employee and community safety.  The grain handling operation has been the foundation for the prospering of the local farming community for nearly a century.  During that time, employee safety, as well as its presence in the local economic environment, is evidenced by a long history of a safe working environment.\n\nRELATION TO REGULATED SUBSTANCES \nBeing a country elevator in rural Henry County, the Grelton Elevator performs the traditional roles of receiving, conditioning, storage of corn, soybeans, wheat, and oats for local farmers.  These grains are harvested at physiological maturity, yet the moisture level of these grains is frequently too high for long term storage of grain.  A fundamental process of conditioning for storage is the application of artificial heat and large volumes of forced air to reduce the moisture content.  Propane is the fuel source for providing heat for the grain dryer.  The storage tank is placed in the far eastern perimeter of the elevator property.  This location of placement was based on the desire for the tank to be far away from vehicular traffic and activates at the elevator.  This placement also maximizes the distance from any local residence.  Accessibility to the storage tank is not an issue since the tank is refilled fewer than three times/ year"

      "SummaryText": ".\n\nRELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\nThe storage tank was installed under current best industry standards.  Propane is received in largest possible quantities to reduce frequency of attaching/detaching hoses.  The site of the tank was purposefully chosen to be far from vehicular or human contact.  Inventory of stored propane is taken regularly for early detection of lost product even though the use of dryer fuel is seasonal.  Grelton Elevator insists on the local supplier inspecting the installation and approving the tank for receiving and storage of propane before any deliveries.\nInvolvement of outside safety forces is requested by the elevator.  Regular inspections by the local fire department are expected.  The elevator volunteered as the county-wide training site of the Henry County LEPC in fall of 2002. This training exercise was a mock emergency, involving county fire departments, county EMS Services, and the Henry County Sheriff Department.\nSudden Release flow valves are installed to close piping in event of sudden pressure release.\n\nACCIDENT HISTORY\nGrelton Elevator?s attention to safe working practices and fuel storage design has resulted in no measurable or detectable release of propane since installation.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE\nGrelton?s Emergency Response Plan recognizes the risks of the storage to workers and community.  In event of a release, Grelton has plans to notify the Henry County LEPC immediately.  Cooperatively, the elevator and county response officials have identified people at risk in residential situations and have procedures in place to notify possible affected residents.  If an evacuation would be deemed necessary by the county safety officials, mass transportation with local school buses is available.  The existence of propane has been reported on the annual report for \"The Community Emergency Planning and Right-To-Know Report\" to state and county safety and emergency officials.\n  No intuitions of confinement ? schools, hospitals, commercial cente"

They feel the best plan is to continue their schedule of annual training of safe handling of hazardous materials for employees.  They plan to continue the close working relationship with local and county safety officials.  No modifications in size of storage are planned."
