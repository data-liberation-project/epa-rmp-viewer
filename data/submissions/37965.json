As a result, accidental release prevention and emergency responsibilities have been instituted which include: operating and maintenance procedures, training and incident investigation programs for handling chlorine, notification of trained personnel, an on-site emergency response plan and procedures for notification of local emergency planning individuals in the event that local emergency response is needed.\n\nThe chlorine-specific accidental release prevention program in place at the facility provides written procedures that incorporated operational and maintenance data and training procedures for dependable use of relief valves, leak detection systems and alarms.  \n\nNo accidents have occurred in the last five years.  Procedures are in place to identify and record any future accidents or incidents.\n\nAn on-site Emergency Response Program, including and evacuation plan, assembly areas, and other safety information has been developed.  This program has been coordinated with the City of Baltimore?s Emergency Response Program ? SARA title III off-site response plan.  The off-site plan will supersede the on-site response program in the event that an accidental release extends beyond the facility?s boundary.  \n\nThe City will updated the program as required and will review the program every five (5) years or when applicable on-site conditions change."
