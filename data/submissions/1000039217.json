It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\r\n\r\n2.\tThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\r\n\r\nOur facility's primary activities encompass WHOLESALE CHEMICAL DISTRIBUTOR. We have 1 regulated substance present at our facility. This substance is Chlorine. Chlorine is used for Resale to Municipalities for Potable Drinking Water.\r\n\r\n3.\tThe Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario.\r\n\r\nTo evacuate the worst case scenarios, we have used the EPA's OCA Guidance Reference Tables or Equations. For alternative release scenario analyses we have employed the same. The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\r\n\r\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 2 toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from Gas Chlorine. In this scenario 7950.50 lb. of Chlorine is released. The toxic gas released is assumed to form a 1-cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place. The entire pool is estimated to evaporate over 10 minutes. The released quantity has been limited to 100% of the maximum capacity of the source by a system of administrative controls. At Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s wind speed, the maximum distance of 12 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.0087 mg/L.\r\n\r\n4.\tThe General Accidental Release"
