We take our environmental responsibilities very seriously.  The investments Clemens has made in environmental stewardship result in a cleaner environment and the conservation of our precious resources.  Clemens is committed to constant reinvestment into its facility to keep its equipment and processes modern and efficient, resulting in the highest level of equipment integrity and safety for our employees and the surrounding communities.\n\n\n\nWith the submission of this Risk Management Plan (RMP), Clemens continues to show its commitment to operate the facility and all its processes in a safe, environmentally responsible manner. Emergency response planning and an accidental release prevention program are in place to ensure a safe working environment and with it, protection of the public and the environment outside the property lines.\n\n\n\nFACILITY DESCRIPTION AND SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\n\n\nClemens is a family owned and operated company that has been in business since 1895.  Clemens is a manufacturer and supplier of quality fresh and manufactured pork products for retail and foodservice industries.  The operations performed at the plant include: slaughtering, cutting, processing manufacturing, and rendering.\n\n\n\nThe facility has ammonia refrigeration systems on site to provide freezing and cooling capabilities.  This Risk Management Plan was developed for these ammonia refrigeration systems.\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nThe ammonia system at Clemens is subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management Rule (PSM Rule).  The management system developed based on this regulation together with elements of the Risk Management Program results in a comprehensive prevention program.  Clemens is committed to maintaining this system. \n\n\n\nThe elements of the p"

It is the policy of the facility management to implement the requirements of this ER Plan by managing and operating the facility in accordance with the OSHA PSM and EPA RMP regulations and general good operating practices.  The objective is to minimize the risk of a fire or an accidental hazardous material release.  The ER Plan was developed to ensure fast and efficient response in case of an emergency situation.\n\n\n\nThe ER Plan identifies the emergency response organization, the procedures for notification and evacuation, and emergency preparedness and planning.\n\n\n\nClemens has assigned roles for its emergency response coordinator, alternate emergency response coordinators, and emergency response team.  These emergency coordinator and alternates are responsible for emergency actions as well as coordination with state and local agencies on a 24-hour basis.  The emergency coordinator functions as the leader of the emergency response team, initiates plant evacuation if needed, notifies the appropriate governmental agencies and offsite responders, and is responsible for documenting and reporting after the emergency.  The emergency response team provides additional support.\n\n\n\nIn addition, the ER Plan details the responsibility of the first aid team, the emergency procedures, and th"

Part of this commitment is maintaining and operating the system in accordance with the principles and requirements of the OSHA PSM and EPA RMP plans.  Currently the facility is replacing some older equipment and piping with new equipment and piping to improve safety at the facility."
