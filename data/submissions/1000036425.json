This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures.  Suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures are made when the team finds such measures are necessary.\n\n\n\nTo ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, WVC will update and revalidate the hazard analysis results at least once every five years for the life of the process. The results and findings from these updates will be documented and forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution documented and retained.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\n\n\nWVC maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) shutdown, and (4) initial startup of a new process.  Temporary and emergency operating procedures are developed for each case prior to commencement of the operation.  These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  Procedures are maintained current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.

The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to plant management.  Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until they are complete. When necessary, short-term interim measures are taken until the permanent fix is implemented.  The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings. Incident investigation reports are retained on file for at least five years to supplement the hazard analysis records for the affected areas, and are reviewed during PHAs and PHA revalidations.  WVC implemented a non-conformance report database and an employee improvement program in November 2003.  \n\n\n\nCompliance Audits\n\n\n\nTo help ensure that the process safety program is functioning properly, WVC periodically undergoes an audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required are being implemented.
