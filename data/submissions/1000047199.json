Applicable procedures of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Prevention Program are generally adhered to.  Regency's emergency response policy involves the preparation of response plans which are tailored to each facility and to the emergency response services available in the community, and is in compliance with the EPA Emergency Response Program requirements.  Regency's spill policy seeks to implement appropriate controls to prevent accidental releases of regulate substances.  If such a release does occur, the Facility personnel are prepared to work with the local fire department, Local Emergency Planning Commission and other authorities to control and mitigate the effects of the release.\r\n\r\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE HANDLED (40 CFR 68.155(B))\r\n\r\nThe primary activity at the Holt Plant, herein referenced as the stationary source and the facility, is the handling and compression of natural gas.  In addition, as part of the facility operations, natural gas liquids (NGL) are separated from the natural gas stream, stored on site, an sold to a petroleum refiner.  The flammable regulated chemical substances at the facility are a chemical mixture containing methane, ethane, propane, isobutene, N-butane, isopentane and N-pentane.  This substance exceeds the regulated threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds (lbs.).  The maximum inventory of the chemical mixture is 69,504 lbs.\r\n\r\nTHE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND THE CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS (40 CFR 68.155(D))\r\n\r\nThe facility has taken the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements of 40 CFR 68.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with applicable state and federal regulations as listed in the RMP.  The follo"

The Emergency Response Plan describes response procedures to minimize hazards to human health and the environment in the event of a regulated substance accidental release.  Aspects of emergency response include adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas.  In the event of a covered process accident, first aid procedures, and procedures to inform authorities and the public are described in the Emergency Response Plan.  A general emergency practice drill is performed at least annually.\r\n\r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY (40 CFR 68.155(G))\r\n\r\nMaintenance checks and incident investigations will identify changes to improve safety.
