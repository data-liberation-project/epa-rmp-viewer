This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\r\n\r\n1.)\tTo save lives.\r\n2.)\tTo minimize and avoid injuries.\r\n3.)\tTo protect the environment.\r\n4.)\tTo minimize property damage.\r\n\r\nBama Frozen Dough maintains an emergency response team whose members are the designated emergency coordinators for the facility.  The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year.  This Plan will be reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations, as well as to incorporate any facility changes.\r\n\r\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\r\n\r\nThe Bama Frozen Dough facility prepares frozen bakery products for distribution.  The refrigeration process, consisting of piping, valves, and equipment, cycles ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration for process equipment and cold storage rooms.  Typical operating conditions range from vacuum (approximately 15.5 Hg) on the low pressure side of the system to 180 psig on the high side.\r\n\r\nAmmonia is used as the refrigerant in the refrigeration process.\r\n\r\nThe total ammonia inventory is 57,000 pounds.\r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\n\r\nIn order to operate the ammonia refrigeration system, the facility complies with the following risk management regulations:\r\n\r\n1)  \tOSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM); and\r\n2)  \tEPA's Risk Management Program (RMP).\r\n\r\nThe facility also follows r"

      "SummaryText": "ecognized standards and good engineering practices using state and local codes and IIAR standards.\r\n\r\nIt is important to note that the refrigeration system has been designed with several safety features to prevent the accidental release of ammonia.  For example, the compressors are equipped with safety mechanisms that will cause the units to shut down if operating conditions exceed designated safety limits.  Also, level indicators, alarms, and switches are installed in key points within the system to monitor the supply of liquid ammonia and to ensure that a vessel is not overfilled.  The facility has also installed ammonia sensors throughout the facility which will alert plant personnel in the event of an ammonia detection.\r\n\r\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nAn investigation into the facility's accident history revealed that Bama Frozen Dough has had no RMP reportable ammonia releases in the last five years (February 2009 - February 2014).  Such accidents would involve serious accidents with either on-site deaths, injuries, or significant damage; or known, off-site deaths, injuries, property damage, or environmental damage.  In addition, there have been no significant releases of ammonia that exceeded the Federal Reportable Quantity of 100 pounds.  However, the facility has had a few small releases within this time frame that triggered an incident investigation. The incidents are described as follows:\r\n\r\nJuly 2009 Incident\r\nAt about 3 PM on July 22, 2009, refrigeration technicians found that one of the recirculator pumps (RP-8) was leaking.  The leak was coming from the pump's oil reservoir.  The refrigeration technicians isolated the pump and tightened the bolts on its end plate to stop the leak.  The pump was put back into service shortly after the leak had stopped.  In the early morning of the following day, the pump started leaking again as two maintenance technicians were starting up compressors RC-2 and RC-8.  Liquid ammonia was spraying from the oil reservoir"

      "FacilityID": 1000047826,
      "SummaryText": ".  The maintenance technicians donned their respirators then isolated the pump to stop the leak.  An investigation into the incident revealed that the pump seal may have been contaminated when it was rebuilt on July 21, 2009.  In addition, the end plate for the oil reservoir may have been misseated, causing the pump to leak.  Approximately 7 pounds of ammonia was released on July 22, 2009 and 2 pounds released on July 23, 2009, for a total of 9 pounds.  There were no injuries that resulted from this incident.  As part of the incident investigation, recommendations were made to investigate the maintenance procedures on refrigeration pump rebuilds and to provide further training for personnel that rebuild the pumps. These recommendations were completed on August 13, 2009.\r\n\r\nAugust 2013 Incident\r\nThe most recent incident occurred on August 23, 2013.  A refrigeration technician smelled ammonia on the north side of the plant around 10:15 am.  A leak had developed in a pump out nipple on the bottom of the return line from the Shick Heat Exchanger to the Shick Heat Exchanger surge drum.  The technician isolated the heat exchanger and surge drum, pumped out the equipment, and changed the nipple.  This nipple was screwed (vs. welded), was a smaller schedule than standard (SCH 40 vs. SCH 80), and had corroded over time.  Approximately 55 pounds of ammonia was estimated to have leaked based on the orifice diameter, pressure, and duration of the release.  To prevent recurrence, similar pump out nipples were evaluated for their mechanical integrity in June 2014.\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\r\n\r\nBama Frozen Dough has an Emergency Response Program in place.  The facility has an Emergency Response Team that is trained on an annual basis.  All Emergency Response Team members are fit tested and respiratory trained annually.\r\n\r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\n\r\nBama Frozen Dough has worked to address safety issues as they arise in a continued effort to ensure a safe work environme"
