In case of an emergency, Solvay's emergency response procedure will help ensure that accidents will be mitigated properly without undue risk to the public, environment, employees, and contractors, or other personnel within the plant.\n\n\n\nSolvay has implemented programs and procedures that comply with EPA's Level 3 Accidental Release Prevention Program Rule.\n\n1. Worst-case release scenario for Epichlorohydrin can impact persons across the property boundary of the nearest public receptor.\n\n\n\nThe accidental release program is designed to systematically accomplish the following functions:\n\n\n\n1. Control the creation and retention of safety information regarding the regulated substances, processes and equipment.\n\n2. Conduct periodic hazard reviews to identify, evaluate, and control process hazards associated with the regulated substance, processes, and procedure.\n\n3. Create, maintain, and evaluate operating procedures for activities within or near processes that use regulated substances.\n\n4. Provide training for personnel who operate covered processes so that they safely perform their jobs.\n\n5. Monitor and control maintenance activities that can affect the mechanical integrity of equipment used in covered processes.\n\n6."
