Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies:\n\nAt this facility, we produce fluorine and fluorine derivative gases for packaging into compressed gas cylinders or tube trailers.  During the fluorine manufacturing process, we use hydrogen fluoride as a raw material.  We also re-package anhydrous hydrogen chloride and ethyl chloride from bulk storage tanks.  Anhydrous ammonia is used in a reaction with fluorine to produce one of the fluorine derivative gases and is purified and packaged into other bulk containers.  Arsine and phosphine cylinders and trichlorosilane containers are stored in our shipping/receiving area.  A-5 containers of boron trichloride are received and stored to be eventually repackaged into small cylinders.  All nine chemicals listed above, in the amounts handled by our facility, are considered hazardous by the EPA.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and state rules and regulations.  Air Products manages the safety of the regulated processes by means of operating procedures, equipment testing and inspections, safety devices (e.g., alarms, shutdowns, instrumentation, relief devices) inherent in the design of this facility and other controls and systems designed to prevent accidental releases of hazardous chemicals.  Safe work practices and training of our personnel supplement the inherent safe design of the plant.\n\nOur emergency response program is based upon OSHA?s HAZWOPER regulation.  The emergency response plan includes procedures for the notification of the local fire authority and Hazardous Materials unit so that appropriate measures can be taken by local emergency responders to control accidental releases.\n\nThis document has been prepared in accordance with the EPA?s Risk Management Plan regulation (40 CFR, Part 68).

The stationary source and regulated substances handled:\n\nThe primary purpose of this facility is the production of specialty and electronic gases and chemicals.  A majority of these gases are derived from fluorine, which is generated at the site in electrolytic cells by electrical decomposition of hydrogen fluoride.  Hydrogen is generated as a by-product, which is vented in small amounts to the atmosphere.  The electrolysis takes place in a cell containing hydrogen fluoride with dissolved potassium bifluoride.  The majority of the fluorine is cooled by liquid nitrogen to remove residual hydrogen fluoride and potassium fluoride carried over from the electrolytic cells.  After these impurities are removed, the gas is compressed for distribution to the various fluorine users throughout the facility.\n\nThe hydrogen fluoride is also transfilled into smaller containers, or cylinders.  The hydrogen fluoride is brought on site by railcar that is placed inside a totally enclosed containment building.  The hydrogen fluoride is then fed directly from the railcar to the fluorine plant or pumped into cylinders or ton containers, which are stored and maintained on site for shipment to customers.  \n\nThis facility also re-packages anhydrous hydrogen chloride.  The hydrogen chloride is brought on site by railcar.  From the railcar, it is transferred through a series of heat exchangers and pumps to the tube trailers and cylinders.  Also, tube trailers and cylinder storage of hydrogen chloride are maintained.\n\nBulk quantities of ethyl chloride are brought on site primarily by railcar and loaded into a storage tank.  From there, the material is pumped into cylinders, which are stored and maintained on site for shipment.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is brought on site by tank truck and pumped into a stationary storage tank.  It is used as a raw material in the production of nitrogen trifluoride (NF3).  NF3 is made by "

A full vessel inventory of 89,000 pounds is assumed to be released and ignite, resulting in a VCE.

For anhydrous hydrogen chloride, the ACS is the failure of a safety device on a single tube of a tube trailer, resulting in a release of 3000 pounds of hydrogen chloride over a 15-minute period.  The 15-minute release duration is the approximate time it takes for the tube to empty.

      "SummaryText": "n opening of about 24 square inches.  The entire contents of the tank, about 89,000 pounds, are released over a period of 40 minutes through this opening.  The maximum distance to the EPA-defined flammable endpoint of 1- psi overpressure for this ACS does not reach receptors off-site.\n\nThe ACS for trichlorosilane is a container being punctured by a fork lift.  The entire contents of the container (550 pounds) would be released in less than 5 minutes.  The maximum distance to the EPA-defined flammable endpoint using the lower flammable limit of 6.9% by volume for this ACS does not reach receptors off-site\n\n4.  The general accidental release prevention program and specific prevention steps:\n\nThe facility developed prevention program elements based on the Federal EPA?s Accidental Release Prevention Plan and OSHA?s Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation.  This facility was designed and constructed to comply with applicable state and industry codes.\n\n5.  Five-year accident history:\n\nThis facility came on line in March of 1973.  In the last five years, there have been no accidents involving or accidental releases of flammable or toxic gas that resulted in any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n6.  The emergency response program:\n\nEmployees that are members of the on-site emergency response team at the facility will respond to emergencies beyond initiating emergency response from outside agencies.  All on-site ER team members have undergone training in nearly all of the alternate case scenarios.  All facility employees have been trained to OSHA?s HAZWOPER, First Responder Awareness Level in order to identify the need for an initiated response.  Retraining is conducted annually.\n\nThe facility maintains an Emergency Procedure Manual that contains specific procedures for employees to take in the event of an emergency or accidental release"
