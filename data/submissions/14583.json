Our facility makes products which help produce better and healthier foods.  We also make products to eliminate pests indoors and outdoors.\nAt Zeneca, Safety,  Health, and the Environment are always our top priorities.  They are top priorities from product development right on through its final use.  This benefits our community,  our customers,  and our employees.\nIt is the responsibility of Zeneca Cold Creek management to identify and control risks to an acceptable level. \nWe are an accepted part of our community because we strive to meet all relevant laws and regulations so that we can protect the health of all employees and our neighbors,  and reduce environmental impact to a practical minimum.  We participate in our Lemoyne Industrial Park Community Advisory Panel which is an active and worthwhile panel.  We are also active members of the Chemical Manufacturers Association (CMA) Phosgene Panel.\nWe have adopted a \"Zero Tolerance\" philosophy defined as the level of acceptance the organization has for leaks,  spills,  and incidents.  Zero Tolerance means that we don't accept incidents and injuries as a given.  We recognize they are preventable and we are accountable to establish their cause and elimination.  Zero Tolerance is a  part of our culture.  It is   accepted proactively,  pursued during work activities by every member of the Cold Creek Site.\nWe have worked almost 6 years and close to3.5 million manhours without a Lost Time Injury.  Our Toxic Release Inventory (TRI) has been reduced more than 99% since 1992. \n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Guidelines\n\nZeneca Cold Creek also follows 19 SHE ( Safety, Health, & Environmental) Standards as defined by the Zeneca board in consultation with the Chief Executive Officers of the Business. \nThe 19 Standards are:\n1)  Safety,  Health,  and Environment (SHE) commitment\n2)  Management and"

Presently,  we are in our third year of revalidating the initial Hazard Studies by reviewing  and evaluating the initial process hazard analysis,  reviewing all modifications to the process,  and reviewing all incidents that have occurred since the initial analysis.  Teams are used to conduct the studies and findings or recommendations for improvement are monitored.\n\nCold Creek operates an extensive Mechanical Integrity Program.  We conduct periodic inspections and tests on piping,  vessels,  relief devices,  rotating equipment,  and instrument and electrical equipment.\nPiping is checked by visually inspecting every flange for corrosion of the flange and the bolts.  Alignment and torquing is also checked.  Non-destructive testing is performed on the pipe and re-inspection is based on the remaining life of the piping system.

They contain 4 inches of insulation and an outer steel jacket. DOT sets the regulations for the shipment, and specifications for the construction of the cars. They are equipped with 375 psig safety valves.  The cars are inspected every two years. \nThe cars are located on a dead-end siding,  the brakes are set and the wheels blocked.
