      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\r\nIntroduction\r\nNielsen & Bainbridge, LLC. (NielsenBainbridge)  operates a foam manufacturing plant at 7830A West 71st Street, Suite A, in Bridgeview, Illinois (facility).  The facility is subject to the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) Risk Management Program as outlined in 40 CFR Part 68 because it operates a 12,000-gallon (58,440 pounds) butane vessel that exceeds the established threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds established for regulated flammable substances.  With appropriate precautions, as described in the RMP, butane can be safely utilized at the facility.  \r\n\r\nNielsenBainbridge used to operate a foam manufacturing facility at 8301 South 77th Avenue in Bridgeview, Illinois, under the Risk Management Plan entitled Isopentane Risk Management Plan (EPA Identification Number 1100 0057 4049).  In 2004, the facility relocated to a new building located at 7830A West 71st Street, in Bridgeview, Illinois.    \r\n\r\nSince 2004, NielsenBainbridge has been using butane instead of isopentane during the foam manufacturing processes. The facility is operating under the Butane Risk Management Plan originally prepared by CPI Environmental Services, Inc. and dated November 2003.  In compliance with 40 CFR 68.190 (b), this plan has been updated to reflect changes in management and corresponding emergency contact information at the Facility.  \r\nButane Process\r\n\r\nThe facility utilizes a 12,000-gallon liquefied petroleum gas (butane) vessel.  Butane is stored in a pressurized aboveground vessel to keep it liquefied.  The butane vessel was constructed in accordance with ASME code and installed in conformation with the requirements of NFPA Standard #58.  Butane is delivered in a tanker truck by an outside vendor.  \r\n\r\nButane is a colorless, odorless liquid, which readily evaporates into a gas.  Its vapor pressure is approximately 17 psig at 70 degree F.  It is flammable and readily forms explosive air-vapor mixtures at ambient temperature.  It i"

It can flow for long distances along the ground, and can collect in drains, gullies, and cellars.  \r\n\r\nButane is used as a foam-blowing agent. The foam is utilized for various packaging applications.  In the foam manufacturing process, the blowing agent (butane) is injected into melted plastic pellets in an extruder at temperatures of 375-440 degree F along with color additives and aging agents.  The mixture exits through a specially designed die head with a resultant loss of pressure, allowing the blowing agent to expand to ambient pressure, which in turn, transforms the plastic into a foamed material.  \r\n\r\nThe storage vessel has been installed outdoors within a secured area away from general manufacturing and work areas where employees may reside.  The tank area is protected with bollards and a concrete wall, which surrounds the tank.  In addition, engineered safety devices installed include emergency shutoff devices, high and low pressure shut down devices, hydrostatic and pressure relief valves, excess flow valves, check valves, vapor recovery, pressure transducers, and gas detection alarm and shutdown system.\r\n\r\nHazard Assessment\r\nA hazard assessment, including offsite consequence analysis, has been prepared for the facility to evaluate hazards associated with a potential release of butane from a worst-case release scenario and an alternative release scenario.  The USEPA's RMP*Comp model (1.07 version) was used to perform offsite consequence analyses.  \r\n\r\nFive-Year Accident History\r\nNielsenBainbridge has been in operation as a foam manufacturer since 1997 and has had no reportable accidents in the last five years.  \r\n\r\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program \r\nNielsenBainbridge has a thorough Emergency Action Plan which covers emergency preplanning, evacuation procedures and agency notification procedures as required by OSHA under 29 CFR 1910.38.  NielsenBainbridge has an extensive safety train"

Safety training is required as part of the annual refresher courses and for new employees.  Evacuation drills are performed annually.\r\n\r\nNielsenBainbridge has a thorough Process Safety Management (PSM) Program as required by 29 CFR 1910.119.  As part of the PSM, a process hazard analysis was performed using a \"What If\" scenario in conjunction with a process flow diagram.  The effects of fire, explosion, and equipment failure were evaluated as part of the hazard analysis.  The facility has an inspection and preventative maintenance program for the butane vessel and process equipment.  The program includes operating procedures for the safe operation of the system, specific requirements for safe work practices regarding such actions as welding, and safety requirements for contractors.  The facility has a procedure in place for investigating incidents, identifying the cause, and implementing corrective actions thereby, minimizing the potential for recurrence.  The program also will have a procedure for conducting compliance audits to ensure the PSM is being implemented at the facility.  Lastly, the PSM program will incorporate the facility's existing emergency action plan for emergency response and notification to proper agencies in the event of a butane release.    \r\n\r\nEmergency Response Plan\r\nNielsenBainbridge has notified the Bridgeview Fire Department regarding the butane tank, its location and capacity.  In case of fire, the facility's fire alarm will be activated and the Bridgeview Fire Department will be notified automatically.  Therefore, the facility is not required to have an Emergency Response Plan since the facility is not equipped to respond to accidental releases of butane beyond what can be controlled with a facility fire extinguisher.\r\n\r\nThe facility's Emergency Action Plan included in the Process Safety Management Complia"
