Health, safety and environmental compliance are a fundamental part of every employee's job.  It is facility protocol to adhere to applicable Federal, State and local laws and to implement appropriate controls to prevent accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release were to occur, the facility would respond in accordance with its Emergency Action Plan and is prepared to work with the local fire department, the Local Emergency Planning Committee and other authorities to control and mitigate the release and minimize the impact of the release to employees, the environment and the general public.\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled: The primary activity at this facility (the stationary source) is the storage, handling and mixing of fertilizers for direct wholesale to local cooperatives.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, mixed, and used for manufacturing of 10-34-0 and starter grades.  The maximum stored quantity of anhydrous ammonia at the facility is approximately 50000 pounds stored in tank trucks.  The maximum fill level of each tank is 85% of the total tank capacity, which is controlled by a liquid level gauge.  This facility is loaded by transport truck; therefore, the maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia handled would occur when the on-site storage tank is at the maximum fill level of 85%.\n\nLiquid fertilizer is manufactured by combining anhydrous ammonia, super phosphoric acid, and water in a converter reactor.  The super phosphoric acid is delivered in insulated rail tank cars.  The super phosphoric acid is transferred to the reactor via a flexible hose to the reactor tank.  The anhydrous ammonia is delivered by a high-pressure gas cargo tank truck and stored in a pressurized aboveground storage tank.\n\nLiqu"

After the heat exchanger, the anhydrous ammonia vapor is mixed with the water and phosphoric acid, which is pumped from the phosphoric acid rail car to the reactor.  The anhydrous ammonia and phosphoric acid react to form ammonium phosphates and heat.  The ammonium phosphates exit the reactor and enter a holding pool where they mix with water to form an ammonium reactor and enter a holding pool where they mix with water to form an ammonium phosphate solution (i.e., 10-34-0).\n\nSituated above the holding pool is a cooling tower with a fan that pulls air up the tower off of the holding pool.  The ammonium phosphate solution is pumped to the top of the cooling tower where it flows down packing (i.e., Pall Rings) back down to the holding pool.  While falling down the packing, the water evaporates and cools the solution.\n\nSome of the ammonium phosphate solution in the holding pool is pumped out to the anhydrous ammonia heat exchanger.  The warm ammonium phosphate solution is used to vaporize the anhydrous ammonia liquid from the anhydrous ammonia tank. The ammonium phosphate solution, which is cooled by the anhydrous ammonia vaporization, flows back to the holding pool and some of the solution flows to a storage tank.\n\nWorst Case Release Scenario and Alternative Release Scenario: The worst case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of one tank truck.  The maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia released would be approximately 50000 pounds released in a gaseous form over ten (10) minutes.  The resulting distance to the toxic endpoint concentration extends offsite and public receptors are within the distance to the endpoint.

The quantity of anhydrous ammonia released in a gaseous form would be approximately 12000 pounds, which is based on a release rate of approximately 6000 pounds per minute over a two (2) minute time period.  The resulting distance to the toxic endpoint concentration extends offsite and public receptors are within the distance to the endpoint.  The distance to the toxic endpoint concentration (0.14 mg/L) is 0.41 miles.  There were no passive or active mitigation measures considered in this scenario.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps: This facility complies with EPA's accidental release prevention requirements and applicable State and Local codes and regulations.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the facility's release prevention program.\n\n1) Safety Information: The facility was designed and constructed in accordance with applicable Federal and State regulations.  All plans and procedures maintained at the facility are periodically reviewed by facility management for safety updates and changes.  Material Safety Data Sheets, equipment specifications and the codes and standards used to build and operate the anhydrous ammonia equipment are maintained at the facility.\n\n2) Hazard Review: Facility management conducts reviews of the hazards associated with the handling and storage of anhydrous ammonia.  The reviews identify the opportunity for equipment malfunctions or human errors that could cause an accidental release, the safeguards used to control hazards and prevent releases, and the steps used to detect or monitor releases. The results of the reviews are documented and problems identified are addressed in"

The procedures generally follow the provisions of the Occupation Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) standard, 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\" and the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) standard, \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\".  The written procedures are reviewed by facility management on a regular basis and revised as necessary.\n\n4) Training: All employees at the facility that handle anhydrous ammonia participate in a training program.  Initial training for new employees consists of classroom type instruction (e.g., reading safety information, operating procedures and response measures followed by a written test) and on-the-job supervision.  Refresher training for all employees is conducted at least once every year.  The training program is reviewed by facility management on a regular basis and revised as necessary.\n\n5) Mechanical Integrity: Written procedures are established to maintain the ongoing integrity or process equipment.  Each employee involved in maintaining the ongoing integrity of process equipment is trained in an overview of that process and its hazards and in the procedures applicable to the employee's job tasks to assure that the employee can perform on process equipment following recognized and generally accepted good engineering practices.  The frequency of inspections and test of process equipment is consistent with applicable good engineering practices.\n\nDocumentation of each inspection and test on process equipment is maintained in the appropriate format.
