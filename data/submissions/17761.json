Facility Policy.\n \n The owners, management and employees of East Central Iowa Cooperative(the facility) are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia\tand \t propane.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate and minimize the impacts of the release to the people and the environment.  \n \n2. Facility Information.\n\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for both direct application and for blending into mixed-grade fertilizers for crop production nutrients.\nThe maximum quantity stored would be 127,500 pounds of ammonia and 94,350 pounds of propane. \n\n3.\tWorst-Case Scenario and Alternate Release Scenario\n\na.\tThe worst-case scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released as gas over a period of 10 minutes. \n\t\n\tAnhydrous Ammonia-  The maximum quantity released would be 127,500 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the end point (point of dispersion to 200 parts per million, or ppm) is 2.40 miles.  \n\n\t\tPropane- The maximum quantity released would be 94,350 pounds.  The distance \t\tto the end point (point of 1 psi overpressure) is 0.40 miles.\n\nb.\tThe alternate release scenario, based on the five-year accident history (or the most likely potential incident), is as follows:\n\n\tAnhydrous Ammonia- The alternate release scenario is a release from a break in a 3-inch transfer hose followed by release of ammonia for 2 minutes before an automatic or manual shut-off intervenes and sstops the flow of ammonia.  The maximum quantity released would be 26,640 pounds.  The distance"

The \tdistance to the end point (point of 1 psi overpressure) is 0.03 miles.\n\n4.\tAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe facility has been reviewed for general compliance with the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc. (ANSI), and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia\".  The ANSI Standard has been adopted by reference by Iowa Administrative Code Part 21-Chapter 43-Rule 43.6(200)-Standard for the storage and  handling of anhydrous ammonia.  The applicable standard for propane is NFPA-58.  The OSHA standard is referenced in the Registration Form Section 8.3.b.\n\n5.\tFive-Year Accident History.\t\t\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia or propane in the past five years that: have caused any deaths, injuries or significant property damage at the facility; nor to our knowledge, have resulted in off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.  \n\n6.\tEmergency Response Program.\n\n\tThe facility has:\n\n\ta.\ta written action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.38;\n\nb.\tprovided state and local authorities with the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA);\n\n\tc.\ta written emergency response program, in accordance with OSHA standard \n29 CFR 1910.120, including pre-emergency planning and employee training.\n\n7.\tPlanned Changes to Improve Safet"
