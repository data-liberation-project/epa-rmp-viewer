As a reflection of our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws and regulations, we submit this plan to address the hazards inherent with the use of sulfur dioxide.  Our program addresses safety precautions regarding the handling and operation of this covered system as well as proper training for those who operate and maintain the system.  The company training policy requires that all employees will be properly trained for a job position before assignment to that job.\n\nOur accidental release prevention program is clearly defined by the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) Program for this facility.  This prevention program follows industry-recommended standards for preventing unnecessary human exposures and reducing the threat to the health of our employees as well as to members of the community and the surrounding area.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle these chemicals, the safety devices inherent in the design of this facility and its processes, and the training that we provide our personnel.  This Plan is updated as required by law.\n\nOur Emergency Action Plan (EAP) details the response this facility will take as a result of an uncontrolled release of sulfur dioxide.  The Plan includes procedures for notification of the local emergency responders.  This EAP also includes a specific protocol for responding to a sulfur dioxide release and assigns an Emergency Coordinator to implement the response.  This Plan is current and updated as required by law and conforms to the requirements for an Emergency Action Plan as per 29 CFR ? 1910.38(a).\n\nThis facility has also coordinated with the local emergency responders and will maintain close contact to ensure that the responders are familiar with the system and with the general safety and accidental relea"

The company provides sulfur dioxide (SO2) and sulfurous acid (H2SO3) to wineries, as well as welding gases such as acetylene, argon, and oxygen to its customers.  The facility was founded and constructed in January 1997.\n\nThe business is located at 1180 Vendels Circle in Paso Robles, San Luis Obispo County, California, just east of the intersection of State Highways 101 and 46 West.  The facility is situated within a few hundred feet along State Highway 101 on the east side of the highway.\n\nThe company property is bordered by commercial businesses, light industrial facilities, and agricultural land. The facility is located south of the town of Paso Robles, which has a population of about 24,000 and lies at an elevation of approximately 740 feet.  The business lies west of the Salinas River in the Salinas River Valley between the Santa Ysabel and Paso de Robles Mountains. The average annual rainfall for the area is about 13 inches.\n\nThe Regulated Substance Handled\n\nCentral Coast Gases uses one regulated substance, sulfur dioxide, in two processes.  Sulfur dioxide is purchased from a sulfur dioxide manufacturer and stored and used on-site in 150-lb. cylinders and 2000-lb. cylinders as a gas liquefied under pressure.  The chemical is primarily sold to wineries for use as a preserving agent.\n\nThe maximum aggregate quantity of sulfur dioxide at this plant at any given time in the outside process (storage) is 6,500 pounds and 2,500 lbs. in the inside process (production).  These quantities are limited by written ordering procedures and t"

Alternately, the sulfur dioxide may also be sold as a sulfurous acid solution produced by mixing anhydrous sulfur dioxide and water.  There are two systems for production of the sulfurous acid solution, depending upon the size of the vessel required to fill an order (?Large Vessel Fill? and ?Small Vessel Fill?).\n\nThe Large Vessel Fill system uses one (1) 2000-pound sulfur dioxide cylinder to produce sulfurous acid in 37-gallon or 50-gallon stainless steel Dewars, constructed as double-walled vessels with a vacuum between the walls.  The Small Vessel Fill system uses a 150-pound sulfur dioxide cylinder to produce sulfurous acid in 5-gallon stainless steel containers.\n\nEach cylinder is plumbed with stainless steel flexible piping and associated fittings and valves for dispensing sulfur dioxide gas to the sulfurous acid containers.  The systems are located in the same building approximately 30 feet apart.  \n\n\nSafety systems include:\n\n?    Vent line on Large Vessel Fill system Dewars from sulfurous acid dewar to water-filled container outside the building \n?    Ventilation system for continuous ventilation of the Production Area\n?    Fire extinguishers\n?    Emergency showers and eyewash station\n\nThe operation and maintenance staff consists of a primary system operator and a secondary system operator.  The facility maintains an Emergency Action Plan for response to sulfur dioxide releases.  The Plan includes notification and evacuation protocols.\n\n \n3.3    THE WORST CASE AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nThe methods to simulate the accidental release scenarios included the use of ALOHA, a computer simulation program developed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the National Safety "

The program is designed to predict the dispersion of chemical vapors into the atmosphere as a result of pipe and tank failures and evaporation of liquid puddles.  The results of the recent Process Hazard Analysis were also used to develop the mitigated alternate release scenario.\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario\n\nThe worst-case scenario is not the most likely scenario but serves to demonstrate the potential effects of catastrophic events.  Due to system controls such as proper operating procedures and equipment with inherent safety features, this scenario has a very low likelihood of occurring.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario for the sulfur dioxide system models a total release from a 2000-pound cylinder over a period of ten minutes under stable atmospheric conditions.  The enclosed building serves as a passive mitigation measure that would lessen the severity of the release from the in-process cylinder.  The storage cylinder is located outside and has no passive mitigation controls.  \n\nAlternative Case Release Scenario\n\nThe alternative case release scenario was modeled using typical site and weather conditions and variables appropriate to the particular release scenario.  The methodology used in the worst-case scenario (ALOHA) was also used for the alternative case release scenario.  The alternative case release scenario must be a scenario more likely to occur than the worst-case scenario and that will reach an endpoint offsite, if one exists.\n\nThe alternate release scenario was identified as a one-ton sulfur dioxide cylinder fusible plug failure for the outside cylinder. The scenario results indicate that prevention measures and emergency response procedures are essential.  The likelihood of this scenario occurring is very low.\n\nMitigating measures were not considered in modeling this scenario since the cylinder is stored outside.

Key prevention steps taken by this facility to maintain safety are outlined in the PSM Program.  These include the description of all system and equipment information, process hazard analysis, operator training, contractor qualification, operating procedures, pre-startup safety review, hot work permitting, management of change, mechanical integrity, incident investigation, compliance audits, and emergency response.\n\nThose who operate, maintain, or supervise the system will be trained to understand the properties of sulfur dioxide and sulfurous acid, an understanding of the process equipment and proper operating and maintenance procedures, recognition of abnormal conditions and the steps to correct deviations, and emergency shutdown procedures as appropriate to the level of involvement each employee will have with the process.\n\nThe general safety program includes hazard communication, forklift operation, first aid, emergency response, use of personal protective equipment, and function-specific training.\n\n3.5    THE FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere have been no releases of sulfur dioxide at this facility in the last five (5) years.\n\n3.6    THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nEmployees are trained to understand and implement the requirements of the Emergency Action Plan.

The PHA team developed a list of recommendations to improve safety by reducing potential hazards of the process.  All recommendations were implemented immediately, except for two items, which will be completed soon.  The items planned for the future include: \n\n?    Discussions with the local fire department regarding response measures and possible joint exercises or drills\n?    A review of customer traffic for evaluation of current safeguards.\n?
