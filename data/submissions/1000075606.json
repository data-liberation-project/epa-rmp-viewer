This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program in place that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  In the unlikely event that such a release does occur we are completely coordinated with the Caldwell County Local Emergency Planning Commission (LEPC) and the Granite Falls Fire Department to provide highly trained emergency response personnel to control and mitigate the effects.\n\n\n\n2.THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nOur facility's primary activities encompass the manufacturing of polyethylene foam products that are used as packaging material.  We have one regulated substance present at our facility, a blend of isobutane.  This regulated substance is used as a blowing agent at our facility.  \n\n\n\n3. THE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND THE CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  In addition, we have one process at our facility which is subject to the Occupational Safety & Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard under 29 CFR 1910.119 and we operate under a Title V permit.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the accidental release prevention program that are in place at Pregis.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nPregis maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with the covered process. \n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nPregis conducts comprehensive st"

These studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and revalidated at a regular interval of 5 years or when major changes are made to the covered process.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within the covered process, Pregis maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as startup, shutdown, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown and emergency operations.  The information is reviewed on a regular basis and is readily accessible to operators involved in the process.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\nPregis has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating components of the covered process are competent in the operating procedures associated with these components.  Refresher training is provided at least every three years and more frequently as needed.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nPregis performs documented maintenance checks on covered process equipment to ensure proper operation.   Process equipment examined by these checks include but are not limited to storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.  The maintenance operations are done by qualified personnel with the previous training in maintenance practices; and these personnel are provided specialized training as needed.\n\n\n\nManagement of Change\n\nWritten procedures are in place at Pregis to manage changes in covered process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures.

These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operation and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation\n\n\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nPregis will continue to conduct periodic audits to ensure that the provisions set forth under the RMP and SPM rules are being implemented.  Any corrective actions required as a result of the audits will be undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\n\n\nIncident Investigation \n\nPregis promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions that would prevent the release from reoccurring.  All reports are retained at our facility for a minimum of 5 years. \n\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nPregis truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.  Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and they actively participate in process safety management.  In addition, Pregis employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP and PSM rules, including information resulting from process hazard analyses.\n\n\n\nContractors\n\nOn occasion, Pregis hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities.

Because Pregis's stringent release prevention programs, there have been no significant accidental releases during this period.\n\n\n\n5.EMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN\n\nPregis maintains a written emergency evacuation plan for the safety of its employees during accidental releases of hazardous materials.  The plan includes adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations and notification of local emergency response agencies.  Pregis employees do not respond to the emergency. \n\n\n\nEmergency notification equipment is regularly inspected and serviced to insure proper functioning.  Upon modification of the covered process, the plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes within the covered process that would require a modified emergency response.  \n\n\n\n6.PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nTo enhance our continuous improvement in occupational safety and health, we conduct monthly general safety planning meetings which includes employee participation."
