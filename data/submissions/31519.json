Oil & Refining Co. is an independent petroleum refiner located on 136 acres in the Port of Tacoma with the facilities and personnel to process approximately 40000 barrels per day of crude oil into products.  The facilities include over 2 million barrels of storage capacity for crude oil feedstocks, intermediates, and finished products.  The hydrocarbon materials range from volatiles such as liquid butane and gasolines, through distillates such as turbine aviation fuels, diesel and catalytic cracker feedstock, to heavy residuals and byproducts such as fuel oils, asphalt products and liquid sulfur respectively.  The refinery has operated in this location since 1957 and has evolved with the industry into a complex, yet safe, clean, and efficient facility with 160 employees.\n\nThe refinery, which consists of a crude oil processing area, tank farm, finished product loading racks, and office area, is bounded by Marshall Avenue to the South, Lincoln Avenue to the Northwest and Port of Tacoma land to the East, West, and North.  The refinery's main processing units consist of a crude oil unit, two catalytic reformers, one diesel hydrotreater unit, sulfur processing facilities, and ancillary utilities.  The substances handled at the refinery that are regulated by 40 CFR Part 68 include Propane, Butane, Isobutane, Pentane, and Isopentane.\n\nIt is our policy to follow responsible safety, environmental, and quality practices to ensure continuous improvements in protecting our employees, the public, and the environment.  Additionally, our training programs ensure employees are aware of their responsibilities and understand the necessity of operating all processes in continuous compliance with all applicable safety and environmental regulations as well as stringent company standards.\n\nPrevention Program\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at U.S. Oil & Refin"

Each of the 12 elements is fully implemented and integrated into the standard operating practices of the refinery.  Summarized below are brief descriptions of each of the elements:\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nU.S. Oil & Refining Co. actively encourages employees to participate in all phases of process safety management and chemical accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation at the refinery range from updating technical documents and chemical information, to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nCritical information on properties of feedstocks, intermediates, and finished products is made readily available to facility personnel through Material Safety Data Sheets, current drawings, and comprehensive operations manuals.\n\nThe refinery maintains various technical documentation that provide key information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, as well as design pressure, temperature, and electrical ratings.  This information, along with written procedures carried out by trained personnel, provides the basis for establishing excellent inspection and maintenance systems.  These systems enable U.S. Oil & Refining Co. to evaluate proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features are not compromised.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nU. S. Oil & Refining Co. has a comprehensive program in place to ensure that hazards associated with the operations on site are identified and minimized.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measu"

This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention. All approved mitigation options being implemented in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained. \n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, U.S. Oil & Refining Co. periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and the results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.  Team findings are forwarded to management for consideration and the final resolutions of the findings are documented and retained.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nClear and concise instructions have been developed by teams of experienced personnel for all facility operations.  The procedures are kept current by frequent, regularly scheduled review, and by integrating the Management of Change procedures.  The operating procedures address various modes of process operation, such as (1) Unit Startup, (2) Normal Operations, (3) Temporary Operations, (4) Planned or Emergency Shutdown, and (5) Initial Process Startup.\n\nAdditionally, U.S. Oil & Refining Co. maintains comprehensive operating manuals that provide guidance on all facets of the operation, including specific responses if process or equipment parameters are out of optimal operating ranges.\n\nTraining \n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, U.S. Oil & Refining Co. has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  New employees receive basic training in refinery operations if they are not already familia"

After operators demonstrate adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) they are allowed to work independently. \n\nIn addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years.  All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training. \n\nContractors \n\nU.S. Oil & Refining Co. uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities. Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the refinery has a comprehensive pre-qualification procedure in place.  During the pre-qualification process, U.S. Oil & Refining Co. evaluates contractor safety programs and performance prior to selecting the contractor to perform work at the refinery.  Once a contractor is approved to provide service at the refinery, their performance is monitored to ensure that contractors are meeting our expectation that all work is carried out safely.\n\nU.S. Oil & Refining Co. provides contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work at the refinery.  These activities help to ensure that contractors are able to perform their work in a safe manner, are aware of the hazards in their workplace, and understand and follow all site safety rules.\n\n Pre-Startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs) \n\nU.S. Oil & Refining Co. conducts a PSSR for any new process equipment or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety "

The PSSR review team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness.  A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented. \n\nMechanical Integrity \n\nU.S. Oil & Refining Co. has well established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems; controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition.  The basic aspects of this program include: (1) conducting training, (2) maintaining written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting identified deficiencies, and (5) applying quality assurance measures.  In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process equipment. \n\nMaintenance personnel receive training on (1) an overview of the process, (2) safety and health hazards, (3) applicable maintenance procedures, (4) emergency response plans, and (5) applicable safe work practices to help ensure that they can perform their job in a safe manner.  Written procedures help to ensure that work is performed in a consistent manner and provide a basis for training.

Before any work can be performed on any equipment in the refinery, a Safe Work Permit must be obtained from the operations personnel in charge of the process area affected by the work.  The Safe Work Permit is used to determine what procedures and additional permits will be required to safely perform each job.\n\nExamples of workplace practices that may be employed include: (1) control of the entry/presence of support personnel, (2) a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment, (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous materials before process piping or equipment is opened, (4) a permit and procedure to control spark-producing activities (i.e., hot work), and (5) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space.  These procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\n\nManagement of Change \n\nU .S. Oil & Refining Co. has a comprehensive system to manage changes to processes. This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process-operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented.  Changes are reviewed to ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards, and verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.

The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to refinery management for resolution. \n\nCorrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings.  Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years so that the reports can be reviewed during future PHA?s and PHA revalidations.\n\n Compliance Audits \n\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, U.S. Oil & Refining Co. periodically conducts an audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented.  The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to refinery management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the audit's findings are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the most recent audit reports are retained. \n\nCHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS \n\nIn addition to the general accident prevention program activities listed above, U.S. Oil & Refining Co. has safety features on many units to help quickly detect, contain or control, and reduce the consequences of (mitigate) an accidental release.

This coordination includes communications as necessary with local emergency response officials, local government officials, and local industry representatives.  U.S. Oil & Refining Co. has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate emergency response organizations (Tacoma Fire Department).  This provides a means of notifying the public if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident. \n\nIn the event of an accidental release at the refinery, the shift supervisor would determine if the plant emergency is of a nature that outside assistance is required.  The first outside assistance called is the Tacoma City Fire Department for fire, injury or large vapor or liquid release.  The refinery emergency whistle would be activated and plant personnel evacuated upwind of the release.  The shift supervisor is the initial on-site incident commander.  In the event of a release that could impact areas outside of the refinery, the Tacoma Fire Department is responsible for notification of the neighboring community.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY \n\nWe believe that continuous improvement is the best way to be successful in the future.  This is especially true in the safety, health and environmental areas.  Our philosophy is to continuously look for opportunities to improve our abilities in protecting our people and our community.  U.S. Oil & Refining Co. uses findings from PHAs, incident investigations, and employee safety meetings as a means of continuously improving our safety performance."
