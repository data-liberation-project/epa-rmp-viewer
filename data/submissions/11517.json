This Risk Management Plan (RMP) has been developed in accordance with the requirements specified under 40 CFR Part 68, Subpart G. The RMP certifies that Rodney has instituted a Risk Management Program at their facility that is in compliance with U.S. EPA ARP requirements. \nThe RMP includes an Executive Summary and Data Elements following the format published by U.S. EPA.  In addition to identifying the applicable corporate policies and risk management systems, the RMP identifies a set of worst case and alternative release scenarios, the potential off-site consequences of those releases, and the facility's five-year accidental release history.  This RMP certifies that prevention and emergency response programs are in place so as to minimize risks to both workers and the potentially affected public.\n\nAccident Release Prevention Program and Emergency Response Policy\nIt is the policy of Rodney management to implement the requirements of this Risk Management Program (RMP) in accordance with the USEPA regulations under 40 CFR Part 68.  The objective is to minimize the risk of a release of a hazardous material and if a release occurs, to minimize the potential impact to Rodney employees, the public and the environment.\nThis objective will be accomplished by utilizing good operating procedures, providing appropriate training to all employees, and coordinating response activities, as necessary, with the local emergency response providers.  Rodney's management is committed to providing the resources necessary to implement this policy.  \nRodney has developed a management system to implement and maintain compliance with the ARP Program and related OSHA Process Safety Manag"

Other individual employees such as the Environmental Manager, Health and Safety Coordinator,Operations Supervisor, and Vice President of Operations are responsible for the technical implementation of individual sections of these programs.\n\nFacility Description\nThe Allegheny Rodney Strip Division facility in New Bedford, Massachusetts utilizes two processes that are subject to the requirements of 40 CFR Part 68.  The hydrofluoric acid is used in the pickling and cleaning lines and is classified by the North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) as industry number 331221 which includescold-rolled steel shape manufacturing.  The hydrogen used at Rodney is part of the annealing process and is classified by the North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) as industry numbers 332811,  which includes metal heat treating.\nRodney processes metal to manufacture thin gauge metal foil. The facility processes stainless steel, carbon steels, nickel and titanium alloys, and other metals and alloys.  Process operations used at Rodney to manufacture thin gauge metal foil include rolling, annealing, pickling, cleaning, coating, slitting, cutting and machining and welding. \nRodney uses a number of hazardous compounds at the site; these include both toxics and flammables. Of these, hydrogen gas, which is used in the annealing process, and 70% hydrofluoric acid, used in the Furnace 12 acid pickling solutions, exceeds the threshold amounts.  Other toxic compounds that are used at the site are either not of sufficient quantity to be regulated or are found at such a concentration that they are exempt from the RMP regulations. \n\nProgram Level Identification\nThe EPA Risk Management Regulation identifies three levels of requirements defined as programs. Program 2 and 3 are applicable to processes"

Program 3 applies to all processes, such as the hydrogen process present at Rodney, that are subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management Standard (PSM).  \nThe Furnace 12 hydrofluoric acid process at Rodney falls under  Program 2 as it is not subject to Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management Standard (PSM).  However, the hydrogen process at Rodney's facility is subject to OSHA PSM Standard, and it is therefore a Program 3.  Rodney's Accident Prevention Program elements are adopted directly from the compliance program for the PSM standard, consistent with the Program Level 3 RMP Program requirements under 40 CFR Part 68. Program 3 related information is included in the Data Elements section of the Risk Management Plan\n\nWorst-Case and Alternative-Release Scenarios\nThe RMP regulations require that each facility identify worst-case and alternative case release scenarios.  For the purposes of developing and maintaining adequate Risk Management Plans, the EPA has defined in its governing rules and guidance a series of modeling methods and assumptions, which are to be used as administrative guides for planning purposes.  In order to standardize and simplify the many factors that can potentially occur in an accidental release situation, some of these assumptions may not take into account the available preventive measures or mitigation methods that could diminish or even eliminate the implied risks that are suggested by worst-case analyses. For that reason, both the results for the standardized worse-cases defined by the EPA methods and a set of alternative cases which are believed by Rodney to more realistically represent situations that may possibly, but rarely, occur within the lifetime of the facility are also presented. \nEPA has defined a worst-c"

For toxic liquids or substances such as hydrofluoric acid stored at ambient temperatures it is assumed that the release occurs over a 10-minute period.\nThe Allegheny Rodney facility is located on the west bank of the Acushnet River in New Bedford Harbor.  In the immediate vicinity of the facility, the aerodynamic surface roughness is 'urban' in nature, due to the many large buildings, tanks and other structures at the site. For both the worst-case scenario analysis, and alternative release analysis, the following EPAs RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guide and RMP*COMP\u0019 model were respectively used and urban surface roughness was used.\n\nWorst-Case Release \nThe EPA Risk Management Program Guidance For Offsite Consequence Analysis (April 1999)  was used to simulate the worst-case release scenario for Rodney. \nThe worst-case scenario for the hydrofluoric acid process consists of a 10-minute liquid ground-level release of 500 lbs. of stored 70% hydrofluoric acid at 900F, dispersed under atmospheric conditions of F stability and 1.5 m/sec wind speed. The 70% hydrofluoric drums are kept in a separate room adjacent to the main building that is enclosed on three sides. Within the storage area there is berm separating the HF drums from other chemicals and a trench lining the storage room to promote drainage. Should a release occur, the trench would provide containment of the liquid. The selection of the worst-case release for hydrofluoric acid should, therefore, be viewed as a regulatory necessity, rather than a realistic representation of a worst-case release event.\nThe modeling results for the regulatory defined worst-case release indicate that the distance to the toxic endpoint is approximately 0.2 miles.
