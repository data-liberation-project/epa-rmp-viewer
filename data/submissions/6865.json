      "SummaryText": "Naval Station (NS) Mayport's accidental release prevention and emergency response policies are to maintain safe conditions for base personnel and the inhabitants of the surrounding communities. This policy is to be enforced through strict compliance with applicable regulations, physical safeguards, rigorous training, and deployment of adequate resources. Accidental release prevention and emergency response are given the highest priority.\n\nThe Clean Air Act (CAA) Amendments of 1990 required the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to formulate regulations for managing and reducing the probability of release of highly hazardous chemicals. On June 20, 1996, EPA promulgated the Risk Management Program (RMP) rule (40 CFR 68) requiring any stationary source utilizing greater than a specified threshold quantity of a regulated substance to develop and submit a Risk Management Plan (RMPlan) to regulatory authorities on or before June 21, 1999. Regulated substances include 77 air toxics and 63 flammable gases or liquids.\n\nNS Mayport has five processes subject to EPA RMP regulations:\n\n* Chlorine storage, handling, and use at the water treatment plant (WTP);\n* Chlorine storage, handling, and use at the wastewater treatment plant (WWTP);\n* Sulfur dioxide storage, handling, and use at the WWTP;\n* Propane storage, handling, and use at the Fleet Training Center (FTC); and\n* Propane storage, handling, and use at the Navy Lodge.\n\n\nChlorine, sulfur dioxide, and propane are used in excess of their threshold quantities of 2,500 lbs, 5,000 lbs, and 10,000 lbs, respectively. Chlorine and sulfur dioxide stored in one-ton containers and used in the treatment of drinking water at the WTP and sewage at the WWTP. Approximately 246,000 lbs of propane are stored at the FTC in two 30,000-gallon tanks used for firefighter training and one 9,000-gallon tank used for comfort heat and hot water. 10,785 lbs of propane are stored at the Navy Lodge in three 1,000-gallon tanks to power large clothe"

      "SummaryText": "s dryers.\n\nIt is important to note that, at the time of this writing, the U.S. Court of Appeals has issued an indefinite stay on all propane RMP submittals. It is unclear whether propane will remain on the list of regulated chemicals or be assigned a new threshold quantity. In keeping with the General Duty Clause of the RMP rule, propane processes at NS Mayport continue to be governed by RMP regulations; however, the propane processes will not be included in the initial RMP*Submit electronic submittal to EPA.\n\nThis RMPlan summarizes the primary components of the RMP in place at NS Mayport to correspond with specific EPA RMP requirements, including:\n\n* Management;\n* Hazard Assessment;\n* Prevention Program 2;\n* Prevention Program 3;\n* Emergency Response Plan;\n* Planned Changes to Improve Safety;\n* Certification; and\n* Registration and RMP*Submit data elements."
