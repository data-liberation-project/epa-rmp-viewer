      "SummaryText": "Premium Standard Farms operates a pork processing facility near the northeast corner of Milan, Missouri.  The facility is located at the northwest corner of the intersection of Highway 5 and Highway 6, and has been at this location for approximately 9 years.  The nature of the business involves swine slaughter and processing of pork products for commercial distribution.  The Milan pork processing facility has very few hazardous or toxic chemicals on site.  Our facility's refrigeration system uses approximately 214,000 pounds of ammonia as refrigerant.  The High Pressure Receiver vessel V1, located outside the northwest wall of the main facility structure, holds the greatest amount of ammonia.  This receiver can hold as much as 43,300 pounds of ammonia, based on maximum high level controls in the vessel.\n\nPremium Standard Farms is committed to maintaining our ammonia equipment in safe condition, and to providing our personnel with training in safe operating procedures.  This facility has never had an accidental release of ammonia from our facility which resulted in adverse health effects to the public or to our employees, or to property damage.\n\n\nWORST CASE SCENARIO\n\nThe maximum on-site inventory of ammonia at the Milan pork processing facility is approximately 214,000 pounds, constantly circulating through the refrigeration system?s 6 vessels, compressors, condensers, pumps and piping.  For the worst case scenario analysis, the contents of the vessel capable of containing the greatest quantity of ammonia must be assumed to be catastrophically released, if the resulting toxic vapor cloud results in the farthest possible endpoint determination for the facility.\n\nVessel V1, the High Pressure Receiver, contains the greatest quantity of ammonia, because of its size and pressure.  This vessel could contain as much as 43,300 pounds of ammonia.  The EPA requires that this maximum quantity be imagined released in a 10 minute period in order to calculate the worse case scenar"

This results in a release rate of 4,330 pounds/minute (lbs/min).\n\nEPA has calculated the endpoints and provided results for ammonia as a function of rate of material released.  For the Milan pork processing facility?s worse case scenario described above, the endpoint is 2.4 miles from the receiver vessel.\n\n\nALTERNATE SCENARIO\n\nThe alternative release scenario should reflect an incident that has occurred, or potentially could occur, at PSF?s Milan facility.  In addition, EPA guidance documents state that the scenario should:\n\n?    Be more likely to occur than the worst case scenario, and, \n\n?    Result in a distance to the endpoint exceeding the distance to the facility boundary, unless no such scenario exists.\n\nThe alternative scenario selected for PSF?s Milan facility involves a leak in the piping used to transfer ammonia from the High Temperature Recirculation Vessel (V2) to the Intermediate Temperature Recirculator Vessel (V3).  The pump seal or a flange gasket ruptures while the system is unattended.  This scenario is more likely to occur than the worse case scenario, and compared to other realistic alternative scenarios, would be relatively likely to result in the maximum (greatest) distance to the endpoint.\n\nIn this scenario, a shutoff valve would need to be closed manually in order to terminate the release of ammonia from a rupture in the piping.  An EPA guidance document states that in a database of ammonia refrigeration system accidental releases the agency has compiled, this type of failure represents a large number of the incidents which were reported.  This type of failure typically results in an affective hole area of ? to ? inch square.  In order to use the EPA guidance document modeling technique, a hole size must be assumed.  Using the upper end of the range given by the Agency, ? square inch, allows a conservatively high release rate to be calculated for the alternate scenario.\n\nThe line pressure between V2 and V3 is 75 psig.

Using this value, and corresponding endpoint estimates provided by the agency, results in a distance to endpoint of 0.2 miles.  The endpoint estimates provided by the EPA are specifically stated by the Agency to apply to releases of any duration.\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nOur Plant Vice President of Operations, our Plant Manager, and all our employees, are dedicated to maintaining our ammonia refrigerant system in a safe manner.  We have clear lines of authority and responsibility with respect to all aspects of our release prevention program, leading directly to the Plant Vice President of Operations.  We maintain current safety information on ammonia and our ammonia refrigeration equipment, and review any potential hazards that may be associated with the storage and potential use of ammonia at our facility.  \n\nWe train both our operating and maintenance personnel, in our procedures and safe practices.  New employees are trained before being allowed to work without close supervision, and periodic refresher training is provided to all employees.  Any time significant changes occur in equipment or processes which could potentially impact the storage or use of ammonia, affected employees are retrained.  We inspect and audit our facility, using both in-house staff and trained professionals from outside our company.\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE\n\nBecause ammonia is a toxic substance above EPA?s CAA Risk Management Program threshold quantity, the PSF Milan pork processing facility is required to 1) develop an emergency response program including a written emergency response plan; or 2) coordinate response actions with the Milan, Missouri Fire Department.\n\nThe Milan facility has developed a written emergency response plan.  The plan designates incident commanders, an administrative assistant responsible for contacting outside agencies at the direction of the incident commander, tw"
