Some of our well known brands include: Kayem Old Tyme Hot Dogs, Genoa Sausage, Triple M Spiral Hams and Al Fresco Pizza and Chicken Sausage.

It is Kayem Foods' policy to maintain a safe and healthy workplace, protect the environment, and comply with all applicable regulations, including 40 CFR 68 and, as applicable, Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations promulgated as Title 29 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 1910, Section 119 (29 CFR 1910.119), and OSHA's Hazardous Operations and Emergency Response regulations (29 CFR 1910.120). \r\n\r\n\r\nStationary Sources and Regulated Substances\r\n\r\nKayem Foods is required to maintain low temperatures in the food processing and distribution areas of the plant that are within standards required by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) [Federal Department of Agriculture (FDA)] to ensure quality in the final products.  Kayem Foods also operates freezers and coolers for product storage.  Kayem Foods uses anhydrous ammonia (the 112A&reg; regulated substance) as a refrigerant to maintain the 200,000 sq-ft facility within the required range of operating temperatures and to operate the freezers and coolers.

The worst-case release scenario is defined as the release of the entire contents of the largest single vessel over a 10-minute period.  Using the EPA's RMP Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration Reference Tables or Equations, the maximum distance to the specified endpoint (a conservative distance established by EPA at which it is expected that a person could be exposed to the chemical for an hour without suffering irreversible health effects) includes schools, hospitals, churches, personal residences, and various commercial areas.\r\n\r\nThe worst-case release scenario was developed following EPA regulations and is not considered by Kayem Foods to be a likely release scenario for the facility.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlternative Release Scenario\r\n\r\nA more realistic release scenario (alternative release) was developed by Kayem Foods, Inc. taking into consideration the operating experience and the hazards identified in the process hazard analyses (PHAs) conducted to ensure that Kayem Foods' hazards are identified and minimized.  These analyses were conducted in accordance to Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations promulgated as Title 29 of the Code of Federal Regulations Chapter 1910, Section 119 (29 CFR 1910.119).  \r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\r\n\r\nTo prevent and mitigate accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia, Kayem Foods has implemented several precautionary measures that include process/equipment controls, procedures, preventive-maintenance programs, employee training, and audit programs.

Some of the controls installed to prevent catastrophic releases of ammonia are process equipment (pressure relief valves, backup pumps, and manual shutoffs) and automated controls (automatic shut-offs, ammonia leak detection system.\r\n\r\nKayem Foods has developed standard operating procedures for all employees and contractors that have contact with the ammonia refrigeration system that incorporate safety measures into the procedures.  These safety procedures were developed by refrigeration system operators and are reviewed at least annually by means of SOP review session(s).  Process safety information for the refrigeration system is reviewed periodically as well.  Kayem Foods also encourages employee participation in development of the control measures used at the plant.  Pursuant to written management of change procedures established by Kayem Foods, any changes to the operating procedures are to be communicated to affected employees.\r\n\r\nKayem Foods understands that maintaining the refrigeration system in good working order is essential to preventing accidental releases; therefore Kayem Foods has implemented a preventative maintenance program.
