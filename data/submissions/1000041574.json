Grain Co-op\n\nHardtner NH3\n\n\n\nOur facility is for the unloading from transports, storage and loading onto trailer nurse tanks of anhydrous ammonia. Anhydrous ammonia is used by farmer members of our cooperative as a source of nitrogen fertilizer for the production of crops.\n\n\n\nThis facility has 1-12,000 gallon bulk tank and 10-1,000 nurse tanks.  By law these tanks cannot be filled over 85% full, which leaves a total capacity of 18,700 gallons.  The specific gravity listed on the MSDS supplied by Koch is .633@4 degrees C.  The weight of water (8# per gallon) is multiplied by .633, then multiplied by 18,700 gallons to arrive at the total weight of 80,492 pounds.  This gives a combined total of 123,536 pounds.\n\n\n\nAccidental release prevention:\n\nOur best protection against accidental release of anhydrous ammonia is well-trained and conscientious people.  All workers who handle anhydrous ammonia at our facility are full-time employees with a number of years of experience.  They receive annual training (either in-house or at regional safety meetings), as well as on-the-job training.\n\n\n\nOur next line of defense against accidental release is good safety equipment and thorough inspection of that equipment.  Safety equipment includes liquid level indicators to help prevent overfilling on all tanks, excess flow valves, which shut off if there is a leak in a hose or line, and pressure relief and hydrostatic relief valves which protect from excess pressure buildup.\n\n\n\nEmployees are required to wear gloves and goggles at all times when handling anhydrous ammonia. Workers also inspect all trailer nurse tanks for worn or damaged equipment needing repair when they come into the facility and make the necessary repairs before the tanks leave.\n\n\n\nWorst-case accidental release scenario:\n\nThe EPA has requested (for security reasons) that all worst-case and alternative scenarios be removed from this summary.  The information is submitted in the plan and is avai"

The alternate case scenario was a leaking pipe of 2\" diameter.  Both figures were determined using the charts supplied as part of the Degadis model.  Population data was gathered by calling local city officials.  \n\n\n\nAccidental release prevention:\n\nOur facility is inspected annually by the Kansas Department of Agriculture to insure all equipment is in safe working condition. Our employees regularly inspect the facility and must undergo periodic training, either in house or at regional safety meetings, on safe handling procedures to prevent accidental releases from occurring. The facility must also meet OSHA and Kansas Department of Agriculture regulations.  In addition, we meet strict underwriting guidelines set forth by the insurance company and reviewed annually by a loss control representative.  \n\n\n\nFive year accident history:\n\nThere have been no accidental releases at this facility within the past five years.\n\n\n\nEmergency response program:\n\nSince this is a small community, we personally know most of the fire and police personnel and keep them aware of our operations.  First responders are encouraged to visit our facilities at their convenience and they receive an offer to tour our facilities annually when we submit our Tier II report.  If requested we provide training for them free of charge.  \n\n\n\nDue to the hazards involved, our employees are not allowed to handle any problem that requires a respirator or SCBA.  In such cases the local responders will be called to assist with the problem at hand.  Employees who are active in the local volunteer fire department may leave and return as a member of the first responders.  \n\n\n\nWe do maintain an emergency action plan that is consistent with the requirements of the OSHA standards.  Employees have been trained in this plan.  \n\n\n\n\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety:\n\n\n\nRecently stand"
