There were other incidents that occurred and were investigated, but they did not fall into the reportable category for RMP.  \r\n\r\nOn February 2, 2013, a nipple was broken off a process unit and a release of hydrogen sulfide ensued.  Two Alon employees were injured due to inhalation of the hydrogen sulfide, and outside medical help was required.\r\n\r\nOn April 21, 2016, a process upset resulted in a release of hydrogen sulfide and sulfur dioxide from an emergency device.  The release resulted in a plume coming across the refinery with operators sheltering in the South Side Control Room for a short period of time.  Atmospheric conditions were such that an inversion occurred and the plume came to the ground rather than dissipate.  No injuries occurred as a result of this event.  \r\n\r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\n\r\nThe Alon Refinery is continually seeking to improve the safety of the facility.  As part of our efforts to continually improve and reduce the risk of our processes we periodically evaluate the hazards of our operations.  Some of the safety improvement items we currently plan to implement came from these hazard reviews.  Below are improvements under review:\r\n\r\nUpgrades to the fire water system\r\nPerimeter monitoring for air releases\r\nPerimeter camera systems for improved site security\r\nNew badging system with implementation of DISA and TWIC\r\nUpgrading selective pumps to tandem seals with alarms\r\nContinued improvements to structural fireproofing\r\nContinued inspections for corrosion under insulation\r\nContinued installatio"

      "SummaryText": "RMP programs are functioning properly, Alon USA periodically conducts an audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the program are being implemented.   At least every three years, an outside audit will be conducted to assess the adherence to the OSHA PSM Standard and EPA Risk Management Plan (RMP).  The auditors develop findings that are forwarded to refinery management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the audit findings are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding is documented.\r\n\r\nEmployees participate in compliance audits by assisting in the collection of information prior to and during the performance of the audit.  Also, all employees and contractor personnel are subject to being interviewed during the audit to assure that they are knowledgeable of the PSM elements and that they are following policies and procedures. Employees participate in the Hazard Recognition (HAZREC) Audits conducted monthly so that all units are covered on a quarterly basis.  Safety observations are conducted as part of the VPP initiative.  During turnarounds, job and site audits are conducted by employees, contractors, and safety personnel.  \r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM - The Alon USA Big Spring Refinery Emergency Response (ER) Plan describes the organization, responsibilities, and plans for responding to emergencies.  The ER Plan is available at the workplace for employee review; many employees are involved in multiple aspects of this plan.  The plan is reviewed and updated at least annually prior to the required drill regarding salt well storage facilities.  Outside agencies are invited to a minimum of one major drill each year (Salt Well Drill) and the local fire departments are invited to joint training exercises with the refinery emergency response team.  \r\n\r\nAffected personnel assigned new responsibilities or designated actions receive training upon assignment of those new duties.

      "SummaryText": "permanent record of the MOC and is stored in the PSM Department.  \r\n\r\nMECHANICAL INTEGRITY - Mechanical Integrity efforts assure the initial and on-going integrity of process equipment by determining and documenting the equipment is designed, installed and maintained properly for the intended service.  Employees have the opportunity to provide input in the development of the procedures applicable to their job tasks.  Employees are an integral part of the inspecting and testing of process piping, instrumentation and equipment.   Each employee involved in maintaining the integrity of the process equipment will be trained in an overview of that process, the hazards of the process, and in the procedures applicable to the employee's job tasks to assure the employee can perform the tasks in a safe manner.  \r\n\r\nThe Inspection Department is comprised of both Alon and contract personnel.  Inspectors, technicians, and craftsmen meet the qualifications required for the work they perform.  The Inspection Department at the Alon Refinery stores the information related to inspections and mechanical integrity of piping and vessels.  PCMS is used to facilitate the inspection process.  Hard copies of certain information are maintained in the Project Engineering Department Library.  Policy 101.8 is an integral part of the mechanical integrity process.  \r\n\r\nThe MI Department follows the Alon specifications along with those from outside agencies such as API, ASME, ASTM, UL, NFPA, and others when conducting their inspections or recommending replacement of piping and equipment.\r\n\r\nSAFE WORK PRACTICES- Safe work practices/procedures are used to control hazards during operation and maintenance activities.  These procedures are available to all employees on the Big Spring Refinery Home page Electronic Data Locator (EDL).  Alon has developed and implemented procedures for Hot Work Permits along with other Safe Work Practices in areas such as confined space entry, line and vessel entry, site a"
