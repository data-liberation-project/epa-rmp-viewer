Big Spring Refinery\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICIES\n\n\n\nAlon USA has a long-standing commitment to the safety and health of our community and workers and protection of the environment.    This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our process. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  If a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond quickly and effectively to control and mitigate the release.  In an effort to reduce the risk of accidental releases from this facility it is the policy of the Alon USA Big Spring Refinery to comply with the requirements of both 29 CFR 1910.119, Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Materials (PSM), and 40 CFR Part 68, Risk Management Program (RMP), regulatory requirements. We have verified compliance with these important regulations\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n\n\nThe Alon USA Big Spring Refinery (BSR) is a 73,000 B/D crude oil refinery located in Big Spring, Texas with a Nelson Complexity of 10.5.  The primary business is the production and sale of ultra-low sulfur gasoline, ultra-low sulfur diesel fuel, jet fuels, and asphalt plus limited amounts of LPG's, benzene and propylene used as petrochemical feedstocks.  The refinery has a threshold quantity of several flammable substances and one toxic substance (hydrogen fluoride).  The refinery reports twenty-six (26) regulated processes with ten (10) additional processes located at the refinery that are not covered by RMP. \n\n\n\nToxics \n\n\n\nHydrogen Fluoride/Hydrofluoric Acid (commonly called HF Acid) is used as a catalyst in the production of gasoline blend stock.

The BSR accidental release prevention program includes all of the elements of both PSM and RMP regulations.  Key to these prevention efforts is the knowledge of the chemicals and equipment used in the process units, the careful evaluation of and reduction of operating risks, and the proper operation, monitoring, upkeep and maintenance of equipment and systems.  These ongoing efforts severely reduce the likelihood of a worst-case scenario event (toxic or flammable) occurring at the BSR. The mitigation systems currently in place and the prompt response by experienced and qualified personnel would further limit the worst case or alternate scenarios to much less than the estimated impacted areas if they did occur.  The following is more detailed information regarding our risk management and incident prevention program currently in place.\n\n\n\nThe Alon USA BSR Risk Management Program prevention program includes the following elements:\n\n\n\nEMPLOYEE PARTICIPATION - All Alon USA Big Spring employees are involved in risk management efforts.  This involvement includes assistance in identifying and correcting hazards, assistance in conceptual design of improvements and new installations, reviewing and revising operating procedures, pre-startup safety reviews, training, operation and maintenance of equipment, development of maintenance procedures, and the safe operation of the plant. Selected employees, including represented ones, are members of special teams for Incident Investigations, Process Hazards Analysis (PHA) evaluations, reviewing policies and procedures (Policy and Procedure Committee), the Health & Safety Committee, and the Risk Management Committee, while others are directly involved in the writing and reviews of the operating and maintenance procedures.\n\n\n\nPROCESS SAFETY INFORMATION (PSI) - PSI is the written process safety informati"

Currently, all PSI is updated by use of the Management of Change (MOC) system along the Pre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR) system.  Employees are provided access to all process safety information related to the equipment, technology of the process, dangers of acutely and chronically hazardous chemicals, along with flammable materials used in the process.  Piping and Instrument Diagrams (P&ID) are maintained by the engineering department in electronic files available online to employees.  Process overviews along with operating instructions are electronically available to all employees.  This includes maximum intended inventories of materials on the units.  Safety Data Sheets are available online through MSDSONLINE on the plant intranet.  Other PSI is housed in the Technical Department (Process Safety), Engineering Department (Mechanical Integrity, drafting, new projects), Maintenance Department (Mechanical Integrity, Rotating Equipment, Preventative Maintenance), HSSE Department (PHAs, MOCs, General Training and Re-certification, Incident Investigations, Contractor Certifications), and Operations Department (Operating Instructions, Unit Operator Training).

The final resolution of each finding is documented.\n\n\n\nEmployees participate in compliance audits by assisting in the collection of information prior to and during the performance of the audit.  Also, all employees and contractor personnel are subject to being interviewed during the audit to assure that they are knowledgeable of the PSM elements and that they are following policies and procedures. Employees participate in the Hazard Recognition (HAZREC) Audits conducted monthly so that all units are covered on a quarterly basis.  Safety observations are conducted as part of the VPP initiative.  During turnarounds, job and site audits are conducted by employees, contractors, and safety personnel.  \n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM - The Alon USA Big Spring Refinery Emergency Response (ER) Plan describes the organization, responsibilities, and plans for responding to emergencies.  The ER Plan is available at the workplace for employee review; many employees are involved in multiple aspects of this plan.  The plan is reviewed and updated at least annually prior to the required drill regarding salt well storage facilities.  Outside agencies are invited to a minimum of one major drill each year (Salt Well Drill) and the local fire departments are invited to joint training exercises with the refinery emergency response team.  \n\n\n\nAffected personnel assigned new responsibilities or designated actions receive training upon assignment of those new duties.

      "SummaryText": "raining is completed after the yearly update and prior to the annual drill.  Newly assigned personnel review the portions of the ER Plan they must know to protect themselves in the event of an emergency.  This plan is communicated to and coordinated with local groups including the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and responders such as the Big Spring Fire Department, the Howard County Sheriff's Department, the Big Spring Police Department, the Texas Department of Public Safety and the Howard County Volunteer Fire Department.  These groups are used to supplement the efforts of the Alon USA Emergency Response and HAZMAT teams that take direct control to handle the emergency on-site.  \n\n\n\nCommunication on-site includes a warning siren system and individual portable radios.  Communication to the public is coordinated through the LEPC and 911 systems which, in turn, include notifications through the local radio and cable TV stations.  \n\n\n\nRoutine, joint training exercises are conducted to insure a coordinated, timely and appropriate response will occur in the unlikely event of a release actually occurring.  The refinery has developed a comprehensive Integrated Contingency Plan (ICP) that defines the levels of response along with the roles and responsibilities of the responders.  The refinery has standardized on the National Information Management System (NIMS) in order to be able to seamlessly integrate with outside responding agencies.  As members of one or more of the refinery Emergency Response Teams (REDHATS), refinery personnel participate in classroom training, onsite training, offsite training, drills, and real incidents inside the refinery.  The refinery maintains a Hazardous Materials and Emergency Response (HAZMAT) team, High Angle Rescue Team, Confined Space Rescue Team, Medical Response Team, and Fire Department with both incipient level and certified fire fighters.  The site has personnel trained in CPR and First Aid along with some higher level med"

The accident prevention program is applied to all RMP-covered processes.  Collectively, these activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failure and / or human error.  In addition to the accident prevention program activities, Alon has safety features on many units to help 1) contain / control a release, 2) quickly detect a release, and 3) reduce the consequences of (mitigate) a release.  The following types of safety features are used in various processes:  release detection, hydrocarbon detectors with alarms, hydrofluoric acid detectors with alarms, hydrogen sulfide detectors with alarms, personal hydrogen sulfide detectors worn while in the units, process relief devices that discharge to a flare to capture and incinerate episodic releases, valves to permit isolation of the process (manual or automated), emergency shutdown systems, curbs or dikes to contain liquid releases, redundant equipment and instrumentation, double seals on specific pumps, atmospheric relief devices, water curtain in the HF area, water cannons, deluge system on sphere 73, fire suppression and extinguishing systems, and trained emergency response personnel.  \n\n\n\nWCS for toxic - HF Acid release - This drum and associated piping are routinely inspected to insure adequacy for continued service.  This includes on-stream thickness monitoring for corrosion rate and remaining life calculations.  This vessel is rated at 175 psig and is protected by a dedicated relief valve set at 150 psig.  This will vent any excess pressure that could lead to the worst case release scenario.  The liquid level is routinely monitored by computer, while the"

There were other incidents that occurred and were investigated, but they did not fall into the reportable category for RMP.  \n\n\n\nOn February 2, 2013, a nipple was broken off a process unit and a release of hydrogen sulfide ensued.  Two Alon employees were injured due to inhalation of the hydrogen sulfide, and outside medical help was required.\n\n\n\nOn April 21, 2016, a process upset resulted in a release of hydrogen sulfide and sulfur dioxide from an emergency device.  The release resulted in a plume coming across the refinery with operators sheltering in the South Side Control Room for a short period of time.  Atmospheric conditions were such that an inversion occurred and the plume came to the ground rather than dissipate.  No injuries occurred as a result of this event.  \n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nThe Alon Refinery is continually seeking to improve the safety of the facility.  As part of our efforts to continually improve and reduce the risk of our processes we periodically evaluate the hazards of our operations.  Some of the safety improvement items we currently plan to implement came from these hazard reviews.  Below are improvements under review:\n\n\n\nUpgrades to the fire water system\n\nPerimeter monitoring for air releases\n\nPerimeter camera systems for improved site security\n\nNew badging system with implementation of DISA and TWIC\n\nUpgrading selective pumps to tandem seals with alarms\n\nContinued improvements to structural fireproofing\n\nContinued inspections for corrosion under insulation\n\nContinued installatio"
