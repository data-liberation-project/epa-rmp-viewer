Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies at the Facility:\r\n\r\nThe Coop board, management and employees at Watonwan Farm Service, Mankato, MN location, are committed to the prevention of accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\r\n\r\n2. Facility Information and Regulated Substances Handled: \r\n\r\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage of fertilizer for sale to farmers. Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and handled for direct application. Anhydrous ammonia is used for crop production nutrients. The facility will have 1-45,000 gallon storage tank; and additional available capacity of approximately 20,000 gallons in nurse tanks when the nurse tanks are on site during the spring planting and fall harvest seasons. The maximum quantity handled would be a tank truck holding 40,000-45,000 pounds.\r\n\r\n3. General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps:\r\n\r\nThe facility has implemented Minnesota Dept. of Agriculture rules, the Standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia; and 40 CFR part 68 as they apply to this facility. The facility is required to conduct a semi-annual inspection of all bulk and nurse tank equipment, including load and unload equipment, and perform any needed maintenance to the equipment found during the inspections. Visual checks are to be conducted daily at the facility.\r\n\r\n4. The Five-year Accident History:\r\n\r\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that have:\r\na) Caused any death, inj"
