Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and processed into 10-34-0 non-hazardous liquid fertilizer.  Processing is periodic and usually occurs in the Spring and Fall.  Ammonia mixing with phosphoric acid occurs in a T-reactor.  Water is used as both a reaction feed material and product stabilizer.  The Emergency Response Procedures for Pacific Junciton are coordinated with the Mills Co Local Emergency Planning Committee..\n\nUnited Suppliers, Inc. - Pacific Junciton, IA has taken the necessary steps to comply with accidental release prevention requirements set forth in 40 CFR Part 68.  Pacific Junction is also covered by OSHA's Process Safety Management standard.  The following briefly describes the prevention program elements in place at this stationary source:\n\nProcess Safety Information:  The facility maintains information describing the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with the covered process.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis:  Studies are conducted to ensure the hazards associated with process operations are identified, understood and controlled.\n\nOperating Procedures:  Written operating procedures are maintained for covered process operations.  These procedures address the following activities:   initial startup, normal, temporary, emergency shutdown, normal shutdown and startup following a turnaround.\n\nHot Work Permits:  In order to assure adequate controls are used in work where conditions could cause ignition or flammable or combustible materials, the Hot Work Permit System will be utilized.  Hot work involves any welding, soldering, cutting, grinding, drilling, or any type of work where sparks may occur during operation.  These permits will be utilized where the supervisor deems them necessary for job safety.  It will be the supervisor's responsibility to ensure"

Deficiencies are corrected in a timely manner.\n\nManagement of Change:  Written procedures are in place to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and/or procedures.  Affected personnel are informed and trained to deal with authorized system changes.\n\nPre-Startup Review:  Technical and operational reviews will be conducted on new processes and/or modifications to existing covered processes.  Reviews confirm the construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable.  Reviews are completed prior to placing equipment in operation.\n\nCompliance Audits:  Internal audits are conducted on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions specified under the RMP rule are being implemented.  At a minimum, these audits are conducted every three (3) years.  Any determined corrective actions are completed in a timely manner.\n\nIncident Investigations:  Investigations are conducted to determine the root cause of covered process incidents.  In addition to determination and correction, investigations are directed toward preventing reoccurence.  Investigations become process safety information and are retained for five (5) years.  United Suppliers, Inc.
