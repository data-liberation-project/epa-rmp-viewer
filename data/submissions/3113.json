This commitment is inherent in a comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances and to train employees regarding the safe operation of  processes involving regulated substances. Although such an event is unlikely, employees are trained to react to unplanned releases of regulated substances.  In addition, the plant has coordinated with local and other emergency response organizations which provide highly trained emergency response personnel to help control and lessen the effects of any unplanned release.\n\n2.The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances \nThe primary manufacturing activity at this plant involves the production of plastic consumer products such as polystyrene foam plates, bowls, food containers, and trays that you might find meat or poultry on in a supermarket.  We have one substance present at our facility which is regulated by United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) under the Risk Management Program.  This substance is iso-pentane; and is referenced in this document by the term \"regulated substance\".  The regulated substance at our facility is used as foaming agents in the production of the polystyrene foam.  These products are also often called \"blowing agents\" or \"expansion agents\" .\n\nThe maximum inventory of iso-pentane possible at our facility is approximately 400m pounds (76m gallons). \n\n3.Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario.\nUnder RMP, USEPA requires facilities to determine the eff"

      "SummaryText": "ects of catastrophic releases of regulated substances.  In facilities which use flammable regulated substances, USEPA defines the worst case scenario for a catastrophic release to be 1 pound per square inch (psi) over-pressure as a result of an instantaneous release of the largest tank volume utilizing no active measures to control the release of the regulated substance under worst-case weather conditions.   USEPA defines alternative release scenarios as 1 psi over-pressure as a result of a timed release of a portion of the largest tank volume utilizing active measures to control the release of the regulated substance under neutral weather conditions.  \n\n To evaluate the worst case scenario for the particular regulated substances and conditions at this facility, we used equations from Appendix D of the USEPA RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance and RMP Compute, a simplified EPA model based on the EPAs Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance.  For analysis of alternative release scenarios, we also employed the equations provided by the USEPA in the RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance and RMP Compute.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe activities at the plant can be categorized by Program 3 of the RMP guidance.  The projected worst case release scenario would involve a catastrophic release from the iso-pentane tank car.  The scenario involves the release of 150m pounds (28m gallons) of iso-pentane.  Passive mitigation systems such as dikes were not considered when evaluating this scenario.  The worst case release scenario assumes that the entire quantity of the iso-pentane storage tank is released as a vapor, and an ignition source is present. Under worst case weather conditions, the maximum distance of 0.40 miles corresponds to an endpoint of 1 psi overpressure.  \n\nThe alternative release scenario involves a release from the iso-pentane tank car unloading hose assumed to result in a vapor cloud explosion.  The scenario i"

The release is controlled by active mitigation measures that include a deluge system and an automatic shut off valve.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the flammable endpoint of 1 psi overpressure is 0.10 miles.\n\n4.  The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under EPAs 40 CFR Part 68.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-58 Standard, 1967 Edition.  A number of processes at our facility are subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119.  We also have submitted an air operating permit application under Title V of the Clean Air Act. This facility has received a Star Ranking under OSHAs Voluntary Protection Program (VPP) for over 13 years.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that are in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nTenneco Packaging Specialty and Consumer Products, Inc.  maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating guidelines and equipment designs associated with the processes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducts extensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The approach used to carry out these analyses is a HAZOP/Modified What If process.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering, process operations, and safety and are revalidated at a regular interval of approximately every 5 years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Tenneco Packaging Specialty and Consumer Products, Inc."

The information is regularly reviewed and is readily available to operators involved in the processes.\n\nTraining\nTenneco Packaging Specialty and Consumer Products, Inc. utilizes a detailed training program to ensure that employees who are operating processes using regulated substances are skilled in the handling, operation, and maintenance procedures associated with these processes.  Refresher training is provided at least once every 3 years and more frequently as needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nTenneco Packaging Specialty and Consumer Products, Inc.  carries out routine, periodic maintenance inspections and preventive maintenance on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these inspections include but are not limited to pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with training in maintenance practices.  These personnel are provided specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by maintenance inspections  are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nManagement of Change\nWritten procedures at Tenneco Packaging Specialty and Consumer Products, Inc. are in place to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures.  Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of changes and provided training, as needed, to deal with these changes.\n\nPre-startup Safety Reviews\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice "
