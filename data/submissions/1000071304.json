Their commitment is demonstrated by:\n\n\n\n       Maintaining a staff of onsite safety professionals to properly manage all aspects of safety;\n\n       Providing a dedicated Safety Trainer for monthly employee training;\n\n       Supporting the facility's Behavioral Based Safety Management System; \n\n       Requiring facility to obtain American Chemistry Council's Responsible Care RC 14001 Certification; an Environmental, Health, Safety, and Security Management Systems that addresses various aspects of pollution prevention and process safety management;\n\n       Requiring facility to undergo per"
