Baker Petrlolite Corporation has established a system to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility as part of this commitment.  One part of this system is a risk management program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at Baker Petrlolite and also complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) regulation 40 CFR part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs (RMP rule).  A requirement of the RMP rule is to submit a risk management plan (RMPlan) describing the risk management plan prepared for the Baker Petrolite Bayport facility.  The purpose of this document is to satisfy the RMPlan requirements of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program at Baker Petrlolite.\r\n\r\nThrough the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances, Baker Petrlolite is committed to the safety of it's employees, the public population, and the preservation of the environment.  Baker Petrlolite implements reasonable controls to prevent identifiable releases of hazardous substances.  In the event of a significant accidental release, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain these releases.  If a release event occurred, Baker Petrlolite would evaluate the release, evacuate workers as required, contact the LaPorte police department (LEPC) dispatcher to inform them of the release, and prevent or reduce the consequences of the release.  Baker Petrlolite has established a program with the LaPorte local emergency planning committee (LEPC), LaPorte fire department, and the Channel Industries Mutual Aid (CIMA) to warn the community if a release occurs that could affect the community.\r\n\r\nBaker Petrlolite is a specialty chemical manufacturer of che"

They include anhydrous ammonia, aqueous ammonia, ethylene oxide, propylene oxide, formaldehyde, ethylenediamine, and methyl chloride.  All of the covered processes involving these chemicals are Program 3 processes for RMP rule compliance purposes.  The following is a summary of the individual chemicals and the covered processes:\r\n\r\n1.\tAnhydrous ammonia is stored in one ton cylinders and used as a reactant in the production of specialty chemicals instead of neutralization.\r\n2.\tAqueous ammonia is stored in a pressure vessel type storage tank within dike containment.  Aqueous ammonia is used as a neutralization chemical agent in the production of chemical intermediates.\r\n3.\tEthylene oxide is stored in two pressure vessel type storage tanks, each with individual dike containment.  Ethylene oxide is used in the ethoxylation of chemical intermediates.\r\n4.\tPropylene oxide is stored in two pressure vessel type storage tanks, each with individual dike containment.

Emergency shutdown instructions are contained in the Bayport Production Standard Operating Procedure Manual.  The batch tickets are reviewed after each batch to ensure they reflect current operating practices.\r\n\r\nBaker Petrlolite has a company training program for all plant operations employees.  New employees receive basic orientation training in plant operations regardless of their previous experience level.  After successfully completing this training, the new operator is then assigned to a more experienced operator with job experience to perform the duties and tasks in the new job assignment.  After the new operator can demonstrate the ability and knowledge (through oral and written testing) to perform the job in a safe manner on his own, he will begin to work alone.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training.\r\n\r\nBaker Petrlolite uses a contractor who specializes in contract maintenance and other outside contractors for construction activities as required.  Because the contractors work at or near process equipment, there are procedures in place to ensure that contractors; perform their work safely, have sufficient knowledge and skills, are aware of the hazards in their work area, understand emergency procedures, follow site specific safety rules, and inform Baker Petrlolite personnel of any hazards they find in the area.  Baker Petrlolite has written procedures both for the contract maintenance contractor and the other contractors performing construction projects.

The OCA consists of evaluating both worst-case scenarios (WCS) and alternative release scenarios (ARS).  Baker Petrlolite does not expect a WCS to ever occur.  An ARS is a more realistic scenario that is more likely to occur than the WCS at a facility such as Baker Petrlolite.  The ARS's will help the LEPC to improve the community emergency response plan.  \r\n\r\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at Baker Petrlolite Bayport manufacturing facility.  Because the processes at the Baker Petrlolite Bayport plant regulated by the EPA RMP regulation are also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) process safety management (PSM) standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\r\n\r\nBaker Petrlolite encourages plant employees to participate in all areas of process safety management and accident prevention.  Employee participation ranges from updating technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team. The employees have access to all information contained in the Baker Petrlolite plant accident prevention program.  One of the ways to address process safety and employee safety issues is in the monthly plant safety committee meetings.  The committee consists of plant operators and management personnel.\r\n\r\nBaker Petrlolite keeps a variety of technical documents that used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.

A program is in place for all process equipment to comply with recognized and generally accepted good engineering practices.\r\n\r\nBaker Petrlolite has a comprehensive program to identify and control hazards associated with various processes.  Each process is systematically examined to identify process hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.  Baker Petrlolite uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis method to perform these systematic reviews.  The HAZOP team consists of people who have operating, maintenance, and engineering expertise.  The team identifies and evaluates hazards of the processes as well as accident prevention and makes suggestions for additional measures as needed.  The team findings are then documented and all approved changes are implemented for corrective action.  These periodic reviews are conducted on a 5 year cycle and will continue until the covered process is no longer operating.
