The Water Treatment Plant at 320 North 5th Avenue in Paragould, Arkansas houses a maximum of 6,000 pounds of chlorine. The Wastewater Treatment Plant at 401 Grant Lane in Paragould, Arkansas houses a maximum of 8,000 pounds of chlorine and 6,000 pounds of sulfur dioxide. This Risk Management Plan (RMP) applies only to the Water Treatment Plant, with the RMP for the Wastewater Treatment Plant being submitted under a separate cover.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nIt is the policy of City Light, Water & Cable that preparation and planning should be used to minimize the potential risks of chemical releases. The management of City Light, Water & Cable has committed the necessary resources to protect the health and safety of all its employees and the community surrounding its facilities. \n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nCity Light, Water & Cable has chosen to comply with federal occupational health and safety regulations. While the quantities of regulated chemical on-site are not sufficient to trigger the Process Safety Management regulations, many of the operational and maintenance requirements have been incorporated into the daily operational and maintenance procedures of each facility. The chorine system has been equipped with alarms and an extensive preventive maintenance program to further reduce the possibility of an accidental chemical release.  \n\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nDue to an excellent prevention program, the Water Treatment Plant has had no chlorine releases in the past five (5) years.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRA"

      "SummaryText": "M\n\nCity Light, Water & Cable has implemented a comprehensive Emergency Response Plan, including hazard assessments, equipment purchases and employee training to develop an in-house hazardous materials response team. City Light, Water & Cable has also coordinated with the Greene County LEPC, Paragould Fire Department and local hospitals to ensure that everyone is aware of the potential of accidental releases and that a community wide response plan is in place. Copies of the Emergency Response Plan will be distributed to each affected employee and the LEPC after updating. In the event of accidental release of significant size to affect the community, public notification will be aired on City Light, Water & Cable's cable television emergency notification system and local radio stations.\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY \n\nCity Light, Water & Cable has made significant improvements in securing all of its facilities, with special emphasis placed on those facilities utilizing hazardous chemicals. This increased attention, along with an increased focus on overall health and safety at all facilities, has allowed City Light, Water & Cable to continue to improve its safety policy and practices with regard to accidental chemical releases.  \n\n"
