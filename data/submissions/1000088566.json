These fluids are utilized for performance testing of submerged liquefied gas pumps and power recovery turbine generator sets. These liquefied gases are stored in six tanks; one 15,000 gallon and one 21,000 gallon LNG tank, one 18,500 gallon LPG tank,  two 11,500 gallon LN2 tanks, and a 26,000 gallon LN2 tank.\n\n\n\nThe worst case release envisioned at the facility is total release from a LNG or LPG storage tank or large flow line, with a discharge in excess of 5,000 gallons of liquid at one time. Any liquid  spill is contained by dykes, and the entire area is covered by a deluge system that will maintain all storage tanks at an acceptable temperature in the event of fire.\n\n\n\nThe general accident release prevention is in complete adherence to standards and regulations established for the industry i.e. NFPA, OSHA, EPA, ASME, API, etc. These criteria are supplemented with in-house policies and procedures that are maintained and enforced without exception. Early warning and emergency shut-down systems are in place and operating. These systems are periodically tested to assure proper operation. Also, independent test and inspections are conducted on a scheduled basis, to verify their operations.\n\n\n\nCryodynamics' Emergency Response Program provides instructions to all employees and visitors. It is well documented and maintained as part of our overall quality management system that is certified to ISO  9001:2008, ISO/TS 29001:2010. These programs have been coordinated with an independent fire protection firm"
