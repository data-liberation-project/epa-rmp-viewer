In this way we promote overall plant, worker, and public safety.\n\nThese programs enable our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of toxic substances as well as fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents.  Overall, these programs prevent accidental fatalities, injuries and illnesses and avoid physical property damage.\n\nOur safety programs are applied to any activity involving hazardous chemicals including any use, storage, manufacturing, handling, or the on-site movement of such chemicals, or combination of these activities.  Any group of vessels that are interconnected and separate vessels, which are located, such that a hazardous chemical could be involved in a potential release shall be considered a single process.\n\nOur safety programs prevent accidents because they focus on the rules, procedures, and practices which govern individual processes, activities, or pieces of equipment.  These rules are detailed and improved as necessary.  They are also communicated to and accepted by all employees at the facility.\n\n\nFACILITY AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\nPasco Processing, LLC operates a vegetable processing facility in Pasco, Washington.  The only chemical that was found to be present above its respective RM program quantity threshold at this facility is anhydrous ammonia.  There is a single Program Level 3 ammonia refrigeration process.  The RM program for the Pasco Fac"

This prevention program is required by both RM Program and Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations, which are quite similar with respect to release prevention.  The prevention program for the ammonia process was developed to comply with PSM regulations.  Key provisions of the facility release prevention program are as follows:\n\n-Employees who operate these systems must receive training initially and periodically on safe startup/shutdown, operations, and emergency shutdown of the processes.  \n-Release incidents are investigated, and the results are used to improve the safety of the process. \n-The ammonia refrigeration system is maintained through the mechanical integrity program, which minimizes the risk of accident and maximizes process safety.\n-Results of incident investigations are also shared with employees who could be affected by the process.  \n-Employees participate in a process hazard analysis (PHA) which identifies potential hazards and ways to improve the safety of the process every five years, or whenever significant changes are made to the process.\n-The facility has a management of change (MOC) program in place that mandates that changes to the ammonia system are reviewed prior to implementing the change to ensure that the change would not compromise safety.\n-A pre-startup review is also completed after a major change and prior to a new process coming on line.  \n-A hot work (spark producing) permit program is in place. \n-Contractors who are hired to work on or near the regulated processes must have adequate training on the hazards prior to starting work. \n-The Pasco facility has an ammonia alarm system that notifies refrigeration system"

The facility has it's own written Emergency Action Plan, the plan includes procedures for informing the public and local response agencies of a chemical release as well as includes information on emergency health care. This plan is coordinated with the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and the local fire department.  We conduct annual drills for implementation of the Emergency Action Plan at the facility.\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\nPasco Processing will continue to improve safety by implementing as soon as possible all recommendations from audits, PHA's, incident investigations, MOC's and mechanical integrity findings."
