      "SummaryText": "A. Chain of Rocks Water Treatment Plant\nThe Water Division is a branch of the City of St. Louis Department of Public Utilities.  We have proudly invested in and served the greater St. Louis Metropolitan area since 1835.  The Water Division's Chain of Rocks Water Treatment Plant has been providing safe, clean drinking water to city customers since 1894.  The plant is located on the Mississippi River near the Chain of Rocks Bridge in the city of St. Louis, Missouri.     \n\nB. Chlorine\nAt the Chain of Rocks Water Treatment Plant, we have used chlorine as part of the treatment process that provides our community with safe drinking water for more than 80 years.  Chlorine is the most widely used disinfectant.  It has been safely used to disinfect drinking water for nearly 100 years.  Water supply disinfection has virtually eliminated incidences of waterborne diseases such as cholera, typhoid and dysentery and is credited with increasing American's life expectancies by more than 50 percent.\n\nChlorine is a greenish-yellow gas with a pungent, irritating odor similar to bleach and is toxic in certain concentrations.  Chlorine exists as a gas at ambient temperature and pressure, but is liquified when kept in our process equipment.  The chlorine we use is transported to the plant by rail in a Department of Transportation (DOT)-approved heavy-wall steel 55-ton railroad tank car.  The railcar is securely parked outdoors at our facility in accordance with DOT regulations and connected to our process equipment.\n\nC. Environmental, Health and Safety Policy\nWe have long understood the hazards of handling chlorine, which if not handled properly, can pose a risk to the community.  It is the Water Division's policy to conduct our business in accordance with all applicable environmental, health and safety laws and regulations and to promote a healthful, safe and protected environment.  The chlorine process at the Chain of Rocks Plant is regulated by the US EPA Risk Management Program (RMP)"

      "SummaryText": "Rule.  The Chain of Rocks Plant complies with this regulation, as well as others, to ensure that the risks involved in handling, use and storage of chlorine and other potentially hazardous chemicals are minimized.  \n\nD. Risk Management Plan\nWe recognize there are risks associated with handling and using chlorine.  We have been, and will continue, working very hard to minimize these risks.  Our Risk Management Plan is the latest step in our continuing efforts to improve the safety of our plant.  The Water Division has conducted hazard reviews and has implemented an accidental release prevention program which integrates technologies, procedures and management practices.  Additionally, the Chain of Rocks Plant has trained employees for emergency response and maintains an Emergency Response Plan which has been supplied to the \nSt. Louis City Fire Department.   These programs enable the Chain of Rocks Plant to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences of hazardous releases of chlorine.\n\nE. Offsite Consequence Analysis\nUnder the RMP rule, the Chain of Rocks Water Treatment Plant is required to conduct and document an offsite consequence analysis, which includes consideration of two chlorine release scenarios, identified as a worst-case release scenario and an alternative release scenario.  The first scenario is defined by EPA as the maximum quantity in the largest vessel...released as a gas over 10 minutes during worst- case weather conditions (no wind, low humidity), due to an unspecified failure.  This worst-case scenario assumes that all safety systems fail and that there is no emergency response.  The alternative release scenario is a different, more realistic scenario, which depicts a failure defined by the facility.  In the alternative release scenario, facilities are allowed to include active mitigation systems in calculating the distance that an accidental release of this type could pose as a hazard to the public or the environment.  \n\nThe offsi"

      "SummaryText": "te consequence analysis is done by 1) determining the distance from the point of release that an accidental release could pose a hazard to the public or the environment, and 2) identifying what is vulnerable within that distance.  To determine the distance over which releases could pose a hazard to the public or the environment, the EPA has established endpoint exposure concentrations.  The endpoint for chlorine is based on the American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA) Emergency Response Planning Guideline (ERPG)-2.  This value represents the  the maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects or symptoms which could impair and individual's ability to take protective action.  The chlorine toxic endpoint used in offsite consequence analysis is 3 parts per million (0.0087 milligrams/liter).  The population potentially affected is defined as the population within a circle that has as its center the point of release, and its radius equals the distance to the toxic endpoint.  The offsite consequence analysis for the Chain of Rocks Water Treatment Plant was conducted using EPA's RMP*Comp v. 1.06 atmospheric modeling software.\n\nWorst Case Release Scenario\nFor the Chain of Rocks Water Treatment Plant, the worst-case release would be the instantaneous failure of a 55-ton chlorine railroad tank car wall causing a total release of the contents of a full tank car in 10 minutes under worst-case weather conditions.  This scenario also assumes a complete failure of all safety controls and no emergency response.  This would result in the release of 110,000 pounds of chlorine. \n\nThe hypothetical worst-case scenario is intended to define the full potential for offsite impacts from an accidental chemical release.  Defining that potential is valuable however, the worst-case scenario is extremely unlikely to occur, and therefor"

It is unlikely to occur because of all of the layers of protection in place to prevent or minimize a large release:\n-  The chlorine process equipment is designed and operated to minimize accidental releases.\n-  The process is monitored continuously and the plant is manned 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.\n-  Plant operating personnel are State-licensed, trained and qualified to operate the chlorine process  equipment safely.\n-  Approved operating and maintenance procedures are implemented and maintained.\n-  Early-warning, highly sensitive leak detection equipment monitors the process equipment.\n-  The process provides for emergency shutdown and remote valves to isolate and limit releases.\n-  Emergency response plans and equipment are in place at the plant.\n-  Emergency notification systems are in place.  \n\nIt is also important to note that, in the extremely unlikely event that a worst-case release would occur, only the population within an elliptical plume extending downwind of the release point is potentially affected.  This plume area, or footprint, is approximately one-twentieth of the area of the full circle. \n\nAlternative Release Scenario\nRMP regulations require that a scenario which is a more realistic scenario than the worst-case scenario be selected as the alternative release. The scenario selected involves the failure of the 3/4 inch tubing that transfers chlorine from the storage tank car to the water chlorination system.   In this scenario, the amount of chlorine released is 34,800 pounds at an average rate over 30 minutes (the duration of the release) of 1160 lb/min.  Active mitigation systems considered are the actuation of a chlorine detector and execution of emergency response procedures.  \nF.

Planned Changes to Improve Safety\nCurrently, the City of St. Louis Water Division is undergoing a multimillion dollar construction project at the Chain of Rocks Water Treatment Plant that will reduce the quantity of chlorine stored onsite and provide additional layers of protection to the chlorine process.  Once the new state-of-the-art facility is on-line, the plant will receive chlorine only in 1-ton cylinders.  All chlorine cylinders will be stored inside a containment building with emergency scrubber equipment,  an emergency power supply, gas detection equipment and alarms, liquid tight floors and secondary containment provisions.  In preparation for this process change, new standard operating and maintenance procedures are being drafted, emergency response plans are being revised and plant personnel are undergoing extensive training.  The new chlorine facility is scheduled to be on-line by February 2000.  The new protection measures will further reduce the RMP worst-case and alternate case scenario distances to endpoint."
