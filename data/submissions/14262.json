Facility Policy\n\n    The owners and employees of this facility are dedicated to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  In the case of an accidental release the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department and other authorities to mitigate any release and minimixe the impact to the surrounding area.\n\n2. Information\n\n    The primary activity at the facility is sale of fertilizer, feed, and seed to area farmers.  \n    Anhydrous Ammonia is stored and sold for direct application for crop production nutrients.\n    \n3. Worst Case release Scenario and the Alternative Release Scenario\n\n    A. The worst-case scenario would be the release of the total contents of the storage tank released as  \n         as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 52,000 lbs as there is only one \n         large storage tank on the premises.  The distance to the endpoint is 1.75 miles.\n  \n    B.  The alternative release scenario based on the most likely incident is a release from a break \n          in a transfer hose.  The distance to the endpoint is .64 miles.\n\n4. The facility has implemented the provisions of the \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of  Anhydrous Ammonia, K-611.1\", published by The American National Standards Institute, inc. and the standards of the U>S> Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\". \n\n5. The Emergency Response Program\n\n    The facility has a written emergency action plan in accordance with OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.38.\n    The community right-to-know information is furnished to authorities\n    Emergency response program including pre-emergency planning and employee training.\n\n6.  Safety is an ongoing process. Evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions."
