Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nVandervoort's Dairy recognizes management's responsibility in protecting the public, its employees, equipment, property, and the environment.  The safety and health of all personnel are very important.  The control of accidents has been and will continue to be a basic responsibility of all personnel in the Fort Worth facility.\n\nTo accomplish the company's goal in preventing  accidents, the facility has established a Plant Safety Program.  The objectives of the Plant Safety Program are to: maximize safety performance, eliminate human suffering and the economic burden resulting from injuries and accidents, and reduce losses associated with damage of property,.\n\nOne of the activities associated with the Plant Safety Program has been the development and implementation of accidental release prevention and emergency response programs which are designed to comply with OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals, 29 CFR 1910.119), and EPA's Risk Management Program (RM program) regulation (Risk Management Programs for Chemical Accidental Release Prevention, 40 CFR Part 68).  Mr. Perry Griffey, Plant Engineer, is responsible for implementation of the Risk Management Program.\n\nThe purpose of the accidental release prevention and emergency response programs is to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences of significant releases of toxic substances as well as fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents.  Overall, these programs prevent accidental fatalities, injuries and illnesses, environmental impacts, and avoid physical property damage.\n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response programs help prevent accidents because they focus on the rules, procedures, and practices which govern individual processes, activities, or pieces of equipment.  These rules are detailed and improved as"

They are also communicated to and accepted by all employees at the facility.\n\nIn addition to the Plant Safety Program, the Vandervoort's Dairy facility follows the following corporate safety guidelines:\n \tEmployee Handbook Plant Safety Rules\n \tKroger Company Contractor Safety Rules\n \tKroger Company Total Quality Initiative (TQI) process\n \tKroger Company Manufacturing Safety Key Element Assessment (KEA) & Management\n \tKroger Company Behavioral Accident Prevention Process (BAPP) Steering Committee\n \tGeneral Office (GO) Safety Inspection program and abatement plans\n\n\nB.   Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nVandervoort's Dairy is part of the Kroger Company.  The facility is a dairy foods processing plant that produces fluid milk and cultured products, ice cream, yogurt, flavored drinks and orange juice.  The amount of anhydrous ammonia (CAS #7662-41-7) contained in the system is in excess of 10,000 pounds.  The maximum inventory in the system is approximately 36,000 pounds.  Since an ammonia release from the system could pose a risk of offsite public and/or environmental impact and the system is regulated under the OSHA PSM standard (29 CFR 1910.119), the system is subject to the Program 3 requirements of the EPA's RM program.\n\n\nC.   Summary of Worst-Case and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nThe worst-case release scenario at the Vandervoort's Dairy facility involves the release of 16,879 pounds of ammonia over a 10 minute period due to the failure of the ammonia receiver.  This quantity represents the full capacity of the vessel, which is a conservative assumption as it may only be full once every 15 years during a substantial system pump- down  Under worst-case weather conditions, ammonia could travel 1.5 miles before dispersing enough to no longer pose a hazard to the public. This distance has been calculated based on the method provided in EPA's Risk Management Program (40 CFR 68) Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration.\n\nThe worst-case release"

Under alternative release weather conditions, ammonia could travel 0.2 miles before dispersing enough to no longer pose a hazard to the public.  This distance has been calculated based on the method provided in EPA's Risk Management Program (40 CFR 68) Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration.\n\nThe alternative release scenario is unlikely for the following reasons:\n\n\t \tIndustry standards were followed for the manufacture and quality control of the liquid lines;\n\t \tAmmonia is not corrosive in this service;\n\t \tMost of the lines are elevated to minimize potential damage from traffic, fork lifts etc.;\n\t \tThe facility has a preventive maintenance program in place to maintain the on-going integrity of the system; \n\t \tThe facility has a training program designed to ensure that the system is operated by qualified personnel; and,\n\t \tThe facility emergency response procedures enable trained personnel to resp"
