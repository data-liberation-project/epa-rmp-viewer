Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:\n\nThe owners, management and employees of Central Grain Corporation (Site #2) are dedicated to the prevention of any accidental release of ammonia from aqua ammonia.  If an addidental release should occur at the facility, employees and management have been trained and are prepared to work with the  Newland Vol. Fire Department, The Pasquotank Central Emergency Communications and any surrounding authorities to mitigate any release and  minimize the impact of the release on people and environment.\n\n2.   The Stationary Source and Regulated Substance Handled:\n\nThe primary activity of the Site #2 facility of Central Grain Corporqtions is the storage of fertilizer for sales to agricultural users (farmers).\n\nAqua Ammonia containing a maximum of 30% ammonia is received by tanker truck, stored, and used from the storage tanks in the production of mixed- grade liquid fertilizer for plant nutrients.\n\nThe maximum quanity of Aqua Ammonia stored at the facility would be  374,500 pounds  in 5 tanks containing 10,000 gallons each.  This would be 112,500 pounds of ammonia at the maximum of 30% ammonia content.\n\n3.   The worse-case scenario and alternate release scenario:\n\na)   The worse-case scenario would be the release of the entire contents of Aqua Ammonia containing a minimum of 30% ammonium from a 10,000 gallon storage tank, release as a liquid  over a 10 minute period.  The maximum amount released would be 75,000 pounds of aqua ammonia whcih would contain 22,500 pounds of ammonia at 30% maximum content.  Teh distance to an endpoint of 200 ppm of ammonia , as determined by The Fertilizer Institute's Model - Degadis is 0.66 miles.  The release would affect  1  residents.  The possibility  of this worse-case release occuring is extremely unlikely as location personnel reqularly inspect and repair as necessary all storage tanks.\n\nThe alternate release scenario, based on the most likely potential incident, is a  re"

The calculated quanilty of Aqua Ammonia would be 15oo pounds which is 450 pounds of ammonia, based on the maximum of 30% Ammonia content.  The distance to end point of 200 ppm of ammonia as dertermined by The  Fertilizer Institute's Model - Degadis is 0.07 miles.  This is 370 feer and would affect  0 (N0)  residents.  The possibility of an alternate release scenario occuring is unlikely as Cental Grain personnel periodically inspect, repair and replace equipment according to industry standard procedures.\n\n4.   The General Accidental Release Prevention Program:\n\nThe Central Grain Corporation Site #2  facility has implemented the provision of Aqua Ammonia suppliers recommendations for safe handling of Aqua Ammonia and appropriate OSHA regulations.  Additionally, periodic training in handling, storage and use of Aqua Ammonia is conducted with personnel at this location.\n\n5.   The Five-Year Accident History:\n\nThis facility has had no accidental release of Aqua Ammonia in the past five years that have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site or has reuslted in any off-site deaths, injuries, evacuationsa, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n6.   The Emergency Response Program:\n\nThis facility has:\n\na.   A written Emergency Response Plan which  is   incorporated in the  written Community Emergency Response Plan of Paquotank County.\n\nb.   Provided State and Local authorities with emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCPA).\nThis facilities Emergency Response Program has been discussed with and reviewed by the Newland Fire Department.\n\n7.   Safety inprovement is an on-going grocess at all the facilities of Central Grain Corporation.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the effectiveness of safety practices and proper maintenan"
