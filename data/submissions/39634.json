Employees working with the anhydrous ammonia system make routine observations and inspections prior to and during transfer operations of the anhydrous ammonia from the storage tank to nurse tanks, enabling them to detect problems early before they can cause a hazardous situation.  Empoyees are trained regularly to recognize areas of potential hazards and new hires are trained immediately and observed to determine their level of comprehension and understanding.  The company makes every effort to cooperate with local, state, and federal officials as they endeavor to assist us with our anhydrous ammonia operation."
