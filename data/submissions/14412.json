We will at a minimum: (1) consult with employees and their representatives on the conduct and development of the process hazard review and other elements of the risk management plan, and (2) provide to our employees and their representatives access to the process hazard review and all other information required to be developed under that standard.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe City of Oklahoma City believes that preventative maintenance is the key to minimizing the potential for accidental releases.  Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) have been reviewed and revised to enable the employees to perform their work in a safe and efficient.\n\nThe Lake Hefner Water Treatment Plant has chosen to be a non-responding facility in the event of an emergency.  Responsibility for emergency response to an accidental release has been given to the Oklahoma City Police and Fire Departments and the State and Local Emergency Response Centers.\n\nStationary Sources and Regulated Substances.\n\nThe Lake Hefner Water Treatment Plant utilizes chlorine and ammonia as disinfectants for the treated drinking water.  The maximum inventory and threshold quantities for these chemicals are shown below.\n\nChemical                                  Maximum Inventory (lb.)

RMP*COMP was used to determine endpoint distances for both scenarios.  A dense gas model is required since chlorine is heavier than air.
