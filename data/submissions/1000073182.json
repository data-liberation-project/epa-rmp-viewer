This ensures that process design, operating equipment, and operating and maintenance procedures are evaluated to determine changes needed to prevent recurrence of the Incident.\r\n- Internal and third party compliance audits will ensure that the level of safety protection at the facility is periodically evaluated for improvements.\r\n\r\nSpecific actions that will be taken in the future to improve the level of safety at the facility include:\r\n- ONEOK's ongoing dialogue, recurring tabletop exercises or physical emergency drills with the Ellsworth and Rice County Emergency Management Directors or his/her designees will help ensure a constant state of readiness to respond to any potential emergencies, as well as a means to implement improvements to emergency response capabilities, as  needs arise.  Protection of the environment, people/public and property is paramount to ONEOK.\r\n- The Bushton Complex has developed an internal company fire brigade and has purchased firefighting equipment to help aid in offensive and defensive emergency response.  Development of emergency response training, ER tool(s) acquisition, and overall response capabilities continues at the Bushton facility.\r\n- For increased security, Bushton Complex Management continues to install perimeter fenc"

(ONEOK) is committed to managing all operations in a manner that protects the environment and the health and safety of employees, customers, contractors and the public while fully complying with applicable laws and regulations.  ONEOK's management philosophy goals are achieved through the implementation of the Environmental Health and Safety Management Systems, by the personal commitments of employees and contractors, and by open communication with employees, customers, neighbors, and regulators.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this Risk Management Plan is to provide information about operations at the facility, programs to prevent accidental chemical releases, emergency response plans in the event an accidental release should occur, the five-year accident history of the facility and planned changes to improve safety at the facility.\r\n\r\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\r\n\r\nONEOK owns and operates a natural gas liquids (NGL) fractionation plant and underground cavern storage facility located near Bushton, Kansas.  The fractionator and the storage caverns were previously covered under separate Risk Management Plans; however, they are now incorporated into one RMP.  The Bushton Fractionator receives raw natural gas liquids via pipeline, which are then fractionated into various products.  These products include ethane/propane (E/P mix), propane, iso-butane, normal butane, and 14# gasoline.  The storage facility receives products from the fractionator as well as from incoming pipeline and stores the substances in underground storage caverns.  From the storage caverns, products are sent to customers via outgoing pipeline.  Additionally, propane is loaded on trucks for distribution to customers.  The RMP flammable substances and mixtures stored or processed at the facility are E/P mix, propane, iso-butane, normal butane, refiner"

These high standards include:\r\n-  Operating in compliance with required environmental permits and regulations. \r\n-  Operating and maintaining assets in such a manner that unintentional releases are minimized.\r\n-  Operating and maintaining assets in such a manner that the small releases associated with normal operation and maintenance will be minimized to the extent possible.\r\n-  Correcting non-compliance found by regular audits of the facility.\r\n\r\nPREVENTION PROGRAM\r\n\r\nThe Bushton Complex is operating under the guidelines of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Program.    Part of the RMP/PSM Prevention Program involves identifying and taking steps to avoid potential accidental chemical releases.  A few examples of the prevention features implemented at this facility include:\r\n- Providing overpressure relief valves on all pressurized vessels.\r\n- Providing level transmitters and alarms on all vessels to help prevent overfilling.\r\n- Conducting preventive maintenance and testing of vessels through the Mechanical   Integrity program to help ensure   that structural failures do not occur in process equipment.\r\n- Minimizing the possibility of an interruption in the combustion of hydrocarbon vapors by having a continuous flare. \r\n- Ensuring hydrocarbon vapor is removed and burned by installing degassifiers at the north and south brine systems.\r\n- Installing hydrocarbon gas detectors throughout the gas plant and at every well in the storage facility.\r\n- Minimizing the potential for a catastrophic"

Also involved in emergency response for the facility would be the Ellsworth and Rice County Sheriff Departments and the Holyrood Fire Department.  The Bushton Plant Manager or Manager, Storage Operations is responsible for coordinating the emergency actions depending on where they occur within the facility.  A specific Emergency Response Plan for the facility is in place and that plan has been coordinated with local officials.  The Emergency Response Program provides the essential planning for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.\r\n\r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\n\r\nCompliance with the RMP Prevention Program, coupled with the Environmental Health and Safety Management Systems, forms the framework for continuous safety Improvement.
