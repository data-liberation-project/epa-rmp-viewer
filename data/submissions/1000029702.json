Because New Braunfels Utility (NBU) \r\nfacilities contain quantities of regulated toxic substances above the threshold quantities, it is \r\nsubject to the RMP regulations.\r\n \r\nFacilities\r\n\r\nNBU is responsible for both potable water and wastewater treatment in a certified service \r\narea in the general vicinity of the city limits of New Braunfels, Texas. NBU operates one \r\nsurface water treatment plant and six wells for potable water treatment and three municipal \r\nwastewater treatment plants. \r\n\r\nCurrently, the NBU water treatment plant (WTP) stores chlorine in up to three, one-ton \r\ncontainers. The quantity of chlorine stored onsite exceeds the EPA\u00bfs threshold of 2,500 \r\npounds, thus subjecting the NBU WTP to the RMP Rule. The RMP primarily consists of the \r\nfollowing three elements: Offsite Hazard Assessment, Accident Prevention Program, and an \r\nEmergency Response Program.\r\n\r\nApplicable Program Level\r\n\r\nThe RMP regulations define three Program levels based on the relative potential of a process \r\nfor public impacts, the level of effort needed to prevent accidents, and coverage by other \r\nregulations. The Program levels are defined as follows:\r\n\r\nProgram 1:  Process with no public receptors within the distance to an endpoint from a \r\nworst-case scenario and with no accidents with offsite consequences within the past five \r\nyears.\r\nProgram 2:  Process not eligible for Program 1 or subject to Program 3.\r\nProgram 3:  Process not eligible for Program 1 and subject to OSHA\u00bfs Process Safety \r\nManagement (PSM) standard under federal or state OSHA programs.\r\n\r\nThe NBU WTP chlorine process worst case scenario will impact offsite receptors and the \r\nState of Texas does not fall under the OSHA PSM standard. Therefore, the chlorine proce"

The RMP developed for the NBU WTP follows requirements of a \r\nProgram 2 process.\r\n\r\nOffsite Hazard Assessment\r\n\r\nAn offsite hazard assessment was conducted for the NBU WTP to determine the distance a \r\ntoxic concentration of chlorine gas would travel in case of a release. The toxic endpoint \r\nconcentration for chlorine is three parts per million (ppm). The population within the radius \r\nof the release and sensitive receptors such as hospitals, schools, and state parks were \r\nidentified. Two release scenarios\u00bfthe \u00bfWorst Case\u00bf and an \u00bfAlternative Case\u00bf were \r\nconsidered. The Hazard Assessment also includes a five-year accident history of the NBU \r\nWTP.\r\n\r\nWorst Case Scenario\r\n\r\nThe worst case scenario assumes the entire contents of the largest single container are \r\nreleased, regardless of how improbable that may be, over a period of ten minutes. \r\nTherefore, the NBU WTP must model offsite impacts of a 2,000-pound chlorine release over \r\na duration of 10 minutes. The resulting release rate is 200 pounds per minute. The worst \r\ncase scenario also requires conservative meteorological conditions. A relatively slow wind \r\nspeed of 1.5 meters per second and a stability class F must be assumed. Stability classes are \r\ncategorized by the amount of turbulence in the atmosphere. Class F is the lowest turbulence \r\nclassification. With low wind speed and atmospheric turbulence, the chlorine plume will \r\ndilute slowly, causing an increased distance to the toxic endpoint. \r\n\r\nFurthermore, only \u00bfpassive\u00bf mitigation methods such as buildings or dikes can be \r\nconsidered. Passive mitigation, as defined, requires no mechanical, electrical, or human \r\ninput. The one-ton containers of chlorine at the NBU WTP are not located inside a building \r\nand therefore cannot consider building mitigation.\r\n\r\nEPA\u00bfs RMP*CompTM was used to predict the distance required for the plume of chlorine gas \r\nin a worst case scenario situation to dilute to 3 ppm.

Unlike the worst case scenario, the alternative release \r\nscenario may consider \u00bfactive\u00bf mitigation such as automatic shutoff valves and scrubbers. \r\nActive mitigation is defined as requiring mechanical, electrical, or human input. \r\nFurthermore, the alternative release scenario assumes more realistic regional and seasonal \r\nmeteorology as compared to the worst case scenario. \r\n\r\nThe alternative release scenario modeled for the NBU WTP involves a one-ton chlorine \r\ncontainer rupture due to dropping it during changing out empty containers with full \r\ncontainers. This particular scenario was selected because it represents a \u00bfworst case\u00bf \r\nalternative release resulting in offsite impacts.\r\n\r\nTo predict the distance required for the plume of chlorine gas in an alternative release \r\nscenario to dilute to 3 ppm, EPA\u00bfs RMP*CompTM was used. Using the predicted distance, \r\npotential offsite public and environmental receptors were determined.\r\n\r\nFive-year Accident History\r\n\r\nUnder the RMP Rule, a five-year accident release history must be reported for regulated \r\nsubstances exceeding the threshold quantity. The release must have caused at least one of \r\nthe following situations: onsite or offsite death(s), injuries or significant property damage, \r\noffsite environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place. There were no reportable \r\naccidents at the NBU WTP between June 21, 1999, and the present date.\r\n\r\nPrevention Program\r\n\r\nThe Prevention Program is composed of Safety Information, Hazard Review, Operating \r\nProcedures, Training, Maintenance, Incident Investigation, and Compliance Audit \r\nprocedures.

In addition, details \r\nsuch as maximum intended inventory and safe upper and lower operating limits can be \r\nfound.\r\n\r\nHazard Review\r\n\r\nThe hazard review (HR) provides information that will assist NBU WTP staff in making \r\ndecisions for improving safety and reducing the consequences of hazardous accidental \r\nreleases. A HR is a systematic effort to evaluate potential causes and consequences of \r\naccidental releases. The HR focuses on equipment, instrumentation, utilities, human actions, \r\nand external factors that might affect the process.

Necessary forms for \r\ndocumentation are included and must be maintained for a minimum of five years after each \r\nincident. \r\n\r\nCompliance Audit\r\n\r\nProcedures were developed to complete a compliance audit for the NBU WTP. A \r\ncompliance audit is a self-evaluation of the effectiveness of the RMP program that identifies \r\ndeficiencies, assures corrective action, and increases safety awareness among plant staff. To \r\nensure compliance with the program, the RMP includes a checklist that the NBU WTP staff \r\nmust complete at least once every three years.
