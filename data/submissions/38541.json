Changes are reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.

This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\r\n\r\n\tThe Crown refinery, located in Pasadena, Texas , operates a variety of processes to produce petroleum products (e.g., refinery grade propylene, gasoline, fuel oil, and coke) from raw crude oil.  The refinery has several regulated flammables, such as hydrogen, methane, ethanes, propanes, butanes, and pentanes.  In addition, the refinery uses chlorine for algae control in cooling towers  and hydrogen fluoride in the making of gasoline, which are also regulated substances.\r\n\r\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT RESULTS\r\n\r\n\tEPA has tailored the requirements of the worst case scenario (WCS) assessment into three tiers and Crown's risk management program falls into Program 3, because of its industry type - refining, and its existing coverage under the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) process safety management program.  Crown's  WCS assessment associated with toxic substances in Program 3 processes at the refinery is a catastrophic failure of the hydrofluoric (HF) acid storage drum , resulting in a release of 50,000 pounds of HF gas from its storage drum over a 10-minute period.

The 1-minute release duration is the approximate time necessary for monitors to detect HF and for the isolation valves to isolate the pump and stop the release.  No other mitigation measures were taken into account in evaluating this scenario.  The maximum distance to the toxic endpoint for this ARS is 0.1 miles as calculated by EPA's RMP*Comp\u00bf.\r\n  \r\n\tThe WCS associated with a release of flammable substances in Program 3 processes at the refinery is a vapor cloud explosion (VCE) involving the full inventory of the largest storage tank containing normal butane.  We do not limit the storage inventory in the tank and therefore, the WCS assumes the full tank inventory of 2,900,000 pounds is released, completely vaporizes, and ignites, resulting in a VCE.  The maximum distance to the 1-PSI (pounds per square inch) endpoint for this WCS is 1.1 miles as calculated by EPA's RMP*Comp\u00bf.

After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the emergency operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.
