The Facility Policy\n \nThe owners, management, and employees of Consumers Co-op Assn. are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous and propane. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire company, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment. \n\n 2. Facility Information.\n\n The primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers, and propane sales and delivery.  Anhydrous ammoina is received , stored and distributed for direct application. Anhydrous ammonia is used for crop production nutrients. Propane gas is received , stored and distributed for delivery for home heating, farm and commerical business uses.\n \nThe maximum quantity of ammonia stored would be 500,000 pounds in our 26,000 and 18,000 gallon storage tanks. The maximum quantity handled would be the unloading of a tank truck holding 40,000 pounds.\n\nThe maximum quantity of propane gas stored would be 220,000 pounds in our two 30,000 gallon storage tanks. The maximum quantity handled would be the unloading of a tank truck holding 40,000 pounds.\n \n3. The worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario.\n\n a. The worst-case release scenario for anhydrous ammonia would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released as a gas over ten minutes. The maximum quantity released would be 120,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards. The distance the end point (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 1.09 miles.\n\nThe worst case release scenario for propane would be the failure of one 30,000 gallon storage tank when fi                                          "
