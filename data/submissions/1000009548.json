The accidental release prevention and emergency policies.\n\nThe Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) classifies two raw materials utilized by the James Austin Company as hazardous; chlorine and ammonium hydroxide.\n\nThe management of the James Austin Company is cognizant of the risks such chemicals pose to its employees and the community.  Austin?s management is committed to ensuring that its employees adhere to safety and accident prevention procedures when handling all chemicals.\n\nSensors provide early warning of minute leaks of chlorine and are linked to the facility?s alarm system.  Once detected, automatic shut off valves close quickly to seal off a leak.  Alarms are also in place to automatically signal emergency personnel and evacuate the facility in the event of a potentially serious leak.  Evacuation routes are clearly marked and periodic drills are conducted.  Sensors, alarms, and other emergency equipment is checked for proper functioning.  Defective emergency equipment is fixed or replaced promptly.\n\nAll employees who handle chlorine and ammonium hydroxide must complete specialized in-house training prior to assuming such responsibilities.  These employees are also sent annually for additional outside training sponsored by our chemical suppliers, they also receive the Hazmat Technician Refresher Training, enabling the establishment of an on-site emergency response team.\n\nLocal Fire Departments are invited annually for a tour of the plant.  Many of the local departments attend each year.  They are appraised of any significant changes in equipment, chemicals or processes that may assist in an emergency response.  The company also solicits their input on ways to improve the safety of our facility.\n\n\n2).  The facility and regulated substances handled.\n\nThe James Austin Company is a family owned business and in existence over 100 years.

      "SummaryText": "old cleaning and laundry aides are manufactured.  Such as; bleach, ammonia, dish soaps, fabric softeners, laundry detergents, window cleaners, etc.  Most of these products are produced by dilution and/or blending of concentrated raw materials.  Of these products, the bleach and ammonia will be discussed.  These are the chemicals on site, which the EPA considers to be hazardous materials.\n\nThe raw materials used to produce these products are shipped to our facility by drum, tank truck and rail car.\n\nThe finished household ammonia is produced by a 29.4% ammonium hydroxide solution, which is a regulated substance.  It is shipped in by tank truck and unloaded into a storage tank.   The maximum amount of the 29.4% ammonium hydroxide that can be stored is 98,280 pounds.  A measuring level meter in the 29.4% ammonium hydroxide tank enables us to determine the exact amount being delivered and the amount in the tank at all times.   When production of the household ammonia is needed, the 29.4% ammonium hydroxide is metered and diluted into another tank.\n\nThe offloading of chlorine from a rail car produces the finished household bleach.  Chlorine is a regulated substance.  The maximum amount of chlorine that can be stored on the rail siding is 720,000 pounds.  The chlorine is metered through continuous bleach making process unit with a solution of water and sodium hydroxide that are also being metered to produce finished household strength bleach.   The sensors metering these raw materials open and close valves accordingly to keep a constant strength.   Samples are taken from the continuous bleach making process during this time to ensure the proper strength.  Samples are also taken from the finished tank to once again check product quality.\n\n\n3).  The general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps.\n\nThere are several regulations which aide as preventive measures in reducing the risk of injury or a release that James Austin Company must co"

      "SummaryText": "mply.\n\nOne of these regulations is the Process Safety Management Standard of highly hazardous chemicals, Title 29 CFR 1910.119.  This standard is to prevent unwanted releases that could expose employees and others to serious hazards.  The standard covers the hazards of the chemicals used in the process, technology of the process, equipment in the process and employee involvement.  Another regulation is the Department of Transportation 49 CFR 174.67 tank car unloading.\n\nPreventive measures are taken each day during start-up and shut down of the system to reduce the rise of problems.  This includes the checking of valves, making sure of a secure hook up seal, scrubbing chlorine lines when finished and meters are calibrated.\n\nThe continuous bleach making process has numerous high and low level alarm settings that will automatically close valves if the alarm is reached.  The chlorine rail car is equipped with a Unipro automatic valve shut off system.   If the chlorine car is moved, loss of air pressure, loss of electric or the chlorine sensors detect chlorine, the Unipro automatic valves will close.  \n \nA chlorine air monitoring system is constantly monitoring the air inside the building and at each rail car.  Upon the detection of chlorine, the alarm will signal either a first or second alarm depending on the amount detected.  Either alarm will close the automatic shut off valves at the rail car.  First alarm is a warning, second alarm employees must evacuate the building and the proper personnel on site will respond. Also in second alarm, the outside monitoring company will call the facility for a clear code.  If no answer or proper clear code given, they will dispatch emergency response crews.\n\nThe hooking up and disconnection of a chlorine rail car is a 3-person must operation.  Two will perform the job while the third watches on the monitor.  All are in contact with 2-way radios during the procedure and throughout the day.\n\n\n4).  The five-year accident history.\n\nTh"

We are continuously updating and adding safety features to the systems and training personnel to prevent a future possible release.\n\n\n5).  The emergency response program\n.\nAll employees are given general safety training that work around the chemicals in the plant.  The training informs the employees how to recognize, understand, and use labels and material safety data sheets.  It provides what safety procedures to follow when working with chemicals to reduce hazards.  Explanation of the different alarm signals and what evacuation procedures to follow.\n\nIn the event of an emergency that requires evacuation, an announcement is given over the PA system or the alarms will signal.  The evacuation routes to follow are posted in each department.  There are fire alarms throughout the entire plant, office, and warehouse.  These will set off anytime there is water movement in the sprinkler system.  A chlorine monitoring system is in place by the continuous bleach making process area, by each rail car dome area and the outside perimeter of the rail cars.   If the sensor head detects chlorine it will alert employees and close the automatic shut-off valves at the rail car.  The chlorine monitoring is tied into the fire protection system.  The outside company monitoring our system will call the facility upon a chlorine alarm for a clear code.  If there is no answer or proper clear code given, they will dispatch emergency response crews.\n\nThe mixing department receives a more specialized training.  New employees work very closely with a veteran mixer.  During their training period they observe, follow, and learn the system along with the safe handling of chlorine.  Once they are knowledgeable about what they have learned thus far, training will continue with hands-on duties and responsibilities of the standard operating procedures.  They will have to prove their capabilities through a verbal testing gi"
