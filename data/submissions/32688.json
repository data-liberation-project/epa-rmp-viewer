For all personnel, assigned responsibility for individual requirements, this plan identifies the persons responsible and is made up of four (4) major areas identified as the Management System, Hazard Assessment, Prevention Program and the Emergency Response Program.\n\nThe Hazard Assessment is made up of the worst case analysis and the alternate release analysis utilizing Degadis modeling.  Also included is a five (5) year accident history, with no accidental releases occurring at this facility during the past five (5) years.\n\nThe facility is a standard water treatment plant using chlorine as a disinfectant for potable water.  One (1) ton cylinders of chlorine exceeding a threshold inventory of 2500 pounds are stored in a separate enclosed building.  The worst case release scenario, identified in the hazard assessment, would be the release of the entire contents of a one (1) ton cylinder of chlorine gas.  This type of release would have an offsite impact of a 1.5 mile radius around the treatment facility.  The affected area includes residences, two (2) schools, and a hospital.  The alternate release scenarios would be a pin hole piping leak or a vacuum regulator leak with an offsite impact of .10 miles and .20 miles respectively.  The leak detection system includes audible alarms, strobe lights, report back to the central computer, and keyed interlocks of the exhaust system of the sealed chlorine facility.\n\nThe most comprehensive section of the RMP is the Prevention Program.  This section includes detailed information and procedures on Process Safety Information, Process Hazard Analysis, Operating Procedures, Training, Mechanical Integrity, Management of Change, Pre-Startup Review, Com"

Although the facility will not be first responders in the event of an accidental release the emergency plan details the procedures to follow and includes name and phone numbers of the responding parties.  \n\nThe electronic data elements fo the Executive Summary Section 1 entitled registration is make part of the Executive Summary.
