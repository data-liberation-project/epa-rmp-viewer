An investigation team will be assembled and the investigation is initiated within 48 hours of the incident.  The results of the investigation are documented, recommendations are evaluated, and appropriate recommendations are implemented.  Information found during the investigation is reviewed by affected staff and used as needed to revise operating and maintenance procedures.\n\nFive-Year Accident History Summary\nNo reportable releases/accidents have occurred at the North District plant during the last 5 years.\n\nEmergency Response Program Summary\nThe MDWASD emergency response policy involves the preparation and maintenance of emergency response plans for hazardous materials, which are tailored to each facility, and to the emergency response services available in the community, and is in compliance with the EPA Emergency Response Program Requirements.  North District WWTP has an Emergency Response Plan and Emergency Action Plan, that staff are trained on and MDWASD coordinates emergency planning with offsite response officials.

North District WWTP is bounded by Sunny Isles Boulevard on the north, the Oleta River on the east, NE 151 Street to the south, and Biscayne Boulevard (US1) to the west. The treatment plant has a rated capacity of 112 million gallons per day (mgd). The facility stores chlorine which is a regulated toxic substance under RMP rule.\n\n\nChlorine is delivered in one-ton containers to the North District WWTP chlorine building.  The chlorine building is divided into a enclosed chlorine storage room and a chlorination room.  The one-ton containers contain liquid chlorine under pressure.  The chlorine building is equipped to store up to 16 (containers) tons of chlorine.  The maximum quantity of chlorine present at the North District WWTP at any given time exceeds the listed threshold quantity in the RMP rule. It also exceeds the listed threshold quantity in Process Safety Management Standard.\n\nThe pressure from the stored chlorine in the cylinder forces liquid chlorine through the tubing and into the manifold system. During normal operation liquid chlorine flows from the cylinder through the chlorine pipeline to the evaporators located in the chlorinator room.  At the evaporators, the liquid chlorine is heated and converted into chlorine gas.  The evaporators are equipped with high and low temperature alarms, to ensure that normal temperature is maintained. Chlorine gas then flows from the evaporators through the temperature-actuated control valve to the chlorinators.  The chlorinators are used to control the feed rate of the chlorine gas.  The chlorinators are equipped with a gas Rotometer and v-notched orifice for controlling the feed rate.  Injection of the chlorine into the process water produces the concentrated chlorine solution that flows through Iron piping to the various injection points in the treatment process.\n\nThe North District WWTP chlori"

An additional PHA was conducted in 2009 and recommendations are in the process of being evaluated and/or implemented.\n\nOperating procedures \nMDWASD North District WWTP has prepared written operating procedures that provide clear instruction and steps for safely conducting activities relating to the chlorination processes.  Written Standard Operating Procedures include: startup, normal operation, normal shutdown, emergency shutdown, start-up after emergency shutdown, receipt of chlorine, and chlorine cylinder change.  All SOPs have been recently reviewed and updated.\n\nTraining\nNorth District WWTP employees presently involved in operating or maintaining the chlorine processes are trained in the chlorine process and the applicable operating and maintenance procedures.  North District WWTP ensures that each employee newly assigned to the chlorine process, is trained and tested to be competent in the process safety management, standard operating procedures, consequences of deviation from the SOPs, and chlorine process safety features.   Each employee involved in operating the chlorine system, has been trained to receive the required knowledge, skills, and abilities to safely carry out their duties and responsibilities, including emergency response, as provided in the operating procedures.\n\nManagement Personnel are trained on Process Safety Management and compliance with Federal and State Regulations pertaining to Risk Management Planning and Process Safety Management.  All on-site facility personnel that are not involved directly with the chlorine system are also"

MDWASD North District WWTP is required to provide information and explanations concerning the hazards and processes and obtain and evaluate information regarding the contractor\u00c2\u00bfs safety program.\n\nPre-Startup Safety Review and Mechanical Integrity Program\nNorth District WWTP has procedures in place to ensure that a pre-startup safety review is conducted prior to starting up a new covered process or after a shutdown event, or prior to starting up modifications to the chlorination processes that require a MOC procedure implementation.\n\nHot Work Permits and Management Change\nThe North District WWTP requires that employees and contractors employ safe work practices when performing hot work in, on, or around the covered process.  The North District WWTP uses a permitting program to ensure that hot work is conducted safely on, or near a process involving chlorine.   \n\nInternal Compliance Audits\nInternal Compliance Audits will be conducted every 3 years to verify compliance with the programs and procedures contained in the RMP.  The MDWASD will assemble an audit team that will include"
