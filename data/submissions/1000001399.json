These programs were developed for Process Safety management (PSM) and include the requirements of the RMP plan.  These include:\n* Process safety information\n* Process hazard analysis\n* Operating procedures\n* Training\n* Mechanical integrity\n* Management of change\n* Pre-startup review\n* Compliance audits \n* Incident investigation\n* Employee participation\n* Hot work permit\n* Contractors\n\nAs part of our prevention efforts, we have implemented the following prevention steps.\n\nEMPLOYEE PARTICIPATION\n\nActive employee participation and involvement are essential to the success of the RMP/PSM program.  The participation minimizes the consequences of releases of toxic, reactive, flammable, or explosive chemicals.  Communication is encouraged between supervision and employees.  To promote safety, at a minimum, monthly departmental safety meetings are held.  In addition, to the meetings, a central safety committee with employee representation from all areas is held.  Five minute huddles are also used to communicate additional safety concerns.  Other forms of safety communication include near miss reporting, abnormal incident reports (AIR), and special training (emergency response, first aid, CPR, etc).  Employees are always encouraged to speak to supervision about questions, suggestions, or comments concerning safety.\n\nPROCESS SAFETY INFORMATION\n\nA variety of process safety information is available concerning process chemicals and their uses.  MSDSs are available through most networked computers and the main guard house computer and are accessible by the internet.  A hard copy is also available in the medical office.  The MSDSs are updated and any new chemical received into the mill must first undergo a new material check approval signed by the environmental, safety, health, process, purchasing, and paper professional for FDA.

SOPs supply additional information on safety when performing a task.\n\nPROCESS HAZARD ANALYSIS (PHA)\n\nProcess hazard analyses (PHA) are performed on the PSM/RMP chemicals used in the mill.  Chlorine dioxide is the only on-site chemicals that the PHA is performed on.  The PHA is performed for the chlorine dioxide system and is instrumental in determining potential safety items which can be corrected and known.  A what if analysis is performed to identify failure modes.  Once a failure condition is known, the consequences of the failure are identified.\n\nThe PHAs are conducted by a team consisting of engineering, safety, environmental, maintenance, operations, and supervision.  The team identifies failures and their consequences.  The results are reviewed for the seriousness of the hazards and the most severe are performed first.\n\nThe reviews are updated at a minimum of every 5 years.  The updates are documented and reviewed for the recommendations and appropriate measures are taken. \n\nOPERATING PROCEDURES\n\nThe Kingsport Mill has standard operating procedures (SOP) which address the general purpose, operating equipment, objectives, safety considerations, normal operating parameters, troubleshooting and reference drawings for the process.\n\nThe purpose of the SOPs is to understand the correct procedures for a job or task.  SOPs are reviewed by operations and supervision for accuracy and understanding.  Special safety considerations are also presented in the SOPs.\n\nTRAINING\n\nAll new employees are required to have general mill safety training.  All safety training is documented and audited for completeness.  Procedural training, on-the-job training, and testing on safety and process ability are also a mandatory part of the training program.  Employees are also encouraged to participate in computerized training programs available at the mill.\n\nPRE-STARTUP SAFETY RE"

The PSSR involves field verification of the accident prevention program.\n\nMECHANICAL INTEGRITY\n\nThe maintenance department has well established procedures for maintaining process equipment.  Training, inspections and a tracking system to detect deficiencies are in place.  Whenever maintenance personnel are required to work on PSM/RMP equipment, an overview of the process and the safety and health hazards are discussed with the personnel along with applicable safe work practices. \n\nAnother part of the integrity program is the quality assurance of the material used in the repairs.  Unique PSM/RMP equipment is set up in a separate area of the storeroom and is used exclusively for the chlorine dioxide system.\n\nSAFE WORK PRACTICES\n\nSafe work practices are encouraged and required at the Kingsport Mill.  Several safe work practice plans are enforced including lockout/tagout, control of entry and exit, hot work permits, fall protection, and confined space programs.  These procedures and training programs help ensure good safe work practices.\n\nMANAGEMENT OF CHANGE\n\nThe Kingsport Mill has a comprehensive system to manage changes to all PSM/RMP processes.  The management of change requires that changes to items such as process equipment, procedures and other changes be reviewed and documented (by participants signature) before initiation of the change.  The modifications are reviewed and documented to verify the new changes do not present a new hazard and that the controls not updated are still safe.  Any additional training needed for operations or maintenance is given and documented.\n\nINCIDENT INFORMATION\n\nThe Kingsport Mill investigates any incident or near miss incident that could have resulted in a fire or explosion, toxic release, property damage, environmental damage, or personal injury.

The outcome of the investigations is forwarded to specific individuals or departments for corrective actions to begin as soon as possible.\n\nCOMPLIANCE AUDITS\n\nCompliance audits are performed at least every 3 years.  The findings are documented and resolutions for the findings are done.  The findings are tracked for completeness until each item has been addressed.  An additional internal chlorine dioxide plant audit is performed by mill personnel from the Kingsport Mill and other Domtar mills.  This additional audit was performed in 2002, 2005, and 2008.  Bi-annual safety audits are done by safety professionals from other Domtar facilities.\n\nThese individual elements of our prevention program work together to prevent accidental chemical releases.  Our company and our employees are committed to the standard that these management systems set for the way we do business, and we have specific accountabilities and controls to ensure that we are meeting our own high standards for accident prevention.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nWe keep records for all significant accidental chemical releases that occur at our facility.  The Kingsport Mill has had no accidents within the last 5 years.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nWe maintain an integrated contingency plan, which consolidates all of the various federal, state, and local regulatory requirements for emergency planning.  Our program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.
