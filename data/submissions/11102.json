      "SummaryText": "Accidental Release Prevention and Response Policies\n\nExxon modified its safety programs in 1992 by implementing structured safety management systems entitled Operations Integrity Management System (OIMS).  In 1997, Lloyd's Register Quality Assurance reviewed OIMS and evaluated it against the international standard for Environmental Management Systems (ISO 14001) to determine if OIMS meets the requirements of ISO 14001.  After an extensive review which included a number of facility audits, they concluded that the environmental components of OIMS are consistent with the intent and meet the requirements of the ISO 14001 Environmental Management Systems Standard.  They went on to say, We further believe Exxon to be among the industry leaders in the extent to which environmental management considerations have been integrated into its ongoing business processes.\n\nThe Exxon Company, U.S.A. St. Regis Rail Loading Facility has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention (e.g., training of personnel, considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the facility, etc.).  Our approach is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances as well as other substances.  If a release does occur, our trained personnel will take steps to control and contain it until local emergency response organizations arrive.  Additional details are included in other sections of this RMPlan.  \n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances \n\nThe Facility, located about 3 1/2 miles east of Flomaton, Alabama, consists of one Program Level 3 process which has one operation, loading Natural Gas Liquids (propane and/or butane) from the nearby St. Regis Gas Plant into rail tank cars.  The Facility could contain up to 910,000 pounds of regulated flammables (e.g., mixtures containing ethane, propane, butane, iso-butane, pentane"

All transportation of regulated flammables into and out of the facility is handled via pipelines and by rail tank cars.  The Facility is in a rural area and surrounded by forest and farmland.\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis Results\n\nWorst Case Scenario (WCS) \nThe WCS, as defined in the regulation, is a release of flammable materials (i.e., mixture of natural gas liquids) resulting in a vapor cloud explosion (VCE) involving the maximum inventory of the largest vessel.  This scenario is extremely remote, but is required by the EPA regulation.  Even though normal loading operating procedures, pressure relief valves, periodic inspections, and routine monitoring by operating personnel protects this equipment, this maximum inventory must be assumed to be released in 10 minutes and ignited at the point of release.  No mitigation measures were taken into account in evaluating this WCS.  The WCS has some off-site impacts, but the impact area includes few public receptors and no environmental receptors.\n\nAlternate Release Scenario (ARS) \nThe ARS is a release of flammable materials (i.e., mixture of natural gas liquids) due to a pressure relief valve failure to reseat resulting in a vapor cloud explosion (VCE).  Even though this event is unlikely (i.e., filling process is protected by shutdowns, monitoring, and periodic inspections by operating personnel), the maximum inventory of flammable materials in a railcar was assumed to be released and ignited at the point of release.  No passive mitigation measures were taken into account in evaluating this ARS.  The ARS has some off-site impacts, but the impact area includes few public receptors and no environmental receptors.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the Facility.\n\nEmployee Participation\nThe Facility provides for and"

Examples of employee participation range from updating/compiling technical information and drawings to participating on process hazard analysis (PHA) or incident investigation teams.  Employees have access to all information related to the accident prevention program.  Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are detailed in an Employee Participation Plan that is maintained at the St. Regis Gas Plant and addresses each program element.  In addition, the Facility has other initiatives that address process and employee safety issues (e.g., hazard reporting/resolution process and numerous safety meetings [daily, monthly, pre-job], etc.).\n\nProcess Safety Information (PSI)\nThe Facility keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the facility.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, safe operating limits for key process parameters, specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  The OIMS Coordinator at the St. Regis Gas Plant is responsible for coordinating the PSI updates.\n\nChemical-specific information (including exposure hazards, emergency response, and exposure treatment considerations) is provided in material safety data sheets.  For specific process areas, the Facility has documented safety-related operating limits for process parameters (e.g., temperature, pressure, level) in the operating procedures.  The Facility ensures processes are maintained within these limits using process controls/monitoring equipment, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems, pressure relief valves).\n\nThe Facility also maintains technical documents at the St. Regis Gas Plant that provide information about the design and construction of the equipment.

This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for inspection/maintenance activities and the evaluation of proposed process or facility changes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\nThe Facility has a comprehensive program to help ensure hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nThe Facility primarily uses the What If/Checklist analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  This technique is recognized by OSHA as an acceptable hazard evaluation technique.  The analyses are conducted using a team of Facility operating/maintenance personnel and facility engineers, and technical consultants (as necessary).  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the processes as well as the accident prevention and mitigation measures.  \n\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to management to coordinate further evaluation and resolution.  This process involves field level business teams, which include engineering, operations personnel, and management.  Operating personnel are also involved in the evaluation of resolution options.  Implementation of the resolutions is based on relative risk.  Potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk are addressed first.  All resolution plans are tracked until completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\nTo help ensure the process controls and/or hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design, the Facility updates and revalidates the process hazard analysis at least every 5 years.  The results of these updates are also documented and retained.  Similarly, the team's findings are forwarded to management to coordinate further evaluation and resolution, and"

Procedures are readily available to operators and other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.  These procedures provide a consistent basis for training new operators and are annually reviewed and certified as current/accurate.  Procedures are maintained current/accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.\n\nTraining\nTo complement the written operating procedures, the Facility has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating process equipment.  New employees receive basic training in Facility operations (e.g., process overview, applicable procedure reviews, etc.).  New operators are then paired with experienced operators (i.e., subject matter experts) to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After the new operators demonstrate that they have adequate knowledge to perform their duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they are certified and allowed to work independently.  In addition, all personnel who operate process equipment receive refresher training at least every 3 years on the applicable procedures to help ensure their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This training and the means used to verify that the employee understood the training is documented for each employee.\n\nContractors\nFacility uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activity.

This is accomplished by providing contractors an orientation prior to their working in the Facility which includes (1) process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) applicable emergency action plan provisions, and (4) information on safe work practices.  Also, a job safety analysis is reviewed/updated or developed by the contractors (with Facility personnel assistance as needed) prior to each maintenance/construction task.\n\nFacility personnel routinely monitor contractor job performance to help ensure they are fulfilling their safety obligations.  Contractor safety programs/performance are evaluated during the initial selection process, and the Facility supervisor conducts periodic evaluations of safety performance.\n\nPre-Startup Safety Reviews (PSSR)\nThe Facility conducts a PSSR for any Facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides one additional check to make sure that construction is in accordance with the design specifications and all supporting systems are operationally ready.  A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality function by verifying that the requirements of this accident prevention program are properly implemented.\n\nMechanical Integrity (MI)\nThe Facility has well-established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief/vent systems, controls, pumps, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition.

In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process.  Maintenance personnel receive training on the (1) process, (2) safety and health hazards, (3) applicable maintenance procedures, (4) emergency procedures, and (5) applicable safe work practices to help ensure they perform their jobs in a safe manner.  Written procedures and equipment manuals help ensure work is performed in a consistent manner and provide a basis for training.  \n\nInspections/tests and preventive maintenance are performed on a scheduled basis to help ensure equipment and safety devices function as intended and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness, etc.).  If a deficiency is identified, employees correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service or a group of experts (e.g., engineers, etc.) review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure safe operation of the equipment until the deficiency can be corrected.\n\nAnother integral part of the MI program is quality assurance.  The Facility incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs to help ensure new equipment is suitable for its intended use and proper materials/spare parts are used for repairs.\n\nHot Work and Other Safe Work Practices\nThe Facility has long-standing safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety.  These include orientations for visitors/contractors, control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, energy isolation for equipment being worked on, procedures for the safe removal of hazardous materials before opening of process piping/equipment, hot work permit/procedure to safely manage spark-producing activities, vehicle entry into process area, confined space entry permi"

These practices, along with related procedures and training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\n\nManagement of Change (MOC)\nThe Facility has a comprehensive system to manage changes.  This system requires that changes to process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented.  Changes are reviewed to ensure adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.  Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, equipment information, drawings, and procedures are updated for these changes.  In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training related to the change.\n\nIncident Investigation\nThe Facility promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in (or could have reasonably resulted in) a fire, explosion, release, major equipment/property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury.  The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations, and forwards these results to management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings are tracked until completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented, and investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected.  Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years so that reports can be reviewed during the next PHA revalidation.\n\nCompliance Audits\nTo hel"

An audit team consisting of both Facility and technical personnel evaluate the implementation/effectiveness of the processes in this accident prevention program and develop findings that are documented and forwarded to management to coordinate resolution.  Corrective actions are taken in response to the audit team's findings, and resolution status is tracked until actions are completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and the two most recent audit reports are retained.\n\nChemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe processes at the Facility have hazards that are managed to help ensure continued safe operation.  The following is a description of existing safety features applicable to the prevention of accidental releases of the specific regulated substances (i.e., flammables) in the Facility.\n\nUniversal Prevention Activities\nThe accident prevention program summarized previously is applied to the RMP-covered process at the Facility.  These prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human errors.\n\nSpecialized Features\nThe Facility has safety features on many units to (1) quickly detect a release, (2) contain/control a release, and (3) reduce/mitigate the consequences of a release.  The following types of safety features are used:\n\n\tRelease Detection .... \n*\tOperator onsite during loading operations\n\n\tRelease Containment/Control .... \n*\tloading line pressure relief valves that discharge into a flare system for incineration\n*\tmanual/automatic isolation valves\n*\tautomated pressure shutdown systems on the transfer line\n\n\tRelease Mitigation ....\n*\tfire extinguishers\n*\tpersonal protective equipment (e.g., self-contained breathing apparatus)\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nThe F"

In fact, there have not been any incidents with offsite impacts, as defined in the regulation.\n\nEmergency Response Program Information\n\nThe Facility maintains an emergency action program to protect the workers, public, and environment.  The program consists of procedures for handling releases of regulated substances (i.e., flammables) including the possibility of fires or explosions.  The procedures address facility/equipment isolation and shutdown, initial first aid and medical treatment for exposures (i.e., Material Safety Data Sheets information), evacuation plans for the facility, accounting for plant personnel after an evacuation, and notification of local emergency response agencies.  In addition, this Facility has procedures that address the maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency equipment and alarms.  Facility personnel receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific duties.\n\nThis emergency action program is reviewed annually and updated when necessary.  Changes required because of modifications to the facilities or emergency equipment are administered through the Management of Change process, which includes informing and/or training affected personnel.\n\nThe overall emergency response program for this plant is coordinated with the Escambia County Emergency Management Association (LEPC), Flomaton Fire Department, and Escambia County Sheriff's Department, and the local ambulance services.  The Facility has around-the-clock communications capability with these emergency response organizations.  These organizations are responsible (if necessary) for notifying the public, coordinating the community response (e.g., blocking off roads, evacuation, etc.), and providing the onsite response (e.g., fire fighting, medical treatment, etc.).  The Facility conducts periodic emergency action drills and provides periodic refreshers to the local emergency"
