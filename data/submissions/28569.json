      "SummaryText": "Facility Accidental Release and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe owners, management, and employees of Helena Chemical Company (Helena), Buckeye Arizona who operate an anhydrous ammonia storage facility are committed to the prevention and minimization of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia. It is the policy of Helena to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local regulations. If an accidental release should occur, Helena is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.  A detailed emergency response plan has been developed and will be implemented in the event of an accidental release.  To meet their commitment to prevention of an accidental release, Helena implemented a Risk Management Plan (RMP) and Program Level 2 Prevention Program in accordance with 40 CFR Part 68.\n\nFacility Information\n\nThe primary activity at Helena Buckeye is the storage and sale of fertilizers, in addition to the sale of pre-packaged agricultural chemicals to farmers.  Helena also operates an anhydrous ammonia storage and distribution facility, approximately 15 miles south of the main Buckeye facility, at 30826 South Old Highway 80, Buckeye, Maricopa County, Arizona 85326 (herein referred to as the Facility). The Facility is operated on leased property that was selected because of its distance from populated areas and its proximity to Helena?s anhydrous ammonia customers, thereby reducing nurse tank transport distances.  The RMP regulated substance is anhydrous ammonia that will be received, stored, and distributed for direct application for crop production nutrients.  \n\nThe anhydrous ammonia will be received by truck and stored in one 10,000-gallon storage tank (bullet) at the Facility.  Up to ten portable, 1,000-gallon nurse tanks will also be available at the Facility for distribution to customers. The maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia handled in this pro"

      "SummaryText": "cess will be 87,380 pounds (lbs).\n\n\nThe Worst-Case Release Scenario and Alternative Release Scenario\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia Worst-Case Release  \nThe worst-case release scenario is failure of the 10,000-gallon storage tank when filled to 85% capacity as limited by regulation.  The worst-case scenario involves the release of 43,690 lbs of anhydrous ammonia over a ten-minute period.  The liquid is assumed to vaporize soon after contact with ambient air.  The toxic endpoint for anhydrous ammonia is 200 ppm.  Air dispersion modeling estimates the distance to the toxic endpoint concentration at 1.65 miles.  Evaluation of the 2000 census data using Landview indicates the population within the 1.65-mile radius is 9 people.  No environmental receptors are identified with the 1.65-mile radius.\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia Alternative Release Scenario\nThe alternative release scenario or the most likely potential incident based on the hazard review is a release from a broken 2-inch diameter pipeline or hose.  The release would last for 2 minutes when it is stopped by manual intervention or activation of the excess flow valve.  The alternative release scenario involves 11,908 lbs of anhydrous ammonia with a distance to toxic endpoint of 1.18 miles.  Population within the 1.18-mile radius is 6 people.  No environmental receptors are located within the 1.18 miles radius. \n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe Facility will implement the provisions of the ?Safety Requirements for Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc. and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, ?Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia.?   \n\nHelena developed a Program Level 2 Prevention Program with the seven required elements: safety information, hazard review, operating procedures, training, maintenance, compliance audits, and incident investigation.

A Process Hazard Analysis was conducted on April 21, 2003 that considered operations and human actions that could result in an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia.  Helena provides operating procedures for handling anhydrous ammonia at its facilities.  Helena must ensure that each employee responsible for the storage and transfer of anhydrous ammonia at the Facility is properly trained in the operating procedures for handling anhydrous ammonia.  A maintenance program is developed to preserve the integrity of the process equipment to minimize the potential for accidental release of anhydrous ammonia.  Helena developed a compliance audit program with a compliance audit checklist to verify that programs, procedures, and practices are adequate and being implemented.  An incident investigation program with procedures and reports provides a means for Helena to examine an accidental release or a near miss that could have resulted in an accidental release.\n\nFive-year Accident History\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia from the Buckeye Arizona Facility in the past five years.\n\nThe Emergency Response Program\n\nHelena prepared an emergency response plan to minimize the hazards presented by an accidental release to the Facility employees and the public.  The plan coordinates the actions of Facility employees with local emergency responders.  The Buckeye Valley Rural Fire Department is the emergency first responder.  Facility staff would activate emergency shutoff or accessible manual shutoff, notify the appropriate response agencies and evacuate if needed.  The facility?s emergency response program is being developed in accordance with the following regulations:\n\n?    OSHA 29 CFR 1910.38; and\n?    OSHA 29 CFR 1910.120.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nBased on Helena?s policy, safety meetings for employees are conducted"
