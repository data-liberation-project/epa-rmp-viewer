      "SummaryText": "Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:\n\nAmercord, Inc. (Amercord) operates a metal wire drawing and plating facility.  Amercord operates three regulated processes. Propane is stored and used as a backup fuel for natural gas fired equipment and in forklift operation. A 37% hydrochloric acid solution is used to remove rust from the wire following heat treat. Chlorine is stored in one ton containers and used for wastewater treatment.  It is Amercord's policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and State rules and regulations to reduce the threat of exposure to our employees as well as members of the surrounding community.  \n\nThe Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled:\n\nThis facility is a wire drawing and plating facility.  Metal wire is drawn, heat treated, acid washed, rinsed and plated.  Propane is used during natural gas curtailment to fire multiple heating equipment and to operate forklifts.  Hydrochloric acid (37% solution) is diluted and used to remove rust from the wire after it has been heat treated.  Chlorine is used to treat process wastewater.\n\nThe regulated substances stored and used at this facility are propane, hydrochloric acid (37% solution, and chlorine.  The maximum amount of propane that is stored at this facility is 330,264 pounds, the maximum amount of hydrochloric acid that is stored is 195,156 pounds, and the maximum amount of chlorine that is stored is 56,000 pounds.  \n\nThe Worst-Case Flammable Release Scenario and the Alternative Flammable Release Scenario:\n\nWorst-Case Scenario - Failure of a storage tank when filled to the greatest allowable amount of propane would result in the release of 110,088 pounds of propane. According to NFPA code, the maximum filling capacity of this tank is 88%.  The distance to the endpoint of 1 psi is 0.40 miles.  The estimated population within the impacted area is 13 people. No environmental receptors were identified within the impacted area.\n\nAlternative Scenario - Failure of "

      "SummaryText": "a 25 foot length of 4 inch transfer hose during tank filling.  The excess flow valves function to stop the flow.  The contents, 68 pounds, of the hose are released. The distance to the endpoint of 1 psi is 0.03 miles.  This release scenario has the possibility of extending beyond the site boundary. According to 1990 Census data, no people were estimated to reside in the impacted area.  No environmental receptors were identified within the impacted area.\n\nThe Worst-Case Toxic Release Scenario and the Alternative Toxic Release Scenarios:\n\nWorst-Case Scenario - Rupture and release of the entire contents of a one ton storage container filled with chlorine.  The release results in a release rate of 200 pounds of chlorine per minute.  The resulting vapor plume disperses off site.  The distance to the toxic endpoint was estimated to be three miles. According to 1990 Census data, 704 people were estimated to reside in the impacted area.  One school and several major buildings were identified in the impacted area.  \n\nAlternative Chlorine Scenario - Breakdown of one fusible plug on the end of a one ton container of chlorine.  The analysis assumes that the plug is repaired within ten minutes of the release.  Approximately 169 pounds of chlorine would be released.  The distance to the toxic endpoint was estimated to be 0.2 miles. According to 1990 Census data, three people were estimated to reside in the impacted area.  No environmental receptors were identified. \n\nAlternative Hydrochloric Acid Scenario - Rupture of hose during tank filling.  The amount of acid released was estimated to be 292 pounds. The distance to the toxic endpoint was estimated to be 0.1 miles.  According to 1990 Census data, no people were estimated to reside in the impacted area.  No environmental receptors were identified. \n\nThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Specific Prevention Steps:\n\nAmercord complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule. \n\nFive-Year Accident History:\n"
