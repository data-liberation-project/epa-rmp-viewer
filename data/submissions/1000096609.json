(Formerly II-VI) facilities in Saxonburg, PA produce optical and opto-electronic components, devices and materials for infrared laser applications.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies (A\u00a7 68.155(a))\n\nCoherent achieves accidental release prevention by operating its processes in conformance with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (\"EPA\") Risk Management Program (\"RMP\") regulations and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (\"OSHA\")Process Safety Management (\"PSM\") regulations.  Coherent handles any required emergency response by means of its Integrated Contingency Plan and its in-house Emergency Response Team.\n\nThe Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled (A\u00a7 68.155(b))\n\nThe Coherent stationary source includes a materials production plant that handles a substance that is regulated by the RMP rule.  This substance is hydrogen selenide.\n \nThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps (A\u00a7 68.155(c))\n\nThe Coherent general accidental release prevention program consists of the following elements that conform to both EPA RMP and OSHA PSM regulations:\n\n* Process Safety Information\n* Process Hazard Analysis\n* Operating Procedures\n* Training\n* Mechanical Integrity\n* Management of Change\n* Pre-Startup Review\n* Compliance Audits\n* Incident Investigation\n* Employee Participation\n* Procedures\n* Contractor Safety\n\nThe prevention program is documented and maintained at the facility.  It is updated when necessary.  Coherent's chemical-specific prevention steps include hydrogen selenide sensors and  hydrogen selenide scrubbers.\n\nFive-year Accident History (A\u00a7 68.155(d))\n\nThere were (2) RMP accidents at this facility in the past 5 years:\n\nOn 09/26/2016 an incident occurred involving less than one (1) pound of hydrogen selenide that was released inside the building.

The emergency response team was activated and responded to the incident, secured the perimeter of the area, initiated actions to identify the potential release source, isolated and repaired the source, and gave the all clear signal shortly afterwards. Two employees were evaluated for potential hydrogen selenide symptoms by the emergency response team and then sent to an off-site medical facility where they received medical treatment and were sent home.\n\nOn 2/24/2021 an incident occurred involving less than one (1) pound of hydrogen selenide that was released inside a process area.  Toxic gas monitors in the area indicated the presence of hazardous gas, alerted employees to leave the area and initiated automatic activation of ventilation and emergency scrubbing of the process area.  Emergency ventilation quickly evacuated reduced gas concentrations to safe levels and captured all released gas in the emergency scrubber.  The process was evaluated and corrected before re-starting.  One employee was evaluated at an off-site medical facility and received treatment for potential hydrogen selenide exposure symptoms.  They were observed for 2-3 hours and sent home.\n\nEmergency Response Program (A\u00a7 68.155(e))\n\nThe Coherent Corp. Saxonburg facility has established a written Integrated Contingency Plan and maintains a well-trained and equipped emergency response team.  An emergency response containment vessel and an on-site community emergency warning system are integral parts of the emergency response program.   \n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety (A\u00a7 68.155(f))\n\nThe Coherent Corp. Saxonburg facility has a policy of continuous improvement.  In support of that policy, we constantly improve the safety of the processes by means of reviews of our plant processes and procedures, an incident investigation program, a security improvement program and an employee Environmental, Health and Safety Committee."
