The worst case scenario is far less probable than natural catastrophes that could \r\nproduce much more severe and extensive damage and injury. A consideration of the release scenarios \r\nhas been incorporated into Energy Transfer's notification and emergency response planning. Energy \r\nTransfer also considered the impact of a more likely loss of containment.\r\n\r\nEnergy Transfer has not had any covered process accidents in the past five years. Energy Transfer\r\nhas implemented safety precautions and procedures designed to prevent and mitigate catastrophic \r\nreleases. Energy Transfer has active operating, maintenance, training and inspection procedures.\r\nEnergy Transfer provides annual emergency response training to its employees. Energy Transfer's \r\nmanagement is committed to the following:\r\n- Preventing accidents;\r\n- Continuing to proactively seek out improvements to process safety;\r\n- Training employees in correct response procedures in the event of an accident;\r\n- Participating in community emergency preparedness;\r\n- Addressing any citizen concerns by fully explaining potential hazards associated with operations\r\nand all steps being taken to prevent and mitigate accidents; and\r\n- Being a good corporate citizen in Beaver County.\r\n\r\nWith these objectives in mind, the Risk Management Plan has been developed to provide\r\ninformation about our management of the risks associated with this Station.

This facility receives and processes liquid petroleum gases (LPGs) and delivers them to the\r\ngathering pipeline.\r\n\r\nTwo requirements of this section specifically apply to operations at the Pike Compressor Station:\r\n\r\n1. Purpose and General Duty Clause - The essence of the general duty clause is that an\r\nowner/operator that stores and uses hazardous chemicals in any quantity has a fundamental\r\nobligation to ensure a safe operation and to have plans in place in the event of an accident to\r\nappropriately manage the situation. Energy Transfer is committed to ensuring the safe operation of\r\nthe Pike Compressor Station, as well as all of its other operations, to ensure a safe workplace for our\r\nemployees and a safe location for our neighbors in the community. Energy Transfer, therefore, has\r\nprocedures in place to prevent accidents and is committed to emergency preparedness both for our\r\nfacility and community-wide by coordinating with the local Fire Department and the Beaver County\r\nEmergency Services.\r\n\r\n2. Risk Management Plan - The primary function of the Pike Compressor Station is to function as a\r\ncompression station for LPGs. Due to the flammable effects associated with LPGs, it is necessary\r\nto observe certain safety precautions to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat\r\nto employee health, and to minimize the threat and impact to nearby members of the community.\r\n\r\nEnergy Transfer's Pike Compressor Station is strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental\r\nsafety and health. Safety at the facility depends on the manner in which LPG is handled as well as\r\nthe various safety devices incorporated into the design of the process. Furthermore, comprehensive\r\ntraining is provided to employees and contractors which reinforces the safety policies and\r\nprocedures of the facility. Programs have been established to help prevent any"
