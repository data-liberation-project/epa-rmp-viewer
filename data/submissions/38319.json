      "SummaryText": "Montana Refining Company\nRisk Management Plan\nExecutive Summary\n\n1. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nMontana Refining Company (MRC) recognizes that, because of the complexity of its operation and the hazardous substances handled, there are potential hazards to employees and the public.  It is for this reason MRC is committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the development and implementation of a comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at the facility.  It is the policy of MRC to implement appropriate controls to prevent releases of hazardous substances so that the health and safety of employees and the surrounding community is maintained.\n\nMontana Refining has employees at the refinery that are trained in emergency response to effectively respond to incidents involving hazardous substances.  Montana Refining invites local health care providers, including hospitals and ambulance services, to attend awareness seminars on some of the hazardous chemicals present at the facility, and has provided the local hospital with information on hazardous chemicals to aid in the treatment of exposures to these chemicals.  \n\nThe Company is represented on the Cascade County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC), which was provided periodic updates on the Montana Refining Company Risk Management Program development.  Montana Refining is supporting the LEPC in upgrading the current community emergency alerting system so that the public can be notified of an emergency situation, including an accidental release, in a more timely and effective manner.\n\n2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nMontana Refining Company operates a 7,000-barrel per day refinery in Great Falls, Montana that contains various processes used to refine crude oil int"

There are 12 substances regulated under the Risk Management Program rule present in covered processes at the facility, as follows: isobutane, butane, propane, hydrofluoric acid, isopentane, propylene, pentane, 2-Butene-trans, 1-Butene, 2-Butene-cis, 2,2-Dimethylpropane and ethane.  These substances may occur in the pure form as well as in mixtures.  With the exception of hydrofluoric acid, which is a toxic gas, all substances are flammable.  These substances have the potential to present a hazard to employees and the public should an accidental release occur.\n\n3. Determination of the Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s).\n\nMontana Refining Company is required to conduct an off-site consequence analysis (OCA) in order to determine a worst case release scenario for both regulated toxic substances as a class and regulated flammable substances as a class that results in the greatest distance to a specified endpoint, which represents the distance from a release that the public or environment could be subject to serious impacts.  The worst-case release scenarios and respective release quantities are specified by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in the Risk Management Program rule, and represent incidents that are considered unlikely.  In the OCA, MRC must also determine an alternative release scenario for both classes of substances mentioned above.  The alternative scenarios and respective release quantities were chosen by MRC to reflect more likely release scenarios for use in community emergency planning.  In all scenarios, EPA Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance Reference Tables or Equations were used to perform the required offsite consequence analyses.\n\n4. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nMontana Refining Company has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release p"

The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at the facility.  These elements are identical to those set out in the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard, with which Montana Refining has been in compliance since 1992.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nMontana Refining Company maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.  Process safety information is readily available to all employees overseeing or maintaining processes, and is updated based upon the results of hazard analyses, as well as employee participation.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nMontana Refining Company periodically conducts a comprehensive Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) on each process covered under the RMP rule to ensure that hazards associated with the processes are identified and controlled appropriately and effectively.  The methodology used to conduct each PHA is the Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) analysis, supplemented by Checklists.  Both methodologies are approved and effective means of identifying hazards within processes.  The analyses of each covered process are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at five-year intervals.  All findings and recommendations related to the hazard analysis are evaluated and resolved in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nFor the purposes of safely operating all refinery processes, Montana Refining Company maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.
