There are 12 substances regulated under the Risk Management Program rule present in covered processes at the facility, as follows: isobutane, butane, propane, hydrofluoric acid, isopentane, propylene, pentane, 2-Butene-trans, 1-Butene, 2-Butene-cis, 2,2-Dimethylpropane and ethane.  These substances may occur in the pure form as well as in mixtures.  With the exception of hydrofluoric acid, which is a toxic gas, all substances are flammable.  These substances have the potential to present a hazard to employees and the public should an accidental release occur.\n\n3. Determination of the Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s).\n\nMontana Refining Company is required to conduct an off-site consequence analysis (OCA) in order to determine a worst case release scenario for both regulated toxic substances as a class and regulated flammable substances as a class that results in the greatest distance to a specified endpoint, which represents the distance from a release that the public or environment could be subject to serious impacts.  The worst-case release scenarios and respective release quantities are specified by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in the Risk Management Program rule, and represent incidents that are considered unlikely.  In the OCA, MRC must also determine an alternative release scenario for both classes of substances mentioned above.  The alternative scenarios and respective release quantities were chosen by MRC to reflect more likely release scenarios for use in community emergency planning.  In all scenarios, EPA Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance Reference Tables or Equations were used to perform the required offsite consequence analyses.\n\n4.
