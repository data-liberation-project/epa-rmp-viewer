      "SummaryText": "Shawnee Milling Company operates rural feed stores offering anhydrous ammonia to local farmers.  ONsite storage and dispensing of this toxic chemcial varies in quantities based on seasonal application demand.  For approximately 3-4 months of the year, maximum quantities of anhydrous ammonia is reduce to less than 20% (14,000 pounds) of the maximum 70,260 pounds held in storage.\n\nThe company ensures that tanks and components are regularly maintained by qualified contractors.  The facility is regularly inspected by both employees, its insurance carrier, and the State of Oklahoma Department of Agriculture.\n\nThis facility would ahve a maximum of 70,260 pounds of anhydrous ammonia onsite at its peak sales periods.  Administrative operating procedures limit the storage tank to 85% of its capacity.\n\nThe worst case scenario is structural damage to the bulk storage tank containing, at peak operating periods, up to 70,260 pounds of NH3.  Failure would result in a near-full release of ammonia within 10 minutes in a  rural environment.  The toxic endpoint has been calcualted to be 4.7 miles from the tank at which point it would be dispersed enough to no longer pose a hazard to the public.  Public receptors includes residences, schools, and recreation areas.  There are no environmental receptors within the distance to endpoint.\n\nThe more probable alternative accidental release would involve overfilling a tank with a maximum potential release of up to 100 pounds.  Quantities in the 3-10 pounds are more likely.  In this alternative worst case scenario, the toxic endpoint would be limited to under 0.2 miles which would expose less than 100 people and no other commerical or public receptors.\n\nThis facility has not had a reportable accidental release in the last five years.  Employees are trained in the safe handling and storage of anhydrous ammonia by the State of Oklahoma, Department of Agriculture.\n\nThis facility follows the emergency response plan established by the Grady County "
