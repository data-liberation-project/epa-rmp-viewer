The health and safety program includes chemical hazards.  This program is a top priority for Prairie State.  Success depends on the alertness and personal commitment of all.\r\n\r\nPrairie State provides information to employees about workplace safety and health issues through regular internal communication channels such as supervisor-employee meetings, bulletin board postings, memos or other written communications. It is the responsibility of all employees to develop proper safety work attitudes and adhere to all safety rules, be aware of potential worksite hazards, and to be informed and trained about safety issues.\r\n\r\nEmployees and supervisors receive periodic workplace safety training. The training covers potential safety and health hazards, safe work place practices and procedures to eliminate or minimize hazards. These are provided to increase awareness and allow employees to function within a safe working environment.  Employees shall not perform work where known chemical hazards exist unless they have received safety training for those job functions.  All employees receive emergency response awareness training for the anhydrous ammonia system. \r\n\r\nA safety committee composed of hourly employees, supervisors, managers and other representatives from throughout the organization will be established to help monitor the Company's safety program, to address accident preventability, and to facilitate effective communications between employees and management about workplace safety and health issues.\r\n\r\nRegulated Substances Handled\r\n\r\nPrairie State Generating Station maintains one substance, anhydrous ammonia, on site in amounts exceeding the Risk Management Program (RMP) threshold"

Anhydrous ammonia is to be used in the selective catalytic reduction air pollution control devices installed on Prairie State's two utility boilers.  \r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention\r\n  \r\nPrairie State has operation, maintenance and inspection procedures for the anhydrous ammonia system that are designed to prevent accidental releases.  Personnel will receive training before being allowed to work on the systems.\r\n\r\nThe ammonia systems will be visually inspected on a daily basis.  Standard operating procedures for startup, shutdown, normal operation and emergency operation of the ammonia storage systems will be in place when operation begins. The procedures will be written and posted in appropriate areas.  Personnel will be trained annually on safety concerns and general operation procedures as well as emergency procedures. \r\n\r\nAmmonia sensors and alarms are in place to detect an anhydrous ammonia release.  A water deluge control system serves as the primary means of mitigating an airborne anhydrous ammonia release around the storage tanks. \r\n\r\nPrairie State performed process hazard assessments using a 'What If' type analysis for the anhydrous ammonia system.  This analysis utilizes a brainstorming approach, in which a team of people familiar with the process asks questions about possible undesirable events.  The What If analysis results in a listing of undesirable events with their consequences, safeguards, and recommendations for risk reduction.  Comments and recommendations are summarized in the Process Hazard Assessment section of the Risk Management Program.\r\n\r\nFive-Year Accident History\r\n\r\nThe facility has had no ammonia releases in the past five years. \r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program\r\n\r\nPrairie State's emergency response program for anhydrous ammonia involves trained hazmat employees on-site and public responders dispatched by 911 and Prairie State.
