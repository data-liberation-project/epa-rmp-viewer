This commitment is demonstrated by the\n\nresources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the\n\ndesign, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes. Our policy is to implement\n\nreasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release\n\ndoes occur, facility trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release. Other safety\n\nmeasures such as fire suppression, ambulatory, or evacuation of the community is coordinated and\n\nhandled through local emergency response personnel in the community.\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe Houston Railyard receive propane, iso-butane, n-butane and natural gasoline from the Houston Gas Plant and loads the product directly into railcars for transporation. Several support vessels exist to aid in handling and loading of these NGLs.  A ethyl mercaptan tank is also located at the site to odorize propane cars when requested by customers. \n\n\n\nRegulated substances that are currently stored or will be stored through the time of predictive filing\n\nin this RMP include propane, ethyl mercaptan and flammable mixtures.  Iso- and n-butane are transported through pipeline and directly into railcars but are not stored as a purity product at the Railyard.\n\n\n\nFor additional detail of the various processes at the Houston Railyard see the plant operations\n\nmanager.\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION\n\n\n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention in place for the process at the facility.\n\nBecause the process at the facility that are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's\n\n(EPA's) risk management program (RMP) regulation are also subject to the Occupational Safety and\n\nHealth Administration's (OSHA's)"

HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of\n\nthe most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques and will be utilized for each major\n\nprocess change or renovation.

The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts, determine what\n\nerror states led to the incident and to develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the\n\nincident or a similar incident. The investigation team consists of the immediate supervisor, one\n\nperson knowledgeable in the process, and other members with appropriate experience to investigate\n\nand analyze the incident. The team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a\n\nrecurrence, and forwards these results to facility management for resolution. Corrective actions that\n\nare identified will be promptly addressed, resolved and tracked until they are complete. The final\n\nresolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are\n\nreviewed with all employees (including contractors) whose job tasks are relevant to the investigation.\n\nIncident investigat"

Examples of employee participation range\n\nfrom updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a\n\nmember of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team.

The permit indicates the days on which hot work may be performed and the\n\nobject upon which hot work is to be performed.

In addition, the Houston Gas Plant will only select contractors who submit\n\ncertification that employees are trained in specifics and safe work practices associated with their job,\n\nand that provide safety performance documentation from the previous three years. Finally, facility\n\npersonnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their\n\nsafety obligations.\n\n\n\nCHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nThe processes at the Houston Railyard have hazards that must be managed to ensure continued\n\nsafe operation. The following is a description of existing safety features applicable to prevention of\n\naccidental releases of regulated substances in the facility.\n\n\n\nUniversal Prevention Activities\n\n\n\nThe accident prevention program summarized previously is applied to all RMP-covered processes at\n\nthe Houston Railyard. Collectively, these prevention program activities prevent or mitigate\n\n\n\npotential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human errors.\n\nSpecialized Safety Features\n\n\n\nThe Houston Railyard has safety features on many units to help (1) contain/control a release, (2)\n\nquickly detect a release, and (3) reduce the consequences of (mitigate) a release. The following\n\ntypes of safety features are used in the covered process:\n\n\n\nRelease Detection\n\n\n\n1. Hand-held hydrocarbon detectors operated by facility personnel.\n\n2. Personnel are on site 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.\n\n\n\nRelease Containment/Control\n\n\n\n1. Process relief valves that discharge to a flare to capture and incinerate episodic releases.\n\n2. Valves to permit isolation of the process (manual and automated).\n\n3. Automated shutdown systems for specific process parameters (e.g., high temperature)\n\n4. Curbing or dyking to contain liquid releases.\n\n5. Redundant e"

The facility maintains\n\na written emergency action plan, which is in pace to help protect employees and public safety as\n\nwell as the environment. The plan identifies steps to be taken in case of an accidental release\n\nincluding: evacuation plans, accounting for personnel after an evacuation, and notification of\n\ncompany staff, local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs. However,\n\nfacility personnel are not trained to be first responders to large fires and should a release occur from\n\none of the vessels the Houston Plant would rely on the local fire department to respond.\n\nEmployee receive training in the procedures to be followed when certain employees must remain to\n\noperate critical process operations before they evacuate.

This interface provides the means of notifying the public of\n\nan incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.\n\nThe overall emergency response program for the Houston Railyard is coordinated with the\n\nWashington County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC). This coordination includes\n\nperiodic meetings of the committee, which includes local emergency response officials, local\n\ngovernment officials, and industry representatives.
