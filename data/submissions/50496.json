UAP Distribution, Inc. is the owner of this facility, having purchased it from Quality Feed and Fertilizer, Inc..\n\nFor further information contact: Dale Buxman, ERS Area Manager, 5701 Eureka Bend, McKinney, TX 75070 (972) 489-3154, or; \nRod Mayerske, Operations Manager, UAP Distribution, Inc., 644 22nd Avenue, Galva, KS. 67443 (620) 345-2440\n\nRisk Management Plan - EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n1.  The Facility Policy\n\nThe owners, management, and employees of UAP Distribution, Inc. are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire company, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2.  Facility Information - UAP Distribution, Inc., 644 22nd Avenue, Galva, KS 67443.  The storage tank and anhydrous ammonia nurse trailers are located near the center of this facility, between the dry and liquid fertilizer plants..\n\n The primary activity at the facility is the storage of fertilizers for sale to farmers.\n\n Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application.\n\n The maximum quantity stored would be 255,000 pounds, composed of 79,000 pounds in our 18,000 gallon storage tank, plus a total  potential of 176,000 pounds in up to 25 nurse trailers.\n  \nOperating procedures for an emergency situation, unloading at a storage facility, and loading of ammonia nurse trailers have been updated as of 10/25/2007.\n\n3.  The worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario.\n\nA.  The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of the contents of the 18,000 gallon storage tank,  released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 79,000 pounds, which repres"

The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 0.83 miles.\n\n4.  The accidental release prevention program.\n\nThe facility has implemented most of the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc., and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29  CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia\".  The governing regulations are put forth by the Kansas Department of Agriculture and the facility is inspected on a regular basis by company personnel, inspectors from the Kansas Department of Agriculture, and representatives of the Company's insurance carrier.  Important differences between ANSI standards and KDA regulations involve color coding of valves, installation of a bulkhead at the truck unloading point, and remote shut-offs for the storage tank(s).  \n\n5.  The Five-year Accident History \n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that: have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor  to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n   \n6.
