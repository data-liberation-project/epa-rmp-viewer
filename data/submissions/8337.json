      "SummaryText": "Vinyls facility located in Louisville, Kentucky has one regulated flammable substance identified for the Accidental Release Prevention Program (40 CFR Part 68.130) above the Threshold Quantity (TQ) of 10,000 pounds: Vinyl Chloride Monomer VCM (CAS No. 75-01-4).  No toxic chemicals listed in the Accidental Release Prevention Program exceed the TQ.\n\nRELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nThe worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario, including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario, are outlined herein:\n\n\tWORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\n\tCatastrophic failure of the South vinyl chloride storage tank (south sphere) would release 1,800,000 pounds of VCM.  It is assumed that the entire contents of the south sphere is released as a vapor which finds an ignition source.  Ten percent of the release quantity is assumed to participate in the resulting explosion. The distance to the endpoint of 1 psi for worst case scenario is 0.73 miles.\n\n\tEquation C-1 on page 92 of Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance (OCAG) Document was used for estimation of the distance to the endpoint of 1 psi.  \n\n\tALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\n\tA failure of the 2 inch hose connecting the rail car to the unloading apparatus.  This release could be detected and isolated by active and passive safety systems in ten minutes or less and would result in a maximum release of 25,000 pounds of vinyl chloride over that ten minute period. For this scenario, the distance to a 1-psi overpressure would then be 0.06 miles for a vapor cloud explosion, per EPA's Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance Document.\n\nPREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nOxyVinyls has in place a prevention program encompassing elements consistent with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management Standard (PSM) for Highly Hazardous Chemicals (29 CFR 1910.119).  VCM is regulated under the USEPA Clean Air Act Section 112(r)(7) Accidental Release Prevention Requirement"
