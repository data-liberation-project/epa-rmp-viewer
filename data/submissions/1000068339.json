The intent of the program is to prevent the occurrence of, or minimize the consequences of, accidental releases by stating policies and procedures for the management of process hazards in start-up, operation, inspection, maintenance, and the other areas addressed in the federal standard.\n\nThis Executive Summary includes information required under 40 CFR 68.155.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nBOR implements a scheduled preventive maintenance program, including inspection and testing, to minimize the potential for accidental releases. Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) are maintained to enable the employees to perform their work safely and efficiently and provide immediate corrective response to any accidents.\n\nThe YDP staff are trained and conduct drills and exercises to quickly implement shelter-in-place response activities in the event of a chemical release incident. Emergency response to an accidental release is also coordinated with Rural Metro Fire Department, law enforcement, and emergency management.\n\n\n\nStationary Sources and Regulated Substances\n\nThe YDP utilizes chlorine (the regulated substance) as a disinfectant, necessary to promote the destruction of algae, bacteria, micro-organisms, and other aquatic life.\n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nA Process Hazard Analysis as well as written process safety information has been developed to enable personnel to identify and understand the hazards posed by processes involving extremely hazardous substances. Process safety information includes chlorine information, technology of the process information, and equipment information.\n\nThe BOR verifies that the treatment plant (YDP) compli"

In addition, a Management of Change program has been established to ensure proper review of a proposed change to the chlorine system.\n\nA pre-startup safety review is performed on new or modified processes to ensure that equipment and construction meet design specifications, procedures and training have been implemented, and hazard analysis recommendations have been resolved.\n\nA Compliance Audit Program has also been implemented. The objective of this self-evaluation program is to ensure that a strong RMP program is maintained, implemented, and followed by appropriate personnel.\n\nStaff have developed a formal documented system to manage incident investigations and follow up. Each incident from a covered process that resulted in deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering-in-place, property damage, or environmental damage will be investigated and an incident investigation report filed in the RMP/PSMP files.\n\nManagement staf"

Provide employee access to the RMP/PSMP\n\n? Involve employees in the development and updating of training\n\n? Involve employees in an incident investigation\n\nAn authorization and permit program for hot work operations near or around the regulated chlorine process has been implemented at the YDP.\n\nContractors performing maintenance or repair on or adjacent to the chlorine process are instructed in the hazards of the materials onsite, and documentation is maintained on contractor understanding of training provided as described in the RMP/PSMP. In addition, emphasis is placed on knowing how to respond in the event of an emergency.\n\nThe YDP chlorine system technologies are not confidential and any information regarding the process or process chemistry is available for review in the RMP/PSMP.\n\n\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nIn the last 5 years, the YDP has had no accidental releases that resulted in deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering-in-place, property damage, or environmental damage\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nThe following 3 plans provide a comprehensive emergency response program for the YDP and include 1) RMP/PSMP; 2) the Global Management Services, Operations and Maintenance Personnel, Emergency Response Team (ERT), Standard Operating Procedure; and the Continuity of Operations Plan for the YDP. These plans include the following elements:\n\n? Procedures for informing the public and local emergency response agencies about accidental releases\n\n?
