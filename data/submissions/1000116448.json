However, an ACS is a more realistic scenario that is more likely to occur.  The ACSs will help the LEPC to improve the community emergency response plan.  If interested, please contact our RMP coordinator Thomas Rios (832) 572-0418.\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at the Bayport Facility. The processes at the Bayport Facility are not only regulated by the EPA RMP regulation but also by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) process safety management (PSM) standard. This summary addresses the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system to implement the accident prevention program.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nBaker Petrolite keeps various technical documents used to help maintain the safe operation of processes.  Chemical-specific information is provided in safety data sheets (SDS). The SDSs are maintained and located online and can be accessed through the Baker Hughes Intranet. Block diagrams on PSM-covered processes are included in the Bayport PSM Manual and the maximum intended inventories of PSM-covered chemicals. Additionally, safely designed upper and lower limits of pressure, flow, composition, and temperature for PSM-covered processes are included in the Bayport PSM manual. The Bayport facility maintains the processes within these limits by using process controls and monitoring equipment, trained personnel, and protective instrument systems. The Bayport PSM Manual includes an evaluation of the consequences of deviation. The plant engineering department maintains the following information: materials of construction, piping and instrument diagrams, electrical classifications, relief valve design, ventilation system design, design codes, engineering standards employed in the plant, and safety system interlocks/suppression systems."

These procedures form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nBaker Petrolite has a comprehensive program to identify and control hazards associated with various processes. Each process is systematically examined to identify process hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards. Baker Petrolite performs these systematic reviews using the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis method. The HAZOP team consists of people with operating, maintenance, and engineering expertise. The team identifies and evaluates hazards of the processes and accident prevention and suggests additional measures as needed. The team findings are documented, and all approved changes are implemented for corrective action. These periodic reviews are conducted on a 5-year cycle and will continue until the covered process is no longer operating. Again, the team findings are documented and retained.\nOperating Procedures\nBaker Petrolite LLC maintains written procedures for the manufacture of specialty chemicals. Each specialty chemical requires a specific \"batch ticket\" to manufacture that chemical, intermediate, or finished product. These \"batch tickets\" contain particular information on raw materials required, quantities of raw materials, reaction conditions, and any chemical-specific conditions for that chemical reaction. In addition to the \"batch tickets,\" there are written plant standard operating procedures (SOP) which cover activities that are genera"

These SOPs cover general tasks such as forklift operations, chemical storage tank filling, container storage, sampling procedures, housekeeping, and other activities familiar to many of the specialty chemical processes. Emergency shutdown instructions are in the Bayport Production Standard Operating Procedure Manual (P-26, P-27, and P-28). The \"batch tickets\" are reviewed after each batch to reflect current operating practices.\n\nTraining\nBaker Petrolite LLC has a company training program for all plant operations employees. New employees receive basic orientation training in plant operations regardless of their previous experience level. After completing this training, the new operator is assigned to a more experienced operator with job experience to perform the duties and tasks in the new job assignment. After the new operator can demonstrate the ability and knowledge (through oral and written testing) to perform the job in a safe manner on his own, he will begin to work alone. In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nThe chemical processes at the Bayport Facility have hazards that must be controlled to maintain safe operation. The prevention program previously summarized applies to all the Program 3 EPA RMP-covered processes at the Bayport plant. These prevention program procedures help prevent potential accident scenarios caused by human or equipment failures. Baker Petrolite LLC has safety equipment and features on all units to help contain or control a release and reduce the consequences of a release. The safety features used on various chemical process equipment for release detection are hydrocarbon detectors with alarms, process alarms, and video monitors. The types of equipment features used for containment or control of releases are process relief valves, tank scrubbers to control vessel or storage tank emissions, valves to permit isolation of process equipment, automated shutdown sys"
