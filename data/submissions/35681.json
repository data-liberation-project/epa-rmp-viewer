The manufacture of these materials dictates that certain chemicals be used.  Some of these chemicals are required to be addressed in the EPA's Risk Management Program, (RMP), discussed below.\n\nThe EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) is part of the Clean Air Act similar to what we have been doing for several years with the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation.  For the most part, the requirements are similar with one key difference. PSM is interested in accidents that could affect persons onsite.  In contrast, RMP is interested in accidents that could affect persons offsite.\n\nThe RMP program has three parts listed below.\n\n1. Prevention Program (how to avoid accidents)\n2. Emergency Response Program (how to handle an accident)\n3. Hazard Assessment (what area might be impacted in an accident)\n\nREQUIREMENTS FOR WOODRUFF\nRMP regulations apply to facilities that have certain chemicals in amounts exceeding a threshold quantity.  The applicable chemicals at Woodruff are:\n\n- Acrylonitrile (toxic)\n- Ammonia (toxic)\n- Ethylene (flammable)\n- Vinyl Acetate (toxic)\n\nPREVENTION PROGRAM\nThe Prevention Program is the first line of defense against accidents.  The Prevention Program under RMP is essentially identical to that required by PSM. Thus, Woodruff has already been complying with this portion of RMP even before the RMP regulation went into effect.\n\nAs implied by the name, the Prevention Program tries to avoid accidents.  The Prevention Program consists of the following components and applies to the chemicals listed above.\n\n1. Process Safety Information - maintaining physical details about the chemical processes such as toxicity and reactivity data, hazardous effects of inadvertent mixing, consequences of a deviation, process chemistry, design codes, and safety systems.\n2.

The method covers hazards of the process, identification of potential accidents, engineering and administrative controls, consequences of failure of controls, siting, and human factors, and includes a qualitative evaluation of the health and safety impacts of control failure. At least one operator and one maintenance employee participate fully in the anayses.\n3. Operating Procedures - specific instructions for the operators that includes information on startup, emergency shutdowns and other aspects of operation.\n4. Training - new operators are trained on the operating procedures, health and safety hazards, emergency operations, and safe work practices. Refresher training is provided at least every three years.\n5. Mechanical Integrity - applies to pressure vessels and storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls, and pumps. \n6. Management of Change - Woodruff's Process Safety Review Committee (PSRC) reviews planned changes to operations or chemicals prior to the change. Changes are reviewed for the entire plant, not just for RMP- or PSM-covered projects. Changes are incorporated into the other Prevention Program sections. \n7. Pre-Startup Safety Review - when a change is big enough to change safety information during the Management of Change audit, a Pre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR) is required. Woodruff also may require these even when not required by law. The PSSR confirms that the requirements specified by the PSRC are met.  An operator and maintenance employee are included in the PSSR.\n8. Compliance Audits - the corporate Safety, Health and Environmental group audits the Prevention Program.\n9.

Hot Work Permit - permits are issued for work that could potentially have an ignition source in flammable areas - the permits are used to ensure that proper safety precautions are in place.\n12. Contractors - Woodruff has a contractor evaluation program in place to ensure that contractors meet safety requirements before working at Woodruff. Additionally, all contractors receive plant-specific training before starting work onsite.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\nIn the event of an accident, an emergency response program minimizes the potential impact.  Woodruff has internal response teams trained to handle many potential events and coordinates with local fire departments for backup or certain types of response.\n\nWoodruff has an onsite hazardous materials (HazMat) response team, and each member has at a minimum completed 40-hr technician training. Additionally, Woodruff has an onsite medical response team (First Responders) and a confined-space rescue team.\n\nWoodruff relies on the local fire departments for fire support and uses the Spartanburg County local emergency planning committee (LEPC) for backup for all events.  Woodruff coordinates responses with the community responders through twice-yearly site drills.\n\nWoodruff is an active sponsor of both Enoree Fire and Rescue and the town of Woodruff fire department.\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT\nEPA requires that Woodruff estimate the potential impact zone for accidents involving the regulated chemicals. A computer model is used to estimate the potential impact distance.\n\nEPA requires that two cases be evaluated:  a worst-case and a more realistic case (i.e. alternative case). The worst-case is highly improbable.

The more realistic case uses typical weather conditions for the site (e.g., partly cloudy day or night with mild winds) and a more realistic accident.\n\nThe result of the Hazard Assessment is a \"zone of influence\" which, for toxics, is a distance at which the air concentration of the chemical is at the EPA concentration limit. Nearly all individuals (including sensitive persons such as people with asthma) could be exposed to the EPA limit for up to one hour without irreversible or other serious health effects. EPA states the following about the EPA toxic limit (endpoint) and the worst-case analysis.\n\n\"Because the assumptions required for the worst-case analysis are very conservative, the results likely will be very conservative.  The endpoints specified for the regulated toxic substances are intended to be protective of the general public. These [toxic] endpoints are concentrations below which it is believed nearly all individuals could be exposed for one-half to one hour without any serious health effects. In addition, the worst-case analysis is carried out using very conservative assumptions about weather and release conditions. The distance to the endpoint estimated under worst-case conditions should not be considered a zone in which the public would likely be in danger; instead, it is intended to provide an estimate of the maximum possible area that might be affected in the unlikely event of catastrophic conditions.  ... EPA intends the estimated distances to provide a basis for a discussion among the regulated community, emergency responders, and the public, rather than a basis for any specific actions.\"\n\nFor flammables, the worst-case endpoint is a blast overpressure of one pound per square inch, which could cause partial collapse of houses and shattering of glass.

At Woodruff, in addition to our Prevention Program and Emergency Response Program, we have taken the following steps to minimize the hazard distance.\n\nSpill Containment - our liquid tanks (acrylonitrile, ammonia, vinyl acetate) are all diked such that if a spill occurs, even a total rupture, the contents will stay inside the dike.  This greatly reduces the potential impact distance.\n\nMechanical Integrity - avoiding a spill in the first place is the best way to minimize the hazard distance. \n\nTank Location - The tanks and unloading areas are generally situated away from the main process areas and property boundary, such that if an accident were to occur the area of highest impact would be generally away from employees and the public.\n\nOTHER WOODRUFF ACTIONS\nThe Woodruff plant is an active participant in the Responsible Care(r) program.  Responsible Care(r) consists of 10 Guiding Principles and 6 Codes of Management Practices.  The 10 Guiding Principles are listed below.\n\n1. To seek and incorporate public input regarding our products and operations.\n2. To provide chemicals that can be manufactured, transported, used and disposed safely.\n3. To make health, safety, the environment and resource conservation critical considerations for all new and existing products and processes.\n4. To provide information on health or environmental risks and pursue protective measures for employees, the public and other key stakeholders.\n5. To work with customers, carriers, suppliers, distributors and contractors to foster the safe use, transport and disposal of chemicals.\n6. To operate our facilities in a manner that protects the environment and the health and safety of our employees and the public.\n7. To support education and research on the health, safety and environmental effects of our products and processes.\n8.
