The document also includes the required elements of OSHA\u0092s Process Safety Management (PSM) program. The contents of this RMP and PSM document Texas Pack\u0092s compliance with the Clean Air Act Section 112 (r)(7), 40 CFR 68, and 29 CFR 1910.119 for the protection of employees, the public and the environment.\n\nThis report meets the Risk Management Plan (RMP) requirements of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for Prevention Program 3 (40 CFR 68) and the Process Safety Management (PSM) requirements of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (29 CFR 1910.119). \n\nThe Texas Pack, Inc. facility is located at 508 Port Road, Port Isabel, Cameron County, Texas. The facility occupies approximately 7.2 acres of land at the Intracoastal Waterway/Port Isabel Turning Basin and Navigation District docks (latitude N 26.060932 and longitude W -97.215897).\n\nThe Texas Pack, Inc. facility maintains refrigeration equipment for various cold storage environments for processed food products, including shrimp.

Its emergency response policy involves the preparation of a response plan tailored to its facility and to the emergency response services available in the community.  The policy adheres to Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) 40 CFR 68 Prevention Program procedures and Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) 29 CFR 1910.119 Process Safety Management procedures where applicable, and complies with EPA and OSHA Emergency Response Program.\n\nRMP regulations for Program 3 processes require the performance of a consequence analysis for one worst-case release scenario estimated to create the greatest distance in any direction to a toxic endpoint. The worst-case release scenario selected involved the complete loss of 10,583 pounds of anhydrous ammonia to the air from a high-pressure receiver. \n\nThe worst-case anhydrous ammonia release rate estimated at 1,058.3 pounds per minute based on a 10-minute release.  Dispersion modeling results indicate that the maximum distance needed for the concentration of anhydrous ammonia to reach the toxic endpoint (0.14 mg/L), because of a 10-minute release of 10,583.3 pounds of anhydrous ammonia, is 0.9 miles. \n\nClean Air Act regulations require that the alternative release scenario selection is more probable than the worst-case scenario. The scenario selected involves a refrigeration seal failure or a puncture of a vessel with a capacity of 3,420 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.  The release could be the result of a mechanical failure, operator error or severe weathe"
