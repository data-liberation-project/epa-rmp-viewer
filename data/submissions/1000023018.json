      "SummaryText": "ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICIES\nThe Risk Management Plan for the Gravel Point Plant is being updated because a new refrigeration unit was installed at this facility.  Prior to startup of the refrigeration unit, a Risk Management Plan was developed to include operating procedures, process safety information, and other process-specific information required for the RMP.  A Process Hazard Analysis has been conducted for the new process.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICIES\nThe Gravel Point Plant has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the facility's processes.  The J-W Gathering (J-W) policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of substances.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\nJ-W operates the Gravel Point Plant located in DeSoto Parish, Louisiana.  The Gravel Point Plant receives raw natural gas from well production.  The raw gas is dehydrated and contaminants removed.  Marketable natural gas is delivered via pipelines.  Natural gas liquids are extracted and stored on site.  The extracted natural gas liquids include ethane, propane, butane, and a pentane-natural gasoline mixture that are delivered to market via transportation vehicles.  There are no listed toxic substances which exceed their respective threshold quantities stored at this facility.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nThe Gravel Point Plant had one release-related injury in 2009 which was the result of a leaking ball valve.  An incident inverstigation was initiated immediately and process changes and improvements were implemented to prevent recurrence of similar accidents.\n\nLOCAL EMERGENCY RESPONSE COORDINATION\nThe Gravel Point Plant has coordinated its emergency response activities with the local emergency pla"

Because plant processes are subject to EPA's RMP regulations and to OSHA's PSM standards, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\nEmployee Participation\nJ-W and the Gravel Point Plant actively encourage all levels of employees and contract employees to participate in creating a safe work environment.  This participation begins with well-established mechanisms of communication with all employees regarding covered process information.  Employees are involved in maintaining PSM rule compliance based on their knowledge, skill, job responsibilities, and experience.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nThe Gravel Point Plant maintains written information intended to provide a foundation for identifying and understanding the process hazards.  This information addresses chemical properties, inventories, and associated hazards, as well as for key process parameter limits and equipment design basis/configuration information.  Specific departments within the plant are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in the material safety data sheets (MSDSs).  This information is supplemented, when required, by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  In addition, the plant has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters and ensures limit maintenance by using highly trained personnel, process controls, and monitoring and protective instrument systems.\n\nThe plant also maintains documentation that provides in"

Equipment information includes construction materials, design pressure, and temperature and electrical ratings.  This information provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluation proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\nThe Gravel Point Plant has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nThe Gravel Point Plant primarily uses the HAZOP and checklist methods to perform these evaluations.  Combined, these techniques provide a highly structured approach where process parameters such as flow and temperature are examined for deviations from their intended design.  Deviation effects are considered in order to determine resulting potential hazards while preliminary recommendations for improvement are proposed.\n\nThe PHA team findings are promptly and systematically addressed.  The Gravel Point Plant assures that the recommendations are documented and resolved in a timely manner.  This documentation includes the actions to be taken and a written schedule of completion dates.  The plant also provides proof of communication with operating, maintenance, and other employees whose work assignments are in the process and who may be affected by the recommendations.\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate from the original design safety features, the plant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews will be conducted at least every five years by the PHA team.\n\nOperating Procedures\nThe Gravel Point Plant maintains written procedures that address variou"

These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a consistent training basis for new operators.  Operating procedures are periodically reviewed and certified as current.  When a process change occurs, operating procedures are revised as necessary through the management of change process.\n\nTraining\nTo complement the written process operation procedures, the Gravel Point Plant has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees.  New employees receive job specific basic training in plant operations.  Employee training includes emphasis on safety and health hazards, emergency shutdown operations, and safe work practices.  Operators demonstrating adequate knowledge to safely perform duties and tasks are allowed to work independently.\n\nHot Work Permit\nThe Gravel Point Plant issues a hot work permit for all hot work operations conducted on or near a covered process.  The Gravel Point Plant provides Hot Work Permit training to all plant employees.  Copies of issued work permits are maintained in Operations and Maintenance for a period of 1 year following completion of work.\n\nContractors\nThe Gravel Point Plant periodically uses contractors to perform maintenance or repair, turnaround, major renovations, or specialty work on or adjacent to a covered process.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) are trained in the work practices necessary to safely perform his/her job, (2) follow the safety rules of the location including the safe work practices, (3)advise the plant of any unique hazards presented by the contractor, and (4) notify the facility of all illnesses and injuries that occur in the process areas.\n\nPre-Startup Sa"
