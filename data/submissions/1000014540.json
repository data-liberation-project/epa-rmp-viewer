      "SummaryText": "The Century Plant is located approximately 30 miles southeast of Ft. Stockton, TX in Pecos County.  The Century Gas Plant is designed to separate the feed gas into two marketable fractions A? pipeline quality natural gas and pipeline quality CO2.\n\nProcess Overview\n\nThe processing plant consist of two trains of two units each, a bulk CO2 removal unit and a CO2 polishing unit.  \n\nThe bulk removal unit is a dual refrigerant CO2 fractionation unit (DRCFU) which will reduce the CO2 content in the hydrocarbon stream from approximately 65% to approximately 22%. \n\nThe finishing unit will extract a majority of the remaining CO2 from the residue gas so that the product natural gas stream will meet gas transmission pipeline sales specifications.  \n\nThe CO2 stream from the finishing unit will be recycled to the dual refrigerant CO2 fractionation unit (DRCFU).  The CO2 product stream will exit the dual refrigerant CO2 fractionation unit (DRCFU)and will be delivered to the CO2 sales pipeline.  \n\nRMP Overview\n\nThe Century Plant is covered by RMP regulations due to the presence of methane within the Century Plant Natural Gas Separation Process.\n\nThis is a new facility and there have been no accidents during the previous 5 years involving releases from the covered processes that resulted in off-site injuries, deaths or damage to environmental receptors.\n\nThe distance from the largest vessel to the nearest residence or public receptor is greater than predicted by the worst-case off-site consequence analysis. \n\nDue to the presence of methane, the absence of any accidents during the previous 5 years and the lack of impact on any off-site receptors, the Century Gas Plant is a RMP Program 1 facility. \n\n\n"
