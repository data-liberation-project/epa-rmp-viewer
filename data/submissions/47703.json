The #2 Oleum Reboiler condensate line leaked when acidic condensate corroded a steam condensate exit elbow below the steam chest releasing fuming acid into the atmosphere at 2:35 PM on 10/11/04.  The condensate turned acidic due to a leak in the steam heating tube bundle.  The resulting sulfuric acid mist traveled across an industrial park and reached US Highway 23.  Operators immediately shut off flows to the reboiler, began external water and foam application, and began clearing the reboiler.  At about 2:50 PM the local emergency response agency, state agencies, and the National Response Center were contacted.  Off-site fuming stopped at about 3:25 PM.  Highway 23 was barricaded by local authorities and a precautionary shelter-in-place was requested for the local community and nearby industrial neighbors primarily to keep people off the barricaded road.  Small wisps of fumes continued to be released intermittently on site in the direct vicinity of the #2 oleum reboiler until the mechanics removed the damaged condensate elbow and blind flanged the condensate nozzle to isolate the #2 oleum reboiler between 4:30 P. M. and 5:00 P. M.  All clear was sounded at 5:42 PM, the highway was re-opened and the precautionary shelter\u00bfin\u00bfplace lifted.  Based on best current information, approximately 60 to 65 persons reported to three local hospitals over a two day period complaining of skin, eye, or breathing irritation.  To the best of our knowledge, there was one admission for diagnostic testing.  All others were evaluated and released.  The plant has also been provi"

We do not have sufficient information to verify these claims, although many of the claimants were not near the vicinity of the release or did not seek medical evaluation until days after the release.\n\n\nEmergency Response Program Information\n\nWurtland  maintains a written incident response plan, which is in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment during an emergency.  The plan consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance. The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post-incident cleanup and decontamination requirements.  In addition, the plant has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment, as well as instructions that address the use of emergency response equipment.  Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties.  The incident response plan is updated when necessary based on modifications made to plant processes.\n\nThe overall emergency response program for Wurtland is coordinated with the Wurtland Fire Department.  This coordination includes periodic meetings of  the Wurtland Plant personnel and the Wurtland Fire Chief to discuss needs and concerns in the event of an incident at the plant.   Wurtland has around-the-clock communications capability with the Fire Department who have the ability to communicate to all state, federal and county agencies as to needed equipment (i.e., firefighting equipment, manpower, ambulances, hospitals, law enforcement, and HAZMAT operations).  This provides a means of notifying the public of an"

      "SummaryText": "Resubmittal Information\n\nThe Risk Management Plan (RMP) for the DuPont Wurtland Plant has been updated and is being resubmitted in January 2005 due to the revision of the accident history in section 6 of the site\u00bfs RMP to include information on a chemical release that occurred on October 11, 2004.  No other accident history information had appeared in the previous version of the RMP as no other accidents had occurred in the past five years.  The DuPont Wurtland Plant is a facility reporting under Program 3 and the RMP has also been revised to include the incident investigation information in section 7.  Specifically, the date of investigation and the expected date of completion of changes to reflect actions taken as a result of the accident have been revised.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Response Policies\n\nDuPont's Wurtland Plant has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of substances. However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nThe Wurtland Plant manufactures and processes sulfuric acid in Greenup County Kentucky.  Raw material, intermediate and process storage tanks are in use at the site.\n\nThe Wurtland Plant was evaluated to determine if any regulated flammable or toxic substances exceeded the threshold quantity.  Based on process knowledge, DuPont identified the regulated substances and quantities kept on site. The facility uses three regulated substances in the sulfuric acid process, oleum, sulfur trioxide, and anhydrous hydrogen chloride (Process 1).  In addition,  railcars containing oleum and anhydrous hydrogen chloride are occassional"

Because processes at the plant that are regulated by the EPA's risk management program (RMP) regulation are also subject to the OSHA's PSM standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nDuPont encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team.  Employees have access to all information created as part of the Wurtland Plant's accident prevention program. One way that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program is our Safety, Health, and Environmental (SHE) Committee.   In addition,  Wurtland  has a number of initiatives under way that address process safety and employee safety issues. These initiatives include forming teams to promote both"

These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.  The procedures are kept current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.\n\nThis information is readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\nTraining\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, Wurtland  has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  New employees receive basic training in plant operations if they are not already familiar with such operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years.  All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to VERIFY that the operator understood the trai"

This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented. Changes are reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.  Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures, are updated to incorporate these changes.  In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on the change.\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nWurtland  will promptly investigate all incidents that result in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury.  The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.

In addition, DuPont is subject to Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) and is classified under a listed SIC Code 2819.  Therefore, the sulfuric acid process and the railcar storage area are classified as Program 3 under the Accidental Release Prevention (ARP) Program.\n\nOff-Site Consequence Analysis Results\n\nWorst-Case Releases\n\nFlammable Substances\n\nThe endpoint for the worst-case release of a flammable substance is 1 psi overpressure (i.e. 15.7 psia) for vapor cloud explosions. DuPont Wurtland Plant does not store any flammable substances listed in the rule in the threshold quantities required by the regulation; therefore, DuPont does not have a worst-case scenario for flammable substances.\n\nToxic Substances\n\nEndpoints for toxic substances are based on the ERPG-2.  Toxic endpoints are listed in Appendix A to 40 CFR Part 68 (Table of Toxic Endpoints). Each of the regulated toxic substances at the Wurtland Plant was reviewed to determine the substance with the greatest distance to an endpoint.\n\nFor the oleum storage vessel, administrative controls exist in which the tank is only filled to 90% capacity.

These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information. Specific departments within the plant are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.  A table summarizing the reference documents and their location is readily available as part of the written employee participation plan to help employees locate any necessary process safety information.\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/ exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs). This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  For the sulfuric acid process area, Wurtland  has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature level, composition) in a Standard Conditions Manual.

Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure the adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nWurtland  primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to local and corporate management for resolution.  Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, Wurtland  periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.
