Joint response training is conducted with local emergency service organizations (i.e. fire, police, rescue, etc.)  Drills are conducted periodically for on-site response teams and with outside organizations.\n\nSAFETY IMPROVEMENTS\n\nFuture changes to improve release prevention include:  improved maintenance procedures and periodicity; addition of new technology as it becomes available; and continued training of plant and response personnel."

      "SummaryText": "tance.  A commercial computer model, Phast Professional, was used to develop the models.  Based on the model results the worst potential chemical accident at the Glen Allen Facility is a chlorine release. \n\nThe Worst Case release at the Glen Allen Facility involves the complete container failure of two, one ton cylinders of liquid chlorine.  The cylinders are side-by-side at the main building water treatment process and would release a maximum of 4,000 pounds of chlorine to the atmosphere.  The chlorine gas cloud, heavier than air, will remain close to the ground and collect in low areas.  The computer model calculates an endpoint of 3 PPM for a 60 minute average at 11.74 miles.  Based on the 1990 census data, approximately 235,814 people live within an 11.74 mile radius of the facility.  More than Hanover County could possibly be involved in a release of this magnitude.  Schools, business centers, recreation areas and other manufacturing facilities are within the end point of the release. The time of day, wind speed and direction would determine the exact number of people involved in an incident of this type.  There were no environmental receptors, as defined in 40 CFR 68, found inside the endpoint radius.  A release of this magnitude is unlikely to occur because of the strict inspection, testing and maintenance requirements placed on one ton cylinders used for transporting chlorine.\n\nA worst case release of ammonia from a storage vessel was also calculated.  The endpoint for this release was calculated to be 2.91 miles and involve 51,000 pounds of ammonia.  Even though there is more ammonia , the release would be less impacting because ammonia gas is lighter than air and will more readily mix with the atmosphere.  \n\nAs part of the requirement of the Risk Management Program, Alternative Releases were also calculated.  The releases were chosen based on evaluations of the processes.  \n\nThe Alternative Release chosen for the release of chlorine involves the breaking o"

The same release scenario is applied to both the Water Treatment Process and the Waste Treatment Process.  Using weather history for the region, a model was calculated.  The end point from the release  was 0.94 miles.  There are about 220 people living in the release radius of the Waste Treatment Process and 230 people living within the radius of the Water Treatment Process.  Schools, business centers and other industry are in the area of concern.  There were no environmental receptors, as defined in 40 CFR 68, found inside the endpoint radius.  This type release is not likely to occur because of the stringent construction codes for pressure vessels and frequent inspections of the pressure vessels.\n\nThe Alternative Release of ammonia involves the failure of a 3/4 inch line on the High Pressure Receiver releasing 20,000 pounds of liquid ammonia over a 48 minute period.  Using weather history for the region, a model was calculated.  Residences up to 0.30 mile from the release could potentially be affected.  There were no environmental receptors, as defined in 40 CFR 68, found inside the endpoint radius.  This release was selected because appurtenances are more likely to be broken.  Protective devices are put in place to protect lines from traffic and accidental breaking.\n\nRELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nTyson Foods has set forth in its policies the importance of operating safely.  The Company has aggressively developed programs, policies and material requirements to minimize the possibility of releases.  These programs include compliance with appropriate OSHA and EPA regulations and sound safety practices.  Stringent material and contractor requirements have been developed to assure that materials and work conform to recognized standards.  Training for employees is conducted to maintain a high level of awareness"

      "SummaryText": "ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICY\n\nIt is the policy of Tyson Foods, Inc. to conduct business in a manner that is safe to the employees, the community and the environment.  The Company's officers, managers and supervisors are accountable to carry out the policies of the Company relevant to the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous materials.  Tyson Foods has made a determined effort to develop a plan to prevent releases of extremely hazardous substances.  Procedures to assist in the prevention of extremely hazardous material releases are set forth in EPA's Risk Management Program.  In the event of a release, the Emergency Response Plan will be the guidance for responding to, containing and reporting such releases.  The Response Plan includes an incident command system for decision-making authority for each stage of a release situation.  The Company will coordinate with public responders and emergency services in ensuring safety of the public.\n\nFACILITY DESCRIPTION AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nTyson Foods, Inc. is a poultry processing facility.  Chickens are trucked in, slaughtered and processed for human consumption.  To preserve the meat and prevent bacteria contamination, two extremely hazardous substances are utilized, ammonia and chlorine.  Ammonia is used as a refrigerant to maintain cool to freezing temperatures in the various stages of the process.  The refrigeration system is a closed loop system, meaning the ammonia is continually reused.  Chlorine is used to treat the water to kill organic bacteria.  Chlorine is injected into the water via a vacuum system.  Chlorine is also used in the pretreatment of waste from the production process.  When mixed with water, it is diluted to harmless concentrations.\n\nRELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nTyson Foods, Inc. has developed models of the releases at this facility and the potential affected areas.  Ammonia and chlorine were analyzed to determine the worst catastrophic release of a hazardous subs"
