(?Jasmine?) is committed to complying with all of the regulatory requirements of the EPA Risk Management Program. Jasmine has developed their Risk Management Plan / Process Safety Management (RMP/PSM) Manual to document Jasmine policies addressing the implementation of these regulations. The PSM sections pertain to the prevention of accidental releases and include the Process Hazard Analysis study and procedures for operating, training, maintenance, emergency response, and others. The RMP sections pertain to management systems and include the Hazard Assessment (Offsite Consequence Analysis) Report.\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE ACTIVITIES AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\nThe Jasmine Pond Road facility is a new facility, which will provide product cooling and long-term storage for table grapes.\n \nThe facility is located in a rural area outside Delano. Ammonia is used as the refrigerant in the Main Refrigeration System (\"System\"). This is a direct, mechanical refrigeration system, which was installed in 2003. The full system charge and start-up will be on or soon after August 5, 2003. The ammonia equipment is located inside and outside. Compressors and evaporators are located inside. However, valves and piping serving the evaporator are located on the roof.\n\nAccess to the facility is limited by a combination of fencing and gates on the property perimeter.\n\nWORST-CASE SCENARIO ANALYSIS\nThe regulation requires that the Worst-Case Release "
