In the past five years we have had two chemical releases involving materials covered under EPA's RMP rule that resulted in a OSHA recordable injury to an employee.  Due to the OSHA recordable injuries we are including these incidents in our RMP executive summary.  These two incidents would have no off-site impact.  \n\nIn 1999,  a release of Crotonaldehyde that lasted for one minute resulted in a OSHA recordable injury but no off-site impact.   As of July 30, 2000, Crotonaldehyde is no longer a covered chemical at this site.\n\nIn 1998, a release of Formaldehyde (solution) that lasted for 45 minutes resulted in a OSHA recordable injury but no off-site impact.  \n\nFor each of these incidents, we have conducted formal incident investigations to identify and correct the root causes of the events.\n\n6.0 Emergency Response Program\n\nWe maintain an integrated contingency plan, which consolidates all of the various federal, state, and local regulatory requirements for emergency response planning.  Our program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.  Furthermore, we coordinate our plan with the community emergency response plan.  \n\nThe Integrated Contingency Plan (ICP) for the Solutia Inc. (Solutia) Chocolate Bayou Plant.  \n\nThe purpose of the ICP is to ensure the safety of those that may be affected by an emergency and to protect the environment from adverse consequences of an emergency.  Consolidation of emergency response information into a single document will help to minimize any confusion that those involved in emergency response may have regarding which set of guidelines are app"
