      "SummaryText": "The Risk Management Program implemented at the City of Griffin?s Still Branch Water Treatment Plant integrates technologies, procedures and management practices to monitor potential chlorine hazards and to minimize the risk of an accidental chlorine release.  The plan addresses procedures and steps to provide employee safety, public health and response agency interaction.  The plan is summarized in a manual, which is maintained on site. The manual not only contains information relating to the safe handling of chlorine and emergency response actions, but also provides the framework for maintaining and operating chlorination equipment, conducting training programs, and completing incident investigations and compliance audits.\nThe Risk Management Program includes the following elements:\nAccessible chlorine safety information\nWritten operating procedures\nWritten maintenance, inspection and cleaning procedures\nOperator training\nChlorination safety equipment (leak detector)\nSafe design of chlorination system\nHazard review of equipment and procedures\nCompliance auditing\nEmergency response coordination\nThe Still Branch Water Treatment Plant utilizes chlorine to provide a disinfection residual.  The facility maintains an inventory of up to 20,000 pounds of chlorine in up to ten one-ton containers.  The chlorination system consists of container-mounted regulators, chlorinators, automatic switchover unit, injectors and two leak detectors and alarms. Since the piping from the injectors to the regulators is under vacuum, any failure in the piping system would break the vacuum thereby limiting any potential release.  Because the regulators are mounted directly on the ton containers, nearly all of the chlorination piping is protected this way.\nThe Still Branch WTP is a new facility and the Superintendent and Assistant Superintendent have operated the other water treatment plant owned by the City of Griffin, the Harry Simmons WTP.  A review of the process history indicates that no "
