This commitment is integral to the effectiveness of the facility-specific programs and policies developed to prevent an accidental release of hazardous materials. The prevention of accidental releases has been provided by developing and implementing design and installation specifications, operating procedures, maintenance programs, employee training, and continuous improvement practices.\n\nAn accidental release prevention program intends to prevent a highly hazardous chemical incident or minimize the potential consequences of an accidental release. In a highly hazardous chemical incident or accidental release, employees, visitors, and contractors are trained to act following the facility-specific Emergency Action Plan (EAP).\n\nThe Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nReddy Ice-Austin (301), located at 7901 Springdale Road, Austin, Texas 78724, is a packaged ice manufacturing and storage facility. The Risk Management Program (RMP) regulated substance for this facility is anhydrous ammonia (ammonia), which is utilized as a refrigerant for the closed-circuit mechanical refrigeration system. Ammonia, when properly used, has proven to be a safe, reliable, and efficient refrigerant, although, because of moderate toxicity and slight flammability, ammonia is considered a highly hazardous chemical. The closed-circuit ammonia refrigeration system provides process cooling for product manufacturing and refrigerated warehouse storage to maintain product quality.\n\nDue to the operating inventories of the ammonia refrigeration system, this facility is covered under Program Level Three [3] requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency\u0092s (EPA) RMP regulation.\n\nThe Worst-Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative-Case Release Scenario(s)\n\nReddy Ice LLC has conducted a compreh"

The OCA describes the off-site exposure to surrounding areas and the potentially affected off-site population and receptors from an accidental ammonia release from the refrigeration system.\n\nThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nReddy Ice LLC has taken all necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements established by 40 CFR Part 68 and 29 CFR 1910.119 through the development of a combined Process Safety Management and Risk Management (PSM/RMP) Program for the ammonia refrigeration system in operation at the Reddy Ice-Austin (301) facility.\n\nThe PSM/RMP Program consists of fourteen performance-based elements designed to reduce the likelihood and severity of an accidental release of ammonia from the refrigeration system. These elements include policies and procedures for Employee Participation, Process Safety Information, Process Hazard Analysis, Operating Procedures, Training, Contractors, Pre-Startup Safety Review, Mechanical Integrity, Hot Work Permits, Management of Change, Incident Investigation, Emergency Planning and Response, Compliance Audits, and Trade Secrets. All program elements are established by a Management System that ensures the development, implementation, and integration of the program requirements.\n\nThe following sections briefly describe the PSM/RMP Program elements established by Reddy Ice-Austin (301).\n\nEmployee Participation\nThe Employee Participation element provides the guidelines for involving employees in developing, implementing, and practicing the PSM/RMP Program.

Information collection enables employers and employees to identify, understand, and plan for the hazards posed by the ammonia refrigeration system to improve processes, process safety, and emergency response. The compiled information shall be used for many purposes, such as developing procedures and training programs. The facility-specific information is used as a resource to support PHA studies.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nThe Process Hazard Analysis element provides the guidelines for completing comprehensive analyses of the ammonia refrigeration system to ensure that potential hazards are identified and controlled efficiently. The analyses are conducted by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in refrigeration engineering and process operations and are re-evaluated at a minimum of every five [5] years. Any corrective actions required by these studies shall be performed in a safe and timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\nThe Operating Procedures element provides the guidelines and written procedures for safely conducting activities related to the ammonia refrigeration systems. These procedures address various modes of operation, including initial startup, normal startup, normal operations, emergency operations, temporary operations, normal shutdown, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, and startup following an emergency shutdown or turnaround. The information is regularly reviewed for accuracy and is readily accessible to all operators who work with the ammonia refrigeration system.\n\nTraining\nThe Training element provides the guidelines for establishing a comprehensive initial and refresher training program to ensure that author"

Contractors shall be informed of known potential hazards related to the contractor\u0092s work with the ammonia refrigeration system, as well as the procedures for emergency action in the event of an accidental ammonia release.\n\nPre-Startup Safety Reviews\nThe Pre-Startup Safety Review element provides the guidelines for reviewing startup safety when the ammonia refrigeration system or any of its components are opened for repairs, tie-ins, or modifications. These reviews confirm that construction, equipment, operating procedures, and maintenance procedures are suitable for a safe startup before placing equipment into operation.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nThe Mechanical Integrity element provides the guidelines and written procedures for maintaining, inspecting, and testing the ammonia refrigeration system equipment to ensure proper operations. Process equipment examined by these checks includes but is not limited to the following components: pressure vessels, piping systems, pressure relief valves, emergency shutdown systems, controls, and pumps. Maintenance operations are performed by qualified personnel with previous training in the applicable maintenance practices.\n\nHot Work Permits\nThe Hot Work Permit element provides the guidelines for controlling welding and hot work activities on or around the ammonia refrigeration system.

These investigation procedures identify the situation leading to the incident, determine the root cause, and define any corrective actions implemented to prevent the release from reoccurring. All incident investigation reports are retained for a minimum of five [5] years.\n\nEmergency Planning and Response\nThe Emergency Planning and Response element provides the guidelines for planning and responding to an ammonia incident. Emergency planning and response provisions include procedures for emergency notifications, employee training, and safe evacuation of personnel. All emergency planning and response documents are reviewed regularly to verify data and revised and updated as necessary to reflect facility operations and personnel changes.\n\nCompliance Audits\nThe Compliance Audit element provides the guidelines for conducting periodic audits of the PSM/RMP Program to determine whether the provisions set out under the Federal and, as applicable, State regulations are implemented. A comprehensive PSM/RMP Program audit is completed at least every three [3] years.
