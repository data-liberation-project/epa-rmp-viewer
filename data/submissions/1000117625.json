Executive Summary\n\nThis program is intended to meet the spirit and intent of the following regulations:\n- California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program - Title 19 CCR, Chapter 4.5\n- Federal EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) - Title 40 CFR \u00a768\n- California Process Safety Management (PSM) Program, Title 8 CCR \u00a75189\n- Federal Process Safety Management (PSM) Program, Title 29 CFR \u00a71910.119\n\nHereafter this program will be referred to as the RMP-PSM program.\n\nThis program is intended to be a \"living document\". As such, the information, procedures, policies, and documentation that make up this program must be made easily accessible and updated as necessary. To accomplish this, Delicato Family Wines Monterey has elected to use PSMWriter, software developed and distributed by Resource Compliance, Inc. This software will assist us with updating, maintaining, scheduling, and tracking RMP-PSM related activities. \n\n1.1 Delicato Family Wines Monterey, Risk and Process Safety Management Program\n\nThis is to inform all interested persons, including employees, that Delicato Family Wines Monterey, also known as Delicato Monterey Winery (DMW), has updated their unified RMP-PSM Program. This program has been prepared to address the risks involved in operating and maintaining the following process which have the presence of hazardous chemicals above threshold quantities: \n\nProcess Name           | Process Chemical          | Process Quantity(lbs.)\nAmmonia Refrigeration    Anhydrous Ammonia           16,000\n\nOur RMP-PSM program promotes overall plant, worker, and public safety.

Utilized PSMWriter software to ensure that all necessary employees have access to relevant information (SOPs, PHAs, audits, etc.)\n\nThe RMP-PSM program sets forth rules, procedures, and practices that will help our employees and neighbors protect themselves.\n\n1.2 Process Description\n\nDelicato Family Wines Monterey operates a winery in King City, CA. The facility has an ammonia refrigeration system that provides refrigeration capacity to sixty-six (66) jacketed wine tanks.\n\nEach jacketed wine tanks is equipped with solenoid valves which control the flow of liquid ammonia from the recirculator to the jacketed wine tank. \n\nThe control valve groups are located in next the tanks to which they serve. The refrigeration machinery is contained outside in a designated machinery area. A partial list of system components installed in the machinery area includes:\n(1) Screw compressor\n(1) Reciprocating compressor\n(2) Oil separators\n(1) High pressure receiver\n(1) Liquid Recirculator with two (2) integral ammonia pumps and one (1) oil pot\n(1) Evaporative condenser\n\nThe system operates as follows: high pressure liquid from the high pressure receiver is piped through a solenoid valves, an expansion valve, and into the recirculator. From there, low pressure liquid is pumped to each jacketed wine tank, where it passes through a solenoid valve, hand expansion valve and into the tank jacket. Low temperature liquid circulates through the tank jacket. As heat is absorbed, the liquid ammonia vaporizes to form low temperature and pressure gas which passes through an isolation valve and is returned to the recirculator. The residual liquid is separated from the gas in the recirculator and the gas is piped to the suction inlet on the compressors which elevate the temperature and pressure of the gas. The high pressure discharge from the compre"

As such, the refrigeration system at Delicato Family Wines Monterey is treated as a single process.\n\n1.3 General Accident Release & Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\n1.3.1 General \n\nWe inform our employees engaged in process operations of the dangers of an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia in annual safety meetings. During these meetings we also discuss preventative measures, such as evacuation, in order to be prepared for a release.\n\nDelicato Family Wines Monterey has also conducted an off-site consequence analysis of worst-case and alternative release scenarios for the ammonia refrigeration process. These are for the purposes of informing the public in the event of an accidental release. The results of the analyses are reported in PSMWriter and hard copy binders. \n\n1.3.2 Anhydrous Ammonia\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration process at the Delicato Family Wines Monterey facility is an integral part of the overall business and operates most of the year. The ammonia process contains a total charge of approximately 16,000 (LBS). It is extremely important that this process is maintained and operated in a safe and efficient manner. Management is committed to making sure that employees are made aware of the potential danger of an ammonia leak.\n\nOur refrigeration personnel monitor the ammonia refrigeration process and keep an active log book of all procedures and transactions that pertain to ammonia.

Nevertheless, Delicato Family Wines Monterey \ncontinually strives to improve in all areas, including safety.\n\nBy utilizing PSMWriter software, all necessary employees have access to every aspect of the RMP-PSM program. This has improved Delicato Family Wines Monterey's ability to communicate hazardous situations to employees and contractors. In addition, PSMWriter tracks all RMP-PSM related events so that Delicato Family Wines Monterey's management team can ensure that the RMP-PSM program is being implemented.\n\nDelicato Family Wines Monterey has implemented all aspects of the RMP-PSM program. When a RMP-PSM program requirement is completed (i.e. mechanical integrity inspection, process hazard analysis, compliance audit, etc.) any specific action items related to that event are entered into PSMWriter, assigned a responsible person, and given a due date. Once the action item has been completed, the resolution can be documented using PSMWriter as well. A list of current or past due action items can be accessed at any time by those with access to PSMWriter.\n\nIn addition to utilizing PSMWriter to create, schedule, track, and document events, Delicato Family Wines Monterey has also entered into a contract with Resource Compliance to obtain help with RMP-PSM program implementation.\n\nFor the future, Delicato Family Wines Monterey now thinks of the RMP-PSM program as a \"living document\". It is an interactive framework that guides safe action for Delicato Family Wines Monterey employees, but allows for feedback and continual improvement. Through the RMP-PSM program Delicato Family Wines Monterey will continue to maintain overall plant worker and public safety."
