As a part of this commitment, KMTEX has established a system to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility.  One part of this system is a risk management program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at KMTEX and that complies with the requirement of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulation 40 CFR part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements; Risk Management Plan (the RMP rule).  One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit a risk management plan (RMPlan) describing the risk management program at KMTEX.  This document is intended to satisfy the RMPlan requirements of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of the RMP program at KMTEX in Port Arthur, Texas.\n\n\n\n1.1 ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nKMTEX, LLC has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety and preservation of the environment. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, including training of personnel and safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of the processes at the KMTEX facility.  KMTEX implements controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  KMTEX places emphasis on prevention, prompt detection, and expeditious correction of unsafe conditions by periodically conducting internal inspection and regularly training responsible personnel. Should a release occur, the facility's trained personnel will respond to control, contain, and mitigate the release. \n\n\n\n1.2 KMTEX AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n\n\nKMTEX may at times, handle sufficient quantities of a substance covered by the RMP rule. The substance covered under this rule is:\n\n\n\n*Vinyl Acetate\n\n\n\nThe process for which vinyl acetate may be involved includes:\n\n\n\n*A Vinyl Acetate distillation to remove impurit"

The KMTEX facility is an OSHA process safety management (PSM) regulated facility.  The elements of the KMTEX facility PSM program / OSHA PSM standard have been in place since 1991, which essentially mirror the prevention program requirement of the EPA's RMP standard. \n\n\n\nThe accidental release prevention program required for Program 3 processes is summarized as follows:\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\n\n\nActive employee participation and involvement in the development and implementation of the facility's accident prevention program is a critical component of the overall objective to prevent or minimize the consequences of a catastrophic release of a flammable or toxic substance.  Employee involvement helps to ensure that all perspectives regarding accident prevention are considered for implementation.  Open communications are encouraged between supervisors and employees regarding all aspects of safety and health issues concerning employees, contractors and the public.  Employees are encouraged to participate in all facets of PSM and accident prevention.  Employee participation ranges from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to being a member of the Process Hazardous Analysis (PHA) team.  KMTEX strongly promotes employee involvement in safety issues through, for example, safety meetings, hazard communications, incident reporting systems and emergency response training.  Employees are encouraged to discuss accident prevention with their supervisors and to bring any questions, com"

The process safety information is readily available to all employees and used by facility personnel, the PHA team and persons in charge of updating the emergency response plan. KMTEX maintains a variety of technical documents that are used to maintain safe operations. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters, specific chemical inventories, equipment design basis and configuration. Chemical specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in Safety Data Sheets (SDS).\n\n\n\nKMTEX also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment at the facility. This information includes, but is not limited to, materials of construction, design pressure ratings, temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment. This information in combination with written procedures and trained personnel provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities.  This is also used for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\n\n\nThe facility has a comprehensive program to ensure that hazards associated with the processes are identified and controlled. Within this program, the process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\n\n\nKMTEX primarily uses the hazard and operability analysis (HAZOP) to perform these evaluations.  The analyses are conducted using a team of facility personnel who h"

The team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are needed.  The PHA team findings and/or action items are forwarded to the appropriate personnel, addressed and tracked for completion.  Resolution of each finding is documented and records of the analyses are retained.\n\n\n\nTo ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not significantly deviate from the original design safety features, the facility periodically updates and re-validates the hazard analysis results. These periodic reviews are conducted at least every five years unless review is warranted sooner due to a significant change to the process. Once again, the reviews are documented and records of the review are retained.\n\n\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\n\n\nKMTEX maintains written operating procedures in the form of runbooks at the facility that address various modes of process operations such as: (1) unit start-up, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, and (5) normal shutdown.  The operating procedures are reviewed by operators and technical staff before every process begins.  \n\n\n\nOperating procedures provide current design and clearly written instructions for operating the processes. Instructions include applicable safety precautions and appropriate information on safety implications. Operating procedures ensure that all employees operate the processes in a prescribed, consistent, and safe manner. \n\n\n\nTraining\n\n\n\nTo compliment the written procedures for process operations, KMTEX implemented a company training program for employees involved in operating a process.

All training is documented for each operator including the means to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\n\n\nContractors\n\n\n\nKMTEX utilizes contractors during increased maintenance or construction activities. Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, KMTEX has mandated that all contractors attend and complete applicable training at the International Safety Training Council (ISTC) location to ensure that they: (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards at KMTEX, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site-specific safety rules and, (6) inform KMTEX personnel of any hazards that they find while performing their work. This is accomplished by providing contractors with site specific training that covers: (1) a process overview, (2) information about the safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements and, (4) safe work practices prior to beginning their work. In addition, KMTEX evaluates contractor safety programs, history and performance during the contractor selection process. KMTEX personnel monitor the contractor's performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\n\n\nPre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR)\n\n\n\nKMTEX conducts a Pre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR) on any new process or process modification that requires a change in process safety information.
