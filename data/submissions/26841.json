Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\nWe at Farmers Co-operative Elevator Co. in Rosholt are strongly committed to employee, public,\r\nand environmental safety.  This commitment is an inherent part of our comprehensive accidental\r\nrelease prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures,\r\nmaintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to\r\nimplement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. We coordinate\r\nour response efforts with the Rosholt Fire Department, which provides emergency response\r\nexpertise.\r\n\r\n  2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\r\nOur facility's primary activities include support services for crop production.  We have anhydrous\r\nammonia stored in a 30,000-gallon tank at our facility in Rosholt (Figure 1).  The maximum amount\r\nstored is 25,500 gallons (131,223 pounds) at the maximum fill capacity of 85%.  With the inclusion\r\nof our facility nurse tanks, we have a total storage capacity of 228,997 pounds of anhydrous\r\nammonia.\r\n\r\n\r\n  3. Worst Case Release and Alternative Release Scenarios\r\nWe utilized RMP PRO which utilizes the EPA OCA Guidance for the worst case and alternate case\r\nscenarios of the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility.  The following details these\r\nscenarios.\r\n\r\nThe worst case release scenario involves a catastrophic release of the entire contents of the\r\nanhydrous ammonia storage tank (131.223 pounds) in gaseous form over a 10-minute period.  At\r\nClass F atmospheric stability, 1.5 m/s wind speed, and a urban topography, the maximum distance\r\nto a toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L is 5.2 miles (Figure 2)"

The estimated population within a 5.2-mile\r\nradius of this facility is 45.\r\n\r\nThe alternative release scenario involves a release from an anhydrous ammonia product line.  The\r\nscenario involves the release of 6,854.78 pounds of ammonia in a gaseous form over a period of 30\r\nminutes.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.14\r\nmg/L of ammonia is 0.19 mile (Figure 3).  The estimated population within a 0.19-mile radius of the\r\nfacility is 45.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  4. General Accidental Release Prevention Program\r\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the EPA's accidental release prevention\r\nrequirements as set forth in 40 CFR part 68.  The following sections briefly describe the elements\r\nof the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\r\n\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\nFarmers Co-operative Elevator Co. maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes\r\nthe chemical hazards, operating parameters, and equipment designs associated with all processes\r\n(Appendix D).\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis\r\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are\r\nidentified and controlled effectively.  Any findings from the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\nOperating Procedures\r\nFarmers Co-operative Elevator Co. maintains written operating procedures to ensure that activities\r\nwithin our covered processes are conducted safely.  These procedures address various modes of\r\noperation; the information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in\r\nthe processes (Appendix B).\r\n\r\nTraining\r\nFarmers Co-operative Elevator Co. has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that\r\nemployees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with\r\nthese processes.\r\n\r\nMechanical Integrity\r\nFarmers Co-operative Elevator Co. conducts documented maintenance checks on process"

Examples of process equipment that would receive maintenance\r\nchecks include:  pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency\r\nshutdown systems, controls, and pumps.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance\r\nchecks are corrected in a safe and timely manner (Appendix C).\r\n\r\nManagement of Change\r\nWritten procedures are in place at Farmers Co-operative Elevator Co. to manage changes in process\r\nchemicals, technology, equipment, and procedures.  Process operators, maintenance personnel or\r\nother employees whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly\r\nnotified of the modification and offered training to deal with it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPre-startup Reviews\r\nFarmers Co-operative Elevator Co. routinely conducts pre-startup safety reviews related to new\r\nprocesses and modifications in established processes.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that\r\nconstruction, equipment, and operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior\r\nto placing equipment into operation.\r\n\r\nCompliance Audits\r\nFarmers Co-operative Elevator Co. conducts compliance audits on a regular basis to determine\r\nwhether the plan's provisions, set out under the 40 CFR part 68, are being implemented.  Any non-\r\ncompliance issue discovered during the audit is promptly corrected.\r\n\r\nEmployee Participation\r\nFarmers Co-operative Elevator Co. truly believes that process safety management and accident\r\nprevention is a team effort.  Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views\r\nconcerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  In addition, our employees\r\nhave access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP,\r\nparticularly information resulting from process hazard analyses.\r\n\r\n  5.

Emergency Response Plan\r\nFarmers Co-operative Elevator Co. maintains a written emergency action plan to deal with accidental\r\nreleases of hazardous materials which is coordinated with the local fire department and the LEPC. \r\nThe plan is intended to assist responding agencies to address all aspects of emergency response\r\nincluding first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, and notification of local emergency response\r\nagencies and the public.  In the event of an accidental release, Farmers Co-operative Elevator Co.\r\nwill contact the local emergency response agencies (Appendix A).\r\n\r\n7.  Planned Safety Changes\r\n\r\nWe plan to continually upgrade the NH3 system at our site to stay in compliance with State and\r\nFederal regulations.  We will continue to provide our employees with ongoing annual training to\r\nensure that they are current with all of the safe ammonia transfer and handling procedures, and\r\nprovide regular inspection and maintenance on all of the ammonia equipment."
