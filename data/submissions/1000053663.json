Maple Leaf Farms Inc. is committed to protect their employees and the people of the surrounding community.\n\nThe only regulated chemical used by Maple Leaf Farms is anhydrous ammonia used in the refrigeration system.  There is approximately 21,000 lbs of ammonia within the system. At most times the system charge is somewhat lower than this number.\n\nAs a part of our prevention plan we have performed a worst case and alternate release scenario centered around the possibility of an ammonia release. Our worst and alternate case scenarios are described in a letter attached to the RMP Report.\n\nMaple Leaf Farms, Serenade Foods Division has in place a Process Safety Management / Risk Program.  As a result of the PSM / RMP Program the following procedures and policies are in place:\n\n     Employee Participation Guidelines\n\n     Employee Training\n\n     Contractor Qualification Guidelines\n\n     Pre-Startup Procedures\n\n     Mechanical Integrity Inspection Policy\n\n     Support Personnel Entry Program\n\n     Hot Work Permit Program\n\n     Management of Change Program\n\n     Incident Investigation Program\n\n     Emergency Planning and Response Plan\n\n     Compliance Audit Procedure done by outside contractor\n\n     Dissemination/Trade Secrets Policy\n\n     Policy for Opening the Refrigeration System\n\n     Process Hazard Analysis\n\nMechanical Integrity inspections are done annually to ensure the equipment is operating properly.

They have toured our facilities and given us a hazard analysis.  We will be having drills twice yearly to familiarize the team with the equipment and procedures to be followed.\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nBecause of executive support Maple Leaf Farms Serenade Foods Division maintains a comprehensive PSM program. This support allows our PSM / RMP team to have the freedom to make necessary improvements as they are identified.\n\nMaple Leaf Farms Serenade Foods Division provides certification training opportunities for employees directly and indirectly involved with the ammonia refrigeration system through courses offered by 3rd party consultants. This provides a better understanding of the operation of our ammonia refrigeration system allowing for safe operation of the system.\n\n\n\n"
