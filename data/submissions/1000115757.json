When this has been done, the Third Crew Member will let Control know whether repairs have been made or if further assistance is needed.\n\nResponse to Major Leaks\nThe District's response to Major Leaks is similar to its response for Minor Leaks, except that the Response Team will wear fully encapsulated suits if a severe gas leak has occurred or if the Response Team finds a vessel/tank leak. The Third Crew Member will notify Control to send Police and Fire Department Personnel to the scene to secure and evacuate the surrounding area, as necessary.

As such, the District, as part of its hazardous materials business plan (HMBP) and Emergency Response Program for Water Reclamation Plant No. 7, has developed and implemented an emergency response plan and an emergency evacuation plan.\n\nCall Outs\nWhen a gas leak alarm occurs during the hours that a Plant is staffed, the Plant Operators will respond to the leak with three operators. The Chlorine Response Team can be dispatched to the Plant during the staffed hours if the Plant Staff are unable to respond to the leak with a three person crew.  When control receives a gas leak alarm after hours, the Control Operator will call out the Chlorine Response Team and the Sanitation Standby Operator. Upon arrival at the scene, both will wait at the entrance gate for the other to arrive and will enter the Plant together.\n\nResponse Teams\nEmergency response and any work with chlorine connections requires a minimum of three employees to be present. ALL Plant Operators are trained in Emergency Response.  After hours this two-person crew responds with the standby operator to unmanned Plants or to other Plants that may need assistance. There are always three employees on call with pagers ready to respond to chlorine emergencies. The on call crew is rotated weekly.\n\nTraining\nChlorine response personnel are scheduled to be trained quarterly in the use of emergency repair kits, the use of personal protective equipment (PPE), and District Emergency Response Procedures. Furthermore, emergency response personnel are trained annually in the safe storage and handling and in CPR/First Aid.\n \nResponse to Minor Leaks\nTwo employees will respond with Self-Contained Breathing Apparatuses (SCBAs), Chlorine B Repair Kits, gloves and a bottle of 26 Baume Ammonia.

These devices are located throughout the Plant and monitor various aspects of Plant Operations.\n\nAlarms\nWRP No. 7 is equipped with Leak Detectors that are designed to detect chlorine in the chlorine storage and use areas at or above 1-ppm. When one of these detectors senses a gas leak at or above 1.0-ppm, audible alarms activate locally and an alarm is transmitted to District Control at Headquarters. At 3-ppm the visual alarm(beacon light) on top of the building is activated. Ventilation fans in the chlorinator room run constantly 24-hours per day. The alarms can only be reset and cleared after the leak detectors sense less than 1-ppm of gas. The alarms are tested by District Operators twice each month. Additionally, the District's Communications Shop inspects, tests and calibrates the chlorine alarm system on a monthly schedule.\n\nScrubbers\nEmergency ventilation scrubbers were installed in 2021.  The chlorine concentration released from the stack of the emergency scrubber system are less than 5.0 ppm. If concentrations rise above this, a stack sensor will shut off the scrubber system. There are 2 scrubbers at WRP#7running in a lead lag configuration. Each scrubber is designed to handle a max of 2,700 lbs of chlorine or one full cylinder, accounting for overfill and contingency. If the lead scrubber reaches the stack shutdown limit, the lead scrubber shuts down and the lag scrubber kicks on. The scrubbers also have differential pressure gauges that will shut the lead scrubber down in the event that the air flow through the scrubber is restricte"

These programs include design and operating controls such as compliance with specified codes, the District's health and safety program, numerous standard operating procedures, the equipment inspection and maintenance program (including a mechanical integrity and preventive maintenance program), the management of change program, pre-start-up review, fire protection and hot work permit programs, management of- and safety of- contractors, accident/incident investigation procedures, emergency response plan, the Federal RMP/CalARP RMP/OSHA PSM Program compliance auditing program, the Federal RMP/CalARP RMP/OSHA PSM Program recordkeeping program and a variety of personnel training programs.

In the extremely unlikely case that this scenario occurs, up to 2,000-pounds of chlorine could be released (in the worst-case). The release would occur to the outdoors. It was assumed that the chlorine released during the catastrophic accident forms a cloud of vapor which is then free to migrate off-site. Offsite receptors within the impact zone were then determined through the use of the 2020 Census Demographic Data Map Viewer, which contains updated information from the US Census Bureau and the USGS maps. \n\nAlternative Release Scenarios\nAlternative release scenarios which are considered to be more likely to occur are those which may result in the release of anywhere from less than one-pound to up to 2000 -pounds (worst case). These scenarios include situations such as delivery of a leaking one-ton container to the Plant, a pinhole leak in the transfer piping, a partial or complete failure of the transfer lines (100-percent vapor) at various points in the system (out-doors or in-doors), the rupture or separation of the flexible connections from the online one-ton container, or a leak from the valve assembly of the one ton container.

Additionally, the site is equipped with a perimeter security system. Lastly, ALL building entries are equipped with intruder alarms to alert control of unauthorized access. Badges are used to enter the chlorine building and only authorized operators have access to the building. These site security provisions are intended to prevent unauthorized access to areas of the Plant where chlorine is stored, handled or used and seek to provide an added level of safety for the storage of chlorine at the plant.\n\nES 2.0 ACCIDENTAL RELEASE SCENARIOS\nThe Federal RMP regulations and the CalARP RMP regulations require that at least two types of release scenarios be evaluated for their potential to impact off-site populations: the worst case release; and an alternative release (an accident scenario that is more credible than the worst-case release scenario). A number of hypothetical accidental release scenarios were postulated and evaluated for the Five Year Federal RMP/CalARP RMP Update, included those listed in the RMP requirements. These scenarios were categorized into worst-case release scenarios and alternative release scenarios. Each of these categories of hypothetical accidental release scenarios is discussed below.\n\nCHLORINE\nWorst-Case Release Scenarios for Chlorine. In this scenario, one of the one-ton containers on site experiences a catastrophic failure due to an unknown event.

The Plant is owned and operated by the Coachella Valley Water District (with a mailing address of P.O. Box 1058; Coachella, California 92236). The purpose of this document is to comply with the risk management plan requirements as set forth in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 40, Part 68 (also known as the Federal Risk Management Plan Regulations) and the California Code of Regulations, Title 19, Division 2, Chapter 4.5, Article 3, Section 2745.3 (also known as the California Accidental Release Prevention Program Risk Management Plan - CalARP RMP Regulations).\nThe scope of the Federal RMP and CalARP RMP includes all operations conducted at the subject facility that involve the storage, handling and/or use of chlorine at WRP7.\n\nPolicy Statement\nIt is the Policy of the Coachella Valley Water District (District) to conduct all District activities safely to prevent job related accidents, illnesses, and injuries to employees and others and damage to District and Others' property. A well organized safety program provides a safe working environment and promotes increased efficiency at ALL levels (IIPP).\nES 1.0 DESCRIPTION OF STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\nThe primary operation conducted at WRP No. 7 is the treatment of wastewater (NAICS Code 22132 - Sewage Treatment Facilities).
