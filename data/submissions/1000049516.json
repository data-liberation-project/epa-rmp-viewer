The Plan includes an analysis of the potential offsite consequences of an accidental release, a five-year accident history, and a release prevention and emergency response program.  \n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nWilbur-Ellis has implemented release prevention and emergency response procedures to minimize the potential for accidental releases of hazardous materials.  Emergency response procedures including evacuation procedures and notification procedures have been implemented by Wilbur-Ellis.  In addition, Wilbur-Ellis has developed operating procedures and preventative maintenance activities to reduce the likelihood of accidental releases.\n\n\n\nThis Plan and the emergency response procedures document the accidental release prevention, safety, and emergency policies in place at Wilbur-Ellis.\n\n\n\nDescription of Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nWilbur-Ellis is located at 1720 Commerce Road in Creston, Iowa (the \"facility\").  Wilbur-Ellis is a retailer of fertilizer in the form of anhydrous ammonia stored under pressure.  There are two anhydrous ammonia storage tanks located at the facility with a capacity of approximately 30,000 gallons each that are operated in tandem.  The anhydrous ammonia is transferred from the storage tanks into 1,000 or 1,500 gallon nurse tanks.  There are six nurse tanks with a capacity of 1,000 gallons, four nurse tanks with a capacity of 1,500 gallons, seventeen double nurse tanks with a capacity of 1,000 gallons in each tank, eight double nurse tanks (customer tanks) with a capacity of 1,000 gallons in each tank, and three double nurse tanks with a capacity of 1,500 gallons in each tank.  The contents of the tanks are sold and delivered to the "

The Plan's purpose is to enhance the facility's existing safety programs implemented at the site to reduce the possibility of accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia that could cause harm to employees, the public and the environment.  The emergency response program, documented in the emergency response procedures, includes accidental release prevention and chemical specific prevention steps.\n\n\n\nWilbur-Ellis ensures that equipment meets the appropriate industry standards prior to use.  Wilbur-Ellis implements operating procedures and maintenance procedures in accordance with manufacturer and industry specifications to prevent accidental releases at the facility.  Chemical specific prevention steps implemented at the site include excess flow valves, pressure relief valves, emergency shut off valves with cables that run along the length of the horizontal storage tanks for quick access, and ammonia training for personnel.\n\n \n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\n\n\nThere have been no qualifying accidents involving ammonia in the five-year period prior to the completion of this Plan.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\n\n\nThe facility coordinates with the Bryan Fire Department (\"fire department\") regarding specific actions to be taken in response to an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia.  The facility has established emergency evacuation procedures to evacuate the site and notify the appropriate agencies regarding a release.  The facility's emergency response program is documented in the facility's Emergency Response Procedures.  The emergency procedures contain the following key elements:\n\n\n\n1.    Emergency response notification procedures.\n\n2.    Facility evacuation proc"

Emergency response coordination and regulatory notification.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nPlans to improve safety at the facility were developed based on the results of compliance audits, hazard reviews, and a Risk Management Plan (RMP) site inspection conducted by an outside contractor.  The Branch Manager is currently working on an implementation schedule for the recommended actions.  Recommended actions include the following:\n\n\n\n1.    Consider potential installation of a remotely located shut down system for the anhydrous ammonia.\n\n2.    Evaluate potential installation of a fenced perimeter for added security.\n\n3.    Ensure that a legible ASME data plate is present on each storage tank.\n\n4.    Ensure that a fire extinguisher is stored in the immediate vicinity of the anhydrous ammonia storage tanks and in the riser/loadout area.\n\n5.    Label the tank opening located at the bottom of each storage tank.\n\n6.    Ensure that chock blocks are available at the facility in the event that a truck arrives without chock blocks.\n\n7.    Evaluate potential installation of barricades around risers to prevent impact from vehicular traffic.\n\n8.    Ensure that worn tires are replaced on nurse tank wagons.\n\n"
