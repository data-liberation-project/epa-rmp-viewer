              "Description": "This prevention program applies to the hydrogen fluoride manufacturing unit which includes the HF generation, high purity, aqueous HF and shipping subprocesses.  A PHA was conducted for the main HF and aqueous HF processes in 1989 and was revalidated in 1995, 2000 and 2005.  A PHA was conducted for the ultra-high purity HF process in 1994 and again in 1999.  Management of change evaluations and prestartup safety reviews are conducted for all modifications. The ultra-high purity HF process was decommisioned in December of 2003.",

Honeywell shares the site with three other chemical manufacturing facilities.  The area is predominately rural with adjacent and nearby chemical manufacturing facilities. There are no immediate residential neighbors.  The plant employs approximately 180 company and about 90 contract workers.\n\n\n\nThe Honeywell Geismar Plant's five covered processes manufacture new generation ozone friendly refrigerants, inorganic acids and fluoropolymer resin. The Hydrogen Fluoride Plant manufactures hydrogen fluoride.  The Multiproducts Plant manufactures 1,1,1,2 tetrafluoroethane (HFC 134a), pentafluoroethane (HFC 125) and 1-chloro-1,2,2-tetrafluoroethane (HCFC 124).  The Aclon Resin Plant manufactures fluoropolymer resin.  The 125 Plant manufactures opentafluroethane (HFC 125).  The 245fa Plant manufactures 1,1,1,3,3-pentafluoropropane (HFC 245fa).\n\n\n\nAnhydrous hydrogen fluoride is used as a raw material in the manufacture of refrigerants, fluorocarbons, gasoline, as well as other chemical derivatives.  Aqueous solutions of hydrogen fluoride are used in the manufacture of electronic components, circuit boards, steel, high-purity quartz, light bulbs televisions, and computer monitors.\n\n\n\nHFC 134a is used as a refrigerant in automotive applications.  HFC 125 is used as a refrigerant in residential air conditioners and commercial refrigeration units such as supermarket freezers, display cases and ice machines.

Consideration was given to the amount of material released, injuries which may have occurred, and actual or potential impact both on and off the facility. Two incidents involving an affected chemical occurred at the Honeywell Geismar Site in the past five years.\n\n\n\na.)  In April of 2001, the Multi-Products Plant experienced a sudden rupture of two 90? sections of piping initiating a vapor leak of hydrogen fluoride and organics from the first stage vaporizer (E-201) outlet.  The release occurred under decreasing pressure for approximately sixty minutes as the plant was secured and the vessel emptied.  There were no injuries as a result of this incident.\n\n\n\nIt was determined through engineering calculations that approximately 6,420 pounds of material was released.  This material contained approximately 3,106 pounds of hydrogen fluoride (CAS# 7664-39-3) and 1,956 pounds of  tetrachloroethylene (CAS# 127-18-4) with the balance being HCFC's.  \n\n\n\nb.)  In July of 2001, an operator was adjusting a manual valve on the bottom of the HCL column (T-220) in the Multi-Products Plant when the valve experienced a sudden failure initiating a release of process materials.  The release occurred under decreasing pressure for approximately sixty minutes as the plant was secured and the column emptied.  The operator involved was injured and was hospitalized as a result of this incident.\n\n\n\nIt was determined through engineering calculations that approximately 7600 pounds of material was released.

The Plan provides for both internal site and external community emergency alerting and notification using established protocols.  The plant has multiple means of communication established to alert public safety agencies.  The plan addresses emergency health care, sheltering in place, evacuation, emergency responsibilities, response, control procedures, and emergency equipment.  The Plan provides for the implementation of an Incident Command System to direct and coordinate the Site's response activities.  The Plan has been coordinated with the local emergency planning committee and with the local sheriff's agencies that would direct all offsite community response activities.  The Honeywell Geismar site maintains its own professionally trained Emergency Response Team (ERT) which is knowledgeable and prepared to respond to incidents involving accidental releases.  The ERT holds annual site emergency response drills and other exercises that have been conducted jointly with the local public safety response groups. \n\n\n\nThe Geismar site utilizes audible warning systems for both onsite and offsite notification.  The onsite notification system can be activated at several locations including control rooms and the plant security gate.  This system has siren and voice capability that can use prerecorded or live announcements.  The system is tested weekly and during routine drills by Honeywell and other companies which share the site.\n\n\n\nNotification of persons off the site property is accomplished in conjunction with the local public safety agencies by activation of a regional audible warning system.
