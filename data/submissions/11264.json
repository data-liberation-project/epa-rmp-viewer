An\n\nalternative release scenario represents a release that: 1)  might\n\noccur  at a facility such as CFS, and/or, 2) would result in  the\n\ngreatest potential offsite consequences if the release occurred.\n\n\n\nThe main objective of performing the offsite consequence analysis\n\nis to determine the distance at which certain effects might occur\n\nto  the  public  because  of an accidental  release  (called  the\n\nendpoint  distance).  Minimal effects could occur at the endpoint\n\ndistance.   At  distances  less than the endpoint  distance,  the\n\neffects  would be greater; at distances greater than the endpoint\n\ndistance, the effect would be less.\n\n\n\nThe  RMP  rule includes specific requirements for the  worst-case\n\nand  alternative release scenarios that must be reported by  CFS.\n\nThese requirements are:\n\n\n\n          One worst-case and one alternative release scenario for\n\n          the   class  of  flammable  substances  in  Program   3\n\n          processes.\n\n\n\nThe  following  information summarizes  the  offsite  consequence\n\nanalysis performed by CFS.\n\n\n\n\n\n  Issue Date:\n\n   08/31/98\n\n\n\nProgram 3 Processes\n\n     Flammable Substances:\n\n\n\nThe  worst-case  release  scenario for  flammable  substances  is\n\nfailure  of the product storage tank, resulting in a vapor  cloud\n\nexplosion.  No administrative controls or passive mitigation were\n\nconsidered  for this release scenario.  The maximum  distance  to\n\nthe  1-psi  overpressure endpoint is 0.39 miles.  Several  public\n\nreceptors  are  located  within  this  distance,  including   ANR\n\nPipeline Company Patterson Compressor Station, Shell E&P  Calumet\n\nGas Processing Plant and some residential areas.\n\n\n\nThe  alternative release scenario for flammable substances  is  a\n\npipe  rupture of the line from the product storage vessel to  the\n\nproduct pumps.\n\n\n\nThis scenario assumes that flammable substances (ethane, propane,\n\nbutane,  pentane, condensate) are released through"
