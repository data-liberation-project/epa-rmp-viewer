We are a Cold Storage facility as well as having various seafood processing and packing operations as well. \n\n     The chemical within our Redmond facility that merits the most concern and the only chemical we have in sufficient quantity to report under the EPA, OSHA and State of Washington guidelines is Anhydrous Ammonia (CAS#7664-41-7). Our facility is covered under the OSHA Process Safety Management rule 29 CFR 1910.119 and as such, UniSea, Inc. has taken the necessary engineering steps to ensure that even small releases would be detected and dealt with quickly to ensure the safety of our employees, our products, the surrounding community as well as the environment surrounding our facility. \n\n     Our ammonia refrigeration system is in a closed loop system and we believe that both the worst case and alternative scenarios detailed within our risk management plan are highly unlikely to occur given the procedures that are in place as well as the way the processes are laid out within our facility. We have ammonia sensors throughout the facility in key areas set at very low detection levels which, in conjunction with our trained engineering staff, response personnel and response equipment, minimize the potential for any significant release to occur. UniSea, Inc. has not had a significant release of ammonia in the last five years and we are continuing to take steps to improve our system and procedures to continue that record. \n\n\n     We work closely with the Redmond Fire Department and have developed and maintain a Hazardous Materials Management Plan in accordance to local, state and federal regulations pertaining to the emergency response capabilities should a release occur. While the Redmond Fire Department has "

      "SummaryText": "substantial expertise and resources in regards to hazardous material responses, we have formed a group of emergency responders, which include not only the engineering staff but also a variety of both production and management employees. These employees receive ongoing and annual training so as to keep them abreast of changes within the facility. As we are under PSM, we have conducted Process Hazard Analysis using the A?What-If / ChecklistA? for ammonia systems and recently have made changes to our facility using current IIAR, locally approved building codes, current NFPA Life Safety and Electrical codes. We are currently reviewing other portions of our system to meet current codes. All affected employees have been involved with and trained in the modifications, additions and new processes associated with the recent system changes within the facility. \n\n     UniSea, Inc. has instituted a change in our management process known to us as A?Project FocusA?. As part of that process, all managers must provide information to the executives as to their current departmental status every two weeks. Part of that status requirement is injury (actual/near-miss) information and upcoming changes that affect safety within our organization. This process has required managers and supervisors to become much more involved in the day to day issue of safety as they are now not only required to report occurrences but to work as a team to come up with solutions for remediation. This has promoted a Safety Culture based on not only responsibility but accountability as well.\n"
