Compliance Audits and PHA Revalidation studies have been completed based on the RMP and PSM requirements, both of which generated recommendations to improve safety at the facility.  These include enhancing employee training policies, revising standard operating procedures, updating labeling, and reviewing / updating preventative maintenance policies.  Costco Wholesale is proceeding with the few remaining mitigation measures associated with these studies.\r\n\r\nThe corporate safety group has also implemented an annual program to review the PSM and RMP programs at each of the Depots to ensure on-going compliance with the Process Safety Management and Risk Management Programs."

The majority of the system is located in the facility's ammonia engine room including vessels and compressors.  The condensers are mounted on the engine room roof, and all of the evaporator coils are located in the cross dock warehouse.  At one end of the warehouse, there are several evaporator coils that are used to maintain a slightly lower temperature for meat products.\r\n\r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\n\r\nThe Costco Wholesale ammonia refrigeration system has many safety features.  Much of the safety of the system is inherent in the policies and procedures that govern the operation of the system.  For example, the Costco Wholesale facility operates in accordance with OSHA's Process Safety Management regulation.  Refrigeration contractors, experts in the ammonia refrigeration industry, are contracted at the Chill Depot to maintain the system via routine site visits and are on call for equipment repairs.\r\n\r\nThe Costco Wholesale facility, including the ammonia system, was designed and constructed in accordance with the Uniform Mechanical Code which specifically outlines requirements for the safe operation of ammonia refrigeration system.  These safety features include a water diffusion tank, ammonia leak detectors in the engine rooms and the cold storage areas, and automatic shut down systems.  In addition, the majority of the ammonia is maintained inside the engine room and just outside of the engine rooms (condensers).  All pressure vessels are equipped with pressure relief valves that protect the integrity of the equipment in case of a high pressure situation.\r\n\r\nAmmonia refrigeration systems do not typically experience any chemical reactions or internal corrosion.  The only composition change that occurs within the systems are phase changes, as ammonia is cycled through vario"

Any leaks are noted and repaired immediately.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the Uniform Mechanical Code, Costco Wholesale has developed a preventive maintenance program that utilizes the services of a professional refrigeration contractor to complete regularly scheduled inspections and tests of the ammonia refrigeration system as well as repairs as needed to process equipment.  This program is implemented throughout the Costco Wholesale Depot system.\r\n\r\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nThe Costco Wholesale facility has not had any reportable ammonia releases during the past 5 years (June 2014 - June 2019).  No injuries have occurred at the facility due to the operation of the ammonia refrigeration process.\r\n\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\r\n\r\nCostco Wholesale has an emergency action plan in effect at the facility.  Emergency response activities are coordinated with the local Tracy Fire Department.  In case of a major ammonia emergency, the facility will evacuate employees and then call 9-1-1 to alert the local Police and Fire Departments.  Other responders will be called as needed, including the county Hazardous Materials Response Team, and the San Joaquin County Environmental Health Department / CUPA.  If a release exceeds the federal reporting quantity of 100 pounds for ammonia, the National Response Center will also be called immediately.\r\n\r\nThe Costco Wholesale facility has an Emergency Command System in place.  The Depot Manager will assume command in an emergency situation with backup personnel appointed to serve if he/she is not available until the Fire Department arrives.  Costco Wholesale maintains a safety committee whose members include the designated emergency coordinators for the facility including the Assistant Depot Manager.

This group monitors the on-site implementation of the Process Safety Management programs through periodic meetings at each regulated facility.  In addition, the corporate safety group in conjunction with the local Depot Managers are responsible for maintaining a safety and environmental program to promote a safe environment for all employees and the surrounding communities.  This policy is administered through Costco Wholesale's safety and environmental programs.  These programs include forklift safety, hazard communications, lockout / tagout, Hazardous Materials Emergency Business Plan, employee safety manuals, manufacturers' documentation, as well as the Risk Management Plan.\r\n\r\nThe Costco Wholesale facility has an emergency action plan in effect.  The Emergency Action Plan (Plan) is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of the PSM/RMP document which is maintained at the facility.  This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\r\n\r\n - To save lives.\r\n - To minimize and avoid injuries.\r\n - To protect the environment.\r\n - To minimize property damage.\r\n\r\nThe Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\r\n\r\nStartup of the ammonia refrigeration system at the Chill Depot occurred in late 1998.
