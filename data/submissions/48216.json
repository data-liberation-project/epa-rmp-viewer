The Regional Water Plant is located in Wylie, Texas at 810 North Highway 78. The facility is owned and operated by the North Texas Municipal Water District (NTMWD). The plant is a conventional water plant that serves over 1,500,000 people with potable water. The treatment plant used anhydrous ammonia and chlorine for disinfection of the water. Currently a maximum of 163,000 pounds of ammonia and 2,160.000 pounds of chlorine can be found on site depending on the time of the year and the volume of water treated. No other chemicals located onsite are of sufficient inventory to be included in the RMProgram. \n\nThe NTMWD is constructing a new water plant facility in Bonham, Texas. This will be a small facility. Sodium hypochlorite will be utilized at this facility for disinfection rather than using chlorine gas. This commitment was made by management and operations personnel to eliminate the possibility of a chemical release. \n\nSAFETY AND EMERGENCY REPSONSE POLICIES\n\nThe NTMWD has developed a safety handbook and accident prevention plan that is read by all employees upon their employment. By having employees read the safety handbook during employee orientation they immediately realized the importance NTMWD places on having a safe workplace. A copy of each plan is maintained at the facility for reference to safeties polices. The handbook includes a mission statement at the beginning that states, ?NTMWD promotes accident and injury prevention to protect the employees and citizens we serve through a training and awareness program.? This statement is signed by the NTMWD Executive Director and supported by management personnel. Also, each new employee as part of employee orientation is given an overview of the RMProgram and ERP to alert him/her of the part in the plan in the event the plan is placed into s"

In the awareness classes each chemical stored on the facility is discussed. MSDS sheets are reviewed so that employees understand the information included and are encouraged to read the information before working with or near any of the chemicals at the plant. \n\nThe NTMWD has developed and included in the Vulnerability Assessment study a plan detailing emergency response to various weather conditions, and security threats. Management has set up a command center that will be activated in the event of an emergency condition including a chemical release. \n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL SPECIFICE PREVENTION STEPS\n\nNTMWD is committed to safety at the Regional Water Treatment Plant and has long emphasized the importance of safety in storing and using regulated substances. NTMWD has used 40 CFR 68 requirements as an opportunity to further refine its safety program and strengthen its emergency response plan.\n\nThe NTMWD will be placing Plant IV in service during the summer of 2007. This will add additional inventory of chlorine and ammonia at the facility. Chlorine at Plant IV will be stored in an enclosed building with chlorine detectors that automatically scrub the air in the event of a chemical release. To further enhance the safety of our employees and the citizens we serve, automatic excess flow shut-off valves at the railcars will be in service to prevent a chemical release. Plant III chlorine is also stored in an enclosed building with scrubber facilities to neutralize the air before being discharged to the atmosphere. The NTMWD is evaluating the construction of a chlorine scrubber at the chlorine storage area for Plant 1& 2. Chlorine leak detectors are located in the chlorine storage areas at all plants.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe NTMWD is committed to managing the risk associated with chlorine an"

The NTMWD has not experience an accidental release of chlorine or anhydrous ammonia with the past five years or during the history of the NTMWD, which spans fifty-five plus years. \n\nEMEGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe NTMWD has developed an emergency response plan that is a joint effort between the NTMWD emergency response team, a contract emergency responder (SET Environmental), and the Wylie Fire Department. The NTMWD has worked closely with the Wylie Fire Department on emergency response. They have requested that in the event of the chemical release that their department be the first responder. The NTMWD has conducted training onsite with the fire department and other local industries to evaluate emergency response and pool the efforts of each industry and the fire department in the event of a chemical release at the NTMWD facility or other local industries. \n\nEmergency response drills have been conducted onsite with the fire department. The drills have included a call to 911 with both fire and police department responding in the event the release was caused by terrorism. This scenario include the police capturing a terrorist on site, while the fire department worked with the NTMWD emergency response team repairing a leaking a one-ton cylinder. \n\nThis past year the NTMWD, Collin County LEPCA, and the Wylie Fire Department conducted drills on repairing a leaking rail car. This drill included personnel using the appropriate PPE clothing, SCBA, Chlorine repair kit, and a decontamination area was set up for personnel exiting the area. This was a valuable exercise that will be continued. \n\nThe NTMWD has also coordinated with the Wylie Fire Department in providing maps of the facility showing locations of the chemical storage areas, building are number to provide better emergency response, and locations on the site have been evaluated that will allow Care-Flight (GPS coordinates have been "
