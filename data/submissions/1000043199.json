Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the facility has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform facility personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.  This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work. In addition, the Buckeye CO2 Plant evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor. Facility personnel periodically monitor contractor performance with regard to their safety obligations. \r\n\r\nPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSR)\r\n\r\nThe Buckeye CO2 Plant conducts a PSSR for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information. The purpose of the PSSR is to see that safety features, procedures, personnel and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service. This review provides one additional check that construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready. A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\r\n\r\nMechanical Integrity\r\n\r\nThe Buckeye CO2 Plant has established practices and procedures to maintain process equipment, pressure vessels, piping systems, relief systems, controls, pumps and compressors in a safe operating condition.

The teams typically have members from various areas of the plant, including operations. maintenance, engineering, and plant management.\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\n\r\nThe Buckeye CO2  Plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information. The Buckeye CO2  Plant currently has a Process Safety Management/Risk Management (PSM/RMP) Coordinator that assists in maintenance of up-to-date process safety information. A table summarizing the reference documents and their location is readily available as part of the written employee participation plan to help employees locate any necessary process safety information.\r\n\r\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response? exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs). For specific process areas, the facility has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) in Operator Procedure Manual. The facility maintains the process within these limits by using process controls and monitoring instruments, trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\r\n\r\nThe facility also maintains files that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.

Written procedures provide that work is performed in a consistent manner and serve as basis for training. Inspections and tests are performed to help verify that equipment functions as intended and that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels). If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service. This may require that a management of change team review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary.\r\n\r\nAn integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance. The Buckeye CO2 Plant incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs. This helps determine that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.\r\n\r\nSafe Work Practices\r\n\r\nThe Buckeye CO2 Plant has safe work practices in place to help provide worker and process safety. Examples of these include (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) a lockout/tagout procedure to isolate energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous substances before process piping or equipment is opened, (4) a permit and procedure to control spark-producing activities (i.e., hot work), and (5) a permit and procedure to verify that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confi"

These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate. The procedures are kept current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes. In addition, the Buckeye CO2 Plant maintains information on how to respond to upper or lower limit exceedances for specific process or equipment parameters. This information, along with written operating procedures, is readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\r\n\r\nTraining\r\n\r\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the Buckeye CO2 Plant has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process. New employees receive basic training in process operations if they are not already familiar with such operations. After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with an experienced operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks. After operators demonstrate adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently. In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level, This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years, or more frequently upon request.

This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented. Changes are reviewed to (1) determine that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.  Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures are updated to incorporate these changes.

The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident. The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to facility management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation teams findings and recommendations are tracked until they are complete.
