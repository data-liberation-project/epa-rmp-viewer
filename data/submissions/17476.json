CCWRF occupies 17.91\nacres of land directly adjacent to and south of Chino Hills Parkway in the city of Chino,\nCalifornia 91710.

The primary operation conducted at CCWRF is wastewater\ntreatment. As a part of this process, chlorine is utilized for water disinfection and sulfur dioxide\nis utilized for dechlorination. Provided below, is a brief description of the primary operations\nconducted at the facility and a description of the storage, handling and use of chlorine and sulfur\ndioxide.\n\nPRIMARY OPERATIONS\n\nFigure ES-I provides a simplified process flow diagram for the wastewater treatment process at\nCCWRF. As shown, raw sewage is passed through screening and grit removal units, primary\nclarifiers, aeration basins, secondary clarifiers, polymer and coagulant chemical addition, effluent\nfilters, chlorination and dechlorination units and then discharged. The plant effluent is discharged\nto Chino Creek and onto the Santa Ana River.\n\nCCWRF contains six aeration basins, two primary clarifiers, three secondary clarifiers, tertiary\nfilters, a maximum of sixteen one ton containers of chlorine, and a maximum of eight one ton\ncontainers of sulfur dioxide.\n\nSTORAGE, HANDLING AND USE OF CHLORINE\nCCWRF Chlorination Process Description\n\nAt CCWRF, the quality of water is monitored via sampling of the process. Chlorine is utilized to\ndisinfect cleaned/treated water prior to discharging (this is also known as final disinfection of the\neffluent). Chlorine is a regulated substance subject to the federal RMP requirements. The\nCCWRF chlorination process consists of four main components:\n\n  A maximum of sixteen one-ton containers of chlorine;\n\n  Two evaporator for converting liquid chlorine to a gaseous state;\n\n   Three chlorinators and three ejectors to control the injection of chlorine and maintain a\nvacuum\non the gaseous chlorine system; and\n\n  System piping.\n\n"
