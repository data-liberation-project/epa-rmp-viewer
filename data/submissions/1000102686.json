The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nThis facility\u0092s systems and practices are designed to achieve compliance with EPA's Risk Management Plan (RMP) Rule, OSHA\u0092s Process Safety Management (PSM) Rule, and with related state and local requirements for prevention of accidental chemical releases.   The aerosol storage area was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-30B and includes safety features such as automatic fire sprinklers, two personnel exits, and self-closing lift-truck doors that would be activated by the heat of a fire.\n\n4. Five-year Accident History\nThere have been no accidental releases in the past five years. Engineering controls and employee awareness have played a key role in the success of the facility\u0092s safety record.\n\n5. The Emergency Response Plan\nThis facility's Emergency Action Plan includes response actions for site personnel for multiple types of emergencies.  The primary elements of the plan include emergency reporting and evacuation procedures, emergency personnel responsibilities, command of responses, training, and site-specific details such as emergency contacts and maps with pertinent locations illustrated.  Facility emergency contacts have provided a copy of this plan to the Orange City Fire Department and the Sioux County Emergency Management Agency.  Note, however, the facility is a non-responding source, meaning it relies on local emergency responders in the event of an accidental release.\n\n6. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\nThe company\u0092s commitment to its proactive safety policy is ongoing. Safety improvements are periodically evaluated and completed in conjunction with NFPA-30B revisions and with recurring activities such as process hazard analyses, management of changes, and compliance audits."

      "SummaryText": "INTRODUCTION\nDiamond Vogel, Inc. is the owner of the warehouse at 303 19th Street SE in Orange City, IA, which has EPA Systems Facility Identifier number 1000 0024 9322. The warehouse stores products, including aerosol paint cans. The warehouse is being modified to increase the size of the aerosol storage area where packaged spray paint cans are primarily stored in pallets of cardboard box cases. A Program Level 1 Risk Management Plan (RMP) is being submitted in accordance with 40 CFR \u00a7 68 since the maximum quantity of flammables contained in the aerosol products stored in the larger aerosol storage area could exceed the applicability threshold and the estimated impacts from the offsite consequence analysis are predicted to not go beyond facility boundaries.\n \n1. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nAccidental release prevention is inherent within the design of the aerosol storage area. Aerosol products must be handled appropriately to reduce potential exposure hazards to employees, visitors, and nearby members of the community.  Safe operation is enhanced by the careful manner of handling aerosol products, engineering controls at the facility, and effective training of employees.\nFurthermore, the facility\u0092s Emergency Action Plan is designed to minimize potential hazards to human health and the environment from fires, explosions, or any unplanned sudden or non-sudden release of hazardous material or hazardous material constituents to air, soil, or surface water.  It also is company policy to comply with Federal and State rules and regulations.  \n\n2. The Facility and Regulated Substances Handled\nThe purpose of the warehouse is to store products, including aerosol paints, for distribution to customers.  Aerosol paints contain Aerosol Grade Propellant that is approximately 62% propane and 38% butane (by weight) and a solvent that is usually flammable such as acetone. The maximum inventory of flammables that can be stored within the aerosol stor"
