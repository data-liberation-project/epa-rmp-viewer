This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. If such a release should occur, our highly trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release. We are also completely coordinated with the Kanawha Putnam Emergency Planning Committee which provides additional emergency response expertise.\n\n\n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n\n\nThe South Charleston site is a manufacturing facility that annually produces many different specialty chemicals. Most are intermediates used in other processes or sold to customers who convert them into finished products. \n\n\n\nUnion Carbide Corporation handles and stores threshold quantities of the following RMP-regulated toxic substances at the South Charleston Plant:\n\nAllyl Alcohol\n\nEthylene Oxide Propylene Oxide\n\n\n\nThe toxic alternative-case release scenarios for ethylene oxide, propylene oxide, and allyl alcohol were determined using the RMPComp tool. \n\n\n\nChanges were made to Section 1 to reflect changes in Owner or Operator, person responsible for RMP implementation, Emergency Contact, Parent Company web site address, and number of fulltime equivalent employees on site.

A change was made to the quantity of propylene oxide released for the toxics alternative release scenario from 3,000 pounds to 3,120 pounds.  This is believed to be due to a typographical error in the 2014 submittal and there is no impact on the population impact modeling.  Catastrophic failure of Allyl Alcohol storage tank was once again evaluated as a potential worst case scenario. However, for this submittal, the dike (height 32\", area 848 ft2) serving this tank was considered as mitigation.  When considering the dike as mitigation, the RMPComp result was greatly reduced, thus validating the EO Header as the worst case.  For section 7, Program 2 for TRITON, installation of process controls was checked for the 2019 submittal due to constant upgrades of LOPA revalidation. \n\n\n\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nSouth Charleston Plant has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last 5 years. Due to our stringent release prevention policies, there have been no accidental releases as defined by the RMP rule of regulated substances, during this period.\n\n\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n\n\nUCC's general accident prevention program consists of compliance with the EPA RMP rule, OSHA's PSM standard, and implementation of Dow's Operating Discipline Management System. Key elements include:\n\n\n\nWe maintain a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes. Examples include Material Safety Data Sheets for all the hazardous chemicals, Equipment Design Specification sheets, Reactive Chemicals Test results, and many others. This information is maintained up-to-date and is available to operating personnel.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our p"

The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at regular intervals. Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Union Carbide Corporation maintains written operating procedures. These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround. The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\nOur facility has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes. Refresher training is provided on a continuing basis.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nWe carry out a highly documented Planned Preventative Maintenance Program (PPM) which provides checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations. Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls, pumps, and compressors. Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices. Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.

These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\n\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nSelf-assessments and audits are conducted on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented. Audits are carried out at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\n\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nUCC promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a significant release of a regulated substance.

Detailed emergency response plans are developed and coordinated with the Kanawha Putnam Emergency Planning Committee and the community.\n\n\n\nThe South Charleston facility carries a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials.

The plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within our processes that would require a modified emergency response.\n\n\n\nTo ensure proper functioning, quarterly emergency drills are conducted to enhance skills and tactics for responding to an accidental chemical release.
