The Cooperative's policy is to adhere to all applicable Federal and State rules and regulation in order to:\n1. Prevent unnecessary human exposure,\n2. Reduce the threat to employees health, and \n3. To reduce the threat to nearby members of the community.\nSafety depends upon the manner in which an accidental release is handled, combined with the safety devices inherent in the design of the operation, the safe handling procedures used and the training of personnel.\n\nThis Cooperative complies with the provision of \"Safety Requirements for Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61-1\", published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc., and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Heath Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\".  The Cooperative's emergency response plan includes procedures for notification of the local fire authority, the LEPC and any potentially affected neighbors.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCES AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia\nAt this facility, anhydrous ammonia is stored and distributed for resale to farmers and other customers.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is received by truck, and stored in a 12,000 gallon tank.  The anhydrous ammonia is distributed and used for direct application to customers fields for crop production nutrient.\n\nThe maximum amount of anhydrous ammonia that can be stored at this facility is 48,000 pounds (12,000 gallon tank times 4.67 pounds/gallon times 85%).\n\nRELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia\nWorst case scenario - Failure of the 26,000 gallon tank when filled to 85% capacity would release 48,000 pounds.  The anhydrous ammonia would be released as a gas over a 10 minute period (4,800 pounds per minut"

The distance to the endpoint under urban conditions using the degadis model (toxic endpoint is 200 ppm) is .8 miles.\n\nAlternate Scenario - A hose breaks resulting in a release of 5% of the tank or 2400 pounds.  The release is stopped through human intervention in 2 minutes (1,200 lbs/min).  The distance to the endpoint under urban conditions is 0.3 miles.\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND THE SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\nThis distribution facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations.\n\nThe anhydrous ammonia facility has implemented the provision of \"Safety Requirements for Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc., and the standards of the U.S. Occupation Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\".\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past 5 years that have caused any death, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor to our knowledge, have resulted in off site deaths, injuries, evacuation, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\nThis facility emergency response program is written in accordance with OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.38.  The Cooperative has discussed this program with the LEPC and local fire department.  A representative of the local fire department has inspected the site.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no additional specific safety recommendations for implementation.\nFor further information contact: COOP FACILIY PLANT MANAGER"
