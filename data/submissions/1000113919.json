Ammonia is used for cooling purposes only. 1,3 Butadiene is used to manufacture a water based emulsion polymer or dispersion. This dispersion is used in a variety of products including foams for pillows and mattresses, shoe inserts, general purpose adhesives and for asphalt modification to improve resiliency and extend the service life of streets and highways. \n\n2-(cis)Butene and 2-Trans) Butene are contaminates in the 1,3 Butadiene and are recovered and sent off site for recycling.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\nTo prevent accidental releases, this facility is in compliance with the EPA Risk Management Program, the OSHA Process Safety Management standard, and the American Chemistry Council (ACC) Responsible Care Process Safety Code. \n\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nThis facility has an emergency response plan that is coordinated with the community plan.  Facility HazMat team members are trained and participate in drills regularly. The BASF Chattanooga site is also the home of the Southeast Technical Resource and Chemical Emergency Response (TRACER)team which consists of Specialist Level Responders capable of responding to transportation incidents involving hazardous materials. These Specialist Responders have assisted local fire and emergency officials in managing non-BASF emergencies when called upon as well.  \n\n\nChanges to Improve Safety\n\nFacility processes are routine"
