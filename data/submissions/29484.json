Describe Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Policies\n\nFairmont Foods has established a workplace safety program to assist in providing a safe and healthful work environment for employees, customers, and visitors.  This program is a top priority for Fairmont Foods.  Its success depends on the alertness and personal commitment of all.\n\nFairmont Foods provides information to employees about workplace safety and health issues through regular internal communication channels such as employee meetings, bulletin board postings, memos, or other written communications.  A safety advisory group has been established to assist in these activities and to facilitate effective communication between employees and management about workplace safety and health issues.\n\nEach employee is expected to obey the safety rules and to exercise caution in all work activities.  Employees must immediately report any unsafe condition to the appropriate supervisor.  Employees who violate safety standards, who cause dangerous or hazardous situations, or who fail to report or, where appropriate, remedy such situations, may be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Policies are designed to comply with OSHAs Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals, 29 CFR 1910.119) and EPAs Risk Management Program (RM program) regulation (Risk Management Programs for Chemical Accidental Release Prevention, 40 CFR Part 68). \n\nThe purpose of the accidental release prevention and emergency action program is to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of toxic substances as well as fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents.  Overall, these programs prevent accidental fatalities, injuries and illnesses and avoid physical property damage.\n\nB. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThis"

      "SummaryText": "facility operates an ammonia refrigeration system to provide cooling and freezing capabilities for food products.  The amount of anhydrous ammonia (CAS #7662-41-7) contained in this system is in excess of 10,000 pounds.  The ammonia inventory of this system is approximately 47,000 lbs.  Since ammonia releases from this system could pose a risk of offsite public impact and is regulated under the OSHA PSM standard (29 CFR 1910.119), the system is subject to the Program 3 requirements of the EPAs RM program.\n\nThe closed loop ammonia refrigeration system at the facility provides (3) major suction pressures (temperatures) for use in the preservation and process freezing of perishable food products.  Through the use of two-stage compression the refrigeration system provides refrigerant temperatures of -1F. To 50F and  -28F to -45F.The higher pressure portions of the system include the condenser, located on the roof, along with refrigerant vent lines where any leaks can dissipate to the air, joining ammonia produced by lightning where it can be consumed as it goes through a natural biodegrading process.  Normal safeties include: high pressure cut-outs, relief valves, and ventilating systems for machine room areas.\n\nC. Summary of Worst-Case and Alternative  Release Scenarios\n\nThe Worst Case Release Scenario is determined to be a catastrophic release from the Low Pressure Receiver. A worst-case release from this vessel includes an estimated 1969 pounds of ammonia.  For this Worst Case Release Scenario, the distance from source to toxic endpoint is 0.6 miles.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario is unlikely for the following reasons:\n\nThe worst-case weather conditions which were used for this scenario are uncommon;\n\nIndustry standards were followed for the manufacture and quality control of these vessels;\n\nAmmonia is not corrosive in this service;\n\nPressure safety valves limit operating pressures in these vessels and vessels have design margins of safety of about 4 to 1.\n\nAlterna"

Using EPA-suggested meteorological parameters for alternative scenarios and following a one-hour release, the distance from release point to the toxic endpoint is 0.1 miles.  \n\nThe Alternative Release Scenario is unlikely for the following reasons:\n\nIndustry standards were followed for the manufacture and quality control of these lines;\n\nAmmonia is not corrosive in this service.\n\nVessel design uses a factor of approximately 4 to 1 margin for safety.\n\nActive mitigation would be the Emergency Shutdown System which permits system to equalize to 50-60 psig.\n\nD.  Description of the Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe prevention program (OSHA Process Safety Management CFR 1910.119) consists of the following elements:\nEmployee Participation\nProcess Safety Information\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOperating Procedures\nTraining\nContractors\nPre-startup Safety Review\nMechanical Integrity\nHot Work Permit\nManagement of Change\nIncident Investigation\nCompliance Audits\n\nE. Five-Year Accident History\n\nThere have been no reportable incidents in the past five years.\n\nF. Description of the Emergency Response Program\n\nThis facility will call in local emergency personnel in the event of a significant ammonia release.  The facility is included in the community Emergency Response Program coordinated by the SERC, 444 Cedar Street, Suite 223, St. Paul, MN 55101-6223.\n\nG. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nA Process Hazard Analysis was conducted on 12/18/03.  Any recommendations resulting from this analysis will be evaluated and implemented as required."
