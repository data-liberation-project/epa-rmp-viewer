              "Description": "Sistersville's prevention program for RMP covered processes includes all required elements of the OSHA PSM program.  This includes an employee participation program which covers all phases of employee participation program within process safety and personnel safety issues.  A process safety information program is maintained which requires assembling of PSM required information prior to a PHA and retention of key PSI information for the life of the process.  Process hazards analysis are conducted on all PSM covered processes every 5 years and maintained for the life of the process.  Team membership includes personnel knowledgable in regards to the PHA process, unit technology, engineering standards and an operator.  Actions plans are generated and tracked to timely completion with periodic status reports to management.  Major process hazards are formally documented through a site Operational Safety standard program and unsafe zones of operation are documented through a site Crtical operating parameter program.  Operating procedures followed a preset format inlucing all required PSM information with annual certifications and operator input into development.  Incidents and near misses are investigated  in a timely manner with team composition based on the complexity of the incident.  An MOC program is maintained which includes Pre-Startup, Facility Change review and Replacement in Kind packages utilized for all changes at the site.  A mechanical integrity program is in place which includes testing of PSM critical components on a routine basis based on good engineering practices, manufacturer's recommendations and prevalend codes such as ASME.  Maintenance procedures are in place and process overview training has been conducted.  Life critical procedures including Hot-work, Hazardous work permits, Confined space entry, Master tag/lcokout and Line breaking are in place and followied by the site.  Operators are trained on a routine basis and job skill verification is conducted to document that appropriate skills are present to operate equipment.  Other required safety training is conducted for all personnel at a frequency prescribed by internal needs and regulatory requirements.  Compliance audits are undertaken by the corporation at intervals not to exceed three years and include assesments of the PSM program at the site.  Internal audits are undertaken of selected PSM elements in each unit during the course of each year through the managers audit program.  The bulk of the prevention  is through engineering controls, including containment of spills in secondary containment, prevention of overfills through the use of alarms, tank levels and administrative procedures when appropriate, perimeter monitoring where appropriate, and documentation of processing steps, corrections for deviations and emergency response procedures undertaken in the event of an emergency.",

              "Description": "Sistersville's prevention program for RMP covered processes includes all required elements of the OSHA PSM program.  This includes an employee participation program which covers all phases of employee participation program within process safety and personnel safety issues.  A process safety information program is maintained which requires assembling of PSM required information prior to a PHA and retention of key PSI information for the life of the process.  Process hazards analysis are conducted on all PSM covered processes every 5 years and maintained for the life of the process.  Team membership includes personnel knowledgable in regards to the PHA process, unit technology, engineering standards and an operator.  Actions plans are generated and tracked to timely completion with periodic status reports to management.  Major process hazards are formally documented through a site Operational Safety standard program and unsafe zones of operation are documented through a site Crtical operating parameter program.  Operating procedures followed a preset format inlucing all required PSM information with annual certifications and operator input into development.  Incidents and near misses are investigated  in a timely manner with team composition based on the complexity of the incident.  An MOC program is maintained which includes Pre-Startup, Facility Change review and Replacement in Kind packages utilized for all changes at the site.  A mechanical integrity program is in place which includes testing of PSM critical components on a routine basis based on good engineering practices, manufacturer's recommendations and prevalend codes such as ASME.  Maintenance procedures are in place and process overview training has been conducted.  Life critical procedures including Hot-work, Hazardous work permits, Confined space entry, Master tag/lcokout and Line breaking are in place and followied by the site.  Operators are trained on a routine basis and job skill verification is conducted to document that appropriate skills are present to operate equipment.  Other required safety training is conducted for all personnel at a frequency prescribed by internal needs and regulatory requirements.  Compliance audits are undertaken by the corporation at intervals not to exceed three years and include assesments of the PSM program at the site.  Internal audits are undertaken of selected PSM elements in each unit during the course of each year through the managers audit program.  The bulk of the prevention  is through engineering controls, including containment of spills in secondary containment, prevention of overfills through the use of alarms, tank levels and administrative procedures when appropriate, perimeter monitoring where appropriate, and documentation of processing steps, corrections for deviations and emergency response procedures undertaken in the event of an emergency.",

They are:  R-23/70, CNT, K-62/63, K-65, K-1, K-2, K-3, K-4, K-21, K-18, K-36, SPCEU and CEU units, all of which utilize these chemicals.  Also referecned are Distribution which handles these chemicals.  PHA's have been conducted for all referenced units between December, 1993 and March of 1997 and revalidations perfromed on K-3 in mid-1998 and Distribution facilities during 3Q, 1998.Sistersville's prevention program for RMP covered processes includes all required elements of the OSHA PSM program.  This includes an employee participation program which covers all phases of employee participation program within process safety and personnel safety issues.  A process safety information program is maintained which requires assembling of PSM required information prior to a PHA and retention of key PSI information for the life of the process.  Process hazards analysis are conducted on all PSM covered processes every 5 years and maintained for the life of the process.  Team membership includes personnel knowledgable in regards to the PHA process, unit technology, engineering standards and an operator.  Actions plans are generated and tracked to timely completion with periodic status reports to management.  Major process hazards are formally documented through a site Operational Safety standard program and unsafe zones of operation are documented through a site Crtical operating parameter program.  Operating procedures followed a preset format inlucing all required PSM information with annual certifications and operator input into development.  Incidents and near misses are investigated  in a timely manner with team composition based on the complexity of the incident.  An MOC program is maintained which includes Pre-Startup, Facility Change review and Replacement in Kind packages utilized for all changes at the site.  A mechanical integrity program is in place which includes testing of PSM critical components on a routine basis based on good engineering practices, manufacturer's recommendations and prevalend codes such as ASME.  Maintenance procedures are in place and process overview training has been conducted.  Life critical procedures including Hot-work, Hazardous work permits, Confined space entry, Master tag/lcokout and Line breaking are in place and followied by the site.  Operators are trained on a routine basis and job skill verification is conducted to document that appropriate skills are present to operate equipment.  Other required safety training is conducted for all personnel at a frequency prescribed by internal needs and regulatory requirements.  Compliance audits are undertaken by the corporation at intervals not to exceed three years and include assesments of the PSM program at the site.  Internal audits are undertaken of selected PSM elements in each unit during the course of each year through the managers audit program.  The bulk of the prevention  is through engineering controls, including containment of spills in secondary containment, prevention of overfills through the use of alarms, tank levels and administrative procedures when appropriate, perimeter monitoring where appropriate, and documentation of processing steps, corrections for deviations and emergency response procedures undertaken in the event of an emergency.",

Introduction and Background\n\nThe Accidental Release Prevention (ARP) requirements mandated in Section 112r of the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments were promulgated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) on June 20, 1996.  These requirements are codified in 40 CFR 68, Subparts A through H.  Under the ARP program, processes with chemical quantities on site exceeding the listed threshold quantities have applicable requirements.\n\nWitco Corporation produces silicone chemicals at the Sistersville plant.  As defined by the regulations, the Sistersville plant stores the following toxic chemicals in excess of the threshold quantities: anhydrous ammonia, acrylonitrile, ethylenediamine, propylene oxide, methyl chloride, 37% hydrochloric acid, methyltrichorosilane, dimethyldichorosilane and trimethylchlorosilane.  The plant stores the following flammable chemicals above threshold quantities as defined by the regulation: dimethylamine, and trichlorosilane.\n\nThe Witco Sistersville plant has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in safety and environmental protection, employee safety training, and safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of plant equipment.  Witco's written safety and environmental policy state that \"Safety is unequivocally our number one priority\".  Sistersville has implemented reasonable controls to prevent and mitigate probable releases of hazardous chemicals.  Should a release occur, trained personnel would respond to control and contain the release.     \n    \n\n2. Description of the Stationary Sources and Regulated Substances\n\nWitco's Sistersville plant is a silicone chemical producing facility located at 3500 South State Route 2 in Friendly, West Virginia.  The plant is situated on approximately 1400 acres in southern Tyler County.  An environmental remediation firm and an aluminum dross-recycling firm to the south, "

      "SummaryText": "the Ohio River to the west, a rural residential area to the north and undeveloped forestland to the east occupy the immediate area surrounding the facility.\n\n   Silicone chemicals have been manufactured at the facility since the mid-1950s.  Witco's Sistersville plant makes a variety of silicone products, which fall into three general categories: urethane additives, silicone fluids and silanes.  The products are utilized in a broad spectrum of industry.  The facility is operated 24 hours a day, seven days per week. Approximately 570 full time employees are at the site.  Plant manufacturing areas are broken down into four areas: Polymers I, Polymers II, New Product Development and Silanes.       \n\n\n3. Worst Case release scenario and alternate release scenario.\n\nThe Risk Management Program (RMP) rule requires the development of accidental release scenarios for both the toxic and flammable chemicals at our site.\n\nA worst-case scenario and alternate release scenario are designed to calculate\nthe potential impact to the surrounding community.  EPA defines a worst-case scenario as the complete release of the largest inventory of a chemical over ten minutes under weather conditions that would allow the chemical to travel the farthest distance at ground level.  It also assumes that none of the facility mechanical controls or safety systems is operational.  A worst-case scenario is highly unlikely to occur.\n\nGiven the severe guidelines of a worst-case scenario, more realistic alternate release or planning scenarios were also developed to more closely resemble a real world event.  These scenarios involve smaller releases and allow safety systems to be included in the release containment and dispersal calculations.  These alternate release scenarios are useful to local government and industry to prepare emergency response plans.\n \nWorst-Case Toxic Release Scenario- The worst case toxic release for the Sistersville plant would be the catastrophic failure of a methyltrichlorosila"
