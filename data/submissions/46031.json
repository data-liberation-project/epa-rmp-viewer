      "SummaryText": "New Albertsons, Inc.(\"Albertsons\") is a diversified retailer of groceryproducts throughout the United States. New Albertsons Inc operates many retail grocery stores throughout Southern California that are supplied through a series of distribution and transportation complexes located throughout California.  Albertsons Refrigerated Distribution Center #8750 located on this facility site employess over 600 people and uses anhydrous ammonia for refrigeration of the products in tsorage. Anhydrous ammonia is subject to EPA regulation under 40 CFR 68, Accidental Release Risk Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals. Albertsons Irvine distribution center stores and uses anhydrous ammonia for refrigeration of grocery products in storage. Albertsosn Irvine distribution centter has not experienced a release of ammonia invloving consequences that affected residents or the environment in the last 5 years. Pursuant to the RMP regulations(40 CFR 68) and the process safety Mnaagment (PSM) regulations, Albertsons has developed a comprehensive PSM written program to protect employees and the surounding community from exposure to the hazardous chemicals onsite. The facility completed a process hazard analysis (PHA) for ammonia using the industry standard What-If?/Checklist Analysis developed through the International Institue of Ammonia Refrigertaion (IIAR). The PHA was completed using technical and operations staff from the Irvine facilityas well as experienced facilitators from an outside engineering Firm (DAMES & MOORE), and was revalidated to meet the PSM and RMP requiremenst in May 2004. Albertsons implementation of the PSM program includes employee education in the hazards of ammonia and measures that can be taken to reduce employee and and community exposure to accidental releases of ammonia. The plans include preventative maintenance  programs (mechanical integrity) for the ammonia system, and a program for both pre-startup safety reviews and management of change (MOC) to this"

      "SummaryText": " system. The Program also includes specifica requiremenst for safe work practices (such as safe approaches to welding and similar hot work) and safety requiremenst fro contractors who amy be hired to work on the system. As part of the RMP requirements, Albertsons undertook a review of the potential offsite consequences of the accidental release of the largets vessel in the system. Although sucha release is highly unlikely, the regulation requires this review. New Albertsons is committed to minimizing accidental releases of ammonia from the refrigeration process at the Irvine facility. Facility management is involved in the design, operation and maintenance of the system. Albertsons employees have been involved in the development of the PSM and RMP programs. Management has committed to working with local agencies and the community to educate the public regarding the hazards of ammonia and to ensure a safe workplace and surrounding community. Specific questions regarding RMP compliance at New Albertsons should be addressed to New Albletsons Environmental Affairs Department.  New Albertsons has prepared this RMP update in accordance with the requirements imposed by the April 2004 revisions to RMP regulations."
