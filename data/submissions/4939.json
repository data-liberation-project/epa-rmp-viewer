      "SummaryText": "Wayne Farms-Union Springs is a poultry processing facility that stores and uses a chemical that is regulated by EPA's Risk Management Program.  This chemical is Ammonia for refrigeration.  We currently have maximum storage capacity of 26,291 pounds of Ammonia at the Union Springs facility.\n\nWayne Farms-Union Springs believes this RMP chemical that we store and handle on site has very real and potential dangers.   However, it is important to keep the risks in perspective.  Wayne Farms-Union Springs's ammonia storage and handling facilities:\n1.  are properly designed\n2.  have effective operation and maintenance procedures\n3.  employ trained operators and technicians\n4.  conduct periodic safety audits, and\n5.  are constantly upgrading its processes to meet or exceed industry standards\n\nWayne Farms-Union Springs also has taken a proactive approach towards coordinating emergency efforts with the Union Springs Volunteer Fire Department.  Bullock County has a copy of our emergency response program and is well trained and prepared to respond to the potential spills and leaks that may occur at the Wayne Farms-Union Springs facility.  The Union Springs Volunteer Fire Department conducts annual site visits at our facility.\n\nA facility which maintains high standards, such as Wayne Farms-Union Springs, provides less public risk than a facility that does not provide safe operations.  Wayne Farms-Union Springs complies with Federal OSHA rules and guidelines for safe handling, storage and operation of ammonia systems.  We also utilize outside ammonia system experts to periodically inspect our systems integrity, train system operators and upgrade systems to improve safety.  As a result of Wayne Farms-Union Springs's safety program, Wayne Farms-Union Springs has had no releases of ammonia which resulted in off site injury or illiness in the past five years.\n\nBecause of the large quantities of ammonia Wayne Farms-Union Springs maintains on site, there is a very small probability that"

      "SummaryText": "there could be off-site consequences if a major leak occurred.  Wayne Farms-Union Springs uses EPA's OCA Guidance for off-site consequence analysis of ammonia.\n\nWORST-CASE SPILL\nIn the event of a worst-case ammonia release (8,925 pounds in 10 minutes), a .6  mile radius around the facility would have to be evacuated.  According to 1990 Census Data, 46 people in the surrounding community should be notified that an evacuation may be necessary.  \n\nALTERNATIVE-CASE SPILL\nProcess piping leaks could result in 260 pounds of ammonia at 11 lbs/min over a twenty five minute period.   According to EPA's OCA Guidance Models, this 260 pounds of ammonia should travel less than .1 miles and may effect 1 member of the general public.  \n\nCONCLUSION\nWayne Farms-Poultry Divison believes that the poultry industry should proactively inform the public of the potential dangers and the actions that Wayne Farms has taken to minimize or eliminate these dangers.  Wayne Farms-Union Springs has had a long-great ongoing relationship with the community.  We encourage any and all citizens who have concerns or questions to contact our facility.  We look forward to continuing our relationship in Bullock County."
