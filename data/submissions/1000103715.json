This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n2.\tThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities encompass custom chemical manufacturing.  We have 1 regulated substances present at our facility:  Vinyl methyl ether [Ethene, methoxy-].  \n\nVinyl methyl ether [Ethene, methoxy-] is used in the production of vinyl methyl ether copolymers.  \n\nVinyl methyl ether [Ethene, methoxy-] is present at our facility in quantities of 42,000 pounds.  \n\n3.\tThe Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used the EPA's RMP* COMP software and OCA Guidance Reference Tables or Equations.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n  \nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 flammable substances as a class involves a release of a tank truck.  In this scenario 35,000 pounds of Vinyl methyl ether [Ethene, methoxy-] is released.  The release is assumed to result in a Vapor Cloud Fire. At Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s wind speed, the maximum distance of 0.25 miles is obtained corresponding to a flammable endpoint of 1 psi overpressure.\n\nOne alternate release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 flammable substances involves a release of Vinyl meth"

In this scenario, 22,505 pounds of Vinyl methyl ether [Ethene, methoxy-] is released through a rupture disc as the result of over pressurization of a reactor.  The release is assumed to result in a Vapor Cloud Fire. Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the flammable endpoint of Lower flammability limit is less than 0.1 miles.\n\n4.\tThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR Part 68.    The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nAscent Chemicals maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses include HAZOPs, What Ifs, and Checklists.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of five years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.  \n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Ascent Chemicals maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nTraining\nAscent Chemicals has a comprehensive trai"

Refresher training is provided at least every three years and more frequently as needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nAscent Chemicals carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others: pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner. \n\nManagement of Change\nWritten procedures are in place at Ascent Chemicals to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures. Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employees whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification.\n\nPre-startup Reviews\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at Ascent Chemicals. These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits\nAscent Chemicals conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented.  These audits are carried out at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\nIncident Investigation\nAscent Chemicals promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or c"

These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\n\nEmployee Participation\nAscent Chemicals believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.  Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  In addition, our employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP rule, including information resulting from process hazard analyses in particular.\n\nContractors\nOn occasion, our company hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities.  Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is carried out.  Ascent Chemicals has a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related the contractor's work and the processes.  Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.\n\n5.\tFive-year Accident History\nAscent Chemicals has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last 5 years.  Due to our stringent release prevention policies, there have been no accidental releases of chemicals covered by this Risk Management Plan during this period which require reporting under 40 CFR 68.42.\n\n6.\tEmergency Response Plan\nAscent Chemicals carries a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials.  The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas.\n\nTo ensure prope"
