      "SummaryText": "RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nRedwash 24B Gas Plant QEP Field Services, LLC - dba Tesoro Logistics - Rockies (TLLP)\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Response Policies:\n\n\n\nTLLP has a long standing commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated in the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel as well as considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the facility.\n\n\n\nTLLP's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, plant personnel will respond to contain the release as necessary.  \n\n\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances:\n\n\n\nThe Redwash 24B Gas Plant is located approximately 25 miles southeast of the town of Vernal, Utah. \n\n\n\nThe Red Wash 24B plant is a 140 million standard cubic feet of gas per day (MMscf/day) natural gas processing plant.  Input to the plant includes sweet wellstream gas.  The plant produces a mixed NGL stream of 1,667 barrels per day maximum.  The plant consists of two (2) process trains which operate in a similar fashion and are composed of similar equipment. \n\n\n\nThe inlet stream enters the facility and is directed through a slug catcher, where liquids initially drop out and are routed to a condensate separator. \n\n\n\nA propane refrigeration system is used to indirectly lower the temperature of the inlet gas stream, which causes the natural gas liquids (NGLs) to separate from the gas.  The system is close-looped, and the propane refrigerant is circulated throughout the system via the refrigeration compressor.  The chilled gas stream and its associated liquids (including NGLs and rich glycol) pass through a three-phase cold separator, where the gas exits off the top and leaves the facility via the gas sales pipeline.\n\n\n\nThe NGLs are transferred from the cold separator to the NGL stabilizer for removal of the lighter hydrocarbon components"

      "ESSeqNum": 1,
      "FacilityID": 1000041557,
      "SummaryText": ".  The light-end hydrocarbon gas is compressed in an electric compressor and either discharged into the gas sales pipeline or recirculated back through the trains.  NGLs leave the facility by a liquids pipeline.  \n\n \n\nThese substances are regulated under the RMP program and considered a flammable mixture.  TLLP has determined that the radius of impact from a worst-case release would be about 0.4 miles and qualifies for Program 1 due to the plant's distance from any public receptors.\n\n\n\nFive Year Accident History:\n\n\n\nThere have been no onsite or offsite accidents, as defined by EPA's General Guidance on Risk Management Programs.  \n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program Information:\n\n\n\nThe Redwash 24B Gas Plant maintains a written Emergency Response Plan, which is in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment.  The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address the aspects of emergency response including first aid, evacuation plans and accounting for all personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency resonse agencies and the public if a release occurs, and the post incident clean up requirements.\n\n\n\nIn addition, the plant has procedures that address maintenance, inspection and testing of emergency response equipment as well as instructions that address the use of emergency response equipment.\n\n\n\nTLLP employees receive training in these procedures as necessary.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Plan is updated as needed."
