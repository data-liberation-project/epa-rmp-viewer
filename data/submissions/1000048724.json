As part of our Risk Management Plan, our facility has completed a registration, which includes all regulated substances for the covered process at our facility. This information has been submitted to the proper authorities. (2.) The management system at Wheeling Nisshinoversees the implementation of the RMP elements in order to manage the risk of a chemical release at our facility. We have assigned a qualified person the overall responsibility for the development, implementation, and integration of the RMP elements. Mr. Lonny Riggs is responsible for the plan. A copy of the plan can be found in the Mgr. EH&S office. (3) From the hazard analysis standpoint, we have determined both worst case and alternative release scenarios. This analysis was conducted by ENSR International of Pittsburgh Pa.(4) Our hazard prevention program follows the guidelines of Section 68.175 and addresses the following elements that are tailored to suit the degree of hazards present at our facility and the degree of complexity of our facility's operation 1. Process safety information, 2. Process hazard analysis, 3. Operating procedures (5) Training, the training program at Wheeling-Nisshin helps our employees understand the nature and the causes of problems that may arise from process operations. Our program helps reduce the number and the severity of incidents arising from process operstions. (6) Mechanical integrity is used within our facility to ensure that all equipment used yo process, store, or handle highly hazardous chemicals are designed, constructed, installed and maintained in order to minimize the risk of chemical release. In addition, we have a maintenance contract eith LaRoche Industries which calls for quarterly inspections and maintenance. (7) Prior to implementing a change at our facility, we review and identify all modifications to equipment, procedures, raw materials and process conditions. (8) The pre-startup review",
