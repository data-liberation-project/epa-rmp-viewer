              "Description": "The process consists of a an ammonia absorption recovery system (AAR) which is used to cool a 450 ton/day potable ice manufacturing system and asociated equipment for production and storage of ice.  Installed mechanical compressors can be used in conjunction with the AAR to supply refrigeration needs.\nThe interface between the liquid overfeed systems and the AAR consists of two shell and tube heat exchangers.  Process equipment utilizes PLC based controls, as well as hard-wired interlocks to provide safety shutdowns (ie. high/low pressure, temp., levels, flows, etc.).  Audible and vusual alarms are also provided.  Process parameters and setpoints are displayed at the PLC interfaces. \n                                                                                                          Overpressurization of system components is provided through process safety shutdowns sensed by transmitters and pressure switches.  Dual pressure relief valves are installed on all process equipment vessels, heat exchangers, and equipment to prevent systems from exceeding their design conditions.    \nProcess areas are equipped with ammonia detection monitoring systems that provide audible alarms that alert personnel of high ammonia levels.",

      "SummaryText": "1. Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies.\n\nThe Cherokee County Cogeneration Partners, L.P. facility is an 80 megawatt combined cycle cogeneration facility.  The facility generates electricity which is sold through a power purchase agreement to the host utility.  The qualifying facility is a potable ice manufacturing facility which produces, stores and markets ice to retail customers.\n\nThe ice production process consists of two systems.  (1) Overfeed System - This system uses electric powered compressors to refrigerate ammonia which is then used to produce ice.  This system is maintained and operated by Triangle Ice Company and covered under their RMP.  (2) Ammonia Absorption Refrigeration (AAR) - This system uses steam energy to refrigerate ammonia which then goes through a heat exchanger to remove heat from the ammonia of the Overfeed System.  This AAR System is maintained and operated by Cherokee County Cogeneration Partners and is the primary subject of this RMP.\n\nThe refrigeration systems utilized at the facility contain anhydrous ammonia which is considered hazardous by the EPA.  A specific refrigerant charge is solely contained within the piping, heat exchangers, and equipment that comprise the system.  The systems that monitor and control the refrigeration systems contain state of the art technology that initiates alarms, as well as protective shutdowns, to ensure the safe operation of the system.\n\nThe personnel who manage, operate, and maintain the facility are trained to observe all precautions required to safely handle ammonia at the facility.  This not only minimizes their exposure to a hazardous chemical, it also minimizes the threat to nearby members of the surrounding community.\n\nThe facility is staffed 24 hrs a day and the personnel are trained in the use of emergency response equipment to minimize a chemical release at the facility.  Our emergency response and preparedness plan includes procedures for notifying the County Emer"
