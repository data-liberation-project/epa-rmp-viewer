The PHA is updated at least every 5 years or when significant changes occur.  A team composed of personnel with engineering process operating experience, and a leader with process hazard analyses experience is assembled to analyze the hazards of each process.  PHA What-If Questions and a Hazard Review Checklist were used to perform the analysis (see Appendix C).  Responsibility to resolve the recommendations is assigned to unit personnel and, when appropriate, changes to enhance the safety of the processes are implemented.  The PHA team incorporated information from the site inspection into the responses on the PHA What-If Questions and the Hazard Review Checklist in Appendix C.  \n\n1.5.2\tOperating Procedures (Appendix D)\n\nCOSL operators and superintendents work together to develop and maintain operating procedures to define how tasks related to process operations should be safely performed.

The training programs for the operators cover the properties of the substances and the hazards of those substances.  The training programs also include orientation to the layout and operation of the chlorine process for that facility and, for WWTP operators, the sulfur dioxide process.  As of the publication date of this RMP, all the current full-time WWTP operators have had at least three semesters of relevant education in the water technology program at Shasta College for wastewater treatment operation.

Process changes that are determined to be a replacement in kind (e.g., replacing a valve with an identical valve) are allowed without implementing the full Management of Change program.\n\nAll major changes to processes must be confirmed through the Management of Change program, in order to ensure that inadvertent consequences of process changes are prevented, safety consequences of changes are addressed, affected process safety information and procedures are updated, and affected employees are notified of the changes.\n\n1.5.7\tCompliance Audit (Appendix I)\n\nCOSL conducted a Compliance Audit on June 20, 2002.  That audit covered the processes to determine whether the prevention program is effectively addressing the safety issues of the operations.

Personnel who perform hot work within the chlorine gas process or sulfur dioxide process areas are required to fill out the Hot Work Permit Form.  The supervisors review the completed forms before work can commence.

These features are further described in the following paragraphs.\n\nAt both facilities, chlorine is stored in DOT-approved cylinders, which are supplied by Sierra Chemical (1-800-777-8965).  Sulfur dioxide at the WWTP is also stored in DOT-approved cylinders, which are supplied by Sierra Chemical.  COSL employs certified chlorine process control companies and engineers to design, maintain, and service COSL\u00bfs chlorine control systems and related equipment, as well as their sulfur dioxide control systems and related equipment.  The systems are maintained every 2 years.  Maintenance was performed on the chlorine and sulfur dioxide systems in June 2004.  This preventative maintenance program is ongoing.  Repairs are completed and/or new equipment is installed, if existing equipment is found to be defective or worn.  In February 2004, the manufacturer\u00bfs authorized service representative replaced circuit board in the controller for the sulfonator in the sulfur dioxide system.

      "SummaryText": "1.0\tExecutive Summary\n\nCOSL is committed to operating in a manner that is safe for its employees, the public, and the environment.  As part of this commitment, COSL has established a system to help ensure safe operation of the processes at these facilities.  One component of this system is a risk management program that is designed to manage the risks at COSL\u00bfs facilities.  Additionally, this RMP complies with all requirements of the California Accidental Release (CalARP), and the Cal/OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standards, and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) requirements.\n\nThe RMP at COSL consists of three elements:\n1.\tA hazard assessment to aid in understanding the potential off-site consequences of hypothetical accidental releases, and accidents that have occurred during the past five years associated with the use of substances regulated by the RMP rule.\n2.\tA prevention program to assist in maintaining and safely operating any processes containing more than a threshold quantity of a regulated substance.\n3.\tAn emergency response program to help respond to an accidental release of regulated substances from the covered processes.\nInformation further describing these elements is provided in this Risk Management Plan.\n\nAlthough the Risk Management Plan (RMP) at the COSL helps provide assurance that the WWTP and WTP facilities are maintained and operated in a safe manner, it is only one component of their overall safety program.  In fact, COSL has a comprehensive safety program in place establishing many levels of safeguards against the release of a hazardous substance, and injuries and damage resulting from a release of a hazardous substance.  COSL has a Safety Director who reviews relevant regulations and initiates safety committee walkthroughs.\n\nCOSL has limited its use of hazardous substances at its facilities.  Before using a hazardous substance at COSL, less hazardous alternatives are considered.  When a hazardous substance is used, COSL consid"
