THE MAXIMUM QUANTITY RELEASED WOULD BE 80,000 POUNDS\n          WHICH REPRESENTS THE VOLUME OF THE STORAGE TANK AT 85 PERCENT CAPACITY\n          AS LIMITED BY DESIGNS STANDARDS. THE DISTANCE TO THE ENDPOINT (POINT OF DISPERSION\n          TO 200 PPM) IS .94 MILES.\n\n          B. THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO FOR ANHYDROUS AMMONIA BASED ON THE\n          DISTANCE TO THE ENDPOINT IS .78 MILES.\n\n        4.
