The procedures are for the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address notification of local emergency response agencies if a release occurs.  Employees receive training in emergency procedures.  The emergency procedure is updated when necessary based on modifications made to the terminal facilities.   \r\n\r\nThe overall emergency procedure program for Chaparral Gas Plant is coordinated with the Eddy County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC). This coordination will include periodic meetings with the committee, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials and industry representatives.  The Chaparral Gas Plant will institute any necessary around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials similar to those already in place for contacting the local fire department. This will provide a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident. In addition to the planned periodic LEPC meetings, the Chaparral Gas Plant conducts periodic reviews of emergency procedures with the fire department emergency response organization.\r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\r\n\r\nThe Chaparral Gas Plant resolves all findings from PHAs, some of which result in modifications to the process.  Other recommendations for possible changes to improve safety come from periodic accident prevention program audits, incident investigations, or employee suggestions and recommendations.  The following changes are planned for implementation at the Chaparral Gas Plant.\r\n\r\n* No planned changes."

As part of the Enterprise safety program, the facility utilizes procedures that are included in the Enterprise program, but may not specifically be required at non-PSM and/or RMP Program 1 facilities (e.g. Safe work practice training; safe work permitting and hot work permitting).\r\n\r\nUniversal Prevention Activities\r\n\r\nThe accident prevention program summarized previously is applied to all RMP covered processes at Chaparral Gas Plant.  Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human errors.\r\n\r\nSpecialized Safety Features\r\n\r\nThe Chaparral Gas Plant has safety features on many units to help contain/control a release, to quickly detect a release and reduce the consequence of a release.  The following types of safety features are used in the covered processes:\r\n\r\nRelease Detection\r\n\r\n*Hydrocarbon (hazardous gas) detectors and alarms\r\n*Plant video surveillance system\r\n\r\nRelease Containment and Control\r\n\r\n*Process relief valves that discharge to a flare to capture and incinerate episodic releases.\r\n*Valves to permit isolation of the process (manual or automated).\r\n*Automatic shutdown systems for specific process parameters (e.g., high temperature).\r\n*Curbs or dikes to contain liquid releases.\r\n*Redundant equipment and instrumentation (e.g., uninterruptible power supply for process control system)\r\n\r\nRelease Mitigation\r\n\r\n*Hand-held fire extinguishers\r\n*Personnel trained in emergency response and procedures.\r\n*Personnel protective equipment (e.g., chemical protective clothing, self-contained breathing apparatus, etc.)\r\n\r\nFive Year Accident History\r\n\r\nRecords are kept for all significant accidental chemical releases that occur at our facility.

We have entered the facility as an RMP Program Level 1 facility.\r\n\r\nToxics\r\n\r\nThere are no toxic materials contained on site above the threshold limits.\r\n\r\nFlammables\r\n\r\nThe Chaparral Gas Plant was evaluated to determine if any regulated flammable substances exceeded the threshold quantity.  Enterprise identified the regulated substances and quantities to be kept on site based on the process design of the proposed process vessels. Listed flammable substances which are present above the threshold quantities at the Chaparral Gas Plant are natural gas (methane), ethane, propane, iso-butane, normal butane, iso-pentane and pentane. The Plant is designed to operate unattended, seven days per week, with occasional shutdowns for major equipment maintenance.  There are no other gas processing, gas compression or industrial facilities nearby.  Due to the presence of regulated flammable materials above the threshold quantity, the Chaparral Gas Plant is being registered as an EPA Risk Management Program 1 facility.\r\n\r\nOffsite Consequence Analysis Results\r\n\r\nThe offsite consequence analysis will not be reflected in the executive summary but rather is reflected in the data components.  There are flammable substances on site and no toxic substances above the threshold quantity.\r\n\r\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program\r\n\r\nThe following is a summary of the accidental release prevention program in place at Chaparral Gas Plant.  The process at the facility is regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) regulation (Program 1).  Release prevention is provided through the use of written operating procedures, employee training in written procedures, including normal operation and emergency release procedures, and in the design of safety and release prevention equipment installed at the terminal site.

The mixed hydrocarbon liquid stream (Y-Grade product) is treated to remove carbon dioxide and is pumped as a mixed product via pipeline to fractionation facilities elsewhere. The plant discharge gas stream (residue gas) flows from the plant via a residue gas pipeline to market.\r\n\r\nThe process is regulated by Federal OSHA 29"
