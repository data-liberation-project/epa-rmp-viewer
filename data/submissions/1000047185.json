Original operations initiated in October 2007.  ICMB will review on-site plans on a regular basis and updates them when necessary.  There has been management changes at the facility, but none that have affected the responsible official. \r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICIES:\r\nICMB has a commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated in the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel as well as considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the facility. ICMB has emergency response policies in place that are addressed in the facility's Health and Safety (H&S) Plan, SPCC/FRP, and Emergency Action Plan. Most of the listed plans have a minimum of annual training requirements in order to keep employees educated on emergency response procedures in place at the facility. Annual training is also a good time to discuss any situations at the facility the occurred over the previous year that the helped the plant gain knowledge on how to better address chemicals or spill practices. New employees are required to undergo training on the plans listed above prior to initiating responsibilities onsite. If job duties warrant, new employees may also be required to read through the plans, as well. ICMB's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, plant personnel will follow the applicable procedures outlined in the SPCC/FRP, Industrial SWPPP, and H&S Plans to respond to, contain, clean-up, and properly dispose of the release.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED:\r\nICM"

      "SummaryText": "B is located in St. Joseph, Buchanan County, Missouri. The facility operates 24 hours per day, 7 days per week for the purpose of manufacturing fuel grade ethanol from corn.  The regulated substances under the RMP program are Anhydrous Ammonia and Denaturant (also known as natural gasoline which is a flammable mixture). \r\n\r\nWORST CASE AND ALTERNATIVE CASE SCENARIOS:\r\nWorst Case Scenarios:\r\nAnhydrous Ammonia - Anhydrous ammonia is stored as a gas liquefied by pressure in an aboveground steel tank. The worst case scenario used is a release of the entire contents of the storage tank, creating a toxic vapor cloud. A determination spreadsheet is included as part of the RMP documentation file at the facility, detailing the conversion from gallons to pounds of ammonia. RMP Comp was used to determine the worst case distance to endpoint; the model results were 3.3 mile radius. The ammonia tank sits on a concrete pad, passive mitigation was not included as part of this scenario. The facility does have a chain link fence around the ammonia tank for security purposes, but the fence would not prevent migration of a release. Population data was obtained using CAPS and public receptor information was obtained using Google Earth as well as facility's knowledge of the surrounding area. There are residences and several schools within the worst case distance to endpoint. The Missouri River is also located within the worst case distance to endpoint for ammonia.\r\nFlammable Mixture (Denaturant) - The flammable mixture stored onsite is natural gasoline, otherwise referred to as denaturant. Natural gasoline is used onsite to denature 200 proof ethanol prior to shipment off-site. Denaturant is stored in an aboveground internal floating roof steel tank within the tank farm. The tank farm is located within a lined berm with gravel overlay for means of secondary containment. A worst case natural gasoline MSDS was used to determine RMP applicability and for RMP Comp modeling. The breakdown of r"

The worst case scenario used is the release of the entire contents of the denaturant tank, causing a vapor cloud explosion. Of the entire tank contents, only a portion is reportable under CAA Section 112(r). RMP Comp was used to determine the worst case distance to endpoint; the model results were 0.5 mile radius. Population data was obtained using CAPS and public receptor information was obtained using Google Earth as well as facility's knowledge of the surrounding area.  There are no environmental receptors within the worst case distance to endpoint for denaturant.\r\nAlternate Case Scenarios:\r\nAnhydrous Ammonia - The alternate scenario used for anhydrous ammonia is a release due to a rupture disk/relief valve failure from the ammonia piping system. This scenario is considered the most likely cause of an ammonia release onsite. The alternate release duration assumed is 30 minutes with an atmospheric stability of D and wind speed of 3.0 m/sec. The facility control room is manned 24 hours per day and would be alerted of a relief valve failure at the ammonia tank within minutes. RMP Comp was used to determine the alternate distance to endpoint, model results were 0.1 mile radius. Population data was obtained using CAPS and public receptor information was obtained using Google Earth as well as facility's knowledge of the surrounding area. No environmental receptors would be affected by an alternate case release of ammonia.\r\n\r\nFlammable Mixture (Denaturant) - The alternate scenario used for the flammable mixture is the release of natural gasoline due to a tanker truck loadout spill, causing a vapor cloud fire. RMP Comp was used to estimate the distance to the overpressure endpoint of 1 psi. Model results are included under ICMB's RMP documentation file. Of the entire tanker contents, only a portion was used in the RMP Comp model run to do the breakdown of regulated co"

      "SummaryText": "nstituents under Section 112(r). Denaturant deliveries at the facility typically occur during normal business hours with a facility staff member overseeing off-loading if possible. Therefore, a release at the loadout area could be ceased within minutes by manual overrides. The loadout area also has a catchment system with underground piping that leads to the tank farm berm. For this scenario passive and active mitigation was not considered, as the mitigation strategies currently in place at ICMB would not contain a vapor cloud fire. Population data was obtained using CAPS and public receptor information was obtained using Google Earth as well as facility's knowledge of the surrounding area. No environmental receptors would be affected by an alternate case release of denaturant.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe facility qualifies as a Program 3 due to the close proximity of public receptors, and the being applicable to process safety management (PSM).\r\n\r\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS:\r\nGeneral accidental release prevention programs in place at the ICMB facility are described in earlier portions of this Executive Summary and in the Industrial SWPPP and SPCC/FRP plans onsite. As part of training, employees participate in drills and exercises in order to test responsiveness to releases of chemicals onsite. These drills and exercises are evaluated by ICMB management to determine if any additional training or education is required.\r\n\r\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\r\nThere have been no accidents since the establishment of the ethanol facility.\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION:\r\nICMB has several safety programs in place at the facility that incorporate emergency response, including a Health and Safety Plan.  A SPCC and FRP have been prepared and implemented in accordance with applicable regulatory standards.  FRP regulations require exercises of internal and external notification systems on a semiannual to annual basis.\r\n\r\nPLANNED CHANGE"

There are no planned changes to improve safety at the ICMB facility at this time."
