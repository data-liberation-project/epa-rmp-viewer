      "SummaryText": "Union Gas Operating Company (Union) owns and operates the Petty #1 Production Facility.  The Petty #1 Production Facility receives production from area oil and gas wells via flowline. The production is treated to separate gas, water and condensate. The gas is further processed through a cryogenic process involving the rapid temperature and pressure change via a Joule-Thompson (JT) valve which condenses the lighter hydrocarbons, including methane, ethane, propane, butane and pentane, to condense forming a Natural Gas Liquid (NGL) product. The NGL product is stored in a pressurized bullet tank with a volume of 18,000 gallons and operating pressure of ~150 psi.\n\nA total rupture of the 18,000 gallon NGL tank resulting in a vapor cloud explosion would pose the worse-case scenario for the Petty #1 Production Facility. The 18,000 gallon tank has been evaluated for total tank rupture using the RMP*Comp offsite consequence analysis resulting in a distance to endpoint of 0.3 miles. No public receptors are within a 0.3 mile radius of the NGL tank. The worst-case scenario would not affect anyone within the endpoint of the off-site consequence analysis. Therefore, this RMP has been evaluated for a Program 1 level RMP under 40 CFR 68. The Petty #1 Production Facility is located in a remote area and is not normally occupied.\n\nThe facility has no accident history to report. Should an emergency involving the Petty #1 Production FacilityA?s NGL system occur, it is UnionA?s policy to notify the Kountze Volunteer Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency. This policy has been discussed with the fire department.\n"
