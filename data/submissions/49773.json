No Program 1 or 2 processes containing regulated substances were identified at the refinery. Our accidental release prevention programs and emergency planning and response programs help us effectively manage the hazards posed by our regulated substances to our employees, the public, and the environment. \n\nB.    GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION MEASURES\n\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention programs in place at Eagle Point Refinery.  The covered process at the refinery is regulated by the EPA RMP regulation 40 CFR Part 68, as well as NJDEP Toxic Catastrophe Prevention Act program N.J.A.C. 7:31 (1-6) and the OSHA Process Safety Management standard 29CFR 1910.119.  The following summary addresses the combined elements of these three programs and describes the activities surrounding the implementation of each element. These programs constitute the framework by which process safety and accident prevention are managed in the refinery.  \n\n1.    Employee Participation\n\nThe Eagle Point Refinery involves employees in the programs developed to support process safety management and accident prevention.  Employees are included in every element of the program, from development, to active participation, to program updates.  They are members of the process hazard analysis (PHA) team, the compliance audit team and make up the safety and emergency response teams. They implement the mechanical integrity, operator training and contractor safety programs.  Employees have access to information created as part of this accident prevention program.   \n\n2.    Process Safety Information\n\nProcess Safety Information (PSI) is compiled for each process unit and is made available to all personnel "

PSI includes information pertaining to the hazards of the highly hazardous chemicals used or produced by the process, information pertaining to the technology of the process, and information pertaining to the equipment in the process.  This information is essential for supporting all of the other elements of our accidental release prevention programs. \n\n3.    Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) with Risk Assessments\n\nProcess Hazards Analyses (PHAs) are performed by experienced employee teams for each covered process unit. Our PHA teams are composed of personnel with engineering and process operating experience and a trained PHA team leader. Studies are conducted according to an established schedule, and each study is updated/revalidated at least every five years (or more often if necessary because of process changes). These comprehensive studies systematically review each unit to identify and assess hazards in the design or operation of the units.  Additional controls are recommended for any unmitigated hazards that are identified. Results of the PHAs are documented in reports that are made available to personnel. \n\n4.    Standard Operating Procedures\n\nWritten standard operating procedures are developed and implemented for all refinery process units.  The procedures, written by experienced operating personnel and reviewed by a technical committee, describe the detailed steps to carry out the principal modes of operation and are designed and implemented for a safe, reliable and environmentally sound operation. Procedures are used to (1) train our personnel before they perform tasks in the field, (2) serve as reference guides for personnel performing tasks, (3) specify what to do if a process upset or operating emergency occurs and (4) provide reference guides in the startup and shutdown of equipment. These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and acc"

The investigation team then recommends and implements additional controls in order to mitigate hazards associated with the incident.  Incident causes are tracked, trended and published by the Safety Department.  The published reports are shared with employees and relevant findings are communicated throughout the Sunoco organization.\n\n11.    Hot Work Permits\n\nHot work permits are issued for any work that could create a source of ignition on or near process units. The hot work permit program ensures that OSHA's fire prevention and protection precautions, specified in 29 CFR 1910.252(a), are in place before hot work (work involving electric or gas welding, cutting, brazing, or similar flame or spark-producing operation) begins on or near a process unit. The permit describes work being performed, authorized dates and all fire prevention and protection requirements.       \n\n12.    Contractors\n\nContractors are employed to supplement the refinery?s work force during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities. A contractor screening procedure is used to help ensure that contractors are hired who accomplish the desired job tasks without compromising the safety and health of employees, the public, or the environment.  Safety regulations are sent with all bid packages, and an evaluation of the contractor safety record and training program is used in selecting a contracting company.
