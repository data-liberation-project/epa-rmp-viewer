If an accidental release occurs, UAP Northeast is prepared to cooperate with the local Fire Department, LEPC, and other authorities to mitigate the release and minimize the impact to the surrounding community and environment.\n\nThe only operations at this facility are the storage and retail dispensing of anhydrous ammonia to local farmers as a nitrogen fertilizer nutrient.\n\nFACILITY INFORMATION\nThe maximum quantity of product stored in only (1) 30,000-gallon tank is approximately 132,000 pounds (85% capacity limited by design standards).  Farmers transfer the product into their mobile 1000-gallon nurse tanks, which are returned immediately to their farm for land application.\n\nWORST CASE RELEASE\nThe worst-case release would be the release of the entire contents of the storage tank over a 10-minute period.    The distance to the toxic endpoint would be 6.9 miles.\n\nALTERNATIVE RELEASE\nThe alternative release is based on a transfer hose failure over a 2-minute period before manual shut-off occurs.  The distance to the toxic endpoint would be 1.3 miles.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE AND PREVTION PROGRAM\nThis facility utilizes accepted operating practices for anhydrous ammonia operations. The Emergency Response Plan details the steps necessary to respond to a release, including notifying the LEPC.\n\nACCIDENT HISTORY\nThere has not been an accident at this facility within the last 5 years.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN\nAn Emergency Response Plan has been implemented and authorities will be notified in the event of a release.  The Emergency Response Plan is distributed annually to the Fire Department and LEPC with the Tier 2 report.\n\nPLANNED CH"
