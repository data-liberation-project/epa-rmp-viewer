      "SummaryText": "RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nElkhorn Valley Ethanol, LLC\n\n\n\nElkhorn Valley Ethanol, LLC (EVE) is a fully operational ethanol production facility which began operations in September 2007.  At that time, EVE submitted an RMP for the facility in accordance with 40 CFR Part 68. Elkhorn Valley Ethanol, LLC is designed to produce approximately 50,000,000 gallons of fuel-grade ethanol per year. Dried, modified wet and wet distillers grains (DDGS/MWDGS/WDGS) are byproducts of ethanol production and are sold to local markets as animal feed. Ethanol production activities fall under the SIC code 2869, Industrial Chemicals, Not Elsewhere Classified.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Response Policies\n\n\n\nEVE is committed to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by EVE's investment in accident prevention, through the establishment of a facility that is well designed, installed, operated and maintained. In addition, training is considered a crucial part of safe operation and accident prevention. Staff is trained about spill prevention and control methods as well as emergency response plans in place at the facility.\n\n\n\nIt is EVE policy to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances and if a release does occur, plant personnel will respond to contain the release as necessary. EVE management is dedicated to safety, spill prevention and proper emergency response.\n\n\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nThe EVE Ethanol Plant is located approximately three miles northeast of Norfolk, Madison County, Nebraska. The site is located in Section 12, Township 24 North, and Range 1 West of Madison County, Nebraska. The site consists of approximately 53 acres and is bounded by North Victory Road to the west, by a county drainage ditch to the south, and by undeveloped lands to the north and east. The Chicago and Northwestern railroads run through the northwest corner of the facility.\n\n\n\nThe fa"

      "SummaryText": "cility operates 24 hours per day, 7 days per week for the purpose of manufacturing fuel grade ethanol from corn.  The substances which EVE has onsite that are regulated by the RMP program are Anhydrous Ammonia and Denaturant (natural gasoline) which is considered a flammable mixture.  The anhydrous ammonia is used as a chemical processing aid and is consumed in the manufacturing process. It is stored in a single anhydrous ammonia tank. The denaturant (natural gasoline) is used to denature the ethanol so that it is unfit for human consumption before being shipped offsite. Denaturant is generally stored onsite in the denaturant and final product storage tanks.\n\n\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\n\n\nEVE has been subject to RMP criteria since it began storing anhydrous ammonia and denaturant (natural gasoline) onsite.\n\n\n\nIn the last five years, EVE has had no reportable accidents.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program Information\n\n\n\nEVE is included in the Norfolk Community Emergency Response Plan and therefore does not have its own Emergency Response Plan for emergencies requiring a high level of emergency support. In the case that an incident occurred which required high level emergency response, EVE would call 911 for the necessary fire, medical or other emergency support.\n\n \n\nAs explained above, EVE is commited to worker and public safety and has invested in training and equipment to prevent chemical spills and other emergency situations. In the event of a chemical spill, plant personnel would respond to contain the release, as necessary. \n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\n\n\nEVE is subject to RMP Prevention Program Level 3.  EVE is fullfiling its duties to comply with the EPA requirements of 40 CFR Part 68.115(d) through the completion of this RMP and similar efforts regulated by OSHA's Process Safety Management standard (29 CFR 1910.119).  EVE has complied with Process safety information, safe work practices such as Hot Work, Confined Space Entry and Lockout/Tagou"

Periodic functions such as process hazard analyses (PHA), training, management of change, pre-startup safety reviews, and incident investigation are conducted on a regular basis.  \n\n\n\nThe denaturant tank is equipped with tank level sensors and alarms as well as a bermed containment structure that surrounds the entire tank farm.  The anhydrous ammonia tank is equipped with a manual shut off valve.  These chemical specific prevention measures minimize the risk for an RMP reportable incident.  Compliance audits of the RMP Prevention Program will be conducted on a regular basis to assure compliance with EPA and OSHA regulations. \n\n\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nAs previously mentioned, EVE is committed to protecting its employees, the greater community and the environment from the release of hazardous substances used in the ethanol fuel production process. EVE management is committed to promoting a safe work environment and will continue to provide its employees with the necessary training, tools, and ongoing support to operate the ethanol production facility in a safe and efficient manner. Periodic audits will help EVE assure that they are doing everything reasonable to minimize the risk of and mitigate the effects of an accidental release.\n\n"
