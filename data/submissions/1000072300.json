This commitment is demonstrated by our efforts in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, facility trained personnel will evaluate the situation, take actions within the capabilities of the facility, and/or notify the necessary outside agencies.\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n\n\nThe Chattanooga Propane Terminal is located at 530 Manufacturers Road, just east of U.S. Highway No. 27 in Chattanooga, Tennessee.  The Chattanooga Propane Terminal provides storage and terminal operations for propane.  Propane is typically delivered to the facility via railcar, stored in 90,000 gallon storage vessels, and shipped out via 3rd party transports.  The propane is odorized while being loaded onto the transports.\n\n\n\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\n\n\n\nSeveral storage vessels within the facility process were evaluated for the worst case and alternative release scenarios.  Results of the worst case release scenario indicate that the process is subject to RMP Program Level 3 requirements.  Details of the worst case and alternative release scenarios are included with the backup documentation associated with this RMP plan.\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe process at the Chattanooga Propane Terminal is regulated by both the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) risk management program (RMP) rule and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) process safety management (PSM) standard.  \n\n\n\nThis facility has implemented the PSM elements to facili"

Process hazard analysis evaluates hazards against safeguards needed to mitigate likelihood of an accidental release. Process changes are managed through the management of change procedure, by considering the impact that a change will have on the rest of the process.  For new or significantly changed processes, a pre-startup safety review is conducted as a final check to enable safe start up.  \n\n\n\nThe employee participation program promotes the development of necessary expertise, experiences, judgment, and proactive initiative within the workforce.  A comprehensive training program ensures that employees are knowledgeable about the processes they are responsible to operate and control.  Operating procedures explain correct startup, operation and shutdown procedures for various equipment in the process.  The hot work program is in place to promote safety of jobs involving potential ignition sources.  The mechanical integrity program ensures that equipment is maintained inspected and tested for ongoing safety.  A contractor safety evaluation program is in place to ensure hire of contractors that will not compromise job or facility safety.   \n\n\n\nThe facility has a policy of investigating every incident, which may have possibly resulted in a release, in order to prevent a similar accident from recurring.  The facility has established an audit procedure to assure the continued integrity of the prevention program.  \n\n\n\nSPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nThe process at the Chattanooga Propane Terminal has potential hazards that must be managed for continued safe operation.  The following is a description of existing safety features applicable to prevention of accidental releases of regulated substance in the facility.\n\n\n\nUniversal Prevention Activities\n\n\n\nThe accident prevention program summarized previously is"

Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human errors.\n\n\n\nSpecialized Safety Features\n\n\n\nThe Chattanooga Propane Terminal has safety features to provide a means of containing/controlling a release, detecting a release, and reducing the consequences of (mitigate) a release.  The following types of safety features are used in the RMP-covered process:\n\n\n\nMonitoring and detection systems include (1) hydrocarbon gas detectors to detect the presence of hydrocarbon, (2) operations personnel on site 24 hours per day providing routine surveillance, (3) camera surveillance from the control room, (4) audible and visual warning alarms, and (5) distributed control system (DCS) providing real-time monitoring and control.\n\n\n\nProcess controls include (1) relief devices to avoid overpressure of process equipment, (2) valves to permit process control or isolation (manual or automated), (3) interlocks and automated shutdown systems for specific process parameters (e.g., high temperatures, pressure, level, etc.), and (4) redundant equipment and instrumentation.\n\n\n\nActive and passive mitigation systems include (1) fire suppression and extinguishing system, (2) emergency procedures to react to emergencies, (3) curbing or diking for spill prevention and control, and (4) communications link with local emergency planning committee (LEPC).\n\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nThe Chattanooga Propane Terminal has an excellent record of accident prevention.  There have been no RMP-reportable accidents over the past 5 years.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThis facility is a non-responding facility and has coordinated with the local fire department for response to large accidental releases.  As a non-responding facility, the RMP emergency response program and emergency response plan requirements (40 CFR 68.95) are not applicable"

However, the facility does maintain an emergency response plan that serves as guidance for facility employees to notify first responders, secure critical operations before evacuation, evacuate the facility, and account for personnel, among other items.  Facility personnel are trained in procedures and use of equipment appropriate to their role in response to small accidental releases.\n\n\n\nMANAGEMENT SYSTEM\n\n\n\nThe Director of Terminal Operations has overall responsibility for the development, implementation, and integration of the risk management program at this facility.  Specific responsibilities are summarized in the back up documentation associated with this RMP plan.\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nThe facility personnel are continually developing ways to improve the safety of the facility.  This is done through responsibility matrices and training which is a vital part of any safety program.  Training is conducted according to a systematic schedule.  All new and modified equipment is designed with approved safety controls and devices.  Additionally, the facility will consider all safety measures resulting from safety audits, PHA's and safety meetings to mitigate potential accidents and to improve safety.\n\n"
