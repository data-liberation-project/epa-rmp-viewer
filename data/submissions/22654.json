      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n \nThe City of Weslaco Wastewater Treatment Plant accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates technologies, procedures, and management practices.  The Weslaco emergency response policy involves the preparation of a response plan that is tailored to each facility and to the emergency response services available in the community.  The policy adheres to EPA Prevention Program procedures where applicable, and is in compliance with EPA Emergency Response Program requirements.  \n\nThe City of Weslaco Wastewater Treatment Plant is located at 907 N. Airport , in Weslaco, Hidalgo County, Texas.  The chlorination building at the wastewater treatment facility consists of a two walled canopy structure facing north that is located approximately in the middle of the facility. Three 1-ton cylinders of chlorine are stored in the facility.  Only two 1-ton containers are connected to the system at one time.  These are located inside the walled canopy structure.  One 1-ton cylinder is operational and the other one is used as backup.  The chlorine containers have manual shutoff valves in case of an emergency and a chlorine alarm will be triggered if a release occurs.  Emergency air supply and power are available.  The facility is manned 24-hours a day, and operators check the chlorination building daily.  Self-Contained-Breathing-Apparatus (SCBA) are stored in the office and workroom located approximately 100 ft. and 200 ft. away from the chlorination building, respectively. \n\nThe offsite consequence analysis for the wastewater treatment includes consideration of two different release scenarios for each of the parameters of concern (chlorine): 1) A \"Worst Case Release\"; and 2) an \"Alternative Scenario\".  The Worst Case Release is defined by EPA guidance which states that \"the owner or operator shall assume that the ... maximum quantity in the largest vessel... is released as a gas over 10 minutes,\" due to an unspecified failure.

      "SummaryText": "Alternative Scenario is defined as \"more likely to occur than the worst-case release scenario.\" \n\nAtmospheric dispersion modeling has to be performed to determine the distance traveled by a parameter of concern before its concentration decreases to the \"toxic endpoint\".  The toxic endpoints are defined by the EPA as 0.0087 mg/L for chlorine. These values correspond to the Emergency Response Planning Guidelines Level 2 (ERPG-2) concentrations which are defined by the American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA) as:\n\n\" The maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to one-hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects or symptoms which could impair an individual's ability to take protection action.\"  \n\nThe estimated population potentially affected by the release is defined as the residential population within a circle with a radius corresponding to the toxic endpoint distance.\n\nThe Worst Case Release Scenario at the Weslaco Wastewater Treatment Plant was defined by the following conditions:\n\nFailure of 2 one-ton containers resulting in the total release of 4,000 pounds of chlorine;\n\nRelease of the entire amount as a gas in 10 minutes;\n\nUse of the one-hour average ERPG-2 as the toxic endpoint;\n\nConsideration of the population residing within a full circle with radius corresponding to the toxic endpoint distance; and\n\nEPA mandated meteorological conditions, specifically an F atmospheric stability class, wind speed of 1.5 m/sec, and air temperature of 77\u00baF.\n\nAtmospheric dispersion modeling for the Worst Case Release scenario resulted in a chlorine toxic endpoint distance of 1.3 miles and an estimated residential population potentially affected of 22,224 persons.
