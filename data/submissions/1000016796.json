Health, safety and environmental compliance are a fundamental part of every employee's job. It is\n\nfacility protocol to adhere to applicable Federal, State and local laws and to implement appropriate controls\n\nto prevent accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release were to occur, the facility\n\nwould respond in accordance with its Emergency Action Plan and is prepared to work with the local fire\n\ndepartment, the Local Emergency Planning Committee and other authorities to control and mitigate the\n\nrelease and minimize the impact of the release to employees, the environment and the general public.\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled: The primary activity at this facility (the stationary\n\nsource) is the storage and handling of fertilizers for direct retail sale to farmers. Anhydrous ammonia is\n\nreceived, stored and distributed for direct application as crop production nutrients.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps: This facility complies\n\nwith EPA's accidental release prevention requirements and applicable State and local codes and regulations.\n\nThe following sections briefly describe the elements of the facility's release prevention program.\n\n1) Safety Information: The facility was designed and constructed in accordanc\n\ne with applicable Federal and State regulations. All plans and procedures maintained at the facility are\n\nperiodically reviewed by facility management for safety updates and changes. Material Safety Data Sheets,\n\nequipment specifications and the codes and standards used to build and operate the anhydrous ammonia\n\nequipment are maintained at the facility.\n\n2) Hazard Review: Facility management conducts reviews "

      "SummaryText": "of the hazards associated with the handling and\n\nstorage of anhydrous ammonia. The reviews identify the opportunity for equipment malfunctions or human\n\nerrors that could cause an accidental release, the safeguards used to control hazards and prevent releases,\n\nand the steps used to detect or monitor releases. The results of the reviews are documented and problems\n\nidentified are addressed in a timely manner.\n\n3) Operating Procedures: The facility maintains written operating procedures for the handling and storage of\n\nanhydrous ammonia. The procedures generally follow the provisions of the Occupation Safety and Health\n\nAdministration (OSHA) standard, 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\" and the\n\nAmerican National Standards Institute (ANSI) standard, \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\". The written procedures are reviewed by facility management on a regular\n\nbasis and revised as necessary.\n\n4) Training: All employees at the facility that handle anhydrous ammonia participate in a training program.\n\nInitial training for new employees consists of classroom type instruction (e.g., reading safety information,\n\noperating procedures and response measures) and on-the-job supervision. Refresher training for all\n\nemployees is conducted annually. The training program is reviewed by facility management on a regular basis\n\nand revised as necessary.\n\n5) Maintenance: The facility maintains written equipment inspection and maintenance procedures. Storage\n\nand transfer/process equipment inspections are performed by qualified personnel on an approximate annual\n\nbasis and are documented. Equipment maintenance procedures follow either instructions furnished by the\n\nequipment vendors, Federal or State regulations (i.e., the provisions of the OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.111,\n\n\"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\") or industry codes (i.e., the provisions of the ANSI standard,\n\n\"Safety Requirements for the Storage and"

      "SummaryText": " Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\"). The written procedures\n\nare reviewed by facility management on a regular basis and revised as necessary.\n\n6) Compliance Audits: As required by the RMP rule, compliance audits will be performed at least once every\n\nthree (3) years. The audit will be documented and conducted by a person knowledgeable in the safe handling\n\nand storage of anhydrous ammonia. Corrective actions required as a result of each compliance audit will be\n\nperformed promptly and documented.\n\n7) Incident Investigation: Facility management will investigate each incident that results in, or could have\n\nreasonably resulted in a catastrophic release of anhydrous ammonia. The investigation will be performed to\n\nidentify the situation leading to the incident as well as corrective actions to prevent the release from\n\nreoccurring. Investigation reports will be retained for five years.\n\nFive-Year Accident History: There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five (5)\n\nyears that caused deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor, to our knowledge,\n\nresulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental\n\ndamage.\n\nEmergency Response Program: In the event of an emergency, it is facility protocol to notify the local fire\n\ndepartment and other emergency responders and request that they respond to the emergency. Facility\n\nemployees will not respond to accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia except for those that are small or\n\nincidental, can be controlled at the time of the release by employees in the immediate release area (e.g.,\n\nshutting a valve) and do not appear to pose an immediate safety or health hazard. This protocol has been\n\ndiscussed with the local fire department and the other emergency responders and the facility has appropriate\n\nmechanisms in place to notify the emergency responders when there is a need for a response.
