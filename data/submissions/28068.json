We have received awards from the government and industrial groups for our efforts to maintain the safest possible operations.  As an OSHA Star site, we have been recognized by the federal government as a company that puts the highest priority on safety.   Our primary focus is to provide safe operations without upset.  We do this through prevention and planning during all phases of operation: design, production, and maintenance.  Examples of emergency equipment that we have include automatic fire water systems, emergency shutdown systems, containment systems, and monitors to detect leaks.  Our processes are controlled by a sophisticated computer control system.  We also have well trained personnel to oversee our operations and prevent accidents.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, our personnel will respond to, control, and contain the release.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe Westlake Petrochemicals site is located in Carlyss, south of Sulphur.  It is comprised of several individual operating facilities.  All facilities are located on a contiguous site.  There are two petrochemical units that receive ethane and/or propane feedstock and produce ethylene and variou"

There is a polyethylene unit that takes ethylene and produces polyethylene plastics and there is a styrene unit that takes ethylene and produces styrene monomer.  Also located on the Petrochemicals site is a loading/unloading facility.  This area is responsible for unloading raw materials used in the various production units as well as loading various side products from the ethylene units.\n\nThe Petrochemicals site has regulated flammable materials such as ethane, ethylene, propylene, hydrogen, 1-butene and pentane.  The site also has chlorine, a regulated toxic substance, which is used for water treatment in these facilities.\n\nWORST CASE (WCS) AND ALTERNATE CASE RELEASE SCENARIOS (ARS)\n\nThe worst case scenario (WCS) associated with a release of a flammable material at the site is the release of the contents of the largest storage tank containing py-gas.   The scenario involves an instantaneous release of the tanks contents, evaporation and dispersion of the material and an ensuing vapor cloud explosion.  This scenario has the potential for off-site impacts.  However, this scenario is considered very unlikely as it assumes the failure of all safeguards, including personnel and equipment.  Py-gas is a mixture of many chemicals.  Only 20% of its makeup includes chemicals on the RMP regulated chemical list.\n\nThe worst case scenario (WCS) associated with the release of a toxic material at the site is the release of chlorine from a pressurized cylinder.  The scenario involves a 10-minute release of the entire cylinder contents followed by dispersion of the material.  This scenario is modeled using stable atmospheric conditions and a low wind speed \u00bf creating the densest cloud.  The scenario has the potential for off-site impact.  \n\nThe alternate case scenario (ACS) associated with the release of a flammable substance at the site is the overpressure caused by the release of ethane from a distilla"

This scenario has the potential for offsite impacts.\n\nThe alternate case scenario (ACS) associated with a release of a toxic substance is the release of liquid chlorine from a cylinder.  The scenario involves the release of the entire cylinder contents due to a broken valve.  The contents then evaporate and disperse.  This scenario is modeled using typical conditions for southwest Louisiana.  This scenario also has potential for off-site impact.\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nWestlake Petrochemicals keeps records of all significant accidental chemical releases that occur at out facility.  Every incident is investigated very carefully to determine ways to prevent similar incidents from occurring.  The following is a brief summary of accidental chemical releases involving material covered under EPA\u00bfs RMP rule for the last 5 years..  This incident history considers offsite impact such as shelter-in-place of the public, injuries to the public, and onsite impacts such as injuries or significant equipment damage.\n\nJanuary 2002 \u00bf A vapor cloud explosion occurred In the vicinity of the cold flare drum when a mechanical failure caused a 30 inch line to rupture.  One contractor was injured but returned to work the same day.  There was also significant equipment damage.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM STEPS\n\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention programs in place at the Westlake Petrochemicals site.  Because processes at the site regulated by the EPA RMP regulation are also subject to the OSHA PSM standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.

Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team.  Employees have access to all information created as part of the site accident prevention program.  Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the site and addresses each program element.  In addition, the site has five committees onsite dedicated to safety (including one specifically dedicated to process safety issues) that include members from various areas of the plant, including operations, maintenance, engineering and plant management.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nThe Petrochemicals site keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.  Many of these documents are available  through a computerized document management system.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters, specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  Specific departments within the plant are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.  A list of reference documents and their location is readily available as part of the written employee participation plan to help employees locate any necessary process safety information.\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDS) that are available to employees through the Mockingbird system and in the central MSDS file.

For specific process areas, the plant has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g. temperature, level, composition, pressure) in data books.  The plant ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g. automated shutdown systems).\n\nThe site also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, etc.  This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nWestlake Petrochemicals has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nThe site primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) method with checklists to perform these evaluations.  The combination of HAZOP and checklists analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating, maintenance and engineering expertise as well as knowledge of the PHA analysis technique being used.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures"

The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not deviate significantly from the original design safety feature, the site periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews re conducted at least every five years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.  Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nThe site maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as unit startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, normal shutdown, and initial startup of a new process.  These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  These procedures are periodically reviewed and certified as current and accurate.  The procedures are maintained current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change and ISO-9002 process.\n\nIn addition, the units maintain a data book that provides guidance on how to respond to upper or lower limit exceedences for specific process or equipment parameters.  This information, along with the operating procedures, is readily available to operators in the process unit and for"

New employees receive basic training in plant operations.  Following successfully completion of this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate (through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted at least every three years.  All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\nContractors\n\nWestlake Petrochemicals uses contractors to supplement its work force during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the site has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner,(2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform site personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.  This is accomplished by providing contractors with a process overview,  information about safety and health hazards,  emergency response plan requirements, and safe work practices prior to their beginning work.  In addition, the site evaluates contractor safety and performance during the selection of a contractor.  Site personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensu"

The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel and the equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready.  The PSSR review team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness.  A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves as a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nWestlake Petrochemicals has well-established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition.  The basic aspects of the program include (1) conducting training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests (4) correcting identified deficiencies, and (5) applying quality assurance measures.  In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process equipment.\n\nMaintenance personnel receive training on an overview of the process, safety and health hazards, applicable maintenance procedures, emergency response plans, and applicable safe work practices to help ensure that they can perform their job in a safe manner.  Written procedures help ensure that work is performed in a consistent manner and provide a basis for training.

If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service (if possible) or a team will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment.\n\nAnother integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance.  The site incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs.  This action helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.\n\nSafe Work Practices\n\nWestlake Petrochemicals has long-standing safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety.  Examples of these include (1) control of entry/presence/exit of support personnel in the units, (2) a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous materials before process piping or equipment is opened, (4) a permit and procedure to control spark-producing activities (i.e. hot work) and (5) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space.  These procedures (and others) along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\n\nManagement of Change\n\nWestlake Petrochemicals has a comprehensive system to manage changes to processes.  This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented.  Changes are reviewed to ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and to verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.

The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent recurrence of the incident or similar incident.  The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to site management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team\u00bfs findings and recommendations are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings.  Incident investigation reports are retained for at least five years so that the reports can be reviewed during future PHAs and PHA revalidations.\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, the site periodically conducts an audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention programs are being implemented.  Compliance audits are conducted at least every three years.  The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to site management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team\u00bfs findings are tracked until they are complete.
