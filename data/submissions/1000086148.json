      "SummaryText": "This document contains all required information in order to meet 40 CFR 68 \"Risk Management Program\".  This document consists of the executive summary and registration data elements (68.155 through 68.185).\n\n\n\n10.1   RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\n\n\nThe Minnesota Specialty Yeast facility in Hutchinson, Minnesota has a good record in preventing releases of anhydrous* ammonia.  As part of their release prevention program, the plant has an excellent and very detailed preventive maintenance program.  \n\n\n\nThe facility has implemented an Emergency Action Plan, which is to ensure the safety of its employees', the community and the environment.  This detailed emergency response program includes procedures for handling an emergency - the established response plan outside people (Hutchinson Fire Dept.) that are involved in containing an ammonia release - HAZMAT team.  These components make the Emergency Action Plan a thorough and comprehensive plan for release prevention and emergency response.  The emergency response policies at the Minnesota Specialty Yeast facility ensure that there is emergency response coverage 24 hours - 7 days per week. \n\n\n\n*From this point in the Executive Summary, anhydrous ammonia will be synonymous with ammonia. \n\n\n\n10.2    PROCESS DESCRIPTION AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n\n\nMinnesota Specialty Yeast produces food grade yeast (Torula yeast).  The NAICS code for the process at this facility is 311999.  Minnesota Specialty Yeast has one regulated substance under 40 CFR 68: anhydrous ammonia.  The ammonia is used primarily as a yeast nutrient.\n\n\n\nThe ammonia threshold for triggering the applicability to 40 CFR 68 is 10,000 pounds.  The total storage capacity of anhydrous ammonia stored in the tank for the yeast nutrient process is approximately 52,530 pounds.  This process exceeds the threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds as set by 40 CFR 68 and thus is regulated by the Risk Management Program.\n\n\n\n10.3     WORST-CASE AND ALTERNATIVE REL"

      "SummaryText": "EASE SCENARIOS\n\n\n\nWorst-Case Scenario Description\n\n\n\nThe largest potential release of ammonia would occur with a puncture in the ammonia tank.  Taking the specific definition of the worst-case from 40 CFR 68.25, the largest quantity of ammonia that can be stored in a vessel is in the ammonia tank during a pump out condition.  The total quantity of ammonia that can be stored in a single ammonia tank is 55,530 pounds.  Since the facility is located in a semi-populated area, the toxic cloud formed by the evaporating ammonia would reach offsite endpoints and nearby receptors.\n\n\n\nAlternative Release Scenario Description\n\n\n\nThe alternative release scenario that meets the selection criteria is an ammonia release from a pipe flange.  The release is located outside, approximately 8 feet above ground level.  Administrative controls are not applicable to this scenario.  Active mitigation of the release is through human intervention.  Since the facility is located in a semi-populated area, the toxic cloud formed by the evaporating ammonia would reach offsite endpoints and nearby receptors.\n\n\n\n10.4     GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION  STEPS\n\n\n\nMinnesota Specialty Yeast has developed an OSHA PSM program for their ammonia feed system. At Minnesota Specialty Yeast, ammonia falls under the RMP Program 3 Prevention Program, which is identical to the OSHA PSM program.  EPA has said that if the process is in compliance with OSHA PSM, then it is compliance with RMP Program 3.  Thus, Minnesota Specialty Yeast's ammonia PSM has been reviewed and determined to be complete for the RMP document.  \n\n\n\nListed below are key aspects of the ammonia prevention program:\n\n\n\n1. Most of the equipment at the ground level is guarded against impact.\n\n\n\n2. Critical ammonia equipment is installed above the 100 year flood level.\n\n\n\n3. Most of the pipe work is out of the way of people and machinery thus there is less of a chance of an ammonia release due to inci"

The plant maintains good training, certification and employee awareness of operating procedures. \n\n\n\n10.5     FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nMinnesota Specialty Yeast's accident history for the previous 5 years was reviewed.  according to 40 CFR part 68.42(a) there was 1 accidental release at this facility in that time frame.  The release occurred on July 7, 2017.  Approximately 280 pounds of ammonia was released through the Coalescer SRV due to over pressurizing in the delivery system.  SOP's were reviewed and employees provided refresher training to procedures.  \n\n\n\n10.6     EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe facilty has an Emergency Response (Action) Plan.\n\n\n\n10.7     PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nThe facility continues to work to reduce the potential for accidental releases of ammonia, through implementation of recommendations from process hazard analyses.  In addition, training to 29 CFR 1910.120 has been and will continue to be conducted.  Managers, Supervisors and Leads are trained to Incident Command Level.  "
