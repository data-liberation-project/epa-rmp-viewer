The City of Tuscaloosa has a population of 96,000 and serves a metropolitan area of 160,00 people.\n    Tuscaloosa is the home of the University of Alabama, Mercedes Benz ATV, JVC Magnetics, Michelin- B.F. Goodrich Tire Mnfg.and Gulf Staes Paper Coorporate Office, Stillman College and several industries that employee 200 to 600 employees. All of these companies make for a pleasurable life style in Tuscaloosa.  The Ed Love Water Treatment Plant is a 45.6 MGD facility. The treatment consist of Aluminum Sulfate (Alum) and lime for coagulation. Lime is also used for pH ccontrol, Potassium Permanganate for oxidation of iron and manganeese, flouride for the prevention of tooth decay and chlorine for dissenfectant for bacteria.  The raw water source for the city off Tuscaloosa is Lake tuscaloosa which has a capacity of 40 billion gallons of water, Lake Nicol as back-up source with foir billion gallon capacity and Lake Harris with a one billion gallon capacity. Lake Tuscaloosa water is a very clean source with an average turbidity of 6.0 NTU.                                                                                             \n      The water filtration plant is in an urban setting with the University of Alabama less than one mile away, DCh Hospital, Bryce's Mental Hospital, Taylor Hrdin State Maximum Security Hospital, Tuscaloosa Middle School, doctor's offices, resturants, apartment complexes, and a motel all within the 1.3 mile plume.\n     The treatment facility utilizes chlorine in the dissenfectant process to prevent viruses and protozoa that are present in the raw water supply. The chlorine is also used to kill bacteria and e-coli.The plant has two one ton cylinders that are attached to a common header to feed the plan at an average of 1200 lbs per day.
