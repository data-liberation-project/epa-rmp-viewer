Anhydrous ammonia is an effective refrigerant that has been used for many years by most food processing facilities. Ammonia is normally a gas at ambient temperatures but is handled as a gas liquefied under pressure. The refrigeration system consists of a high-pressure receiver, evaporators, compressors, piping, and valves. The system holds approximately 11, 960 pounds of ammonia.\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies: \n\nCream O'Weber, LLC is committed to promoting safety for the plant, its employees and the surrounding area.

The purpose of these programs is to ensure that the refrigeration system is operated safely in order to prevent releases of ammonia from the system. In addition, these programs serve to develop procedures to minimize releases in the event that they do occur, and to outline appropriate emergency response steps to take in the event of a release.\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps: As a part of its PSM Program, Cream O'Weber has established numerous programs that serve to prevent accidental releases of ammonia.
