              "Description": "The goal of Polk County Utilities Prevention Program is to reduce the risk to employees and the public of injury or death from an accidental release.  The program was prepared by a committee of employees from varying disciplines and responsiblities within Polk County.  A similar committee will participate in updates and modifications to the program. Process safety information presents information on the characteristics, hazards, and recommended handling methods of chlorine. All process equipment has been presented and described. Process flow and piping and instrumentation diagrams are included. Process hazard analysis procedures are presented, which include development of PHA team, method for conducting PHA, PHA reporting and recommendation implementation requirements, procedures for operating equipment and systems of covered processes, procedures for training new and existing employees in the classroom and on the job, procedures for contractor safety requirements and qualifications, prestartup safety reviews and checklists of covered processes, procedures for inspecting and ensuring the mechanical integrity of equipment and systems of covered processes, procedures for permitting and monitoring hot work in areas of covered processes, procedures for managing changes in equipment and processes, procedures for investigating incidents that resulted in an accidental release, and procedures for conducting compliance audits of facilities utilizing covered processes.  Schedules and documentation requirements for each of these tasks are presented in detail and are paramount to the functional success of the program.",

      "SummaryText": "Polk County Utilities Turner Road WPF is located on Meadow Ridge Avenue in Mulberry, FL.  The facility provides drinking water to a portion of south Lakeland, FL. Up to four one-ton cylinders of chlorine gas are stored and used at the facility for process chlorination. All cylinders are equipped with pressure relief valves and automatic shutoff valves. On-site chlorine monitors provide remote sensing for chlorine leaks. There has not been any accidental releases of chlorine at this site. Polk County Utilities is in compliance with OSHA PSM and EPA RMP requirements for Program 3 processes. A procedural plan is established for training staff on operation and maintenance, pre-startup safety reviews, mechanical integrity checks, hot work, managing changes of equipment, conducting incident investigations, contractor work, compliance audits, hazard assessments, and hazard analyses on chlorination equipment and effects of accidental releases. Emergency response services are provided by Polk County Emergency Management upon notification by Polk County Utilities staff or others of an accidental release at the facility.  Polk County Utilities staff are trained on equipment maintenance and failure repair. Emergency Management staff will direct Utilities staff when to enter the site of an accidental release for investigation and repair of a release. Self-contained breathing apparati will be used by all staff when entering the site. Dispersion modeling was performing using ALOHA algorithms. A worst-case accidental release scenario of 2,000 pounds of chlorine gas in ten minutes results in a 3.1 mile radius zone of impact which could affect a population estimate of 23,000. Seven alternative case accidental release scenarios of 317 up to 4,320 pounds of gas over 27 to 60 minutes result in 0.2 to 1.2 radii zones of impact which could affect population estimates of 100 to 3,450. No environmental receptors are within any accidental release scenario."
