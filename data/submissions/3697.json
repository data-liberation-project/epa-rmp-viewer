We welcome the EPA's RMP initiative and see it as an opportunity to continue and expand dialog with our community.\n\nc. Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\nBFGoodrich has in place a thorough, ongoing program of process safety management (PSM).  This program requires implementation and maintenance of procedural and engineered safeguards at the plant to minimize the likelihood of a significant release of a hazardous chemical, and to mitigate the effects of any release that might occur.  Some highlights of our program are:\n\n1. Process Hazard Analyses - Formal process hazard analyses (PHAs) have been performed on all plant operations involving regulated substances.  PHAs are conducted by a team of personnel from a variety of plant experience backgrounds to ensure all aspects of operation are considered.  During PHAs, each piece of equipment involved in the process is individually evaluated for its fitness for duty considering all expected operating conditions.  Startup, shutdown and upset conditions are also considered.  During PHAs, design and equipment weaknesses are investigated to eliminate the weakness or reduce its impact.  Measures are in place to continuously update this information.  \n2. Process Design - Our processes are designed for safety in accordance with applicable industry standards and best engineering practices.  Designs include, as appropriate, automatic emergency shutdown systems, pressure relief devices, ventilation systems and release sensing systems.  Most operations containing chemicals are computer controlled with trained chemical operators acting as backup and monitors.  Computer controls include continuous monitoring of critical operating parameters such as temperature, pressure, tank levels, flowrates  and valve positions.   Computer controls have inputs to detect abnor"

BFGoodrich has several safeguards to ensure that this condition does not exist including leak detection devices that continuously monitor the storage tank area for vapors, a spill containment dike equipped with a foam suppression system to blanket spilled material to minimize evaporated liquid, and employees who are trained in emergency response procedures. \n\nThe WCS for flammable materials involves the entire contents of our 60,000-gallon 1,3-Butadiene tank released into the air and simultaneously ignited to form a vapor cloud explosion (VCE).  The EPA-supplied software predicts an endpoint distance of 0.5 miles.  All international experience with vapor cloud explosions and predictive models indicates that the physical conditions for a significant VCE can be achieved only if the flammable gas accumulates and is ignited in an area congested by obstacles such as vessels or equipment, or is released in a semi-confined area such as an indoor release.  Otherwise the gas will just burn without causing an explosion.  Since our storage tank is located outside with no confining structures, it is highly unlikely, if not impossible, for a VCE to occur.  Furthermore, the area surrounding the storage tank contains electrical equipment that is rated intrinsically safe, meaning it is designed not to produce any source of ignition during its operation.   Leak detection devices are continuously in operation in the butadiene storage area to inform employees in the event of a leak.  This detection system has an audible alarm and visible readout to alert employees of any problems.\n \n\nEPA requires that this plan consider at least one Alternative Release Scenario (ARS) for each listed toxic substance in a process above its threshold quantity.

Training - Operations and maintenance personnel are thoroughly trained on their job tasks, on safe work practices as they apply to their jobs, and emergency contingency actions, before they may operate or maintain equipment.  They also receive refresher training periodically.  Our operating and maintenance procedures, general safety procedures and emergency response procedures are fully documented and updated for any changes in plant operations.  \n4. Maintenance - Each item of equipment at our plant that is involved in maintaining safety or in responding to an abnormal situation is inspected, tested and/or maintained on a frequency that reflects its service and condition.  \n5.   Management of Change - No change to equipment or procedural practices can take place at the plant without a thorough review of the implications of that change to safety.  No change must adversely impact the safety built into the design and operations of our processes.\n\nOur PSM program is tuned to reflect the specific hazards of the chemicals we use.  For example, our operating, maintenance, safe work and emergency procedures address personal protective equipment appropriate to the material being handled.  Also, equipment is selected based on its intended service and chemical exposure.\n\nd.

Unlike WCSs, ARSs are allowed to consider mitigative systems, such as interlocks, automatic shutdown systems, pressure relieving devices, pollution control devices, emergency isolation systems, fire water and deluge systems and passive mitigation systems such as alarm systems that alert employees to abnormal conditions that could lead to emergency situations.  Therefore, Alternative Release Scenarios included as part of this plan, more realistically define the situations that may be possible if all existing safety systems and operating procedures fail.\n\nThe ARSs for Acrylonitrile and Vinyl Acetate involve the release of 840 pounds in 15 minutes.  The endpoint distance for each scenario is 0.2 mile and 0.1 mile, respectively.   Although this situation has never occurred, it could possibly happen in the unlikely event that a pipeline would rupture during material transfer or should a truck unloading line become disconnected.  Current operating procedures would minimize the amount spilled.  Personnel are trained in safe operating procedures and steps to take in emergency situations.  At the truck unloading station, there is secondary containment, in the event of a spill.  Truck unloading is always performed by trained BFG personnel who are required to constantly monitor the truck unloading.   In the event of a spill, foam suppression systems are available to minimize evaporation of the spilled material.

The plant evacuation alarm is tested weekly. \n\nf. The Worst-Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including Administrative Controls and Mitigation Measures to Limit the Distances for Each Reported Scenario \n\nThe EPA RMP rule requires that this plan include a Worst-Case Scenario (WCS) representing all toxic regulated substances present above the threshold quantity, and one worst-case release scenario representing all flammable regulated substances present above the threshold quantity.   Scenarios have been considered for each listed toxic material and one WCS for a listed flammable material.  The EPA RMP rule specifies the conditions of the WCS for toxics such that the entire contents of the largest vessel or pipeline is released in ten minutes and instantaneously begins to evaporate with no human intervention to correct the problem.  The EPA requires that this scenario be modeled using the highest daily maximum temperature over the last three years.   The WCS for flammable material requires a situation in which the entire contents of the largest vessel or pipeline is released instantaneously, vaporized and ignited, resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  BFGoodrich does not agree with this method of developing WCSs since the prescribed incidents are physically impossible.  Nevertheless, we have prepared the following WCSs for our operations.\n\nThe WCS for this facility for toxic substances is an incident involving a release of the entire 20,000-gallon storage tank of vinyl acetate.

Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nIt is the policy of BFGoodrich to meet or exceed all requirements established by Federal, State and local regulatory agencies.  Our safety policies and practices have historically preceded the regulation of such practices under, for example, the OSHA Process Safety Management Standard.  \nThe risk communication objective for BFGoodrich is that its operating plants will be well prepared to deal with risk communication issues in their local communities and be prepared to act decisively to minimize any impact to the community resulting from industrial activities.  Each BFGoodrich plant regulated by the US EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) rule, 40 CFR 68 will complete a comprehensive RMP Plan and submit it to the appropriate state regulatory agency.  This RMP Plan will include an RMP Communication Plan for the plant within its local community.  The objective of the RMP Communication Plan is that the plant will be prepared to: \n\n7 Provide a realistic communication perspective on RMP information and on the plant's RMP submittal to EPA.\n7 Explain the plant's prevention program and safeguards.\n7 Provide appropriate information about the plant's emergency response procedures.\n7 Explain the plant's products and positive impact on the surrounding community.\n\nRisk communication is an integral part of a comprehensive risk management program at BFGoodrich that meets or exceeds all requirements of the US EPA RMP rule as well as the OSHA rule 29 CFR 1910.119 Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals (PSM).  In addition, BFGoodrich is a voluntary member of the Chemical Manufacturers Association, which has undertaken efforts to improve community relations through its Responsible Care Initiative since 1988.\n\nPlant managers, HSE managers, and their designees are responsible for the timely development and submission of their plant's overall RMP program, in"

The Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\nThe BFGoodrich Performance Materials Plant in Gastonia manufactures Latex resins and coatings used in the textile, carpet, adhesives, paint, printing, coating, automotive and flock industries.  The site manufactures more than 500 products sold throughout the world.  The plant is located approximately three miles south of downtown Gastonia just outside the City limits.  The Gastonia facility covers 23 acres, nine of which contains three separate manufacturing plants.  The site was initially developed by Maurice Walsh as Walsh Chemical Company in 1973.  In 1994, BFGoodrich acquired the site.  The plant currently employs 125 people.   The site is serviced by Norfolk-Southern Railroad, is adjacent to US Route 321, and is less than 10 miles from Interstate 85.\n\nAnnual plant payroll is $5 million, paying about $180,000 in county taxes and $550,000 in state taxes.  We buy $3 million in goods and services mostly from local suppliers.\n\nBFGoodrich is proud to be a part of this hard working community.  The plant and its employees have generously supported the area through the annual Fish Camp Jam, United Way, Volunteer Fire organizations, The Salvation Army, The Shrine Club, Special Olympics, American Business Women's Association, Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts of America, HH Beam, Lingerfelt, Pleasant Ridge Elementary Schools, Holbrook and Southwest Middle Schools.\n\nNearly all finished products manufactured at the Gastonia plant are non-hazardous.  In the manufacture of these products, chemicals regulated by EPA's RMP rule are used.  The RMP regulated chemicals for this site are acrylonitrile, 1,3-butadiene, vinyl acetate and vinylidene chloride.
