This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design , installation, operation and maintenance of the facility?s processes. The Gereke Chemicals policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of substances. However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will respond to, control, and contain the release.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe Gereke Chemicals Facility is located in Harris County on Jefferson Rd. in Pasadena, Texas. The facility is inside the city limit of Pasadena and is located on the Houston Ship Channel.\n\nThe Facility produces and distributes chemicals, which are used in agricultural and industrial applications. Production at the Facility consist of ammonium hyposulfite, ammonium bisulfite , and ammonium polysulfide.\n\nThese chemicals utilize several regulated and non-regulated substances as raw materials. The covered substance used is anhydrous ammonia. The products and raw materials require loading/unloading operations at the Facility, as well as the associated process and storage equipment.\n\nThe Facility was evaluated to determine if any regulated flammable or toxic substances exceeded the threshold quantity. Based on process knowledge , Gereke Chemicals identified no listed flammable substances and one toxic regulated substance kept on site above threshold quantities.\n\nThe Pasadena Facility contains a Program 3 process under the Accidental Release Prevention (ARP) program.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE PROGRAM\n\nThe following is a summary of "

Therefore, this summary addressees each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program. The Facility is in the continuous process of reviewing the Accident Prevention Program and as such is in various stages of implementing changes to improve work place safety.\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nActive employee participation and involvement in the development and implementation of the Facility?s PSM program is an important step forward achieving the objective to prevent or minimize the consequences of catastrophic releases of toxic, reactive, flammable or explosive chemicals. Employees involvement will help to ensure that all perspectives regarding PSM are considered, and that the best ideas are implemented.

The PSI will be useful to the operator; the team performing the PHA; those in charge of training: contractors; those conducting pre-startup safety reviews; and those in charge of updating the emergency preparedness plans. Process Safety Information is to be readily available to all employees.\n\nA variety of technical documents are to be kept that are used to help maintain safe operation of the process. These documents address chemicals properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.\n\nChemicals-specific information. Including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheet(MSDSs).\n\n\nNumerous technical documents are to be maintained that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment. This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment. This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\nThere is a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various  processes are identified and controlled.

Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk matrix assigned by the PHA team. The matrix is based on severity (criticality) and probability (frequency). This ranking helps ensure that potential response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed. The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the PHA team periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results. These periodic reviews are conducted at least every five years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.

The PSI will be useful to the operator; the team performing the PHA; those in charge of training: contractors; those conducting pre-startup safety reviews; and those in charge of updating the emergency preparedness plans. Process Safety Information is to be readily available to all employees.\n\n\n\nA variety of technical documents are to be kept that are used to help maintain safe operation of the process. These documents address chemicals properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.\n\n\n\nChemicals-specific information. Including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheet(MSDSs).\n\n\n\n\n\nNumerous technical documents are to be maintained that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.
