In this way we promote over all plant, worker, and public safety.  These programs enable our facility to minimize the occurance and consequences of significant releases of toxic substances, as well as fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents.  Overall, these programs prevent accidental fatalities, injuries and illnesses and avoid physical property damage.\n\nOur safety programs are applied to any activity involving hazardous chemicals including any usage, storage, handling, or the on-site movement of such chemical.  Any group of vessles are interconnected and seperate vessles which are located such that a hazardous chemical could be involved in a potential release shall be consdered a single process.\n\nOur safety programs minimize accidents because the programs focus on the rules, procedures and pratices that govern individual processes, activities, or equipment.  These programs are detailed and improved as necessary.  They are also communicated to and accepted by all employees at the facility.\n\nDescription\n\nThe ammonia refigeration process at the facility consists of various pumps, compressors, and condencors that are used to change the state of ammonia from a gas to a liquid in four closed systems.  The total ammonia inventory on site includes 107,100 pounds.  The liquified ammonia is used in the freezing of lima beans, carrots, green beans, potatoes, celery and other vegetables recieved at this facility.  The actual vegetables processed at the facility can vary from year to year.  The ammonia is also used to cool packaging rooms"

Under worst-case weather condition, ammonia could travel 2.2 miles before dispersing enough to no longer pose a hazard to the public or the environment.  This scenario is unlikely to happen for the following reasons: worst-case weather conditions are uncommon; industry standards for the manufacture and quality controls of the vessles; ammonia is not corrosive in this service; pressure safety valves limit opertaing pressure in this vessel; the accident preventation program in place at the facility including the mechanical interity program for regular mainenance, inspection and testing, and replacement of equipment, as nacessary; installed ammonia sensors in the system to warn of leaks; alarms are in place to warn operating personnel of process upsets; and an emergency reponse plan and equipment are in place at the facility.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario(s)\n\nFailure of a 1/4 inch diameter pipe would result in a release or approximatly 6000 pounds of ammonia over a period of 60 minutes.  Under common weather conitions, ammonia could travel 0.2 miles before dispersing enough to no longer pose a hazard to the public or the environment.  The 1/4 inch pipe was chosen because it is used to temporarily bleed off a pump so that mainenance activities can be conducted.  This scenario is unlikely to occur for the following reasons:  The pump is isolated with valves in the closed position and only for a few pounds of ammonia would be released; the valves to the pump would have the fail completely; the facility has an accident prevention program in place including operational procedures that includes having personnel present at all times during maintenance of a pump; a mechanical integrity program for regular maintenan"

The key prevention steps at the facility consists of the following:\n\n-Process Safety Information\n-Process Hazard Analysis\n-Standard Operating Procedures\n-Trianing\n-Mechanical Integrity Program\n-Management of Change\n-Prestart up Safety Review\n-Complaince Audits\n-Incident Information\n-Employee Participation\n-Hot Work Permits\n-Contractor Qualifications\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nOn April 16, 1999, an ammona release of 90 pounds resulted in an outside contractor being taken to a doctor for observations and was release immediately.\n\nEmergency Responce Program\n\nThe Darien Birds Eye Foods emergency responce program is based on the OSHA requirements for Emergency Action Plans(29 CFR 1910.119) and Hazwoper (29CFR 1910.120).  We have trained employees for emergency responce and maintain a written emergency responce plan.  This plan is coordinated with the Walworth County Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and the Darien Fire Department.\n\nThis submission is an update in accordinance with the requirements of 40 CFR; part 68.190(b).  The ammonia volume increased due to production expansion in September of 2003."
