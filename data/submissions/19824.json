The Facility Policy\n          The owners, management, and employees of Central Farmers Cooperative (The Facility) are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire company, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2.  Facility Information\n           The primary activity at the facility is the storage  of fertilizers for sale to farmers.\n\n           Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application.\n\n           The maximum quantity stored would be 140000 pounds in our single 30000 gallon tank.      \n           The maximum amount handled would be the unloading of a transport containg 41000        \n           pounds.\n\n3.  The worst case scenario and alternative release scenario.\n           a.  The worst case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of the storage\n                tank released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 140000\n                pounds , which represents the volume of the storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited \n                by design standards.  The distance to the end point is 2.5 miles.\n\n           b.  The alternative release scenario based on the most likely potential incident is a release from\n                a break in a transfer hose.  The distance to the endpoint is 1.14 miles\n\n4.  The accidental release prevention program.\n           The facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety requirements for the Storage and Handling\n           of Anhydrous Ammonia K 61.1\", published by The American National Standards Institute, and the\n           Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, Storage and handling\n      "

The 5 year accident history.\n               There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past 5 years that:\n                   a.  have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor\n                   b.  to our knowledge have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in\n                        place, property damage or environmental damage.\n\n6.  The emergency response program.\n             The facility has:\n                    a.  A written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.38\n                    b.  Provided state and local authorities the emergency planninng and community right to know\n                         information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).\n                    c.  A written emergency response plan, in accordancewith OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.120\n                         including pre emergency planning and employee training.\n\n7.  Planned changes to improve safety\n                Safety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed \n           to asses the maintainance of safe conditions.  There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia \n           safety reccomendations for implementation at this time."
