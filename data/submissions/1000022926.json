      "SummaryText": "The Prochem, Inc. facility in Seward, IL is mainly used for large-scale production of an expanding repertoire of custom inorganic and organic chemicals.\n\nAll production occurs on a batch basis.  The large and specialized processes use glass lined steel reactors, stainless steel reactors, polypropylene and stainless steel tanks that range from 100 to 3000 gallons. Some of these processes include the repackaging of potassium hydroxide flake, conversion of potassium hydroxide flake to 45% solution, and the synthesis of various rare earth nitrates.\n\nCurrently, the focus of the facility is the synthesis and purification of an ultra high purity silicon precursor for the semiconductor industry.  We are currently in the process of ramping up our production schedule to meet this product demand.  This requires us to inventory up to three one-ton cylinders of chlorine.\n\nProchem's commitment is to store, handle and use chlorine in a manner that achieves the necessary process results, while minimizing onsite and offsite risks.  This is accomplished by designing, maintaining, and operating a safe process, through documented procedures and extensive training, and arranging for in-house and local response teams to provide emergency response capability to minimize the consequences of a chlorine release, should a process incident ever occur.\n\nThe accidental release prevention policy and the emergency response policy at your facility \n\nThe prevention of accidental releases from our facility is a direct function of our site safety program.  Training and preparation prior to engaging in each new chemical process as well as documented work instructions are the cornerstones to our overall plan.\n\nAs outlined in our corporate safety policy PCS-SAF-001, ProChem Seward has a well-defined method of reviewing and determining risk assessment of chemical processes and associated hazards.  Various evaluation tools are utilized to accomplish this for new processes and for the review of existing pro"

These tools include \"What If Checklist\", Hazards Operations Reviews, and Failure Mode Effects Analysis (FMEA).\n\nThe concern for the potential for accidental releases or injury extends well past our full and part time employees.  The same quality of protection is extended to all personnel working or visiting our facility.  This policy is outlined in our corporate policy PCS-SAF-005: Contractor Safe Work Program.  Strict access control to our site is maintained at all times.  All delivery personnel are identified and escorted unless they are an approved contractor that has been granted a \"NO ESCORT REQUIRED\" status.\nTraining of employees and contractors are a key to completing site work assignments in a safe and release free environment.  As defined in our corporate training policy PCS-SAF-003 training is an ongoing activity at our site.  Training for new employees and annual training is provided to satisfy the requirements of Hazard Communication Training (29 CFR 1910.1200).  Work instruction training and our program of scheduled reviews and revision procedures are important for keeping our employees current with technology and process changes.  We also furnish advanced training for employees that may respond to small on site release or a damaged transported container.  Over half of the site staff is trained to the Industrial Technician level with specialized training with chlorine containment kits and use of advanced personal protective equipment.  Annual refresher training and cooperative efforts with local responders provide a wide basis of response capabilities.\n\nEmployee involvement is another cornerstone to our injury and chemical release prevention program.  All employees attend a monthly safety meeting and participate in monthly safety inspections as part of the site safety plan.  Corrective action plans for all levels of safety observations are created and tracked as a function of the safety program.  Constant vigilance and conce"

Our ProChem site motto is \"OUR SAFETY IS NO ACCIDENT\".\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical specific prevention steps\n\nWe are required to register a Risk Management Plan (RMP) with the EPA, a Site Security Plan with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and increase our site safety program to include the requirements of Process Safety Management (PSM). These programs require many internal audits including Process Hazard Analysis and full compliant Process Safety Management program.  These programs assure the public and ourselves that we are utilizing safe work and chemical handling practices through all phases of our operation.\n\n Through PSM we have several safety programs including:\nA?    A full pre start up review of the liquid chlorine delivery system to be sure all aspects of the piping, valves, sensors, etc are in working condition\nA?    A Process Hazard Analysis using a What If/Checklist format to determine any possible hazards and how we plan to mitigate or eliminate them\nA?    A preventative maintenance schedule for inspection and servicing of all parts in the process\nA?    Safe operating procedures for handling the chlorine and operating the delivery system\nA?    Employee and contractor hazard communications training programs which comply with OSHA 29 CFR:1910.1200\n\nIn addition to PSM requirements, we have many additional safety features in place to prevent unintentional releases of chlorine into the atmosphere.  These include:\nA?    A semiconductor grade liquid chlorine delivery system designed and fabricated by Airgas Inc with multiple incorporated safety features including temperature, pressure, flow, and specialized chlorine sensors (2 ppm).  If any of these detects an atypical reading, a signal is sent to the delivery system to initiate a shut down, and a signal is sent by email to alert site staff.    \nA?

Five full-time employees with 24-hour HAZWOPER Industrial Technician emergency response training, including specific chlorine response training\nA?    An Emergency \"B\" Kit for chlorine leak mitigation\nA?    An exhaust system that ventilates to a continuously operating scrubbing system \n\nIf a major chlorine leak were to occur, the emergency response plan includes immediate notification of the Pecatonica Fire Department, which triggers a mutual aid system through the \"911\" call.  This activates regional, county, and city of Rockford Hazardous Materials response teams.  The plan also includes orderly evacuation or sheltering-in-place of the surrounding community.\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety\n\nWe are in process of developing a training and certification program for the operation of the Airgas chlorine delivery system. \nWe will be organizing ongoing training for all on site emergency responders, as well as hosting joint training sessions with local hazardous materials teams.\nWe will be adding at least three more on site full-time employees with 24-hour HAZWOPER Industrial Technician emergency response training.\n"
