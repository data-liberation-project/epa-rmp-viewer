CSW Madison promotes employee \n\nsafety involvement and safety program continuous improvement through its \n\nSafety Committee and PSM Committee meetings. Senior management \n\nparticipates in safety program planning and monitoring.\n\n\n\nCSW management and staff strive to reduce or eliminate chemical exposure \n\nrisks through physical measures wherever feasible and communicate remaining \n\nrisks to all employees and other interested individuals through training, signage, \n\nand cooperation with public safety agencies.
