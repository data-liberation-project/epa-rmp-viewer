It processes natural gas to produce purified components, including Methane, Ethane, Propane, Isobutane, Butane, and heavier hydrocarbons. The processing of the natural gas results in the generation of a hydrogen sulfide and carbon dioxide mixture. This mixture is further processed to recover sulfur.\n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nThe RMP rule requires facilities to compile a 5-Year Accident History for all RMP regulated substances in covered processes at the facility.  As part of the ongoing PSM Program, the facility documents and tracks all incidents and near-misses that occur within the facility\n\nRMP requires facilities to report any incident from a covered process involving a regulated substance and resulting in any of the following:\n\n\n\n    Onsite deaths, injuries, or significant property damage\n\n    Offsite deaths, injuries, property damage, evacuations, sheltering-in-place, or environmental damage\n\n\n\nThe BEC Plant had no RMP reportable incident in the five years prior to the submittal of this RMP.  \n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AT BEC\n\n\n\nThe processes at the plant have hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation. The following are some examples of the accidental release prevention program at BEC: \n\n?    LDAR\n\n?    Preventive Maintenance\n\n?    Vessel Inspections\n\n?    Pipeline x-ray\n\n?    Operator Training\n\n?    Annual Contingency Plan\n\n?    EAP\n\n?    SPCC\n\n\n\nCHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nSome of the administrative programs to prevent, detect or mitigate an incident at the plant are presented above.  Specific safety equipment and procedures, known as safeguards, are in place at the plant.  These safeguards are listed as part of the process hazard analyses, process safety information, and in the operating procedures.  Some examples of general safeguards are presented below:\n\n\n\n  Release Detectio"

The facility design, maintenance, operating procedures, and training provide for risk minimization before an accident can occur.  In spite of all these things, emergencies can arise, sometimes through forces beyond control.  \n\nThe purpose of this emergency plan is to provide a cohesive, written procedure for coordinating effective response procedures by all plant personnel in order that danger to employees, contractors, the general public and the environment may be lessened in the unlikely event of an emergency.  The emergency response procedure covers the entire plant. It includes, but is not limited to: incident command system, evacuation, medical response to chemical exposure, agency notification, public notification if potential for impact, personnel accounting, and clean-up.\n\n\n\nTraining for emergency response is conducted frequently with classroom, tabletop, and live exercises.  \n\n\n\nENHANCEMENTS TO SAFETY\n\n\n\nThe BEC plant is constantly re-evaluating the current safety systems through the use of prevention programs such as Management of Change and the Process Hazard Analysis program. As a result of these programs, and other safety and risk reduction initiatives, improvements to the safety of the workers and the surrounding community continue to occur.
