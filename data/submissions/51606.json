The facility de-bones poultry or otherwise prepares poultry to customer specification. The facility was originally built in the 1970's and was previously owned by ConAgra Foods and was acquired by Koch Foods of Alabama, Inc. in 2005. The refrigeration system was re-started on a small scale after the purchase and will have more than 10,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia at the time of this filing. Koch Foods of Alabama has updated the previous Process Safety Management program to comply with OSHA regulations and the Risk Management Plan in compliance with the EPA.\n\nKoch Foods of Alabama Senior Management Commitment\n\nKoch Foods of Alabama is committed to safety and allocates resources to accomplish safety goals, for example:\n\nPurchasing safety equipment; hiring a consultant for assistance with safety and environmental matters, having full time safety and environmental managers on staff, conducting safety training for managers, supervisors and employees, training, equipping and maintaining emergency preparedness including a HAZWOPER team providing meeting area and personnel for public meetings.\n\nIn addition, the plant's HAZWOPER team by its training, drills and other preparedness activities has built a strong reputation in the community and public response agencies such as the Montgomery Fire Department.\n\nKoch Foods of Alabama Ammonia Refrigeration Department\n\nThe refrigeration system is operated by a trained full time refrigeration staff that includes 6 Refrigeration Technicians and 1 Refrigeration Manager. The system is regularly monitored, inspected and maintained. The refrigeration department utilizes preventative maintenance, standard operating procedures, regular and frequent inspections and safety programs.  Safety procedures include: lockout tag out, hot"
