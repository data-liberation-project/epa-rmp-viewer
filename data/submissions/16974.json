The Facility Policy\nThe owners, members, and employees of Dorman Brothers, L.L.C. (the facility) are committed to the prevention of accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department and other agencies to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information\n- This facility was constructed in 1998, using the most current safety measures available.\n- The primary activity at this facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers.\n- Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for both direct application and for blending into mixed-grade fertilizers for crop production nutrients.\n- The maximum quantity stored would be 131,325 pounds of anhyrous ammonia in one fixed-site storage tank.  The maximum quantity handled would be the unloading of a rail tank car holding 136,000 pounds.  Both of these figures are based on filled to a maximum of 85% of the rated capacity of the tanks.\n\n3. The worst-case release scenario and the alternate release scenario:\n- The worst-case scenario would be the release of the total contents of a tank car, released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 136,000 pounds, which represents 85% of the capacity of the tank car as limited by design standards.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 2.65 miles.\n- The alternate release scenario, based on the most likely potential incident, is a release from a break in a transfer hose.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 1.18 miles.\n\n4. The Accidental Release Prevention Program\n- This facility has implemented the pro"

The Five-year Accident History\n- There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia since this facility started in 1998 that have caused any deaths, injuries or significant property damage in the facility, or any offsite cosequences of any release.\n\n6. The Emergency Response Program\n- The facility has:\n- a written emergency action plan in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.38 (OSHA)\n- provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA)\n- a written emergency response program, in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.120 (OSHA) including pre-emergency planning and employee training.\n\n7. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n- Safety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic inspections are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
