Accidental Release Prevention and Response Policies\n\n\n\nConstructed in 1974-75, the Sea-3 Newington LPG Terminal provides a vital energy service to homeowners, commercial businesses, and industry.  The facility has an excellent safety record, and its employees are key players in achieving that safety record.\n\n\n\nSea-3 is committed to safe and reliable operation for the protection of its employees, the community, and the environment.  Sea-3 is proud of its 40 year operating record, during which there has never been an incident that resulted in any off-site impacts to neighboring industries, residents or the community at large. This record has been achieved through consistent attention and total dedication by management and staff to safe operating practices and preventive maintenance.  Sea-3 has constantly made new investments in the latest technology in operating and maintaining the facility.  These practices form the backbone of Sea-3's dedication to keeping the facility and its community safe.\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Description of the source and regulated substances handled.\n\n\n\nThe Sea-3 Terminal in Newington, NH imports and stores fully refrigerated liquid propane (also called liquefied petroleum gas or LPG) at -45A?F.  The terminal processes this product by heating it to +40A?F for shipment to its customers by truck and rail.  Ethyl mercaptan, an odorizing agent, is added to the LPG being distributed from the terminal.  Both propane and ethyl mercaptan are regulated flammable substances.  The terminal has no RMP listed toxic chemicals in threshold quantities.\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Release Prevention Program\n\n\n\nThe terminal was designed and built in accordance with provisions of the following three recognized standards for LPG facilities:\n\n\n\n*  NFPA 58, Standard for the Storage and Handling of Liquefied Petroleum Gases, (National Fire Protection Association).\n\n\n\n*  API 2510, Desi"

Ultraviolet flame detectors monitor the plant to detect fires.  The plant is attended by at least two operators at all times.  They log field operating data at two-hour intervals and monitor plant equipment using the following monitoring and control systems:\n\n\n\n*  The main control panel, located in the central control room, displays pressures, temperatures, valve positions, and flow rates and provides for remote operation and manual or automatic shutdown of valves and equipment.\n\n\n\n*  The emergency control panel, also located in the central control room, displays readings of combustible vapor detectors and fire detectors.  It provides fire department notification and manual and automatic activation of water deluge and emergency shutdown systems.\n\n\n\n*  A closed circuit television (CCTV) system, with displays located in the central control room, is used for surveillance and security of all portions of the terminal.\n\n\n\nWritten policies and procedures for safe operation are contained in the following Sea-3 manuals:\n\n\n\n*  \"Sea-3 Standard Operating Procedures Manual,\" covering normal startup, operation, and shutdown of plant systems and equipment.\n\n\n\n*  \"Sea-3 Safety Standards and Procedures Manual,\" covering safe handling of the product and other materials used in the plant.

Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nThe facility has been in operation since 1975.  Safety reviews have been undertaken periodically since that time.  Many recommendations arising from these reviews have been implemented through equipment and procedural changes.\n\n\n\nThe most recent review was a process hazard analysis (PHA) completed in April 2011.  All issues identified during that review were dealt with by the end of that year.  Sea-3 will update the PHA by April 2016 and will deal promptly with any recommended improvements that result from that review."
