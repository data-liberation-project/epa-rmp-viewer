This commitment is demonstrated by our efforts in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, facility trained personnel will evaluate the situation, take actions within the capabilities of the facility, and/or notify the necessary outside agencies.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES     \n\nThe Chattanooga Propane Terminal is located at 530 Manufacturers Road, just east of U.S. Highway No. 27 in Chattanooga, Tennessee.  The Chattanooga Propane Terminal provides storage and terminal operations for propane.  Propane is typically delivered to the facility via railcar and shipped out via trucks.  The Chattanooga Propane Terminal is able to store enough of propane to meet the minimum RMP reporting quantities.\n\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS RESULTS\n\nThe worst-case scenario (WCS) for the Chattanooga Propane Terminal is a vapor cloud explosion involving the largest inventory of a flammable mixture (predominately consisting of propane) contained in a single pressurized storage vessel.  The maximum quantity possible contained within this storage vessel is 460,000 pounds.  Although administrative controls are in place to limit this quantity, those controls were not considered in calculating this maximum quantity determination.  The entire inventory of the storage tank is assumed to release, form a vapor cloud, ignite and explode - creating a vapor cloud explosion.  Using RMP*CompTM, the maximum distance to the 1-psig overpressure endpoint is 0.6 miles.  Although there are numerous controls to prevent su"

This particular ARS is assumed to last for 5 minutes before operation of isolation valves, pumps, deluge, shutdowns and/or other mitigating actions can be utilized to mitigate the release.  Under this ARS, the released propane vapor is accidentally ignited - causing a vapor cloud fire.  Using RMP*CompTM, the maximum distance to the lower flammability limit endpoint for this ARS is 0.1 miles.  With a radius of 0.1 miles, this ARS would extend outside of the boundary of the Chattanooga Propane Terminal.  The active mitigation systems described are operator initiated and automatic shutdowns for the isolation of the release source. Redundant and remote shutdowns and isolation devices are located in various locations within the facility. The locations of the redundant shutdowns are designed so if an initiating event were to occur in one part of the facility, shutdown may be initiated and accomplished outside of the impacted areas. This is inherent in the design and location of the ESD's and manual isolation valves, and is a consideration looked at during facility siting studies. This event was selected as being a practical scenario for use in emergency planning and response. \n\n\n\n GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM \n \n  The following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the Facility.  The process at the Chattanooga Propane Terminal is regulated by both the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) risk management program (RMP) rule and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration"

Because RMP accident prevention requirements for this process are essentially the same as PSM, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements, and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program at the Chattanooga Propane Terminal.  \n \n Employee Participation\n \n The Chattanooga Propane Terminal encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention, including process hazard analyses, incident investigations, and the development of operating and maintenance procedures. Employees also participate in safety meetings, resolving certain safety concerns, and updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information pertaining to the process and critical equipment.  \n \n Employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's accident prevention program.  Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in a written employee participation plan that is maintained at the Chattanooga Propane Terminal.  This employee participation plan addresses each accident prevention program element.  \n \n In addition, the Chattanooga Propane Terminal has a number of initiatives under way which address process safety and employee safety issues.  These initiatives include forming teams to promote both process and personal safety.  The teams typically have members from various areas of the facility, including operations, maintenance, engineering, and facility management.\n \n Process Safety Information\n \n The Chattanooga Propane Terminal keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the process.

For specific process areas, the facility has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) in the equipment specifications and operating procedures.  The Chattanooga Propane Terminal maintains the process within these limits by using process controls and monitoring instruments, trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\n \n The Chattanooga Propane Terminal also maintains technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment. This information, in combination with procedures and equipment operating history, provides a basis for inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes so safety features in the process are not compromised.\n \n Process Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n \n The Chattanooga Propane Terminal has a comprehensive program to identify and control hazards associated with the various processes that are identified and controlled.  Within this program, the process is systematically examined to identify potential hazards and controls in place to manage these hazards, and recommend additional controls, as appropriate.\n \n The facility uses a variety and combination of applicable methodologies to conduct PHAs.  These PHAs address (1) facility siting, (2) human factors, (3) qualitative evaluation of a range of the possible safety and health effects of failure of controls on personnel, (4) and one or more of the following methodologies appropriate to determine and evaluate the hazards of the process (a) What-if; Checklist, (b) Hazard and Operability (HAZOP), (c) Failure Mode "

Implementation of additional prevention and/or mitigation options in response to PHA recommendations is based on a relative priority ranking assigned by the PHA team.  The approved prevention and/or mitigation options in response to PHA team recommendations are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each recommendation is documented and retained.\n \n The Chattanooga Propane Terminal periodically revalidates these PHAs.  These PHAs are revalidated at least every 5 years, and will be conducted at this frequency until the process no longer contains hazardous chemicals above the threshold quantities.  The recommendations from these revalidated PHAs are also forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of each revalidated PHA recommendation is documented and retained.\n \n Operating Procedures\n \n The Chattanooga Propane Terminal maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process.  These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.

The purpose of the PSSR is to see that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides one additional check that construction is in accordance with the design specifications and required safety systems are operationally ready.  A PSSR also verifies that appropriate safety, operational and maintenance procedures are in place, and adequate training has been provided to the appropriate personnel.  A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.  When new facilities are commissioned, a PHA is included in the PSSR.  \n \n Mechanical Integr"

This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented.  Changes are reviewed to (1) determine that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.  Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, equipment information, and operating procedures are updated prior to incorporating these changes.  In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided necessary training on the change.\n \n Incident Investigation\n \n The Chattanooga Propane Terminal promptly investigates all incidents related to a covered process that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury.  The goal of each investigation is to determine the factors that may have led to the incident, and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The investigation team documents its recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these recommendations to facility management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's recommendations are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the recommendations.  Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years so that the reports can be reviewed during future PHAs and PHA revalidations. \n \n Compliance Audits\n \n To help determine "
