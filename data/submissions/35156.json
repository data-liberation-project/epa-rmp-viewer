      "SummaryText": "KRAFT FOODS, COSHOCTON, OH\nRISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAM\n(Executive Summary and Data Elements)\n\n\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n1.0    Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe Kraft Foods facility in Coshocton, Ohio has a very good record in preventing and minimizing releases of anhydrous* ammonia.  The facility has implemented an electronic preventive maintenance system.  One of the features of this system is that it uses a real time database to track training and inspection dates and issue reminders to responsible groups.\n\nThe emergency response policies at this facility ensure that there is emergency response coverage, 24 hours - 7 days per week.  There are also adequate provisions for coordination with outside agencies, such as with the Coshocton Fire Department and the Coshocton County Emergency Services and Disaster Agency (LEPC), in the event of an emergency.\n\n*From this point in the Executive Summary, anhydrous ammonia will be synonymous with ammonia.\n\n\n2.0    Process Description and Regulated Substances\n\nAt this location Kraft Foods manufactures meat products.  The NAICS code for the primary process at this facility is (311612).  This facility processes and packages bacon and bacon pieces for consumer intake but is not equipped to slaughter hogs.  Many areas of the plant are refrigerated to store raw materials and finished products.  Some of these areas include: receiving, product staging, belly processing, brine mixing, curing rooms, curing over-flow and other storage areas.  The plant produces smoked bacon in smokehouses located on-site. \n\nKraft Foods has one regulated substance, ammonia, under 40 CFR 68. Ammonia is used as a cooling agent in the refrigeration of the meat products in the various areas described above.\n\nThe ammonia threshold for triggering applicability to 40 CFR 68 is 10,000 pounds. The quantity of ammonia stored on-site is approximately 30,000 pounds. Thus, 40 CFR 68 is  applicable to the Coshocton facility.\n\n\n3.0    General Accidental Release Prev"

      "SummaryText": "ention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThis facility is regulated under PSM.  The facility has developed an OSHA PSM program for their ammonia refrigeration system.  Ammonia falls under the RMP Program 3 prevention program, which is identical to the OSHA PSM program.  EPA has said that if the process is in compliance with OSHA PSM, then it is in compliance with RMP Program 3.  Thus, Kraft?s ammonia PSM has been reviewed and determined to be complete for the RMP document. \n\nThere are several aspects of the prevention program that are key:\n\n1.    The majority of the ammonia process pipe work is located in low traffic areas and in the process of being relocated on the roof.  This allows for less human interaction with the process and results in a lower probability of an ammonia release. \n\n2.    The plant maintains good training, certification and employee awareness of operating procedures.\n\n3.    The ammonia system is monitored through a PLC.  \n \n4.    Ammonia detectors are installed in the main housing unit of the ammonia storage vessels, the engine room.\n\n4.0    Five-year Accident History\n\nThe review of this facility's accident history includes the following range of dates: June 22, 1999 - June 21, 2004.  According to 40 CFR Part 68.42(a), there have been no accidental releases of ammonia at the Coshocton facility.\n\n5.0    Emergency Response Program \n\nAs mentioned earlier, in Section 1.0, the Coshocton Plant has developed an emergency response program. The emergency response program is comprised of three elements: emergency communications, emergency evacuation procedures and an off site plan. Separate documents, or plans, were produced to define the policies and procedures of the Coshocton Plant. The plans were also written to identify to the plant employees what precautions and steps should be taken in the event of the release of a hazardous substance. The combination of the three documents yields a comprehensive Emergency Response Program document. The following para"

      "SummaryText": "graphs discuss briefly the contents of each of the three specified documents.\n\nThe emergency communications document is written to establish procedures to notify appropriate agencies (like the Coshocton Fire Department) and the four company trained emergency response team members in the event of an emergency. Company response team members can be notified by the use of a pager or phone.  The Coshocton plant has four employees who are trained as emergency responders.  The Coshocton Fire Department shall be notified by the security  personnel via 911.\n\nThe emergency evacuation procedures document is designed to provide an orderly, effective plan of action for protecting employees in emergency situations when an evacuation is necessary.\n\nThe off site plan was written to identify the hazardous chemicals on site (and the quantities), the primary emergency responders site diagrams, support available at/from the facility and a hazard analysis (off site consequences and affected area, including receptors).\n\n\n6.0    Planned Changes to Improve Safety \n\nThe plant has put together an overall plan to improve our entire refrigeration system:  over the last few years, and for the next few years, we have been, and we will be, replacing equipments, moving all the  piping to the roofs and upgrading equipment so it would be more efficient and more safe."
