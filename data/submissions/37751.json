Release Scenario\n\nThe worst-case and alternative release scenarios, including a\ndiscussion of administrative and mitigative measures used to\nminimize the affects of the release are described below.\nOne worst case release scenario is provided for the Plant,\ni.e., the scenario with the farthest endpoint, and an\nalternative release scenario is provided for each toxic\nchemical. The distinguishing differences between the two types\nof scenarios are: (1) the USEPA specifically defines the\nparameters of the worst case releases scenario and (2) only the\nalternative release scenario takes into account the\naccident/release prevention measures that are in-place to\nprevent and mitigate any release.\n\n   \nIV.  Accident and Release Prevention Programs\n\nThe Noveon, Inc. Avon Lake Plant has\nseveral programs in place, which are specifically focused on\npreventing the accidental release of chemicals. These programs\nare consistent with Plant and Noveon policies and with the\nOccupational Safety and Health Process Safety Management\nStandard (PSM) for highly hazardous chemicals.\n\n   These programs are:\n     \n     1.     Employee Participation  -  Employees regularly\n       participate in activities directed toward aspects of\n       Plant Safety, e.g., Process Hazard Analysis, Management\n       of Change Procedures, and monthly safety meetings.\n     \n     2.Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) - Various Process Hazard\n       Analysis Techniques are performed to identify and\n       analyze the potential process hazards associated with\n       handling hazardous chemicals. Corrective Action plans\n       are then formed and implemented.\n       \n     3.     Operating Procedures - Operating procedures have\n       been developed for all processes to insure the  their\n       safe operation. These procedures are periodically\n       reviewed and modified as necessary.\n       \n     4.
