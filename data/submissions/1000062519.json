The site has 70 employees on our confined space rescue teams.  \r\n\r\nP&G is also very committed to the safety, health, and protection of the environment.  The Mehoopany site has had a strong history of reducing waste, discharge and emissions, and has actively pursued pollution prevention as a business strategy.  This site has reduced it wastes to landfill by over 85% since 1983, voluntarily reduced wastewater discharges by over 38% since 1985, and reduced air emissions by 9% since 1985.  In 1994, the site eliminated the use of chlorine in pulp bleaching, and eliminated rail car storage of chlorine.  P&G has received numerous environmental awards, US EPA 33/50 Success Story for chlorine bleaching elimination in '94, the Governor's Waste Minimization Award in '94, the including the Pennsylvania Governor's Award for Environmental Excellence in 1996 for ammonia nitrogen reduction, and continued recognition in Renew America's \"Environmental Success Index\" for our recycling & pollution prevention results from '90 to '97.  The Mehoopany site has also had a strong record of compliance with environmental laws and regulations.  We also receive a Business for the Bay award in 2002 from the Cheasapeake Bay Foundation for our reduction on nutrients to the Suquehanna River.

Although not a raw material used directly in our products, Chlorine is  used to disinfect the water processes to prevent bacteria growth, not unlike many other municipal water and wastewater treatment plants.  \r\n\r\nChlorine is delivered to our site by dedicated trucks which carry multiple one ton containers of chlorine. These containers are made of heavy gauge metals appropriate for chlorine storage and are designed for sturdy handling and exposure to the elements.  Empty containers of chlorine are delivered and replaced by the supplier on-site.  There are three locations where the one ton (2,000 pounds) chlorine containers are stored and used.  The storage containers are above ground, and are protected by barricades.  The chlorine containers are monitored every shift and routine maintenance of the containers are performed by the chlorine supplier.  Chlorine is completely consumed in the reactions in our processes. \r\n\r\nA number of safety systems are in place at the P&G Mehoopany site to reduce the potential for accidental releases and to quickly respond to those which might occur. The process design and operating systems are continually assessed and improved through a procedure detailed by the OSHA regulations for Process Safety Management (PSM) which is also used to identify potential points from which chlorine may spill or leak from the process.  These points have received special consideration during the process design, the training of operators and maintenance personnel, and in the development of our accident prevention and response systems.  The studies are updated routinely by a team of specially trained and qualified employees and engineers.  Training, maintenance, controls, operating practices, and purchasing requirements are updated based on the results of these hazard studies.  The re"

Improvements resulting from these assessments over the last five years included improvement in the tubing in the chlorine process to a more robust material, improved labeling, improved access for chlorine cylinder deliveries, installation of barricades around the cylinders, and more rigorous and routine process checks and inspections.\r\n\r\nA formal change management system is employed on site for any and all changes to process systems.  The system includes a review of proposed changes by a group of individuals who are highly skilled in their fields of expertise.  Changes are proposed, reviewed, and adjustments made as necessary to ensure personnel, process, and environmental safety is maintained.   \r\n\r\nRELEASE SCENARIOS - ASSESSMENT PUBLIC IMPACTS\r\n\r\nIn order to meet the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP), the site has assessed a \"worst case\" and an \"alternative\" release scenario and considered the potential community effect which is summarized here.\r\n\r\nA \"worst case scenario\" is defined by the EPA as an instantaneous release of the single largest vessel (one storage cylinder), outdoors, during a time of light winds and stable weather conditions.  An instantaneous release of this kind is assumed to release the entire contents of one of the chlorine containers. The worst case release assumes that no emergency response would occur, even though both the on-site emergency response team and the HAZMAT team contracted by the community are trained to respond to this type of scenario.  The spill of an entire storage container would disperse into the air. \r\n\r\nThe EPA defines an \"alternative release scenario\" as a ten minute release from a more likely scenario that would migrate off-site, and assumes more normal weather conditions.

The repair/capping systems and/or valves to shut down the chlorine system would be activated well within ten minutes.\r\n\r\nEPA Risk Management Program Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants (published October 1998) was utilized to estimate the distance a chlorine vapor cloud (at a certain concentration predetermined by EPA) could travel in the unlikely event of the worst case scenario or alternative release scenario as defined above. Since the winds would blow the cloud in only one direction (or would disperse the cloud more quickly if it was to blow in multiple directions), and given that chorine gas is heavier than air, chlorine would follow low land/stream areas. Therefore, the impacts presented above would overestimate the impact of a worst case release.\r\n\r\nThe site's worst case and alternative release scenarios have offsite consequences.\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE\r\nThe goal of the safety & environmental programs at P&G is prevention - it is our first line of defense.  Our chlorine systems have numerous process controls, alarm systems, and emergency shut-down procedures.  Highly skilled and qualified technicians monitor the process round the clock from three control rooms equipped with computers that monitor the processes chlorine is fed to, and also contain detailed inventory tracking logs.  Chlorine containers are only switched when a container goes empty and deliveries to replenish the supply at the various locations are done in one delivery to minimize the unlikely event of accidental leaks or spills.  \r\n\r\nIn the event of an accident, the site has systems to respond to the spill or leak quickly to minimize impacts.  Spills or leaks of chlorine can be quickly communicated to emergency responders by personnel on the scene from phones located in the control rooms, cell phones, or by hand-held two-way radios carried by many personnel and a plant wide alarm system.

The drills allow the opportunity to train new responders, to refresh the skills of the experienced responders, and to improve the communications and response systems.  Equipment that may be used to respond during a real emergency, such as a water spray system and emergency response protective equipment, is employed during these drills.  The local fire department, LEPC, and EMA have been toured through the site to make them aware of hazards and risks on site, and where critical materials are stored.\r\n\r\nAll of the chlorine system operator & maintenance technicians have been qualified in all of our standard operating procedures.  The operating procedures include both routine and non-routine operations.  A total of fifty employees are trained as part of a Hazardous Materials Team (HAZMAT), and eight to ten HAZMAT Team members are available on each shift.  All employees participate in the emergency response drills held once every three years and complete refresher training on the systems annually.
