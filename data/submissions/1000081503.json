Chlorine is stored at the Cement Hill Water Treatment Plant and is used for the treatment of public drinking water for the city of Suisun.\r\n\r\nIt is the intent of the SSWA to comply with the regulations pertaining to management of acutely hazardous materials.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal and state rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle chlori"

PREVENTION PROGRAM\r\n\r\nSafety Information\r\nChlorine is the chemical regulated by this standard.  The Material Safety Data Sheet(MSDS) contained in the MSDS booklet contains information regarding:\r\n\r\n> Toxicity\r\n> Permissible exposure limit (PEL)\r\n> Physical\r\n> Corrosivity\r\n> Thermal and chemical stability\r\n> Reactivity\r\n\r\nChlorine is non-explosive and non-flammable; however, like oxygen, it is an oxidizer and is capable of supporting combustion of certain substances.  Chlorine has a characteristic penetrating and irritating odor.  The gas is greenish yellow in color and the liquid is clear amber.\r\n\r\nThe chlorine utilized at the Cement Hill Treatment Plant is isolated from other chemicals stored on site.  The possibility of mixing of incompatible chemicals is negligible.\r\n\r\n1.

COMPRESSED GAS.  STRONG OXIDIZER.  Contact with combustible materials may cause fire or explosion.  Reacts violently or explosively with many substances.  Reacts with water to form corrosive hydrochloric and hypochlorous \r\nacids.  Confined space hazard.  VERY TOXIC.  May be fatal if inhaled.  Extremely irritating to the respiratory tract.  Causes lung injury and effects may be delayed.  CORROSIVE to the eyes and skin.  Liquefied gas can cause frostbite and corrosive injury to the eyes and skin.  Burns and permanent damage, including blindness may result.  Very toxic to aquatic organisms.  Can cause damage to vegetation.  Read the entire MSDS for a more thorough evaluation of the hazards.\r\n \r\nPotential Health Effects:\r\n \r\nGeneral: Chlorine normally exists as a gas at room temperature and the most important route of exposure is inhalation, followed by eye and skin exposures.  Liquefied chlorine can freeze skin tissues. \r\n\r\nInhalation: Chlorine is a severe nose, throat and upper respiratory tract irritant.  People exposed to chlorine, even for short periods of time, can develop a tolerance to its odor and irritating properties.  In mild exposures, clinical signs include rhinorrhea, cough, headache, sore throat, chest pain, dyspnea, nausea and pulmonary function deficits.  After more severe exposures, clinical signs include rhinorrhea, ulcerative tracheobronchitis, \r\npulmonary edema, respiratory failure and death.\r\n \r\nThe following is a listing of chlorine exposure thresholds and estimated clinical effects:\r\n> 0.2 - 0.4 ppm - odor threshold (with considerable variation among subjects) (decrease \r\nin odor perception occurs over time).\r\n> 5 - 15 ppm - moderate irritation of the respiratory tract\r\n> 30 ppm - immediate chest pain, v"

Direct contact with the liquefied gas escaping from its pressurized cylinder can cause frostbite.  Symptoms of mild frostbite include numbness, prickling and itching in the affected area.  Symptoms of more severe frostbite include a burning sensation and stiffness of the affected area.  The skin may become waxy white or yellow.\r\n \r\nEye Contact: Chlorine gas is a severe eye irritant.

Direct contact with liquefied chlorine escaping from its high-pressure cylinder may cause frostbite.  Burns and permanent damage, including blindness may result.\r\n \r\nIngestion: Ingestion is not an applicable route of exposure for gases.\r\n \r\nExisting Medical Conditions Possibly Aggravated by Exposure: Asthma, bronchitis, emphysema and other lung diseases and chronic nose, sinus or throat, and cardiac conditions.\r\n \r\nChronic Effects: A small number of human population studies conducted have not shown significant respiratory system effects in workers with long-term, low-level (typically less than 1 ppm) chlorine exposure.  One study examined 332 workers exposed to time- weighted average (TWA) concentrations of between 0.006 and 1.42 ppm (0.15-ppm average) for an average of 10.9 years.  No relationship was found between exposure to chlorine and the occurrence of colds, breathing difficulties, and abnormal heartbeat or chest pain.  Significant effects on lung function were not observed.  Studies of workers who have had experienced one or more exposures to chlorine which produced short-term \r\nhealth effects tend to show long-term lung dysfunction.\r\n \r\nCarcinogenicity: Chlorine is not classified as carcinogenic by ACGIH (American Conference"

However, chlorine is a strong oxidizing agent and poses a serious fire and explosion risk because it promotes combustion, like oxygen.  Most combustible materials will ignite and/or burn in chlorine atmospheres, forming irritating and toxic gases.  Containers or cylinders may rupture \r\nviolently due to over-pressurization, if exposed to fire or excessive heat for a sufficient period of time.  Intense local heat (above 200A\u00b8C) on the steel walls of chlorine cylinders can cause an iron/chlorine fire resulting in rupture of the container.  Cylinder and ton containers will vent through fusible plugs at 71A\u00b8C (160A\u00b8F).  Chlorine gas is heavier than air and will collect and persist in pits, hollows, depressions, and other confined or low-lying \r\nareas.\r\n \r\nExtinguishing Media: Use extinguishing media appropriate to surrounding fire conditions, such as dry chemical powder, carbon dioxide, or foam.\r\n \r\nFire Fighting Procedures: Apply water from as far a distance as possible, in flooding quantities as a spray or fog to keep fire-exposed cylinders, containers or equipment cool and absorb heat, until well after the fire is out.

The containers contain chlorine in a liquid and a gas phase.  The containers are a short ton each.  The heads are convex inward and forge welded to the barrel.  The sides are crimped inward at each end to form chimes which provide a substantial grip for lifting beams.  A removable steel valve protective housing protects the container valves.  Each ton container is equipped with two identical valves near the center of one end.  These valves are standard ton container valves.  They differ from the standard cylinder valve only in that they have no fusible metal plug and have a larger internal passage.  Each valve connects within internal eduction pipe.  The containers are equipped with fusible metal pressure relief devices.  Most have six fusible metal plugs, three in each end spaced 120A\u00b8 apart.  The fusible metal is designed to yield or melt between 158 and 165A\u00b8F to relieve pressure and prevent rupture of the container in case of fire or other exposure to high temperature.\r\n\t\t\r\n5. Engineering Controls:\r\n\r\na) The chlorine storage building is equipped with chlorine leak detectors that alarm when chlorine is detected.\r\nb) The chlorine storage building is vented low to the ground so if a leak does occur, and employees are present in the building, then the leak will vent to the outside.\r\nc) On-line cylinders are contained in a T.G.O. Technologies Containment Vessel.  A brochure for this equipment is included in this document.\r\n\r\nC. Hazard Review\r\n\r\nBased on a review of all operating procedures, as outlined in the Injury and Illness Prevention Program (IIPP).  SSWA has concluded that chlorine leaks are the hazard involved in the chlorination process.  The following addresses the hazards of the chlorination process, the engineering and administrative controls applicable to chlorine leaks and their relationships,"

      "SummaryText": "consequences of failure of those controls, and the consequences of the effects on all workplace employees in or near the process area.\r\n\r\n1. Chemical Release\r\n\r\na) Continuous Release:\r\n\r\nChlorine can be released from a point source over a period of time.  An example of such a release is a leak through a faulty flange or improper connection.  Such a leak will get worse until the condition is corrected.  Until that time, the downwind hazards will continue.\r\n\r\nb) Slug Release:\r\n\r\nA slug release will occur if a vessel incurs a large puncture or rupture.  In the case of a puncture in the upper (vapor) portion of the vessel about one-fourth of the liquid (depending on the liquid temperature) will rapidly evaporate or \"flash off.. \r\n\r\nThis will cool the remaining liquid to the atmospheric boiling point.  The evaporation rate of the remaining liquid primarily depends on the heat input from the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nIn the case of a puncture in the liquid phase, liquid will be expelled through the hole until the liquid level drops to the lip of the opening.  Most of the liquid expelled will \"flash off\" as it comes out of the tank, but some may spill on the ground.  The evaporation rate of the spilled liquid depends on heat input from the ground and from the sun.  Reducing the surface area of the spill will reduce the evaporation rate.  The addition of water streams \r\nwill provide additional heat and will increase the evaporation rate.\r\n\r\nThe area and exposure duration depend upon the total quantity released, the rate of release, the height of the release point, and weather conditions.  Chlorine downwind can vary from barely detectable to high concentrations.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Hazards to Health\r\n\r\na) General\r\n\r\nChlorine gas is primarily a respiratory irritant it is so intensely irritating that low concentrations in air are readily detectable by the normal person.

At chlorine concentrations above 5 PPM the gas is very irritating and it is unlikely that any \r\nperson would remain in such an exposure for more than a very brief time unless she/he is trapped or unconscious.\r\n\r\nb) Acute Toxicity\r\n\r\nIn concentrations near the threshold of smell, chlorine gas will, after several hours of exposure, cause mild irritation of the eyes of the mucous membrane of the respiratory tract.  As concentrations increase there is an increase in the irritation effect on the eyes coughing mechanism and on the upper and lower respiratory tract with eventual difficulty in breathing.  As the duration of exposure and/or the concentration increase, the affected \r\nindividual may become apprehensive and restless with coughing accompanied by throat irritation, sneezing, and excess salivation.  At higher levels there is vomiting associated with labored breathing.  In extreme cases difficulty in breathing can progress to the point \r\nof death through suffocation.\r\n\r\nLiquid chlorine in contact with the eyes or skin will cause local irritation and/or burns.  All symptoms and signs result directly or indirectly from its direct irritation action.  There are no known systemic effects.\r\n\r\nc) Chronic Toxicity\r\n\r\nLow concentrations of chlorine gas in the air may have minor irritation effects or may produce slight symptoms after several hours of exposure, but careful examination of persons repeatedly exposed to such conditions reportedly has shown no permanent physiological effect. \r\n\r\nThe maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects or symptoms which could impair an individuals ability to take protective action.

For chlorine, this value is 20 PPM as established by AIHA.  \r\n\r\n1) Vegetation:\r\n\r\nChlorine causes bleach spots on leafy plants due to attack on chlorophyll in the leaf.  Mature leaves are most susceptible to chlorine injury.  Usually the plant itself is not destroyed although yield or growth rate may be retarded.\r\n\r\n2) Animals:\r\n\r\nThe United States National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) \"Registry of Toxic Effects of Chemical Substances\" lists the\tfollowing inhalation LC's (concentration of chlorine in air lethal to 50% of the defined \r\nanimal, exposed over the specified time period):\r\n\r\nHuman\t\t-840 ppm/30 minutes\r\nRat\t\t-293 ppm/60 minutes\r\nMouse\t\t-137ppm/60minutes\r\n\r\nFor an unspecified species of mammal the lowest concentration of chlorine in air (other than LC's) which has been reported to cause death in humans or animals is listed as 500 ppm/5 minutes.\r\n\r\n3. Administrative Controls:\r\n\r\na) All employees will be properly trained in accordance with the training outlined in this document.  The training is cross-referenced with SSWA's IIPP.  The training outlines leak control procedures as well as emergency measures in the event of a leak.\r\nb) All employees who perform work operations around the chlorine storage areas, including but not limited to changing chlorine storage containers, will be equipped with and trained to use the proper protective gear including safety suits and air packs.\r\nc) All employees who change chlorine containers will be trained in the use of the B patch kits for leak repair.\r\nd) Employees will be instructed that if a chlorine leak is uncontrollable, then the SSWA \"Emergency Response Plan\" takes effect.

Safety, operating, maintenance, and emergency procedures are in place and adequate.  Training of each employee involved in operating a process has been completed. \r\n\r\n\r\nL. Employee Participation Plan\r\n\r\nThe Superintendent and/or Supervisor shall consult with employees and their representatives on the development and implementation of all process safety as it relates to any RMP regulated substances.  In particular, employees will participate in process hazard analysis and be consulted as to how the other elements of the prevention program are carried out.  At a minimum, total process review will be done and documented with all employees annually.\r\n\r\nM. Hot work Permits   \r\n\r\nHot work refers to spark or flame producing operations such as welding, brazing, metal cutting, grinding, sand blasting, etc.  The Supervisor will issue a hot work permit describing the hazards of the work to be done and the needed precautions to prevent fires.  The permit shall also indicate the date authorized for the work to be done and identify the object on which the hot work will be performed.  The permit will be kept on file until completion of the hot work operations.  \r\n    \r\nIV. EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM  \r\n\r\nA. Chlorine Leaks\r\n\r\nAs soon as there is any indication of the presence of chlorine in the air, immediate steps will be taken to correct the conditions.\r\n\r\nChlorine leaks always get worse if they are not promptly corrected.  When a chlorine leak occurs, authorized, trained personnel equipped with suitable respiratory protection, will investigate and take action.  No person should work alone on a chlorine leak.  All other persons should be kept away from the affect area until the leak has been stopped and the residual chlorine dispersed.  If the emission is extensive, all persons in the path of the fumes should be evacuated by the proper authorities."

      "SummaryText": "Potentially exposed persons should move to a point upwind of the leak.  Because chlorine is heavier than air, higher elevations are preferable.  To escape in the shortest time, persons already in contaminated areas should move crosswind.  When outdoors without respiratory protection, a wet handkerchief or cloth will reduce the effects of exposure.\r\n\r\nIf inside a building and evacuations seems to be impractical, all windows should be closed and air conditioners and air intake systems turned off.  Personnel should retreat to the highest point of the building on the side away from the break.\r\n\r\nIf the leak is of a serious nature, the SSWA \"Emergency Response Plan\" will be initiated.  \r\nWhen calling for assistance the following information should be provided:\r\n\r\n1) Company name, address, telephone number, and the person to contact for further information.\r\n2) Description of the emergency.\r\n3) Travel directions to the site.\r\n4) Type and  of container involved.\r\n5) Corrective measures being applied.\r\n6) Other pertinent information regarding the weather conditions, injuries etc.\r\n\r\nIf the leak is serious the local Authorities must be notified to effect any necessary evacuation.  All personnel at the Cement Hill Treatment Plant who are involved in the handling of chlorine or could be involved in an emergency will be trained in emergency procedures as out lined in training section of this document.\r\n\r\nB. Fire\r\n\r\nIf a fire is present or threatened, chlorine containers should be moved away from the fire. If a non-leaking container cannot be moved, it should be kept cool by spraying water on it.  If the container is leaking, water should not be used.  Chlorine and water react, and acids are formed that will corrode the container and the leak quickly will get worse.  However, where several containers are involved and some are leaking, it may be prudent to use water \r\nto prevent rupture of the non-leaking containers.

CEMENT HILL WATER TREATMENT PLANT RESPONSE PROCEDURES FOR CHLORINE LEAKS\r\n\r\nWHEN HANDLING ANY CHOLORINE LEAK, THERE MUST BE A MINIMUM OF TWO AUTHORIZED CHLORINE PERSONNEL RESPONDING TO LEAK.\r\n\r\nA. The following positions are authorized chlorine response personnel:\r\n1. Water Treatment and Water Quality Supervisor\r\n2. Water Treatment Operator Shift\r\n\r\nB. Upon discovery of a chlorine leak and if determined by operator on duty to be a minor leak, prior to proceeding to corrective actions, a request for leak response assistance will be made to authorized chlorine response personnel in numerical order of section \r\n(A) until a second authorized response person is at the leak site for assistance.\r\n\r\nC. An example of corrective action responses to be taken are as follows but not limited to:\r\n\r\n1. Donning self contained breathing apparatus.\r\n2. If chlorine leak is in liquid form, attempt to turn the container so that the leak is at the top of the cylinder, thereby the chlorine leaking will be in a gaseous state.\r\n3. Insert leaking cylinder into containment vessel for future use in treatment processes.\r\n4. If unable to insert leaking cylinder into containment vessel, neutralize cylinder leak area with (B) kit application.\r\n5. If determined to be a major leak, operator will call the following in order: \r\n\t\r\n1) Fairfield Fire                       911\r\n2) Tom Campbell                         707-299-8881\r\n3) Kevin King                           707-470-9867\r\n4) National Response Center\t\t800-424-880  within 15 minutes\r\n5) Solano County Department OES         707-784-1600\r\n           \t                        707-421-7090 (after hours)\r\n6) California OES                       800-852-7550\r\n7) Solano Co.

Hold eyelids apart and flush for approximately fifteen minutes.  Seek medical attention.\r\n5) Skin: Remove exposed individual and place under HAWs shower.  Remove contaminated clothing while shower is running.  Do not attempt to neutralize chlorine burns with chemicals, salves, ointments or soap.  Seek medical attention.\r\n6) Inhalation: If individual is breathing, place victim in a comfortable position and keep still and at rest until medical attention arrives.\r\n\r\n\r\nV. HAZARD ASSESSMENT\r\n\r\nA. Five Year Accident History/ Reporting\r\n \r\nAs of the date of this plan, no accidental releases of chlorine have occurred resulting in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\r\n\r\n\r\nB. External Event Analysis\r\n\r\nThe external event reviewed due to its high probability of occurrence was an earthquake event.  The analysis methodology selected is the \"What-if\" analysis.\r\n\r\nIn the event that an earthquake with a significant level of magnitude were to occur at the Cement Hill Water Treatment Plant what types of failure may take place in relation to the chlorination equipment operation and spill containment processes?  \r\n\r\n1.

Also, original copper type \"pigtail\"feed lines were replaced with Monel 400 transfer hoses with type 302 stainless steel guard.  If these were to fail the escaping gas from this hose would be contained within the containment vessel. \r\n\r\n2. What if an earthquake induced power outage was to occur?\r\n\r\nAll ancillary emergency electrical equipment for the containment vessels (leak detectors, shut-off valves, alarms) are powered during electrical outages with on-site diesel powered electric generators.  If for some reason these generators do not respond as designed all chlorine delivery will be automatically stopped via back-up nitrogen supplied shut-off valves.\r\n\r\n3. What if the containment vessels were to be moved from their foundations and exterior ancillary equipment on the containment vessels were to be damaged or detached? \r\n\r\nThe containment vessels are mounted to an 8-inch concrete slab with 12 stainless steel bolts.  If these were to fail allowing the vessel to move severing the chlorine transfer piping to process, the automatic vacuum operated chlorine regulators would close stopping the flow.  Consequences of failure or damage to the automatic shut-off valve are \r\ndescribed in the RMP description of \"Alternative release data analysis\" for an opening in the vessel.\r\n\r\nOperations staff is trained biannually in the use of self contained breathing apparatus and the application of emergency leak repair kits for use on one ton chlorine cylinder."
