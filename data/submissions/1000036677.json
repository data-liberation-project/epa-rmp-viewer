      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary for Perdue Foods, LLC Salisbury, Maryland, Poultry Processing Plant\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE FACILITY AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCE:\n\n\n\nThe Perdue Foods Salisbury facility is located in Wicomico County, Maryland, in the town of Salisbury.  The facility is a poultry processing plant which employs approximately 630 associates to receive broiler and cornish meat plus other raw ingredients to form and prepare for distribution to the market place.  The facility normally operates 24 hours per day, 5 days per week.\n\n\n\nThe regulated substance at the Salisbury facility, covered by 40 CFR Part 68, is anhydrous ammonia (R-717).  The facility utilizes anhydrous ammonia as integral part of its refrigeration system, which consists of several storage vessels, compressors, condensers, piping and air handling units throughout the processing plant in order to maintain proper food safety temperatures.  The total system capacity of anhydrous ammonia on-site is 49,000 pounds distributed throughout the refrigeration components, although the normal operating inventory maintained is approximately 23,000 pounds.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES:\n\nAs a concerned member of the community, the company takes its role as a responsible corporate citizen very seriously.  All Perdue facilities are operated to protect employees, contractors, and the public from injury and illness, and to minimize environmental impact.  A company-wide safety and wellness program stresses safe conditions and safe practices.  Perdue's policy is to inspect, maintain and operate equipment and facilities to prevent accidents, including release of hazardous materials; and to train employees in prevention, as well as to prepare them to respond rapidly and effectively should an accident occur.\n\n\n\nPerdue Farms has developed and implemented Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasures (SPCC) and Process Safety Management (PSM) plans as part of an overall chemical management program.
