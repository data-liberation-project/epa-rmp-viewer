Using the criteria outlined in the ARP rule this mixture represents the facility's worst-case scenario for flammables.\n \nAcetylene\n \nThe largest quantity of acetylene at the facility is contained in a pressure cylinder having a capacity of approximately 375 cubic feet (26 lbs).   With 3 cylinders colocated at the facility, the total quantity of acetylene is approximately 78 lbs.  Therefore, the threshold quantity for this substance was not exceeded.  Accordingly, acetylene will only be addressed under the general duty clause as outlined in Section 112(r)(1) of the 1990 CAA Amendments.\n \nDiesel No. 2\n \nDiesel No. 2 is a mixture containing regulated flammable substances which is stored at the facility in a storage tank.  The tank has a capacity of approximately 1,000 gallons (6,100 lbs.).  EPFS has determined that diesel No. 2 has a NFPA flammability hazard rating of 3.  Based on the List Rule (40 CFR Part 68, Subpart C, Section 68.115 (b)(2)), a flammability hazard rating of less than 4 exempts diesel No. 2 from hazard evaluation.  Accordingly, diesel No. 2 will only be addressed under the general duty clause as outlined in Section 112(r)(1) of the 1990 CAA Amendments. \n\nCondensate\n \nThe largest quantity of condensate at the facility is stored in two containers with a total storage capacity of  8,000 barrels (2,352,000 lbs).  Condensate at the facility is a naturally occurring hydrocarbon mixture that is stored prior to its entry into the processing plant.  According to 40 CFR 68.115(b)(2)(iii), regulated substances in naturally occurring hydrocarbon mixtures stored for this purpose need not be considered when determining whether more than a threshold quantity is present at a stationary source. Accordingly, condensate will only be addressed under the general duty clause as outlined in Section 112(r)(1) of the 1990 CAA Amendments.\n \nGasoline\n\nThe largest quant"

This participation begins with well established mechanisms of communication with all employees regarding covered process information.  Employees are involved in maintaining PSM rule compliance based on their knowledge, skill, job responsibilities, and experience.  Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the plant and addresses each accident prevention program element. \n\nProcess Safety Information \n\nThe Chaco Cryogenic Plant maintains written information intended to provide a foundation for identifying and understanding the hazards involved in the process.  This information addresses chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  Specific departments within the gas plant are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.  \n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs).  This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.

For the consequence analysis, a gaseous release of the total quantity is assumed to occur in 10 minutes, regardless of storage conditions.   For toxic liquids, the total quantity in a vessel is assumed to be spilled onto a flat, non-absorbing surface.  For toxic liquids carried in pipelines, the quantity that might be released for the pipeline is assumed to form a pool.  Passive mitigation systems may be taken into account in consequence analysis for both toxic gases and liquids. The endpoint for air dispersion modeling to estimate the consequence distance for a release of a toxic gas and liquid is presented for each regulated toxic gas and liquid in Appendix B of the OCAGD in Exhibits B-1 and B-2, respectively.\n\nThe Chaco Cryogenic Plant does not have any toxic substances held above the threshold quantity.  Analysis of one worst-case release scenario for all regulated toxic substances is, therefore, not required.\n\nAlternative Release Scenarios (ARS)\n\nAn ARS describes an incident that is more likely to occur than those cited for a WCS.  One ARS analysis is required for each listed toxic substance in a covered process that exceeds threshold quantity while only one ARS analysis is required for all flammable substances as a class.  For ARSs, both active and passive mitigation systems can be considered.\n \nAlternative release scenarios for flammable substances should have the potential to cause substantial damage, including on-site damage.  Alternative release scenarios for toxic substances should be those that lead to concentrations above the toxic endpoint beyond the process fenceline.  Those releases that have the potential to reach the public are of the greatest concern.\n\nFlammable Substances\n\nA single"

A hypothetical, but likely to occur, release scenario has been identified for the flammable mixture as follows.  Seal failure on the flammable mixture pump causes a release from a one-inch opening at 850 psig  and 2500F.  The release is assumed to continue for ten minutes.  The flammable mixture will vaporize and may ignite a vapor cloud explosion with an endpoint of 1 psi overpressure. \n \nIt was determined that a 10-minute release would involve 7,574 pounds of the flammable mixture.  According to Exhibit C-2 (Appendix C) of the OCAGD, the lower flammability limit (LFL) for the flammable mixture is 36 mg/l.  Using the appropriate table (Table 20), it was determined that the release of  this amount of a dense gas in a rural area would result in an ARS endpoint distance of  0.12 miles.\n\nToxic Substances\n\nThe Chaco Cryogenic Plant does not have any toxic substances held above the threshold quantity.  Analysis of each regulated toxic substance is, therefore, not required.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nEPFS reported that an accidental release has occurred at the Chaco Cryogenic Plant within the past five years.  An investigation completed by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) determined that the accident occurred as a result of a system design error and, further, disclosed no violations of the New Mexico Health and Safety Act by the company.  After reviewing EFPSs emergency response policies and procedures, OSHA acknowledged that the company's \u0005sophisticated safety and health program and practiced training program limited the [number of onsite] injuries\u0005.  In addition, no known offsite consequences resulted from this accidental release.  According to 40 CFR 68.10, this accidental release does not, therefore, affect program applicability. \n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the plant.

This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment.  In combination with written procedures and trained personnel, this information provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised. \n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\nThe Chaco Cryogenic Plant has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nThe Chaco Cryogenic Plant primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) study to perform these evaluations.  A HAZOP study uses a highly structured approach where process parameters such as flow and temperature are examined for deviations from their assigned intent.  The effects of these deviations are considered to determine if potential hazards will result and preliminary recommendations for possible improvements may be proposed.    \n\nThe PHA team findings are promptly and systematically addressed.  The Chaco Plant assures that the recommendations are resolved in a timely manner and that the resolution is documented.   This documentation includes the actions to be taken, a written schedule of  completion dates, and proof of communication with operating, maintenance, and other employees whose work assignments are in the process and who may be affected by the recommendations or actions.\n\nTo help"

These periodic reviews are conducted at least every five years by the PHA team.  \n\nOperating Procedures\n\nThe Chaco Cryogenic Plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1)  initial startup, (2)  normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4)  emergency shutdown, (5)  emergency operations, (6)  normal shutdown, and (7) startup following a turnaround or after an emergency shutdown.  These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  These procedures are periodically reviewed and certified as current and accurate when a process change occurs.  The procedures are kept current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.\n\nTraining\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the Chaco Cryogenic Plant has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  New employees receive job specific basic training in gas plant operations if the are not already familiar with such operations. This includes both classroom and on the job training followed by demonstrations, observations, and written tests.  After operators demonstrate having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner, they can work independently. \n\nContractors\n\nThe Chaco Cryogenic Plant periodically uses contractors to perform maintenance or repair, turnaround, major renovations, or specialty work on  or adjacent to a covered process.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) are trained in the work practices necessary to safely perform his/her job, (2) have r"

The endpoint for a WCS involving a regulated flammable substance or mixture is an over pressure of 1 pound per square inch (psi).  For a regulated flammable substance, consequence distance determination is based on its heat of combustion.  For regulated flammable mixtures, the component with the highest heat of combustion can be used for consequence distance determination or, if preferred, directly calculated using equation C-1 of the Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance Document (OCAGD).  The quantity of a regulated substance/mixture used to determine distance to endpoint is the largest quantity of a regulated substance/mixture in a single vessel.                                                                     \n \nThe flammable mixture, containing pentane, propane, butane, methane, and ethane, is in either liquid or gas form and sent via pipeline for fractionation.  The largest quantity is stored in liquid form and contained in any one of four storage vessels each having the capacity of 99,750 gallons (380,716 lbs.).  Using the criteria outlined in the ARP rule, this mixture represents the facility's WCS for flammables.\n \nThe distance to endpoint of 1 psi overpressure for the flammable mixture is determined by using OCAGD equations.  Because methane was identified as having the highest heat of combustion (50,029 kjoule/kg) while acting only as a minor component (0.002 liq %), it was determined that the direct calculation method, using methane's heat of combustion, would provide a more accurate consequence distance.  The calculation resulted in a WCS distance to endpoint radius of 0.58 miles.  The distance to endpoint exceeds the distance to an identified public receptor.  In accordance with ARP regulations, the identification of this exceedance meets the applicable criteria of an assigned program and classi"

Gasoline stored at the facility is used as a fuel for internal combustion engines.  According to 40 CFR 68.115(b)(2)(ii), the regulated substances found in gasoline and stored for this purpose are exempt from threshold determination. Accordingly, gasoline will only be addressed under the general duty clause as outlined in Section 112(r)(1) of the 1990 CAA Amendments.\n\nEPFS identified five regulated flammable substances/mixtures and zero regulated toxic substances along with the total quantity stored.  Listed flammable substances which are stored above threshold quantities at the Chaco Cryogenic Plant include a flammable mixture (natural gas and NGL products) and condensate.  EPFS has determined, however, the regulated substances in condensate are exempt from threshold determination according to 40 CFR 68.115(b)(2)(iii).  The identification of the flammable mixture indicates that Chaco Cryogenic Plant is a covered process with a regulated substance subject to threshold determination for offsite consequence analysis.\n\nOFF-SITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS RESULTS\n\nWorst-Case Scenarios (WCS)\n\nThe Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has defined a worst-case release as the release of the largest quantity of a regulated substance from a vessel or process line failure that results in the greatest distance to a specified endpoint.  A WCS analysis is required for each toxic substance in a covered process while only one WCS analysis is required for regulated flammable substances as a class.  WCSs are assumed to occur at ground level with meteorological conditions defined as atmospheric stability class F (stable atmosphere), wind speed of 1.0 meters per second (2.2 miles per hour), and an ambient air temperature of 25:C (770F).

      "SummaryText": "ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nThe EL Paso Field Services (EPFS) Chaco Cryogenic Plant has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the facility's processes.  The EPFS policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of substances.  However, if a release does occur, gas plant trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOUCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nEPFS operates the Chaco Cryogenic Plant located in San Juan County, New Mexico.  The Chaco Cryogenic Plant is a liquid extraction plant capable of recovering ethane in addition to propane, butanes, and gasoline from the inlet gas.  Mixed liquids product is then delivered via a pipeline that has the capacity to transport liquids containing ethane.  As evidenced in the ensuing text and based on criteria outlined in the Accidental Release Prevention Program (ARP), the Chaco Cryogenic Plant is a Program 3 process.\n\nThe Chaco Cryogenic Plant was evaluated to determine if any regulated flammable or toxic substances exceeded the threshold quantity.  Based on process knowledge, EPFS identified the regulated substances and quantities kept on site. \n\nFlammable  Mixture (Natural Gas, NGL Products)\n \nThis material is a mixture of pentane, propane, butane, methane, and ethane contained in pressurized storage vessels in either liquid or gas form and sent via pipeline for fractionation.
