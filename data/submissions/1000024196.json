The Plant is also committed to its neighbors and surrounding community by ensuring the facility does not pose an unreasonable risk.  The Plant complies with all applicable laws and strives to conserve energy, water and raw materials and to reduce waste as well as through the use of environmentally friendly and lower risk materials where possible.  The Plant will seek to continuously improve its EHS performance. \nThe following outlines the principles St. Louis Plant will use to ensure compliance with the Environmental, Health and Safety policy:\n- Develop and implement EHS management systems that lead to continuous EHS performance improvement.\n- Identify measureable leading performance indicators that will be used to set objective and targets for continuous improvement.\n- Educate and train site personnel to ensure understanding of their responsibilities related to EHS regulations and requirements.\n- Encourage employee involvement in EHS related activities onsite.\n- Communicate EHS policies and performance to employees.\n- Reduce risk associated with activities as it relates to employee protection and environmental and community impacts.\n- Recognize and respond to employee and community concerns regarding EHS compliance and impact.\n\n\nThis document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including:\n-A description of our facility and use of substances regulate"

The facility is located on a 40-acre parcel in St. Louis, MO and is comprised of about 50 buildings containing manufacturing operations, research and development, utility services, and warehousing.\n\nThe EPA-regulated substances are chlorine and chloroform. Chlorine is utilized to manufacture the contrast media agents.  Chlorine is staged and then delivered one cylinder at a time for usage in a reaction to manufacture the contrast media. Chloroform is stored in 55-gallon drums in the Building 76 warehouse and outside the B235 process area. Chloroform is used to manufacture pharmaceutical products in Building 235.  Additionally, a bulk storage tank was installed for B235 to store the waste chloroform that is used in the process.  This project made the process safer by: creating a single storage point for the chloroform waste rather than in multiple drums; reducing the possibilities of a drum handling incident; and providing many more safeguards to prevent overflow and incompatibilities during transfer.\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nMallinckrodt handles thousands of pounds of chlorine and chloroform each year.  There have been no incidents which have involved deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on or off-site, and there are no instances of adverse i"

The program meets the requirements of OSHA and EPA for protection of the safety of our employees and the community and provides for the protection of the environment.    Our emergency response program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.  This program includes interface with the LEPC and St. Louis St. Fire Department and has been audited by state and federal agencies many times.  Mallinckrodt works closely with the local response organizations, has included representatives as drill observers, and supports responder training through the loan of equipment and facilities for training purposes.\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nMallinckrodt uses a variety of means to prevent accidental releases.  These include written procedures and training, preventive maintenance, change management and permitting procedures, incident investigations, inspections, audits and drills.  Furthermore, there are many engineering controls in place that include, automatic shutdown systems, pressure relief systems, spill containment, and water and foam vapor suppression systems that provide multiple layers of protection. Active process safety engineering practices, various internal leadership teams and audits by corporate, local, state, and federal agencies further insure an environment of continuous improvement and incremental risk reduction."
