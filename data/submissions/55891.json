Five Year Accident History:\n\nCrop Production Services, Inc., Mt Sterling has an excellent safety record with no deaths or serious injuries to any of its personnel or contractors as a result of the RMP covered process.  In addition, there have been no accidents resulting in releases of ammonia with off site consequences during the entire operations period.  The Mt Sterling plant was presented with a Safety Award for 1998 for No OSHA Recordable Incidents.  Extensive programs and procedures are in place to maintain that record. \n\nE.  In years past, the Mt Sterling plan has received nuisance odor complaints.  In 1996, the plant was voluntarily redesigned to eliminate this problem.  A totally new design was adopted; new equipment was installed; and subsequent environmental control was assured with the performance of a stack test.  As of this date, no more nuisance odor complaints have been made.  As a result, our relationship with the neighbors and community has greatly improved.  \n\nF.  Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThe Mt Sterling plant continuously looks for ways to enhance the safety of the plant.  Monthly safety inspections are conducted which result in corrective actions; Process Safety Management audits are conducted every three years; and corporate-sponsored comprehensive En"
