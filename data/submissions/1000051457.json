A copy of the PSI is available for review to all employees who work on or near the ammonia process equipment.\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis:\r\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our process are identified and controlled efficiently. The methodology used to carry out these analyses is the What-If/Checklist. The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of every five years. The process hazard analysis is also revalidated when there is an extensive change in the process. Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\r\n\r\nOperating Procedures:\r\nSysco Virginia maintains written operating procedures. These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial start-up, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown, and start-up after a turnaround. The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the process.\r\n\r\nTraining:\r\nSysco Virginia has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes. New employees receive basic classroom training in process operations, followed by on-the-job supervision until they are deemed competent to work independently. Refresher training is provided at least every 3 years and more frequently as needed.\r\n\r\nMechanical Integrity:\r\nSysco Virginia carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operation. Process equipment examined by these checks includes pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping system, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps. Qualified personnel carry out maintenance operations with special training in maintenance practices. Furthermore, these personnel are"

These audits are carried out at least every three years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and timely manner.\r\n\r\nIncident Investigation:\r\nSysco Virginia promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably have result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance. These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident, as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from recurring. All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\r\n\r\nEmployee Participation:\r\nSysco Virginia believes that process safety management and accident prevention are a team effort.

Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of the contractor's safety performance is completed. Sysco Virginia has a strict policy of informing contractors of known potential hazards related to the contractor's work and the process. Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency notification and evacuation, should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.\r\n\r\n4. 5-Year Accident History:\r\nThis facility has had one accidental release from the covered process in the last 5 years (10/13/2011) that had resulted in an injury and release of approximately 98 lbs. of ammonia.\r\n\r\n5. Emergency Response Plan:\r\nSysco Virginia is included in the written community emergency response plan. This facility has its own emergency action plan. The emergency action plan includes specific actions to be taken in response to accidental releases of regulated substances. The emergency action plan includes procedures for informing the public and local response agencies of a chemical release. The emergency action plan includes information on emergency health care.\r\nThe local agency coordinating the facility emergency response plan is Rockingham County Fire & Rescue, which has the phone number: 540-564-3175\r\n\r\n6. Planned Changes to Improve Safety:\r\nSeveral developments and findings have resulted from the implementation of the various elements of our accidental release prevention program.
