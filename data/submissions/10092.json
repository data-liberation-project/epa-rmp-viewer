The facility includes a building with a showroom, offices, and a shop/parts department area.  Natural gas provides the normal fuel source for heating the facility.  Propane is used as an alternative heating fuel.  In the event of a high demand for natural gas, the natural gas utility notifies us to switchover to propane.  In exchange for maintaining the propane option, the utility provides a substantial reduction in their price rate of the natural gas sold to us.  We have three people trained in conducting the tasks required for the switchover.  \n\nAccidental release prevention and emergency response policies:\nThis facility complies with NFPA-58 requirements for LP-Gas storage and applicable federal, state, and local laws.  If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to call the Saint Louis Park Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency.  We purchase our propane from suppliers/deliverers that comply with NFPA-58 requirements and applicable federal, state, and local laws.\n\nThe worst-case and alternative release scenarios: \nThe worst-case scenario is failure of one 15,000-gallon storage tank, when filled to the maximum amount allowed at 550F, resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  The resulting distance to the endpoint extends off-site and public receptors are within the distance to the endpoint.  The alternative release scenario is a break in a one-inch diameter pipe leading to a ten-minute release and a vapor cloud explosion.  The resulting distance to the endpoint extends off-site, and public receptors are within the distance to the endpoint.  \n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps: \nThis facility implements the following elements of a release prevention program: safety information, hazard review, written operating procedures, trai"

This facility is routinely inspected by the City Fire Marshal and our propane supplier for compliance with applicable State and City codes and regulations and is currently in compliance.  \n\nFive-year accident history: \nThis facility has never had an accident involving propane that caused deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage or the need for public evacuations or sheltering.\n\nThe emergency response program:  \nIn the event of an emergency involving our propane system, it is our policy to notify the Saint Louis Park Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency.  We have discussed this policy with the fire department and the Fire Marshal has inspected our propane system.\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety: \nNone"
