(DPE) is a global supplier of specialty elastomers with headquarters in Wilmington, Delaware.  DPE is a wholly owned subsidiary of the E. I. Du Pont de Nemours & Co., Inc. (DuPont).  DPE was formed on July 1, 2005. With approximately 1,200 employees worldwide, DPE offers a wide variety of specialty elastomers with end-use applications in automotive systems, wire and cable, construction, chemical processing, the general rubber industry, and in high-performance parts with excellent temperature, oil, and chemical resistance.  Examples of the end products made with DPE specialty elastomers include:\n\n\u00b7 Coatings - from rainwear to liners for roofs and tanks;\n\u00b7 Automotive products - from power steering pressure hoses to high-performance timing belts;\n\u00b7 Wire and cable insulation - from electrical wiring to power transmission cable; and\n\u00b7 Industrial applications - from protective gloves, O-rings, and gaskets to microwave door enclosures and chemical-resistant hoses.\n\nThe 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments established a statutory framework for assessing the risks to public health and the environment arising from the use of certain chemicals.  Regulations specifying what facilities must conduct these risk assessments, how to assess the risk, and what data to report were promulgated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.  These regulations are known as the Risk Management Plan (RMP) rule and are published in Part 68 of Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations (40 CFR 68). The DPE Chambers Works facility (facility) must comply with applicable sections of 40 CFR 68. This Executive Summary satisfies the RMP rule section 40 CFR \u00a7 68.155 requirements by providing a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities implemented at the facility. Topics include: \t\n\n\u00b7 the facility's accidental release prevention and emergen"

Corporate and facility goals are to prevent all employee injuries, accidental releases and process safety incidents. The facility has both corporate and local programs, procedures and management practices in place to support these goals. Performance against these goals is constantly assessed and communicated to employees. Achievement of these goals is recognized and rewarded. Failure to attain them is regarded as unacceptable performance and treated accordingly.\n\nThe DPE Chambers Works facility emergency response policy is to coordinate emergency response activities with DuPont's Chambers Works plant on-site emergency response personnel and fire department. Should an accidental release occur, appropriate emergency response actions would be taken to minimize the impact on employee safety, public health and the environment. \n\t\nSite Identification and Regulated Substances\n\nThe DPE Chambers Works facility manufactures Viton\u00ae and Kalrez\u00ae specialty elastomers that are used in industrial, automotive and aerospace applications.

Because of its DuPont heritage at Chambers Works, DPE has a broad base of knowledge for, and experience in, handling toxic and flammable substances at the facility in a safe and environmentally responsible manner.  The DPE Chambers Works facility presently has 100 employees. \n\nThree of the substances listed under the RMP regulation are handled at the facility. These substances are:\n\nToxics:\nHydrogen Chloride - Anhydrous (AHCL)\n\nFlammables:\nVinylidene Fluoride (VF2)\nTetrafluoroethylene (TFE)\n\n\nWorst-case Release Scenario(s) and Alternative Release Scenario(s)\n\nThe RMP rule requires that the worst-case release scenario(s) and alternative release scenario(s) be communicated to the public for toxic and flammable substances listed in the regulation and present at the facility above a threshold quantity.  The EPA defines the worst-case scenario as the hypothetical release of the largest quantity of a regulated chemical in a 10-minute period. The worst-case scenario assumes the entire quantity is released, even if it is impossible to do so.\n\nSince worst-case scenarios are very improbable, they are not good cases to focus on for emergency response planning with the community. To make emergency response planning more effective, alternative release scenarios are used to provide a more realistic picture of what could actually happen if facility safety systems fail. The scenarios described below were developed using the EPA Offsite Consequence Analysis (OCA) guidance reference tables or equations. Similar scenario analysis and dispersion modeling has also been used for many years as a routine part of the facility Process Safety Management (PSM) practices.\n\nThe worst-case toxic release scenario is for Hydrogen Chloride. It assumes the release of the entire storage tank contents (43,000 pounds) with no mitigation. Th"

This release scenario is unlikely due to the design and construction requirements of the storage tank, and its fitness-for-service inspection program. \n\nThe first alternative-case release scenario for Hydrogen Chloride is the discharge from pressure relief devices due to excess pressure build up within the storage tank. This scenario assumes approximately 1,000 pounds of HCL is released in a 15 minute period.  This release does not have an off site impact per EPA OCA guidelines. Administrative controls and mitigation measures for this scenario include:  a storage tank refrigeration system to control tank pressure; control room monitoring of storage tank pressure; storage tank excess pressure alarms; tank refrigeration system failure alarms; storage tank insulation to limit pressure build up rate; controlled venting through a environmental scrubber; and increased process consumption from the tank.   \n\nThe second alternative-case release scenario for Hydrogen Chloride is the discharge from a leak in a tank trailer unloading hose. This scenario assumes approximately 960 pounds of HCL is released in a 30 minute period.  This release does not have an off site impact per EPA OCA guidelines. Administrative controls and mitigation measures for this scenario include:  requirements for operating personnel to be physically present during tank trailer liquid unloading; leak detection monitors surrounding the unloading area; unloading hose design, construction, and fitness-for-service program; and emergency response planning for this and similar release scenarios. \n\nThe worst-case flammable release scenario is for Vinylidene Fluoride.

Examples of these include:\n\n\u00b7 Computer display and control of process parameters;\n\u00b7 Interlocks to automatically shut down processes for certain process deviations;\n\u00b7 HCL monitors in the storage tank area that provide an alarm when a leak is detected;\n\u00b7 Isolation valves which can be operated remotely from the process control system;\n\u00b7 Check valves to prevent cross contamination of chemicals;\n\u00b7 Camera surveillance of process areas in central control rooms;\n\u00b7 Fire prevention activities like electrical grounding, inerting flammables with nonflammable gases and hot work permitting; and\n\u00b7 The mechanical integrity of the TFE/HCL and VF2 supply lines is verified by periodic visual inspections and by annual thickness measurements.\n\u00b7 Flexible unloading hoses that connect the railcar to the chlorine supply line are replaced annually.\n\u00b7 When hoses are disconnected from the TFE/HCL trailers, the free ends are covered to keep moisture out of the line.\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nIn the past five years, there were no accidental releases of regulated chemicals from the facility resulting in on-site deaths, injuries, or significant property damage, or known off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.  DPE  first began operating the Chambers Works facility on July 1, 2005. The prior operator of the facility was DuPont Dow Elastomers LLC from April 1, 1996 to June 30th 2005. DuPont operated the facility prior to April 1, 1996.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nIn addition to the accidental release prevention effort, the DPE"

      "SummaryText": "Chambers Works facility has developed and implemented an emergency response program which includes all the elements necessary to satisfy the federal, state and local regulatory requirements.  In the case of a chemical release from the facility,  DPE personnel contact the DuPont Chambers Works on-site emergency response personnel and fire department to coordinate emergency response activities.  The DuPont emergency responders are thoroughly trained and properly equipped to respond to releases of any chemical used at Chambers Works.  The site also maintains an emergency response brigade comprised of specially trained operators that can lend additional support if necessary.  \n\nThe DPE Chambers Works facility conducts emergency drills to simulate potential accidental releases and test emergency response plans. Drill critiques are performed to evaluate emergency response plan adequacy and implementation effectiveness.  The DuPont Chambers Works site conducts practice drills with the local community and emergency response organizations.  Chambers Works also supports a siren system in the local community that would provide early warning for a potential release.  This system is coordinated with the Salem County Office of Emergency Response.\n\nIn addition to these on-site activities, DuPont - Chambers Works also maintains transportation emergency response capability to respond to off site chemical transportation incidents.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety \n\nAs part of the facility's process hazards review procedures, all of the processes are thoroughly studied on a periodic basis to identify risk reduction opportunities.  All recommendations resulting from the studies conducted to date have been completed. In addition, the following changes are planned to further improve the safety of the DPE Chambers Works facility:\n\n\u00b7 Using an upgraded fabrication and installation code for the as needed replacement of piping in the TFE/HCL system\n\u00b7 Improving preventive maintenance inspec"
