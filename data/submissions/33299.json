In this way we promote overall plant, worker, and public safety.  \nThese programs enable our facility to minimize the occurrence and consequences of significant releases \nof toxic substances as well as fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents.  \nOverall, these programs prevent accidental fatalities, injuries and illnesses and avoid\nphysical property damage.\n\n\nOur safety programs are applied to any activity involving hazardous chemicals including any use, storage, \nhandling, or the on-site movement of such chemicals.  Any group of vessels which are interconnected and \nseparate vessels which are located such that a hazardous chemical could be involved in a potential release \nshall be considered a single process.  \n\n\nOur safety programs show a commitment to safety and implimentation of safe procedures to minimize \naccidents as they focus on the rules, procedures, and practices that govern individual processes, activities, \nor equipment.  These programs are detailed and improved as necessary.  They are also communicated to\nand accepted by all associates at the facility.\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nThis facility is a frozen vegetable processing plant, which produces bulk frozen peas, various green beans,\ncob corn, cut corn and carrots.  These vegetables are locally grown and transported to our facility for \nprocessing. The refrigeration process for freezing these vegatables involves the use of Anhydrous Ammonia.  \n\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration process at this facility consists of various pumps, compressors, and condensers\nthat are used to chang"
