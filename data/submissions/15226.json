      "SummaryText": "Fort Walton Beach Wastewater Treatment Plant, located at 1564 Percy L. Coleman Road, Fort Walton Beach, FL, has one independent chlorine injection system.  The chlorine storage and feed tanks are located outdoors.  The chlorination process is located inside a building.  The chlorine system has one (1) one-ton container of chlorine on line and one (1) one-ton container of chlorine on standby at any one time.  Also, there is a maximum of 2 one-ton chlorine containers in storage.   The system is operated under pressure using gaseous chlorine.  The chlorine supply system can automatically switch between the on-line and standby chlorine containers when the on-line container is depleted.\n\nThe facility has chlorine detector to monitor leakage in the chlorinator room.  The sensor is located at about twelve inches above floor level.  The detectors will automatically alarm at the Facility and at the main control room panel. \n\nThe facility normally stores a maximum of 4 one-ton chlorine cylinders at the site at any one time. All cylinders are stored outdoors.  During chlorine deliveries, the delivery truck backs up to the unloading area and the cylinders are taken off the truck via the facility's crane and placed onto the pad. \n\nNormally, the chlorinator room is secured with doors that remain closed except when the system is being inspected.  Inspection takes place daily. If a chlorine leak is detected, the respective alarm will sound and the Operator will notify the Water/Power Plant Superintendent and the Fire Department.   The exhaust fans will be activated from the exterior of the building.  The air inside the building is evacuated and fresh air is drawn into the building through upper and lower vents respectively.  \n\nThe Worst Case release for this facility assumes that a one-ton chlorine cylinder ruptures during unloading outdoors in a rural area.  The cylinder discharges a dense gas release under worst case meteorological conditions of F Stability and 1.5 meters per sec"

      "SummaryText": "ond and ambient temperature of 250C.  All two thousand pounds contained in the cylinder are assumed released over ten (10) minutes.  It is only presented for comparative purposes and for non-OSHA facilities to determine under which RMP Program Level the facility fits.\n\nThe Worst Case Impact Area is three miles in radius (EPA CEPP Risk Management Program Guidance For Wastewater Treatment Plants EPA 550-B-98-010 October 1998).  There are about 2,800 people living in the Worst Case release area who could be affected by this type of release. Located within this area are eight schools (Kenwood School, Choctawhatchee High School, Pryor Junior High School, Ocean City Elementary School, Wright School, Rocky Bayou Christian School, Calvary Christian Academy, and Okaloosa/Walton  Community College).  There are also eight child day care facilities (Trinity United Methodist Preschool, The Wright Day Care, TLC Day Care, Stars Preschool, Garry Day Care, Montessori School, Preparation Station, and Small Wonders).   Other facilities within the Worst Case Impact Area are the Fort Walton Beach Health and Rehabilitation Center, Sanctuary of Praise and Cemetary, Fort Walton Beach Medical Center, Okaloosa Applied Technology Center, Westwood Retirement Center, and Wright Baptist Church.\n\nThe Most Likely case release assumes a release of chlorine occurs due to a pipe leak in the chlorine storage or chlorinator area.  In order to have a leak that emits chlorine outside of the facility, it is necessary to assume the chlorine alarm is activated.  The alarm would sound and the facility would be unable  to shut the system down at the cylinder.\n\nUnder those assumptions, the most likely release case is assumed to be a steady-state leak of up to 5 pounds per minute of chlorine (either as a gaseous or a two-phase release) for 30 minutes (150 lbs).  It should be noted that a completely filled one-ton cylinder has maximum gaseous discharge rate of about 500 pounds per day (0.35 pounds per minute).  "

      "SummaryText": "Significant gaseous discharges above this rate will result in the cylinder freezing up and the discharge stopped.  The Facility has only one (1) one-on cylinder hooked up to the header and a maximum discharge rate from that system could be 0.35 pounds of chlorine per minute.  It is also assumed that the cylinder discharges a dense gas release under meteorological conditions of D Stability and 3.0 meters per second at an ambient temperature of 250 C.\n\nThe Most Likely Case Impact Area based upon the above conditions is a tenth (0.1) of a mile in radius (EPA CEPP Risk Management Program Guidance For Wastewater Treatment Plants EPA 550-B-98-010 October 1998).  It is estimated that there are 8 people living in the Most Likely Case release area who could be affected by this release.  There are no hospitals, schools, or parks located within this area. There is one store located within a tenth of a mile radius.   In fact most of this release would be contained on the facility's property. \n\nThe Facility has not had an accidental release of chlorine from this covered process in the five years prior to the submission of this Risk Management Plan (RMP)."
