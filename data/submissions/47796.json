      "SummaryText": "\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies: Swanson River Field complies with NFPA 58 requirements for propane storage, and it is Union Oil Company of California (UOCC) policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state and local laws.  If an emergency were to occur, it is UOCC policy to notify the Kenai Peninsula Borough Central Emergency Services - Sterling Station.\n\n\n\nFacility: Swanson River Field Plant # 10 has a small distillation tower that separates liquid propane gas from natural gas liquids.  The liquid propane gas is pumped to a set of two propane storage tanks.  The two tanks are connected through a valve that remains closed unless manually opened by an operator.  Each storage tank has a maximum capacity of 40,000 gallons.  Operationally the tanks are only ever filled to a maximum of 80% of their full capacity, or 135,000 pounds propane each. The maximum volume that could legally be put in a tank is 88% of the maximum capacity, or 148,000 pounds of propane each.\n\n\n\nPropane: Propane is a flammable material that is used both commercially and by individuals for a variety of uses including home heating, cooking, barbecuing, air conditioning, and to power various devices in recreational vehicles.  The propane from the Swanson River Field Plant # 10 propane storage tanks is sold to propane distributors who use trucks to distribute the propane locally in Alaska.  This reduces Alaskan reliance on propane imported from Canada.\n\n\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario: The worst case release scenario required is the catastrophic failure and immediate release of the entire contents of a single propane storage tank, resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.\n\n\n\nThe RMP Guidance for Propane Storage Facilities reference tables or equations were used on an instantaneous release of 135,000 pounds of propane.  This worst-case scenario resulted in a 0.4 mile distance to an endpoint of 1 psi overpressure (enough pressure to break a window).  No residences are inside the"

      "SummaryText": " area described by a circle with a 0.4 mile radius from the propane tanks, but the area does include part of the Swanson River Canoe Trail that is used for recreation and impacts the Kenai National Wildlife Refuge since the entire facility is inside the Refuge.\n\n\n\nOffsite Consequences - Alternate Release Scenario:  The alternate release scenario is a leak resultant from the four-inch line to the multiple pressure relief valves being sheared off.  The EPA?s OCA Guidance Reference Tables or Equations were used on the alternate release of 17,620 pounds of propane.  This alternate scenario resulted in a 0.14 mile distance to an endpoint of 1 psi overpressure.  This release scenario impacts the Kenai National Wildlife Refuge but does not reach the Swanson River.\n\n\n\nPrevention Programs: The propane storage at Swanson River Field is in compliance with the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) prevention requirements.  Hazard analyses of each system are conducted using Hazop techniques.  Prevention process improvements are implemented based on the Hazops.  \n\n\n\nThe Swanson River Field is covered by the Oil Pollution Act of 1990.  An Oil Discharge and Contingency Plan outlines the prevention and response strategies in place at the field. The Swanson River Field is also in compliance with a federal Spill Prevention, Control, and Countermeasure Plan.\n\n\n\nFive-Year Accident History:  There have been no reportable accidents involving the propane storage system during the last five years.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program: An Emergency Response Plan is on file at Swanson River Field.  Emergency response at the Swanson River Field is coordinated with the Kenai Peninsula Borough Central Emergency Services.  \n\n\n\nPersonnel at the field have HAZWOPER training to the Hazmat Technician level, and Fire Training and Emergency Response Refresher Training is conducted each year.  \n\n\n\nPublic notification of emergencies is carried out through the Kenai Peninsula Borough 911 system which includes an "
