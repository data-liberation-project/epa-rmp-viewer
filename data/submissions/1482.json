The training\nconsists of classroom lecture, current videos, testing and certification and on the job\ntraining.\n\nFive Year Accident History:\n\nThere have been no accidents involving anhydrous ammonia that caused deaths, injuries,\nproperty or environmental damage, including evacuations on or off site.\n\n\nEmergency Response Program:\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving our ammonia system, it is our policy to notify the \nlocal community fire department and request that they respond to the emergency. In\npreparation for this, we have coordinated with all of the local agencies by providing\ninformation and offering tours to ensure that they are familiar with and are properly\nprepared for an incident at our facility. This will help ensure that the community has the\nstrategy for responding to and mitigating the threat posed by an ammonia release. This\ncomplies with the requirement for our facility to be included in the community \nemergency reponse plan prepared under EPCRA and coordinated with our LEPC.\n\nJohnston Grain has an Emergency Reponse and Contingency Plan for our facilities that\ninclude provisions for public notification, initial medical care, evacuations and LEPC\ncoordination.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:\n\nWe do not plan to make any changes to the physical site. We will continue to provide\nour employees with ongoing annual training to ensure that they are current with safe ammonia  transfer and handling procedures. We will also provide regular inspection and maintenance\non all of the ammonia equipment."

This plan has been developed to prevent accidental release\nthrough responsible handling and proper storage of the product. Johnston's will\nalso ensure that employees receive the necessary training and that proper safety\nequipment is provided. Johnston's will also make sure that the surrounding\ncommunity is aware of our preparedness in the event of an accident.\n\nJohnston's Wakita facility is a full service, country elevator, which sell feed, seed,\nfertilizer, as well as agricultural chemicals. The only substance subject to regulation\nunder RMP and above the threshold quantities is anhydrous ammonia. Anhydrous\nammonia is received, stored and distributed from our facility as a crop fertilizer only.\nOur facility has one storage tank that has  12,000  gallons capacity\nand is filled only 85%, this equals  56,000  pounds of ammonia. We also have\n( 21 ) l000 gallon Nurse tanks also filled to a maximum of 85% full at our location. The\ncombined capacity of all tanks at this location   33,000   gallons or  154,110\npounds of anhydrous ammonia.\n\nThis facility has a site safety coordinator, all Johnston coordinators are given training\nto monitor the day to day safe work activities, maintain the required regulatory record\nkeeping, conduct safety meetings, conduct employee training and act as the location's\ncontact with the corporate office. The site safety coordinator acts as the location's\nemergency contact.\n\nAs required by EPA guidelines"

      "SummaryText": "the following worst-case release and alternative release\nscenarios have been devised.\n\n\nWorst Case Scenario:\n\n\n\nOur worst cast scenario is the loss of the total contents of  12,000  gallon storage\ntank, when filled to the greatest amount allowed (85% of capacity), released as a gas\nover l0 minutes, resulting in total vaporization. The maximum quantity released would\nbe  56,000 pounds. According to DEGADIS modeling, this release (distance from point\nof dispersion to 200 PPM) would have off-site impacts and would travel 0.84 miles.\nIt should be noted that Johnston's has never had a release of an entire stationary\nanhydrous ammonia storage tank from any of facilities.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario:\n\nThe most common alternative release scenario from our facility would be in the failure of\na 1-inch transfer hose and release of approximately 2901 pounds of anhydrous ammonia\nover a two-minute period. Under the worst weather conditions the contents would travel\n.22 miles before dispersing enough to no longer pose a hazard to the public. It should be\nnoted that Johnston's has not had a release of this type from any facility in the past.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific\nPrevention Steps:\n\nThe anhydrous ammonia system is designed, installed and maintained in accordance\nwith ASTM standards and ASME codes. This facility complies with the ANSI K61.1\nstandards, OSHA (29 CFR 1910.111), EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and\nall applicable federal, state and local codes and regulations.\n\nOur ammonia system is protected from major releases by internal excess flow valves,\ncheck valves, relief valves and manual shutoffs. The load-out risers used for the purpose\nof filling the nurse tanks are protected by excess flow valves to stop the flow of ammonia\nin a line or hose fails. All main storage tank valves are locked when not in use.\n\nOur ammonia facility is inspected on a regular basis with maintenance and preventative\nmaintenance scheduled and"
