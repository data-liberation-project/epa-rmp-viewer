(BIC) is committed to managing all operations in a manner that protects the environment and the health and safety of employees, customers, and the public while fully complying with applicable laws and regulations.  \n\n\n\nThe purpose of this Risk Management Plan is to provide information about operations at the facility, programs to prevent accidental chemical releases, emergency response plans in the event of an accidental release, the five-year accident history of the facility and planned changes to improve safety at the facility.\n\n\n\n2)Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nBIC USA, Inc., Distribution Center, located at 5900 Long Creek Park Drive in Charlotte, North Carolina, is a warehouse and distribution facility for BIC products.  BIC's Charlotte Distribution Center consists of office and warehouse operations located in a single building.  At this facility, BIC handles several types of lighters, all of which contain isobutane.  Isobutane is a regulated substance under the Risk Management Program (RMP) with about the same flammability as propane. The facility is regulated under Program 1 requirements under the applicability criteria of ?68.10.\n\n\n\nPallets of lighters (packaged together into cases) are received at the facilities by truck/trailer and unloaded via forklift.  The number of lighters in each individual case depends on the type of lighter.  The pallets are placed in rack storage.  As orders for lighters are received, the pallets of lighters are transferred to the shipping area of the facility via forklift.  From this location, individual cases of lighters are placed (by hand) onto a conveyor system which collates the products required to fill each order.  At the end of the conveyor, the individual cases of products are combined together on pallets and loaded onto trucks/trailers via forklift.  \n\n\n\n3) Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergenc"

BIC's corporate commitment to safety and sound environmental management is translated into action by a full time Environment and Safety professional who serves the Carolina BIC facilities.  BIC's environmental staff, along with facility staff, administer several programs which contribute to release prevention including safe work practices, employee training, preventative maintenance and administrative controls designed to ensure that safety issues are identified and addressed.\n\n\n\n4) Prevention Program\n\nPrevention of accidental releases at the facility is accomplished through compliance with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention provisions, federal and state regulations, and the application of long-standing corporate philosophies and initiatives which help support safe operations.  A few examples of the prevention features implemented at this facility include:\n\n\n\n-BIC's extensive in-line quality testing of every lighter not only guarantees safe and reliable operation of the product by the consumer, but also provides an additional measure of safety for warehousing operations.\n\n-Weekly inspections of hazardous waste storage areas, monthly fire extinguisher inspections, weekly sprinkler control valve and PIV inspection, quarterly flow alarm test and other sprinkler system testing, fork truck driver training, and incident investigation.\n\n-Supervisors make weekly behavioral safety observations and complete a monthly safety checklist of each facility.  \n\n\n\n5) Five-Year Accident History\n\nSince BIC began operations at this facility in February 1996, there have been no accidental releases of isobutane with off-site consequences.  \n\n        \n\n6) Emergency Response Program\n\nBIC has implemented a written Emergency Action and Contingency Plan, which has been prepared in accordance with the requirements of 29 CFR 1910.38.  This plan establishes detailed facility evacuation, response, "

The plan designates a Facility Emergency Coordinator who is responsible for implementing the plan during an emergency.  The plan also provides for emergency training of all facility personnel.  The procedures in this plan have been coordinated with local emergency response agencies, including the Charlotte Mecklenburg County Emergency Management Division and the local fire department through the submittal of the plan and/or through facility site visits by agency representatives. \n\n\n\nEmergency response steps that may be implemented in the event of a release of isobutane may include use of portable fire extinguishers, evacuation of the facility and/or response by the local fire department.  Fire protection of the facility is provided by an automatic sprinkler system incorporating Early Suppression-Fast Response (ESFR) heads.  Packaged lighters are classified as a cartoned, expanded plastic commodity since the quantity of plastic and packaging used results in combustion characteristics similar to plastic materials.  Therefore, standard fire protection and response measures should provide adequate emergency response.  \n\n\n\n7) Safety Improvements\n\nBIC's environmental staff will continue to administer several programs which contribute to release prevention including safe work practices, employee training, preventative maintenance and administrative controls designed to ensure that safety issues are identified and addressed.  \n\n"
