Facility Accidental Release Policy - The owners, management, and employees fo Walla Walla Farmers Co-op, 111 North 9th, Walla Walla, Washington 99362, with branch operations at 113 South D Street, Prescott, Washington 99348, and 5003 West Brinkley Road, Kennewick, Washington are committed to the prevention or any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia and aqua ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.  A detailed emergency response plan has been developed and will be implemented in the event of an accidental release.  2. Facility Information - *The primary activity at the Prescott Facility is the storage, blending and sale of fertilizers to farmers.  * Anhydrous ammonia and aqua ammonia are received, stored, and distributed for both direct application and for blending into mixed grade fertilizers for crop production nutrients.  * At Prescott the anhydrous ammonia is received by tanker truck and put into an 12,000 gallon above ground storage tank.  The maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia at Prescott in storage is 52,500 pounds.  * At Walla Walla the converter, converts anhydrous ammonia to aqua ammonia and the product is transferred on site to above ground storage.  Product is than transferred from the Walla Walla location by tank truck to a 20,000 gallon above ground storage tank at the Prescott branch.  The maximun quantity of aqua ammonia in strorage at Prescott is 144,400 pounds.  3. The Worst Case Release and Alternative Release Scenarios - a. Anhydrous Ammonia - The worst case release scenario and for the Prescott facility is failure of the largest storage tank when filled to the greatest amount would release 52, 500 pounds of anhydrous ammonia, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85% of capacity as limited by regulations.
