(GPRI), a wholly owned subsidiary of Georgia-Pacific Corporation, owns and operates a synthetic resin manufacturing facility in (the Elk Grove facility) in Elk Grove, California, which is referenced as the \u00bfplant\u00bf throughout the remainder of the document. The facility is located on 10399 E. Stockton, Blvd.  The resin plant that was originally constructed in 1967 by Union Carbide. The resin process contains raw material tanks, the process equipment, and finished product tanks.  Overall, the facility employs 33 full-time employees.\n\t\n\tGPRI is committed to operating the plant in a manner that is safe for its workers, the public, and the environment.  As part of this commitment, GPRI has established a system to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility.  One component of this system is a risk management program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at the plant and that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency\u00bfs (EPA's) regulation 40 CFR part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule).  One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit a risk management plan (RMP Plan) describing the risk management program at the plant. This document is intended to satisfy the RMP Plan requirement of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program at the plant.\n\t\n\tThe risk management program at the Plant consists of the following three elements:\n\t\n\u00b7\ta hazard assessment to help understand (a) the potential offsite consequences of hypothetical accidental releases and (b) accidents that have occurred during the last five years associated with the use of substances regulated by the RMP rule (regulated substances).\n\t\n\u00b7\ta prevention program to help maintain and safely operate the processes containing more than a threshold quantity of a regulated substance (covered processes).\n\t\n\u00b7\tan emergency response program to help respond to acc"

In fact, the Plant has a comprehensive safety program in place establishing many levels of safeguards against release of a hazardous substance and injuries and damage from a release of a hazardous substance.\n\t\n\tGPRI limits the use of hazardous substances.  Before using a hazardous substance at the Plant, less hazardous alternatives are considered. When a hazardous substance is used at the Plant, GPRI considers the potential for this substance to adversely affect plant workers, the public, and the environment and takes steps to prevent any such effects.\n\t\n\tGPRI prevents releases of the hazardous substances used at the facility.  When a hazardous substance is used at the Plant, the equipment is carefully designed, built and operated to reduce the likelihood of an accidental release. Industry and government standards are closely adhered to in the design, construction, and operation of the equipment. \n\t\n\tGPRI limits damage from a release, if such a release occurs.  GPRI trains its workers to respond to an accidental release, reducing the consequences of a release if it occurs.  In addition, GPRI works with the local fire department and with the County LEPC to help prevent injuries and/or environmental damage if a release does occur.\n\t\n\tThe safety program at the Plant consists of a number of elements, only some of which are required by the RMP rule. This RMP Plan is primarily intended to describe those parts of the safety program at the Plant that are required by the RMP rule.\n\t\n\t\n1.1\t  Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\tGPRI is committed to the safety of workers and the public, and the preservation of t"

GPRI provides response training to its personnel, designates an emergency response coordinator to oversee response activities, and coordinates response efforts with the local fire department.

The training program includes both initial and refresher training that covers (1) a general overview of the process, (2) the properties and hazards of the substances in the process, and (3) a detailed review of the process operating procedures and safe work practices.  Computer-based training modules, classroom training, and on-the-job training with experienced operators are used to conduct this training.  Oral reviews and written tests are used to verify that an employee understands the training material before the employee can resume work in the process. The operators are consulted annually at safety meetings to evaluate the effectiveness and frequency of the training.  Refresher training is conducted on a minimum of every three (3) years.  Recommendations from the operators are reviewed, and changes to the training program are implemented as appropriate.\n\t\n\t1.3.1.5  Mechanical Integrity - The Plant maintains the mechanical integrity of process equipment to help prevent equipment failures that could endanger workers, the public, or the environment.  The mechanical integrity program includes (1) an inspection and testing program to help identify"

Personnel who are to perform hot work are required to fill out the Hot Work Permit Form.  The Shift Supervisor reviews the completed form before work can begin.  Training in the use of the Hot Work Permit Form is included in the plant\u00bfs safe work practices orientation.\n\t\n\t1.3.1.12   Contractors - The Plant established a program to help ensure that contractor activities at the plant are performed in a safe manner.  The program reviews the safety record of all contractors to help ensure that the plant only hires contractors who can safely perform the desired job tasks.  The plant explains to the contract supervisors the hazards of the process on which they and their employees will work, the plant\u00bfs safe work practices, and the plant\u00bfs emergency response procedures.  The plant requires that the contractor supervisors train each of their employees who will work at the plant before that worker begins work at the plant site.  The plant periodically reviews contractors' training documents and work performance to help ensure that safe practices are followed.\n\t\n1.3.2  Chemical-specific Prevention Steps\n\n\tIn addition to the required prevention program elements, the Plant has implemented safety features specific to the hazardous substances used at the plant.  The following paragraphs describe some of these features.\n\t\n\tFormaldehyde solution-Industry standards are followed at the plant to help ensure safe handling of formaldehyde.  All formaldehyde is delivered to the plant by offsite vendors. The formaldehyde vendor supplies formaldehyde solution via a DOT approved tank truck and follows DOT standards when loading the formaldehyde storage tanks.  The storage tanks\u00bf design and construction are consistent with ANSI standards.  Workers who perform operations involving formaldehyde receive training emphasiz"
