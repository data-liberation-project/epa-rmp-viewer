The Company's refrigeration personnel are trained in hazardous materials response (24 hours). This training includes emphasis on anhydrous ammonia, in addition to other requirements set forth in 29 CFR 1910.119\r\nAt The Company, anhydrous ammonia is used on-site. Ammonia is considered hazardous by EPA and is listed on the Extremely Hazardous Substance (EHS) list. Chemical properties of ammonia make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling ammonia in order to:\r\n&#61623; Prevent unnecessary human exposure\r\n&#61623; Reduce the threat to our personnel\r\n&#61623; Reduce the threat to the community\r\nB.
