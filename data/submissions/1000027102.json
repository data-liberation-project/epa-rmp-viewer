SFI also produces yogurt and cream cheese at multiple facilities across the US and is the nation's largest supplier of store-brand cheese, cream cheese and yogurt products to grocery chains and wholesalers. The SFI - Richland Center West Plant employs approximately 125 people. The Richland Center West plant uses anhydrous ammonia for refrigeration of the products in storage as well as for cooling of manufacturing process lines. Anhydrous ammonia is subject to EPA regulation under 40 CFR 68, Accidental Release Risk Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals.\n\n\n\nPursuant to the RMP regulations (40 CFR 68) and the Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations (29CFR 1910.119), SFI has developed a comprehensive PSM written program to protect our employees and the surrounding community from exposure to the hazardous chemicals onsite. The facility completed an initial process hazards analyses (PHA) for ammonia using the industry standard What-If?/Checklist Analysis developed through the International Institute for Ammonia Refrigeration, and the most recent PHA revalidation was completed in 2011. The methodology used for the revalidation incorporated the HAZOP methodology which includes all scenarios identified in the IIAR's \"What-If Checklist\".  The revalidation PHA was completed using technical and operations staff from the Richland Center Plant as well as experienced facilitators. The PHAs reviewed operational, human factors, and facility siting issues relative to the design of the refrigeration system, and recommendations were made, as appropriate, to address these concerns.\n\n\n\nSFI's implementation of the PSM program includes employee education in the hazards of ammonia and measures that can be used to reduce employee and community exposure to accidental releases of ammonia. The plans include extensive training for operators and maintenance personnel along with pre"

The program also includes specific requirements for safe work practices (such as safe approaches to welding and similar hot work) and safety requirements for contractors who may be hired to work on the system. Finally, SFI has undertaken a rigorous approach to PSM compliance auditing. Findings from the audits are reported to the facility, which then must correct the findings and provide written documentation of resolution of the findings to SFI's Safety Director.\n\n\n\nLastly, the PSM written program incorporates the Plant's emergency response plan and places special emphasis on handling accidental releases of hazardous chemicals and coordination of emergency response with local fire departments and other emergency response organizations. Many of SFI's refrigeration and maintenance personnel have completed 24-hour HAZWOPER HAZMAT technician level training program. This training emphas topics such as classification systems and hazards identification; ammonia spill control and containment; respiratory protection; air monitoring instrumentation; proper personal protective equipment; medical monitoring; and proper termination procedures for emergency response activities. SFI facilities conduct annual HAZWOPER refresher training to keep employees current and comfortable with their responsibilities under the plan using classroom discussion and response to mock emergency scenarios. Our facilities also conduct quarterly drills during which the emergency response team practices implementation of the incident command system to respond to mock emergency situations. Richland Center West is scheduled to complete the 24hr HAZWOPER training in the near future.\n\n\n\nAs part of the RMP requirements, SFI undertook a review of the potential offsite consequences of the accidental release of the largest vessel in the syst"

SFI stores and uses anhydrous ammonia on site for refrigeration of products in storage as well as for cooling of manufacturing process lines. Ammonia is used for its excellent energy efficiency and flexibility, in addition to benefits to employee safety. Ammonia at the facility is kept entirely within the refrigeration system, similar to the refrigerant in your car air-conditioner. The SFI - Richland Center West Plant has never experienced a release of ammonia involving consequences that affected residents or the environment.\n\n\n\nSFI is committed to minimizing accidental releases of ammonia from the refrigeration process at the Richland Center West Plant. Facility management is involved in the design, operation, and maintenance of the system. SFI employees at all levels have been involved in the development of the PSM and RMP programs.
