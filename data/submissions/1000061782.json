Bolthouse Farms, Inc. has prepared a unified Risk and Process Safety Management Program to comply with California's Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program (in California CCR Title 19, Chapter 4.5, Program Level 3 Elements, and Federally Title 40 CFR Part 68) and California OSHA's \"Process Safety Management (PSM) of Acutely Hazardous Materials\" standard. This program is being prepared to address the risks involved with the presence of anhydrous ammonia in an amount in excess of 10,000 lbs which is contained in several different refrigeration systems onsite.\n\n\n\nOur program will promote overall plant, worker, and public safety. The program will enable our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of anhydrous ammonia. Overall, the program is designed to prevent accidental fatalities, injuries, or illnesses, and avoid physical property damage.\n\n\n\nOur company has a good safety record, one that we are quite proud of. Our company has in place many policies and procedures to promote overall plant, worker, and public safety. Since late 1996 our company has had a Process Safety Management program to comply with California OSHA's \"Process Safety Management (PSM) of Acutely Hazardous Materials\" standard (CCR Title 8, Section 5189). We have reviewed our PSM program and modified it to meet our obligations under CalARP. In so doing, we have: (1) prepared a unified program based on the PSM plan to meet CalARP obligations as well; (2) reorganized the program so that it meshes more closely with general Bolthouse business practices; and (3) reviewed plan documentation forms and responsibilities. The unified Risk and Process Safety Management Plan sets forth rules, procedures, and practices which will help our employees protect themselves and our neighbors.\n\n\n\n2. DESCRIPTION OF AMMO"

      "SummaryText": "NIA SYSTEM\n\nWe operate a facility that prepares and packages carrots, carrot products, various juice drinks for sale and salad dressings. Our facility utilizes eight refrigeration systems to provide refrigeration for several coolers, freezers, production areas, and equipment.\n\n\n\nAll refrigeration systems operate in a similar manner. High pressure liquid ammonia is transferred from high pressure receivers to surge drums, recirculator pump packages, or accumulator vessels via a liquid feed manifold. The liquid ammonia passes through an expansion valve as it enters the vessels, which lowers the temperature and pressure. Cold liquid ammonia is then pumped or fed by gravity into cooling devices such as evaporator coils, heat exchangers, or hydrocoolers. As the cooling device absorbs heat the liquid ammonia is vaporized. The low temperature ammonia vapor is transferred/pulled to the compressors. Passage through the compressor raises the temperature and pressure of the ammonia vapor. Compressor high stage discharge is sent to the condensers. Water is sprayed over the condenser coils along with air flow generated by the condenser fans removes heat from the high pressure ammonia vapor and condenses it to a high pressure liquid, which is returned to the high pressure receivers.\n\n\n\n3. GENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE & AMMONIA SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration systems at the Wm. Bolthouse Farms, Inc. are an integral part of the overall business. It is extremely important that the ammonia equipment is maintained and operated in a safe and efficient manner. Management is committed to making sure that all employees are made aware of the potential danger of an ammonia leak.\n\n\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration systems/processes are constantly being monitored by our refrigeration technicians.  The systems/processes are controlled by a computer which monitors many process variables, and offers some remote control capability. In the event of a system upset the computer actuates a "

The detectors are routinely inspected, tested, and calibrated based on the manufacturer's recommendations. \n\n\n\nWe inform our employees of the dangers of an accidental release of ammonia through periodic safety meetings. During these meetings we also discuss the preventative measures to take, such as evacuation, in order to not be affected by a release.\n\n\n\nOur ammonia refrigeration systems were designed and built by professional refrigeration engineers in accordance with applicable codes and standards commonly recognized in the ammonia refrigeration industry.\n\n\n\nOur ammonia refrigeration system is equipped with safety relief valves. These valves limit the operating pressures of the entire system, and prevent integrity failures due to overpressurization.\n\n\n\n4. FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe Wm. Bolthouse Farms, Inc. has not had any RMP reportable accidents within the last five years.\n\n\n\n5. EMERGENCY ACTION PLAN\n\nThis facility's emergency response program is based on the Cal OSHA requirements for Emergency Action Plans (in California CCR Title 8, Section 3220, \"Emergency Action Plans\" and Federally Title 29 CFR 1910.38 and 1910.119) and HAZWOPER (standard (in California CCR Title 8, Section 5192, \"Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response\" and Federally Title 29 CFR 1910.120).\n\n\n\nStrategically, we will respond Defensively to limit or control a release. Under this plan our employees will take defensive steps only to bring a release under control. Several employees of the refrigeration department have training to the defensive level (First Responder, Operations Level) as defined in the HAZWOPER regulations. The first priority will be to operate the ammonia system to bring a release under control safely, from a distance, without donning personal protective equipment. Steps might include stopping the flow of ammonia to a leak point, or using the compresso"

Further response requiring the donning of personal protective equipment would be done in coordination with the Kern County Fire Department and/or other off-site responders. All response activities would be coordinated with the local fire department hazardous materials team.\n\n\n\nEvery year we review, with our employees, our evacuation procedures in the event of an emergency, including an ammonia release. We have windsocks at our facility that employees can use to determine the \"upwind\" side of any point of release.  The Safety Department is in charge of coordinating emergency evacuation drills that are conducted routinely throughout the facility.\n\n\n\n6. PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nOur company has in place many policies and procedures to promote overall plant, worker, and public safety. Nevertheless, Wm. Bolthouse Farms, Inc. strives to constantly improve in all areas.\n\n\n\nThe Process Safety Management team is planning to complete several items over the next year as their continued effort to provide a safe work environment for the facility employees.  These changes include the following items:\n\n\n\n1.  Continue to train applicable employees in Process Safety Management and the facility Safety Plan/Programs.\n\n\n\n2.  Continue to have employee involvement in Safety Plan Development.\n\n\n\n3.  Continue employee involvement through safety team participation.\n\n\n\n4.  Continue internal and external safety audits/inspections and implement changes as needed."
