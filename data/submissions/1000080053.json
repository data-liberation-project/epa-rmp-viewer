The facility operates two shifts, 5-6 days per week, year round.  Much of the product used at the facility is produced at the Seneca Foods Corp.-Process Facility located at 1217 3rd Ave SE, Rochester, MN (approximately 8 blocks north of the Cold Storage facility).\n\n\n\nSenior management is not only committed to offering superior service, but to also maintain safety and environmental programs to promote a safe environment for its employees and the surrounding communities. This is accomplished through the implementation of the EPA Risk Management Program and incorporating Emergency Response capabilities at the facility level.\n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\n\n\nTwo ammonia refrigeration systems are used at the Cold Storage Facility ammonia is a regulated substance per 40CFR Part 68 Environmental Protection Agency (Appendix A).  The same properties that make ammonia a valuable coolant for refrigeration also make it necessary to observe certain precautions when using to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to our own personal health and the health of our co-workers, and to reduce the threat to nearby members of the community.  It is Seneca Foods policy to conform to all applicable state and federal rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the manner in which the refrigeration system is operated, safety devices engineered into the system, good maintenance procedures, as well as the training of our personnel.  The two systems were installed in 1986 and 1995 with a combined ammonia-total between the two systems of 25,200 pounds. The threshold reporting quantity for anhydrous ammonia is 10,000 lbs., thus Seneca's Cold Storage Facility is required to comply with the EPA's Risk Ma"

There is no mingling of ammonia between the two systems, each system supplies ammonia to specific pieces of refrigeration equipment.  The 25,200 lb. total charge of anhydrous ammonia in the two systems is used to provide refrigerant for cooling the product Storage Areas, Processing Room, and Loading Dock.  \n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC STEPS\n\n\n\nSeneca's Cold Storage Facility has an accident release prevention program in place which complies with OSHA's 29 CFR 1910.119 Process Safety Management Standard.  The International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (11AR) \"Guide to the Implementation of Process Safety Management (PSM) for Ammonia Refrigeration\" was used to implement the PSM program at the Cold Storage Facility.  Parts of the program include:\n\n\n\n1) Employee Participation\n\n2) Process Safety Information\n\n3) Process Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\n4) Operating Procedures\n\n5) Training\n\n6) Contractor Requirements\n\n7) Pre Start-up Safety Review\n\n8) Mechanical Integrity Audits\n\n9) Hot Work Permits\n\n10) Management of Change\n\n11) Incident Investigation\n\n12) Emergency Planning and Response\n\n13) Compliance Audits\n\n \n\nIndependent consultants are utilized to assist facility personnel with implementation of our PSM program including: system audits, PHA development, and employee training. In addition, independent refrigeration maintenance contractors are used on occasion for key maintenance tasks. The refrigeration systems were installed in 1986, and 1995 respectively.  All components were new when installed; no second hand equipment was used.  The systems remain in excellent condition as a result of the diligent maintenance program used by Seneca and independent contractors.\n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nEPA's RMP regulation defines \"accident\" as the following:\n\n\n\n\"The release must be from a covered process and involve a regulated "

On-site deaths, injuries, or significant property damage (?68.42(a)); or\n\n?    Known offsite deaths, injuries, property damage, environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place (?68.42(a)).\"\n\n\n\nBased on the above definition and an investigation into the facility's accident history, there have been no significant releases of ammonia that exceeded the Federal Reportable Quantity of 100 pounds in the last five years (June 2009 - June 2014), nor have there been any releases that meet the definition specified above. \n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM:\n\n\n\nThe Seneca Foods Cold Storage facility has coordinated the emergency plan with the Rochester Fire Department. The Rochester Fire Department is Seneca's Cold Storage Facility's designated outside first response team.\n\n\n\nIf an uncontrolled release develops, the following procedure will be used:\n\n\n\n1) Cold Storage Mechanic confirms leak.\n\n2) Cold Storage Mechanic evacuates the immediate area.\n\n3) Management determines the need for a plant wide evacuation\n\n4) An upwind location is selected and the evacuation signal is ordered by the management staff (High-Low Siren).\n\n5) Time cards are collected for role call.\n\n6) Rochester Fire Department* is notified by calling 911.\n\n7) Roll call is taken at the assembly area and first aid is administered.\n\n8) A list of employees not accounted for at roll call will be forwarded to the Rochester Fire Department.\n\n9) Notification of appropriate Company Officials and Government Agencies is done.\n\n\n\n*= Rochester Fire Department will notify potentially affected offsite parties. A representative of the Rochester Fire Department visits the facility on a annual basis.\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nSeneca Foods is continually upgrading not only the ammonia refrigeration equipment but also the written PSM and RMP policies and procedures to stay abreast of indust"
