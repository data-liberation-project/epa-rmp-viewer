All applicable procedures of the Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) Prevention Program are adhered to. The Vermilion Water Plant Emergency Response Program involves the preperation of response plans which are tailored to the Vermilion water Plant facility and the emergency services available in the community.\n\nThe city of Vermilion Water Plant (VWP) is located at 537 N. Main St. Closte to the shore of Lake Erie. The plant has a chlorine room that will contain two one ton  containers. The chlorination system was upgraded to a vaccum system 1985 to improve safety.The chlorinator and equipment room is normally unmanned and can olny be entered from a separate locked outside entrance apart from the building. The Water Plant operators check the chlorine room every two hours or as needed to respond to an alarm.\n\nThe offsite consequence analysis includes consideration of two chlorine release senarios identified as \"worse case scenario\" and \"alternate scenario\". The first scenario is defined by the USEPA which states \"the owner or operator shall assume the maximum quantity in the elargest vessel is released as a gas over ten minutes due to an unspecified failure\". The arternate scenario is defined as \"more likely to ossur than the worst case scenario\". \n\nAtmospheric dispersion modeling has been performed to determin the distance traveled by the chlorine released before it's concentration decreases to the \"toxic end point\" selected by the USEPA of 3 ppm which is the Emergency Response Planning Guidline Level 2 (ERGP-2). This is defined by the American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA) as the \"maximum airbourne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing irreversable or other serious health effects or symptoms which "

      "SummaryText": "could impair an individual's ability to take corrective action\". The residential population within a circle with a radius corresponding to the toxic end point distande has been defined as \"to estimate the population potentially affected\". The worst case scenario at the Vermilion Water Plant involves the failure of the two one ton containers concurently (a total of 4000 lbs. of chlorine). The offsite consequence analysis for this scenario was performed for two sets of conditions. The first followed conditions predifined by the USEPA as the realease of the entire amount as a gas in ten minutes. We used  the one hour average ERPG-2 as the toxic endpoint and consided the population within a full circle radius corresponding to the toxic endpoint distance. These are the conditions used facilitate the offsite consequence analysis.\n\nThe Vermilion Water Plant accidental release prevention program consists of the following key elements:\n\nProcess Safety Information\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOperating Proceedures\nTraining\nMechanical Integrity\nManagenent of Change\nPrestart-up Review\nComplaince Audits\nIncident Investigation\nEmployee Participation Plan\nNon-routine Work Permit (including Hot Work)\nContractors\n\nSteps taken to prevent acidental exposure to chlorine include:\n\na self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) worn by the operators during the connection / disconnection of the chlorine cylinders\n\ntraining to increase tha awareness of the hazardous and toxic properties of chlorine\n\ninstalation af an external alarm that indicates chlorine problems such a leak, loss of vacuum, and low or high chlorine levels in the water.\n\nNo accidental chlorine releases have occured at this facility inb the last 5 years.\n\nAs per our Emergency Response Program the Vermilion Fire Department is the first to be called in any and all emergencies."
