Complete Welders Supply does not use the product in any manufacturing process our primary roll and exposure to Sulfur Dioxide and Ammonia are in storage and handling.\n\n\n\nThe Complete Welders Supply facility in Napa, California has adopted this Program in order to implement Title 8 of the California Code of Regulations (CCR), Section 5189, the California OSHA standard regulating Process Safety Management (PSM) of Acutely Hazardous Materials for sulfur dioxide.\n\n\n\nThis program has also been developed to implement the prevention component of Title 19 CCR, Division 2, chapter 4.5, also known as the California Accidental Release Prevention (CaIARP) Program. The hazardous materials at this facility that meet the CalARP eligibility requirements are sulfur dioxide and ammonia. As per Section 2735.4 (Applicability) of the CalARP program, the Napa Hazardous Materials Certified Unified Program Agency (CUPA) and this facility have determined that these material processes meet the eligibility requirements of Program Level 3 and Level 2, respectively. As required by Article 5 for Program Level 2 and Article 6 for Level 3 of the CalARP Program, the applicable prevention components are\n\ndetailed in this single document.\n\n\n\nThis Program will help prevent the occurrence of, or minimize the consequences of, catastrophic releases by stating and implementing our policies and procedures for the management of process hazards in design, construction, start-up, operation, inspection, maintenance, and other matters addressed in the OSHA standard. This program has been developed to enable all those who may be affected to be able to identify and understand the hazards posed by the processes that involve the covered chemicals.\n\n\n\nOur Program calls for maximum employee participation and includes all elements of the employee p"
