      "SummaryText": "INTRODUCTION\n\nEllwood National Crankshaft Company (ENC) operates a portion of a fully integrated manufacturer of specialty forged steel products, owned by the Ellwood Group, Inc. in Irvine, PA. Currently, the facility's core products are crankshafts used in larger diesel engines and pipe molds used as expendable tooling in the production of iron pipe for water transmission. The balance of production consists of other heavy industrial products that involve precision machining or proprietary boring/coring techniques.\n\nThe site is located on a single contiguous site with Ellwood National Forge (ENF) and Ellwood National Steel (ENS). The ENC/ENF/ENS site encompasses approximately 300 acres with 46 acres of developed property and 578,000 square feet under roof. The combined plant operations employ approximately 564 total personnel in manufacturing and administrative positions. The plant operates three shifts throughout the work week and conducts a one to two week plant maintenance shutdown annually in July. The maximum number of employees on-site at any one time is approximately 287 during the first, or daylight, shift.\n\n1. ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES AT THE STATIONARY SOURCE\n\nEmployee and community health and safety and environmental protection are priorities of ENC/ENF/ENS and its management. ENC/ENF/ENS employs at least two full time health and safety professionals and retains other consultants and professionals as needed to provide supplemental services. Other staff are also involved in health and safety affairs on a part-time basis. The management and employees of ENC/ENF/ENS take pride in being ISO 9002 certified and the combined ENC/ENF/ENS facility is the recipient of multiple safety and environmental awards.\n\n2.

USE OF REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe RMP regulated substance  - anhydrous ammonia - is stored and utilized in the nitriding/surface hardening department of ENC. Anhydrous Ammonia is a toxic and buoyant gas with a threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds. In the nitriding department, crankshaft wear surfaces (bearing/throws) are heated in a nitrogen environment and nitrogen is absorbed in unmasked steel surfaces causing a case hardening to a prescribed depth based on temperature and exposure duration. Anhydrous ammonia is used as both the carrier gas for and the source of the nitrogen used in this process. The ammonia is thermally separated into elemental nitrogen and hydrogen and fed to the furnace to establish the inert nitrogen environment. Periodically, hydrogen and some nitrogen is vented to the atmosphere during the nitriding cycle and replaced.  \n\nC. QUANTITIES HANDLED OR STORED\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is transported and stored under pressure to maintain the ammonia in liquid form (under a vapor head space).  The ammonia is stored in a single 18,000 gallon horizontal, welded, steel, ASME certified, pressure tank. Administrative controls and operating procedures limit the maximum volume stored on site at any time to 16,200 gallons (92,178 lbs).\n\n3. WORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\nThe ammonia release scenarios considered in the ENC RMP are consistent with the USEPA 2004 General Guidance Risk Management Programs for Chemical Accident Prevention (40 CFR Part 68). \n\n3a.  WORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\nThe worst-case release scenario for anhydrous ammonia assumes that the ammonia storage tank catastrophically ruptures, and the entire contents of the (administratively controlled) tank are released as a gas over 10 minutes. \n\nThe quantity released (M) in the 10-minute event is calculated as: M = V * AC * D\nWhere V is the total volume of the "

      "SummaryText": "tank (18,000 gallons), AC is the administrative control on the tank (90%), and D is the density of the material stored (5.17 lb/gal or 38 lb/cf).Therefore, M = 18,000 gallons * 90% * 5.17 lb/gal = 83,754 lbs\n\n3b. ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\nThe alternative release scenario assumes the release of the entire (administratively controlled) contents of the tank due to a failure of a fill pipe, outside the tank enclosure. \n\nThe rate of the release (Q2) is calculated as: Q2 = Cd * A * (2gh)^0.5\nWhere Cd is a dimensionless orifice coefficient (0.61); A is the area of the opening (0.0218 ft2); g is gravitational acceleration (32.2 ft/s2); and h is the pressure head exerted on the tank contents (262 ft). Therefore, Q2 = 0.61 * 0.0218 ft2* (2*32.2 ft/s2*262 ft)^0.5 = 1.73 cf/s (3,938 lb/min)\n\nThe time it takes for the entire contents of the tank to be release (t2) is calculated as: t2 = M / Q2 = 21 min.\n\n3c. DISTANCES TO ENDPOINT\n\nFor both worst case and alternative release scenarios, RMP*Comp Version 1.07 was used to calculate the distances to the toxic endpoint (0.14 mg/1 or 200 ppm). Both model scenarios were considered as releases in urban areas, utilized the default atmospheric stability factors/wind speeds, and resulted in offsite impacts. Passive mitigation-release in an enclosure/building is applicable in either scenario but was not used in the alternative release case. Active mitigation available at the site includes water sprinklers to absorb released ammonia and detectors/alarms/operator attention to contain/control a release. However, no active mitigation was utilized in either scenario. \n\nThe RMP*Comp calculated distance to the toxic endpoint for the worst case scenario is 2.6 miles, affecting an estimated population of 2,136, as well as schools, recreation areas, and the Allegheny National Forest. This distance represents the maximum downwind distance that the catastrophic release (under worst case weather conditions) could pose a hazard to the public. For the "

      "SummaryText": "alternative release scenario, the maximum calculated distance to the endpoint using the RMP*Comp model is a more realistic is 0.4 miles, which would affect an estimated population of 160, as well as the Allegheny National Forest. \n\n4. GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nENC operation and safety plans, policies, and prevention procedures as well as planned maintenance (overall management) have been established to minimize the potential for an accidental or catastrophic ammonia release. The storage tank is equipped with a high pressure, magnetically coupled sight gage that allows accurate tank volume measurement. In addition, the ammonia ordering policy minimizes the potentail for overfill, and unloading management procedures, which require two plumbers minimizes the potential for a release during a delivery.\n\n5. 5-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nNo releases of ammonia have occurred within the past five ye4ars that caused any onsite or offsite deaths, injuries, property damage, environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place. \n\n6. EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nENC has prepared and implemented a written Safety Procedure (plant document sAw-004) entitled, Ammonia Emergency Response Plan, effective dated October 1, 2003 and a written Off-Site Response Plan (last update March 20, 2003) to deal with ammonia releases. ENC operations also require compliance and plans associated with OSHA, Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasures (SPCC), Preparedness, Prevention and Control (PPC), the Clean Water Act (CWA), Emergency Planning and Community Right to Know (EPCRA), etc. Currently, ENC is up to date with all related plans and implementation of those plans. ENC has also prepared and implemented additional plant-wide policies/plans (e.g. a hot work permit program) and a Contractor Safety Program as part of the internal Continuous Plant Safety Awareness and Improvement Program.\n\nThe site response plan is registered with the Warren"
