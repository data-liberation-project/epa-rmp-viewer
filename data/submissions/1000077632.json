      "SummaryText": "It is the intent of the City of Bessemer City to provide for chemical safety for all its employees, as well as the general public.  Our overall approach to chemical safety is to keep employees well informed and trained concerning the chemicals through a comprehensive safety policy which contains Hazardous Communication and Emergency Response. Bessemer City is committed to providing for a safe workplace from Management to Supervisors for the safety of all its employees. Procedures, checklists, and logs are kept to ensure that these policies are followed. Our Facility is a 3.0 MGD conventional water treatment facility with process chlorine for oxidation and disinfection. As mentioned above we use chlorine gas which is the regulated substance contained in this report. This substance is used on a daily basis, feeding fron two 1 ton cylinders, and additional cylinders are stored for reserve use. Again the chlorine is in gas form and is injected into the water at various points for the purpose of oxidation and disinfection. The only worst case scenario listed in this plan is for release of chlorine gas by a tank rupture, fusible plug blow out, or through a faulty cylinder valve. Since the cylinders are stored in a closed facility, the release to the ouside environment would be very minimal; however, we have shown that there is a possibility of the chlorine gas traveling approximately 0.80 miles before dissipation.  Due to the above conditions we chose to use the OCA guidance for this scenario. The rules and regulations that we follow concerning the use, accidential release, and the prevention is the OSHA, CFR 29 1910.119 Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals. In our process safety management plan are written instructions on how to handle chlorine pertaining to off loading and changing cylinders. We require specific trained indiviuals to off load and change cylinders and require fire personnel in full turnout gear to be present in all instances of off loa"

      "SummaryText": "ding or changing of cylinders. We keep a log of who enters the chlorine storage area and indiviuals are required to sign and date these logs. Our PSM requires us to have alarms that are visual and audible in the event of a chlorine leak and instructs the facility employees on what to do and who to call by a chain of command chart and an emergency response plan. We are proud to say that within the last 21 years we have had no accidential release of chlorine. Our emergency response plan is coordinated with our local fire department which is on county communications with the Gaston County Emergency Management. Again,we have a chain of command for the supervisor and the employees to follow. Our individuals who handle the chlorine cylinders are trained annually in safe handling of chlorine and we have visual and audible alarms in place. The only upcoming events that we have planned is the continued training of employees in Hazard Communications, Safe Handling of Chlorine, and Emergency Response."
