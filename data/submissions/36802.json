The purpose of MOC is 1) to anticipate incidents that could be created by a change, as well as health and safety issues, and 2) design the change in a way that reduces the likelihood of incidents.  MOC applies to all changes to Refinery equipment, processes, feeds, chemicals, procedures or technology.  \r\n\r\nThe MOC process involves as applicable a review of equipment design, construction, and siting, fire protection, electrical classification, as well as a review of all associated documents and manuals for proper update of the change.  The change passes through several phases of review with an emphasis placed on the type of change and the impact of that change.  The MOC requests are tracked, and once all the required reviews are completed the MOC is given an authorization to implement change approval.  Completed MOC documentation is retained for a minimum of five years.

Many of the refining processes include the formation, combining, or rearranging of regulated flammable substances.  Those regulated flammable substances on location at the Chevron Hawaii Refinery include: hydrogen, methane, ethane, ethylene, propane, propylene, propadiene, butane, butene, 1,3-butadiene, 2-methylpropylene, and pentane. These substances are generally handled as part of a flammable mixture.\r\n\r\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT RESULTS \r\n\r\nThe worst-case scenario associated with a release of flammable substances from Program 3 processes at the Refinery is a vapor cloud explosion involving the largest storage tank containing liquefied petroleum gas (LPG).  The worst case assumes the full tank inventory (accounting for administrative controls limiting the volume to 47% full) is released, completely vaporized, and ignites resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  This scenario would reach offsite and impact nearby public receptors.  However, this scenario is very unlikely as the Refinery has  controls in place to prevent this type of event, including pressure relief valves on the tank, the Refinery Emergency Response Team, and the physical location of the LPG area away from the process area ignition sources.  For this case however, none of these mitigation measures were considered.\r\n\r\nThe alternative release scenario for flammable substances in Program 3 processes at the Refinery is a large release (2-inch line break) from the Dimersol Plant reactor.  If the resulting vapor cloud were to ignite, this scenario could also reach offsite and impact nearby public receptors.  No active or passive mitigation measures limiting the endpoint distance were considered for this scenario. \r\n\r\nThe Refinery has several programs in place to prevent accidents of this nature.

      "SummaryText": "the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis.  A HAZOP study is a systematic review of existing or proposed new equipment Piping and Instrumentation Diagrams (P&IDs) or significant modifications to existing P&IDs for possible deviations from the normal design intent.  A HAZOP is conducted by a team of people with expertise in engineering and process operations.  The team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.   A final list of action items is reviewed with the Refinery Management Team and after concurrence, is distributed for follow-up.  This action item list is tracked to ensure that all follow-up items are completed in a timely manner.  Completed items are documented, and a copy of this document is placed in the HAZOP study manual.  HAZOPs are revalidated at least every five years.  The revalidation includes a review of the changes (design, regulatory, etc.) that have taken place in the process since the last HAZOP and includes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures as with the initial HAZOP. \r\n\r\nOperating Procedures\r\n\r\nThe Refinery maintains written operating procedures addressing each Plant's operational processes including start-up, normal operations, emergency shutdown, planned shutdown, and the initial start-up of a new plant or after a planned maintenance shutdown.  These procedures are available to operations personnel and serve as a basis for training new operations personnel.  These procedures are periodically reviewed and revised as necessary through the management of change process.\r\n\r\nTraining\r\n\r\nThe Refinery also has an active and comprehensive training program for all operations personnel that serves to build on the operating procedures mentioned above.  All new operations personnel must complete an initial four week training session be"

Over the past five years, there have been no accidents involving RMP regulated substances.  As previously mentioned, every Refinery near miss or accident that does occur is thoroughly investigated and the root cause determined.  Lessons learned from the investigation are documented and communicated throughout the Refinery to prevent similar accidents from occurring.  Any findings indicating needed changes in operating procedures are implemented.\r\n\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\r\n\r\nThe Refinery maintains a written emergency response plan describing procedures to protect worker safety and the environment.  The plan consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is released accidentally.  The plan includes procedures and information on all aspects of emergency response, including the incident command system which is the organizational structure used during emergency response, fire fighting equipment and procedures, internal and external assistance and equipment resources, first aid and medical attention procedures, evacuation plans, and notification procedures for government agencies in"

There are also procedures in place for the testing and maintenance of emergency response equipment and procedures for equipment operation.  \r\n\r\nHypothetical drills are conducted on a regular basis.  These drills create and sustain a high degree of accident response awareness by creating what if situations that stimulate thinking and improve readiness of personnel to cope with a variety of emergency situations.  Hypothetical drills include plant drills and formal drills.  During a plant drill, operating situations that may be a potential fire problem are presented and the group goes through the motions of extinguishing the fire.  Other Refinery personnel may be asked to participate depending on the degree of the drill and apparatus required.  Formal drills on a larger scale are scheduled periodically.  These drills can include outside agencies, and participants treat this hypothetical drill situation as if it is a real fire and respond accordingly.\r\n\r\nThe overall emergency response program for the Chevron Refinery is coordinated with the Oahu Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  This coordination includes periodic meetings of the committee, which has members from the local emergency response community, local government officials, and industry representatives.  The Campbell Industrial Park (CIP), where the Refinery is located, has collective emergency management available by way of the CIP Emergency Management Plan.  This plan compliments Refinery resources and is used as a focal point for coordinating emergency response and management for CIP.  The CIP Emergency Management Plan, along with the Refinery plan, is used as a reference during drills for notifications to the appropriate agencies and neighboring businesses.  Tabletop drills are conducted on a periodic basis using the Plan and a hypothetical release scenario.  The LEPC is involved in conducting these drills and other response agencies, including Honolu"
