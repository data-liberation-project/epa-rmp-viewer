The Refinery Safety Policy includes the following guidelines for all employees.  \n\n\n\n* Work is never so urgent or important that we cannot take time to do it safely and correctly.\n\n\n\n* All accidents are preventable.\n\n\n\n* All employees have a responsibility to work safely and to not endanger others by their acts or omissions.\n\n\n\n* Management and supervisors have overall accountability for the safety of all persons in the work place.\n\n\n\n* Safety is a condition of employment for all employees.  All employees will be held accountable for their own safety performance.\n\n\n\nThe Chevron Refinery is committed to protecting the safety and health of people and the environment.  As such, business is conducted in a socially responsible and ethical manner.  The company's goal is to be the industry leader in safety and health performance, and to be recognized worldwide for environmental excellence.  This goal of operational excellence is achieved through designing, operating, and maintaining facilities to prevent injury, illness, and accidents.  Of equal importance in achieving this goal is open communication with the public regarding the possible impact of our business on them or the environment.  The company is prepared for any emergency and will mitigate any accident quickly.\n\n\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\n\n\nThe Chevron Hawaii Refinery is located on the island of Oahu, Hawaii.  The Refinery receives crude oils via tankers for processing into various products.  The process by which crude oil is manufactured into various saleable products (for example, gasoline, kerosene, propane, etc.) is known as refining.  Petroleum refining involves the separation of crude oil into several components using distillation"

Many of the refining processes include the formation, combining, or rearranging of regulated flammable substances.  Those regulated flammable substances on location at the Chevron Hawaii Refinery include: hydrogen, methane, ethane, ethylene, propane, propylene, propadiene, butane, butene, 1,3-butadiene, 2-methylpropylene, and pentane. These substances are generally handled as part of a flammable mixture.\n\n\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT RESULTS \n\n\n\nThe worst-case scenario associated with a release of flammable substances from Program 3 processes at the Refinery is a vapor cloud explosion involving the largest storage tank containing liquefied petroleum gas (LPG).  The worst case assumes the full tank inventory (accounting for administrative controls limiting the volume to 47% full) is released, completely vaporized, and ignites resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  This scenario would reach offsite and impact nearby public receptors.  However, this scenario is very unlikely as the Refinery has  controls in place to prevent this type of event, including pressure relief valves on the tank, the Refinery Emergency Response Team, and the physical location of the LPG area away from the process area ignition sources.  For this case however, none of these mitigation measures were considered.\n\n\n\nThe alternative release scenario for flammable substances in Program 3 processes at the Refinery is a large release (2-inch line break) from the Dimersol Plant reactor.  If the resulting vapor cloud were to ignite, this scenario could also reach offsite and impact nearby public receptors.  No active or passive mitigation measures limiting the endpoint distance were considered for this scenario. \n\n\n\nThe Refinery has several programs in place to prevent accidents of this nature.  A detailed explanation of these programs follows.  \n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM ST"

Because processes at the Refinery that are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency Risk Management Process (RMP) regulation are also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program. The objective of the PSM system is to reduce the consequences of and potential for accidents in the Refinery.  Accidents could include fires, explosions, toxic gas releases, spills, product quality problems, etc.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation \n\n\n\nThe Refinery encourages participation in PSM through training and the development of cross-functional teams to perform process hazards analyses.  The importance of Refinery safety is mentioned as part of every organizational meeting.  Safety topic presentations are frequently included as part of meeting agendas and responsibility for these presentations is often rotated among employees to give everyone a chance to participate.  Operations safety meetings are held on a frequent basis and involve all operators as participants and/or presenters.  Refinery teams that are specifically dedicated to safety and safe behaviors include the Refinery Safety Steering Council and the Chevron Accident Reduction Environment (CARE) group.\n\n\n\nSafety Audits\n\n\n\nPeriodically the Refinery is subject to company internal audits.  These audits include Industrial Hygiene surveys, Fire, Loss Prevention surveys, and Corporate Operational Excellence Reviews.  These audits/surveys ensure the facility is in compliance with recommended practices, policies, and government laws and regulations.\n\n\n\nSafety Meetings\n\n\n\nSafety meetings are conducted weekly for maintenance personnel and periodically for other employees on an as-needed basis.

The council addresses overall safety, fire and health programs and  serves as a communications channel between work groups and the Refinery Management Team.  The council helps evaluate and improve the effectiveness of the programs, and works towards addressing work force concerns.\n\n\n\nChevron Accident Reduction Environment \n\n\n\nCARE is an action-based way of approaching worker safety.  CARE is a behavior-based observational safety process.  CARE will highlight types of risks present in everyday jobs.  Once these risks are highlighted, they are addressed.  Once a month, there is a review meeting with the participants as a whole to discuss \"at risk\" behaviors/situations affecting the workgroup.  The group decides the best way to handle highlighted problems.

A HAZOP study is a systematic review of existing or proposed new equipment Piping and Instrumentation Diagrams (P&IDs) or significant modifications to existing P&IDs for possible deviations from the normal design intent.  A HAZOP is conducted by a team of people with expertise in engineering and process operations.  The team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.   A final list of action items is reviewed with the Refinery Management Team and after concurrence, is distributed for follow-up.  This action item list is tracked to ensure that all follow-up items are completed in a timely manner.  Completed items are documented, and a copy of this document is placed in the HAZOP study manual.  HAZOPs are revalidated at least every five years.

The Refinery safe work practices along with training of personnel who may be involved with these types of work form a system that aides in making sure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\n\n\n\nManagement of Change\n\n\n\nManagement of Change (MOC) is one element of the Refinery's PSM system. The purpose of MOC is 1) to anticipate incidents that could be created by a change, as well as health and safety issues, and 2) design the change in a way that reduces the likelihood of incidents.  MOC applies to all changes to Refinery equipment, processes, feeds, chemicals, procedures or technology.  \n\n\n\nThe MOC process involves as applicable a review of equipment design, construction, and siting, fire protection, electrical classification, as well as a review of all associated documents and manuals for proper update of the change.  The change passes through several phases of review with an emphasis placed on the type of change and the impact of that change.  The MOC requests are tracked, and once all the required reviews are completed the MOC is given an \"authorization to implement change\" approval.  Completed MOC documentation is retained for a minimum of five years.  Training about the change is provided to affected personnel.\n\n\n\nIncident Investigation\n\n\n\nThe intent of the Chevron Refinery incident investigation program is to learn from the incident, prevent a recurrence, and help prevent similar incidents.

The plan consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is released accidentally.  The plan includes procedures and information on all aspects of emergency response, including the incident command system which is the organizational structure used during emergency response, fire fighting equipment and procedures, internal and external assistance and equipment resources, first aid and medical attention procedures, evacuation plans, and notification procedures for government agencies in "

There are also procedures in place for the testing and maintenance of emergency response equipment and procedures for equipment operation.  \n\n\n\nHypothetical drills are conducted on a regular basis.  These drills create and sustain a high degree of accident response awareness by creating \"what if\" situations that stimulate thinking and improve readiness of personnel to cope with a variety of emergency situations.  Hypothetical drills include plant drills and formal drills.  During a plant drill, operating situations that may be a potential fire problem are presented and the group goes through the motions of extinguishing the fire.  Other Refinery personnel may be asked to participate depending on the degree of the drill and apparatus required.  Formal drills on a larger scale are scheduled periodically.  These drills can include outside agencies, and participants treat this hypothetical drill situation as if it is a real fire and respond accordingly.\n\n\n\nThe overall emergency response program for the Chevron Refinery is coordinated with the Oahu Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  This coordination includes periodic meetings of the committee, which has members from the local emergency response community, local government officials, and industry representatives.  The Campbell Industrial Park (CIP), where the Refinery is located, has collective emergency management available by way of the CIP Emergency Management Plan.  This plan compliments Refinery resources and is used as a focal point for coordinating emergency response and management for CIP.  The CIP Emergency Management Plan, along with the Refinery plan, is used as a reference during drills for notifications to the appropriate agencies and neighboring businesses.  Tabletop drills are conducted on a periodic basis using the Plan and a hypothetical release scenario.  The LEPC is involved in conducting these drills and other response agencies, including Honolu"

      "SummaryText": "lu Fire Department and Honolulu Police Department, are active participants.\n\n\n\nThe Refinery has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and the fire department. This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.\n\n\n\nAdd Planned Changes to Improve Safety Section\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Chevron Refinery resolves all significant findings from Process Hazards Analyses, some of which involve modifications to the process.  We have met a previous goal to expand the CARE Program to the entire Refinery workforce.  CARE highlights types of risks present in everyday jobs by behavioral observation.  Once these risks are highlighted, they are addressed.  We have also implemented a more comprehensive repetitive stress injury prevention program as a result of CARE.  Two years ago, the Chevron Hawaii Refinery was recognized by the Hawaii Occupational Safety and Health Department as the first facility in the state to qualify for Merit-Mentor status under Hawaii?s version of OSHA?s Voluntary Protection Program.  We will continue to make safety improvements revolving improving our safety culture and will work to maintain our Hawaii Voluntary Protection Merit-Mentor status.  \n\n"
