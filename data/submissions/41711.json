The company's officers, managers, and supervisors are accountable to carry out the policies of the company relevant to the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous materials.\n\nBrookfield Farms has made a determined effort to develop a plan to prevent releases of regulated substances.  Procedures to assist in the prevention of regulated hazardous material releases are set forth in our Process Safety Management and Risk Management Programs.\n\nIn the event of an accidental release, our Emergency Response Plan will be the guidance for responding to, containing, and reporting such releases.  The Emergency Response Plan includes an Incident Command system for decision-making authority for each stage of a release situation.  The company will coordinate with public responders and emergency services to ensure safety of the public.  Brookfield Farms has trained and developed Emergency Response teams that will provide emergency response in case of a release.\n\nFacility Description and Regulated Substances\n\nThe Brookfield Farms facility is located in Chicago, IL and is primarily engaged in processing, assembly, cutting, packing, or preserving meat and meat byproducts from purchased meats.   Anhydrous Ammonia is used as the refrigerant within the refrigeration system to cool or freeze our product.  Ammonia refrigeration is a closed loop system, meaning the ammonia is continually reused.  Liquid ammonia is changed to a gas and then condensed to a liquid for reuse.\n\nRelease Prevention Program\n\nBrookfield Farms has set forth in its policies the importance of operating safely.  The company has developed programs and policies to minimize the possibility of releases.  Stringent material and contractor requirements have been developed to assure that materials and work conform to recogniz"
