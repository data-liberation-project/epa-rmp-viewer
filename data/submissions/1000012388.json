We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public, as well as protection of the environment.\n\nThe Enterprise Propane Opelika Terminal is owned by Enterprise Products Operating,LLC, and is operated by Enterprise Propane Terminals and Storage,LLC.  The Opelika Terminal is a LPG pipeline terminal connected to the Cixie Pipeline interstate LPG pipeline system.    The process is regulated by the OSHA Process Safety Management Standard for highly hazardous chemicals.\n\nWe use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help provide for the safety of our employees and the public, as well as protection of the environment.  This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including:\n\n*A description of our facility and use of substances required by EPA's RMP regulation and the processes involved\n*A summary of results from our assessment of the potential offsite consequences from accidental chemical releases\n*Emergency Response Programs\n*General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n*A five-year accident history for accidental releases of chemicals at the Opelika Terminal that are regulated by EPA's RMP rule.  \n\nFacility Description\n\nThe Opelika Terminal engages in the pipeline receipt and storage of liquefied propane under pressure, and the loading of propane tank trucks.    The process is regulated by Federal OSHA 29 CFR 1910.119 and 40 CFR Part 68.  "

The propane storage tanks are administratively controlled to hold and not exceed 80% of their capacity.  The facility consists of pressure storage tanks, a truck loading dock, associated piping, valves and other miscellaneous equipment.  The storage terminal also has an odorant injection system used to inject ethyl mercaptan into the tanker trucks during the loading operation. \n\nIn our process we use the following chemicals that the EPA has identified as having the potential to cause significant offsite consequence in the event of a substantial accidental release:\n\nToxics\n\nThere are no toxic materials contained on site above the threshold limits.\n\nFlammables\n\nPropane is a finished product which is received into the storage tanks.  This material is routed from these tanks to the loading docks for  distribution.  Ethyl mercaptan is also present on site as a propane odorant, but is kept at a level below the threshold quantity in the RMP Regulation.\n\nKey Offsite Consequence Analysis Scenarios\n\nThe EPA's RMP rule requires that we provide information about the worst-case scenarios(s) and alternative release scenario(s) for our facility.  The following are brief summaries of these scenarios, including information about the key administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the exposure distances for each scenario.\n\nWorst Case Release Scenario - Regulated Toxic Chemical\n\nNo toxic material above the threshold quantity on site.\n\nAlternate Release Scenario(s) - Regulated Toxic Chemical\n\nNo toxic material above the threshold quantity on site.\n\nWorse Case Scenario - Regulated Flammable Chemicals\n\nThis simulation involves the rupture or failure of a propane storage tank resulting in a simulated vapor cloud explosion.

The quantity and endpoint of the simulation and the specifics of the simulation are available in the specified reporting of the Risk Management Plan\n\nAlternate Case Scenario - Regulated Flammable Chemicals\n\nThe alternate release scenario is a simulated rupture of the supply hose at the loading docks resulting in a three minute release and simulated vapor cloud explosion.  This scenario assumed the pump continued to operate at its normal flow rate for three minutes after the hose break.    Mitigation measures were taken into account when selecting the alternative release scenario.  These measures consisted of reviewing the use check valves, manual shutoff valves, automatic shutoffs, startup and operating procedures, grounding equipment, and excess flow devices.  Activation of the Emergency Shutdown Devices would isolate the source of the material and secure the facility.  All emergency response and early warning procedures to inform employees and the community would be exercised immediately if this were to occur.  The quantity and endpoint of the simulation is contained in the data elements.\n\nWe are using this information to help us ensure that our emergency response plan and the community emergency response plan address all reasonable contingency cases.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nEnterprise maintains an integrated contingency plan, which consolidates all of the various federal, state, and local regulatory requirements for emergency response planning and reporting.  The program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.  Furthermore, the plan is coordinated with the Lee County Sheriff's Department Emergency Management District, which includes the local Opelika Police department, Lee County Sheriff's Department, Opelika Fire Department, and Emergency Medical Service.\n\nIn the event of an accidental release, local Enterprise personnel are trained to sound the alar"

If something out of the ordinary is found, it is reported to management in order to expediently resolve any problems.\n\nThe engineering and administrative controls in place have been established to reduce the risk of an accidental release of identified hazards.  Enterprise is committed to operations that are safe for employees and the surrounding community.\n\nAccident History\n\nRecords are kept for all significant accidental chemical releases that occur at our facility.
