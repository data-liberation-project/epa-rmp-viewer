Facility Information:  The primary activity at this facility is using anhydrous ammonia to produce other ammoniated dry fertilizers (non-regulated substances) to be used as a nutrient for direct field application by growers.\n\n\n\n3.  Worst-Case Scenario/Alternative-Case Scenario:  This facility has developed a worst-case and alternative-case scenario however it has been withheld from this Executive Summary as security-sensitive information as requested by EPA.\n\n\n\n4.  Accidental Release Program:  This facility complies with the various rules and regulations governing the storage and handling of anhydrous and aqua ammonia including ANSI K61.1, OSHA 29 CFR 1910.111 and regulations administered by our state agency.  Training is provided on safe ammonia operations for employees.  \n\n\n\n5.  Five-year Accident History:  There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous or aqua ammonia for the covered process at this facility in the past five years.\n\n\n\n6.  Emergency Response Program:  This facility has a written emergency plan in accordance with OSHA Standards 29 CFR 1910.38 and 1910.120.
