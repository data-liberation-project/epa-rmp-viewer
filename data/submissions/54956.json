      "SummaryText": "Stationary Source Information\nThe Mud Creek WPCP is a NPDES permitted wastewater treatment facility.  The facility uses chlorine in the disinfection process before discharge of treated wastewater to Mud Creek, and in the solids handling process.  The facility is located in southern Lowndes County, Georgia.\nFive Year Accident History\nThe facility has had no accidents in the past five years that resulted in onsite or offsite impacts, or resulted in reqired reporting.\nWorst Case and Alternative Case Scenarios\nThe worst case distance to endpoint is 0.9 miles.  This distance goes beyond the property boundries of the facility.  The alterative case distance to endpoint is 0.1 miles.  This distance does not go beyond the property boundries of the facility.\nAccidental Release Prevention\nThe Mud Creek WPCP complies with generally accepted measures for this business type, and all applicable state and federal laws.  The facility has chlorine storage and feed systems within enclosed buildings.  Process area monitors are used to provide prompt notification of chlorine release.  Written operating procedures are designed to limit the chance of accidental release.\nEmergency Reponse Program\nThe Mud Creek WPCP employees will not respond to a release of chlorine.  The facility has a written policy (with training) to inform the Valdosta Fire Department through the use of 911.  The Valdosta Fire Department has arranged to respond to facility emergencies involving chlorine.  The Valdosta Fire Department is equipped to hande a release to the magnitude in which chlorine is stored.\nPlanned Improvements\nThe facility plans to switch to ultra violet light disinfection and an alternative solids handling process by the year 2014, thereby removing gaseous chlorine from the facility."
