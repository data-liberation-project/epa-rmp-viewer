      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nThe Helena Chemical Company (Helena) Veribest Facility has submitted this updated electronic RMP in compliance with the provisions of the Clean Air Act 112 (r) as codified by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency at 40 CFR Part 68. Standards codified by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration at 29 CFR 1910.119 are not applicable to the operations at this facility because the facility is operated as a retail operation and is exempt from the OSHA standards. This electronic submittal provides conservative estimates of the offsite consequences of an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia from the Veribest Facility located at 10552 FM 388, Veribest, TX. 76886.  The electronic RMP summarizes the policies and procedures implemented by the Veribest Facility to minimize the likelihood of an accident.  The electronic RMP also summarizes the actions that the Veribest Facility has taken to ensure that a response to a release (even though a release is unlikely) will be implemented in a proper and timely manner.\n\nPURPOSE FOR UPDATING RMP\n\nHelena has updated this RMP in response to recent changes in its management of the RMP program.  Helena was not required to update the potentially affected population because there has been no significant change in population or potential receptors since the original RMP.\n\nFACILITY\n\nThe Veribest Facility is a retail agricultural chemical facility.  Anhydrous ammonia is unloaded from a tanker truck and into one of five stationary tanks located at the facility.  The process operations conducted at this facility are performed by the tanker truck operator or Helena personnel.  The tanker truck operator is responsible to OSHA for Process Safety Management compliance relevant to the unloading of anhydrous ammonia to the stationary storage tanks.  Helena personnel are responsible for the unloading of anhydrous ammonia from the stationary storage tanks to the nurse tanks.  \n\nOFF-SITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\n\nWorst case and"

      "SummaryText": " alternative consequence analysis were completed for the ammonia storage process.  The worst case scenario release for the Veribest Facility assumed that all the contents in the largest single storage tank were released.  The release was modeled as if the ammonia tank was punctured on the side at the ground level. The resulting release of ammonia was modeled as a ground level horizontal jet.\n\nThe alternative (or more likely to occur) scenario assumes a rupture of a 3-inch line caused by an impact from a vehicle or some other source on the liquid ammonia transfer line during a major loading or unloading operation.  Although this event is classified as an alternative scenario, even an accident of this type is unlikely to occur due to the safety equipment (rail guards, check valves) and operating procedures that Helena uses to safeguard ammonia transfer operations.\nBoth the worst case and alternative scenario are overly conservative because even a 2-minute release is unlikely to occur since check valves on the system should close immediately upon increased flow resulting from the severed transfer line.\n\nACCIDENT PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe Operations Manager implements the risk management planning process at this Helena facility.  The Operations Manager is assisted by other Helena staff, as directed.  \n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nHelena Chemical Company?s Veribest Facility is a non-responding facility. Helena has coordinated emergency response activities with its local emergency response agency and local fire department.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere have been no on-site deaths, injuries, or significant property damage; or off-site deaths, injuries, property damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place, in the past five (5) years because of the ammonia operations at the Veribest Facility.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nThe Risk Management Plan implemented by Helena Chemical Company at the Veribest Facility complies with the requirements of the Clean Air Act, Section 112(r).
