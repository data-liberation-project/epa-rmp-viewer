Details of MOC can be found in the MOC program in the Procedure Manual.\n\n12.0\tIncident Investigation\n\nIncident Investigations are performed to determine the root cause(s) of incidents in order to prevent future occurrences.  All incidents will be promptly investigated and documented following the incident.  Time is of the essence when performing incident investigations.  Facts can be confused over time.  \n\nEmployees involved in the incident will be interviewed to obtain as much information as possible.  Cooperation of employees is essential to the investigation.  The focus is to find facts, not to place blame.  \n\nAll resolutions and corrective actions will be documented on the report.  The incident investigation reports will be retained.  See the Incident Investigation Program for more details.\n\n13.0\tEmergency Planning and Response\n\nCGP has developed an Integrated Contingency Plan (ICP).  This plan includes emergency planning and response procedures.  It includes emergencies such as bomb threats, severe weather, evacuation, fire/explosion, etc.  All employees are trained according to their responsibility when hired and annually thereafter.  Drills will also be conducted to verify the effectiveness of the program and to ensure employee understanding.  See the ICP for more details.\n\n14.0\tCompliance Audits\n\nCGP will use compliance audits as a technique to gather sufficient facts and information to verify compliance.  A team will be used perform audits of this program.  Theses audits will be conducted every 3 years.\n\nThe team will be selected based on their knowledge, experience and training.

The storage of flammable liquids in atmospheric tanks is exempt from coverage; however the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has indicated that accidents involving flammable liquids would be investigated under the general duty clause.  Manufacturing processes that store or use greater than 10,000 pounds of a flammable liquid are covered.  The distillation, dehydration and evaporation portion of the CGP process contains greater than 10,000 pounds of ethanol, a flammable substance. \n\nSolutions with ammonia content greater than 44 percent and in a quantity greater than 15,000 pounds are regulated under the PSM standard.  The facility is also subject to regulations under EPA RMP 40 CFR Part 68 (see below) and meets the Program 3 eligibility requirements.

Most of the details for this system can be found in the P&ID\u00bfs.\n\n4.0\tProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nAn initial process hazard analysis (PHA) on these processes has been performed.  The PHA was appropriate to the complexity of the process and has identified, evaluated, and controlled the hazards involved.  The methodology used for the initial PHA was a Hazard and Operability Study (HAZOP).  See Appendix 6 for details.\n\nThe PHA is designed to analyze the possible causes and consequences of fires, explosions, releases of toxic chemicals, and major spills of hazardous chemicals.  We shall focus on the equipment, instrumentation, utilities, human actions (routine and non-routine) and external factors that might effect the process.\n\nAt least every 5 years after completion of the initial PHA, the PHA shall be updated and revalidated by a team meeting the qualifications as determined by this program to assure that the PHA is consistent with the current process.  For this update, one or more of the following methodologies can be used, as appropriate:\no\tWhat-if\no\tChecklist\no\tWhat-if Checklist\no\tHazard and operability study (HAZOP)\no\tFailure mode and effects analysis\no\tFault tree analysis\n\n5.0\tOperating Procedures\n\nWritten operating procedures have been developed and implemented to provide clear instruction for safely conducting activities involved in each process consistent with the process safety information and shall address the following phases.\no\tOperating Phase\n\u00bf\tInitial Startup\n\u00bf\tNormal Operations\n\u00bf\tTemporary Operations\n\u00bf\tEmergency Shutdown\n\u00bf\tEmergency Operations\n\u00bf\tNormal Shutdown\n\u00bf\tStartup following a turnaround\n\no\tOperating Limits\n\u00bf\tConsequences of deviation\n\u00bf\tStep required to correct or avoid deviation\n\no\tSafety and Health Considerations\n\u00bf\tProperties of, and hazards presented by, the chemicals used in the proce"
