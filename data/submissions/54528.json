GENERAL INFORMATION\n\nThe raw water supplied to Lubbock is treated by a conventional process involving disinfection, clarification (sedimentation), taste and odor control and filtration.  The Water Treatment Plant employs chloramine disinfection which is the combination of CHLORINE and AMMONIA.  CHLORINE and AMMONIA (chloramines) produce what is known as a combined or total chlorine residual.  The process\nof using CHLORINE and AMMONIA to form chloramines enhances the longevity of the CHLORINE.  Chloramines are used as the primary disinfectant to kill bacteria, algae and other microorganisms, which are undesirable in public water supplies.\nThe treatment process and primary quality is continuously monitored by a staff of state certified water treatment operator's 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.  Other water quality analyses are performed by highly skilled laboratory staff composed of degreed chemist and laboratory technicians.\n\n2. ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION and EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\n    CHLORINE and AMMONIA are present at the Lubbock Water Treatment Plant.  CHLORINE and \nAMMONIA are classified as toxic chemicals under the Environmental Protection Agency's \n(EPA's) Risk Management Program (RMP) rule.  Some of the same properties which \nCHLORINE and AMMONIA valuable and necessary components of the Water Treatment Plant\u00bfs \noperation also makes it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling each chemical\nto prevent unnecessary human exposure, including the threat to plant personnel, neighboring \ncitizens of the City of Lubbock, as well as the environment.\n\nIt is the City of  Lubbock's policy to strictly adhere to all applicable Federal and State guidelines and regulations.  Safety depends on the manner in which CHLORINE and AMMONIA are handled at the plant, the safety devices inherent in the design of the facility, the safe handling procedures, which are in place and the training of personnel."
