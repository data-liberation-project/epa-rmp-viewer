      "SummaryText": "C&S Wholesale Grocers Inc. Took over the Suffield facility in October of 2003.\nC&S Wholesale Grocers Inc. Has begun its facility risk management program by defining the process. The process at the perishable facility is one of refrigeration. To define would be to say that the anhydrous ammonia is used as a refrigerant to absorb heat from inside an insulated vault area and maintain temperatures of -10 F, 28 F, and 34 f. The process of absorbing takes place through evaporators that are suspended from the ceiling of the vaults or in penthouses. The anhydrous ammonia is pumped into these evaporator air handlers with the use of sealed pumps at the rate of 4 to 1 ratio. This means that 4 times the amount of refrigerant is pumped into the evaporator that can be boiled off during the refrigeration cycle. The refrigerant is then recycled to the pump packages. The screw compressors maintain the pressures required to maintain the desired temperature, by sucking a vapor off the top of the pump packages. This vapor is then compressed into a high pressure gas and piped to an evaporative condenser on the roof of the facility. The high -pressure gas is then condensed by removing heat from the refrigerant pipes within the evaporative condenser by passing water and air over them, thus condensing the high-pressure gas into high-pressure liquid. This liquid then drains into a high pressure liquid receiver. The level of refrigerant in the pump packages is maintained by a float switch allowing liquid refrigerant into thte low stage and high stage pump packages, each having it's own float switch. This liquid is supplied by liquid in the high pressure receiver. There the process being performed is one of boiling (therefore absorbing heat) and condensing (therfore rejecting heat into the atmosphere) within a closed loop system.\n\nThe facility's approach to chemical safety is taken from 29 CFR 1910.119\nWithin this reference are the following:\n\nEMPLOYEE PARTICIPATION\nWe have an on-going proces"

Employees have been involved in every aspect of the PSM program. There have not been any additions to the process since installation of the original equipment.\n\nPROCESS SAFETY INFORMATION\nThe contradctor information that was compiled during construction is complete. Although we , through the Process Hazard Analysis have approached all aspects of the information to confirm these facts. Since the process involved is one of refrigeration, the majority of the information needed is compiled on the M.S.D.S. Toxicity, permissible exposure limits, physical data, reactivity data, corrosive data, thermal and chemical stability data, and hazards of inadvertent mixing of different materials all are contained on the M.S.D.S. And are on file. It is also covered by our hazardous communication program posted in the warehouse.\n\nINFORMATION ON TECHNOLOGY OF THE PROCESS\n\nBlock flow diagrams have been made on a one-line diagram for simplicity. They include the zone valve locations for quick reaction by untrained eyes. The as built mechanical drawings and electrical diagrams are readily available in the maintenance office, and in the Emergency Response box located at the Guard Shack entering the facility. They are updated to show changes that have occurred in the program.\n\nMAXIMUM INTENDED INVENTORY\n\nThe Suffield facility has 15,200 lbs. Of anhydrous ammonia. Since our process is one of refrigeration all of our equipment is and has been purchased and designed for the pressure and temperature relationships of NH3. Each and every aspect of the process has been examined by hazard analysis.\n\nEVLUATION OF THE CONSEQUENCES OF DEVIATIONS\n\nC&S Wholesale Grocers Inc.
