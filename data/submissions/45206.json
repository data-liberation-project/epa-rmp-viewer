The risk management program is to be described in a Risk Management Plan (RMP) that is registered with the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection and made available to the public.  At General Chemical Newark Works, two extraordinarily hazardous substances (EHSs) are managed in quantities greater than the threshold quantity.  The chemicals are Oleum (20-27%) and Sulfur Trioxide gas which is generated as an intermediate that is immediately used in another section of the system to produce Sulfuric Acid.\n\nThis RMP was prepared in accordance with N.J.A.C. 7:31-7.1, which provides a format for a written RMP.\n\nThis previous RMP update and updated off-site consequence analysis, were submitted to reflect the discontinued production and use of 65% Oleum and 98% Nitric Acid from our property.\nThis update includes revised Contact information and Worst Case Scenario information\nA hazard assessment was completed consisting of a new worst case release scenario and alternative case release scenarios.  The hazard assessment was conducted in accordance with 40CFR part 68 Subpart B (68.20-68.42) (incorporated by reference into N.J.A.C. 7:31), as well as guidance provided by the USEPA\u00bfs Off-site Consequence Analysis Guidance Document.\n\n1.0 Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nAs part of General Chemical, Newark Works is committed to being a responsible member of the community.

Methods of minimizing or reusing wastes, in addition to using energy and materials wisely are encouraged.  A key element of the General Chemical Health, Safety and Environmental Policy is fostering openness through dialogue with employees and the public.  We are committed to operating and maintaining all of our processes in a safe and responsible manner.  We pay close attention to those chemicals which OSHA and the EPA identify as hazardous substances.  Our policy is to conform to all applicable laws and regulations, as well as codes and recommended practices to ensure the safety of the public and the environment.  We use accidental release prevention programs to make sure our processes are managed safely.  We also prepared for potential emergencies to protect employees and the public in the event of a chemical release.\n\nSafety is an important issue at Newark Works.  Monthly meetings are held with plant employees to address environmental and safety issues.  The plant also has regular audits, which are conducted by internal employees and corporate audit teams.  The recommendations obtained through these audits are used to improve the environmental health and safety status at Newark Works.\n\nIn addition to internal audits, the plant is inspected regularly by the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection for compliance with the state of New Jersey\u00bfs Toxic Catastrophe Protection Act regulatory requirements.  These inspections have occurred annually since 1986 when the regulation became effective.\n\n2.0 Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nAt this facility, Sulfur is burned to form Sulfur Dioxide, which is reacted with air in catalytic converters to form Sulfur Trioxide.  The Sulfur Trioxide is then hydrated to form Sulfuric Acid and Oleum in absorption towers.   The Sulfuric Acid is cooled"

An abatement system downstream of the absorption towers maintains facility emissions within permitted limits.  The quantities of these chemicals maintained on site are as follows:  27% Oleum/2,000,000 pounds and Sulfur \n\n3.0 Key Off-Site Consequence Analysis Scenarios\n\nEPA\u00bfs RMP rule requires that we provide information about the worst-case release scenario and alternative release scenarios for our facility.  The following are brief summaries of these scenarios.\n\n3.1 Worst Case Release Scenario\n\nThe worst case release scenario for Oleum is the failure of a storage tank containing 2,000,000 pounds of 27% Oleum.  Secondary containment is considered in this scenario which has a surface area of 8,047 square feet.  The scenario assumes all Oleum in the storage unit would be spilled into the secondary containment area in 10 minutes.  The estimated distance to the toxic end point of 0.010 mg/l was calculated to be 0.6 miles based on a release rate of 13.4 pounds per minute.  The physical parameters of the Oleum are as follows:  27%, 77\u00baF and 18 mmHg.  The calculation was performed using RMP-Comp software.  The conditions defined by the EPA for modeling the worst case scenario are 1.5 m/s wind speed, F stability and an air temperature of 77\u00baF.  The topography is urban.\n\n3.2 Alternative Case Release Scenarios\n\n3.2.1 The alternative case release scenario for Oleum is the failure of a transfer line during transfer from the process to the storage unit, which causes the release of 1,189 pounds in 10 minutes.  Administrative mitigation is considered in this scenario.  An Operator in on site at all times to shut down the process in emergency situations.

The accident prevention program implemented at Newark Works includes procedures and practices which address each of the required elements of the RMP regulation including:\n\n? Process Safety Information \u00bf Information relating to he hazards of the chemical, process technology and equipment information are maintained to ensure proper operation.\n? Mechanical Integrity \u00bf Equipment is routinely inspected and maintenance activities are managed in a manner to maintain the integrity of the equipment on site.\n? Process Hazard Analysis \u00bf Processes are routinely analyzed to identify and correct potential hazards, as well as increase the safety of the operating conditions.\n? Annual Safety Review \u00bf All procedures associated with the TCPA program are reviewed on an annual basis to ensure proper information and direction is provided for employees.\n? Standard Operating Procedures \u00bf Detailed procedures are in place identifying actions necessary for multiple phases of operation, operating limits and safety considerations.\n? Employee Participation \u00bf Employees at all levels are involved in key roles of the release prevention program.\n? Training \u00bf Employees in the operating process are trained in detail o ensure proper operation of the plant.\n?
