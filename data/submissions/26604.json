Facility Policy\nThe Managment and Employees are committed to the prevention of any type of accidental release of NH3 or any other type of chemical that is stored at this facility.  The Great Bend Coop is a Farmland Industries \"AG-21\" member, one of the only three in the State of Kansas.  AG-21 is a program that is Environmental Driven.\n\n2.  Facility Information\nThe NH3 plant is located in the southwest corner of the City of Ellinwood.  The plant has two tanks of 26,000 and 11,000 gallons.\n\n3.  The Worst Case and Alternate Case Scenario\nWorst case scenario would release 172,908 in a ten minute period of 17,300 per minute, with an end point of 4.4 miles.  The alternate release involves overfilling of a nurse trailer and this would travel 0.1 mile to endpoint.  The alternate release, that are expressed are estimates.\n\n4.  Accidental Release Prevention Program\nThe Coop recognizes all safety procedures required by State and Federal Regulations.  The Coop complies with recommendations from Farmland's AG-21 policies and general industry standards.  The most common accidental release would be from over filling nurse trailers.  An example would be if a trailer would be filled from 85-90% on a cold morning, as the air temperature rises, the product expands and causes the pressure relief valves to let product escape.  The Great Bend Coop's policy is not to fill trailers above 86%.\n\n5.  Five Year Accident History\nThe Coop has not had a major accidental release within the last five years.\n\n6.  Emergency Response Program\nThe coop has an Emergency Response Plan, Emergency Action Plan, and an Employee Safety Committee. All areas have worked with the County, City, and the Coop's Insurance Loss Control Department, to develop these plans.\n\n7.  Planned Safety Changes\nThe Company Safety Committee, which is comprised of a representative from each Branch or Department once in a twelve month period s"
