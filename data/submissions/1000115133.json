The procedures are kept current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process. \n\t\nIn addition, the Canute Natural Gas Processing Plant maintains Operating Procedures and/or process safety information that provide guidance on how to respond to upper or lower limit exceedances for specific process or equipment parameters.  This information is readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\t\nTraining\n\t\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the Canute Natural Gas Processing Plant has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  New employees receive basic training in gas plant operations if they are not already familiar with such operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests and skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years.  All training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\t\nContractors\n\t\nThe Canute Natural Gas Processing Plant uses contractors to supplement its work force during periods of increased mainten"

This PHA Team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary. \n\t\nThe PHA team's recommendations are reviewed with corporate management to approve or revise recommended mitigation actions.  Once approved, mitigation actions are assigned a relative risk ranking based upon the magnitude/immediacy of necessary actions to reduce hazard risks - as deemed necessary by the PHA Team, PHA Team Leader, and/or Corporate Management.  This risk reduction ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All management-approved PHA Team recommendations are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\t\nPeriodically, the Canute Natural Gas Processing Plant updates and revalidates the initial PHA to ensure that process controls remain technologically adequate, and that process hazards are minimized and are within acceptable company risk tolerances.  The PHA Revalidation verifies that the process does not deviate significantly from its original engineering design and safety features. These periodic revalidations/reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is decommissioned.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.  As with the initial analysis, the PHA Team findings / recommendations will be forwarded to corporate management for approval / revision and the final resolution of the action tasks will be documented and retained.\n\t\nOperating Procedures\n\t\nThe Canute Natural Gas Processing Plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, including (1) initial startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shut"

In addition to following the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP), the Canute Plant follows applicable laws set forth in OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) standard 29 CFR 1910.119.\n\t\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS RESULTS\n\t\nUnder the RMP regulations, the Canute Natural Gas Processing Plant is classified as a Program Level 1 facility.  Under Program Level 3 guidelines, the Worst-Case Scenario (WCS) associated with a release of a regulated flammable substance is a Vapor Cloud Explosion (VCE) involving the full inventory of the largest storage tank containing NGL mixture.  A written procedure is in place to limit the storage inventory, however it is assumed that the entire tank capacity is 193,200 lbs. (100% of the maximum tank capacity) of this tank and are assumed to release and ignite, resulting in a VCE.  The maximum distance to the 1-psi endpoint for this WCS is 0.5 miles or 2,640 feet.  Additionally, although we have numerous controls to prevent such releases and to manage their consequences, no credit for passive mitigation measures was taken into account in evaluating this WCS for the Canute Natural Gas Processing Plant.\n\n\t\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\t\nThe following is a summary of the accidental release prevention program in place at the Canute Natural Gas Processing Plant.
