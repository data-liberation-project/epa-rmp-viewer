      "SummaryText": "Wilkins-Rogers Flour Mill employs chlorine gas in the process of flour production for pH adjustment and micro control.  CL2 containers are located in a separate housing (building of its own @ 2688 ft3) with an exhaust fan (1 min room air exchange).  Cylinders are situated with the valve side to an exterior door and tanks in cradles to minimize movement.  All piping is seamless schedule 80 and is hard piped to the vacuum side of the secondary valve which is vacuum actuated.  The primary valve is electronic.  Tanks are hooked up with pneumatically operated on-off valves attached to the head valves and interlocked electronically to chlorine sensors which are tied in to the automatic shut-off valves.  A sensor in the tank area will discontinue the flow of CL2  via the automatic shut-off valves and activate the exhaust fan when >1ppm is sensed. A sensor in the process area will do the same and in addition actuate an alarm at the panel.  Once CL2 is stopped, low pressure alarms are sounded.  Training is provided annually by the supplier.  "
