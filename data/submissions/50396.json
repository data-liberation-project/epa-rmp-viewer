Given the quantity handled, anhydrous ammonia is considered a hazardous substance by EPA.  Many of the properties that make ammonia valuable as a refrigerant also require that precautions and procedures be in place to protect employee and public health and safety during a chemical emergency.  It is the policy of Twin City Foods to be in compliance with all applicable federal and state rules and regulations.    \n\nSafety at our facility is inherent on the manner in which anhydrous ammonia is handled.  While the design of the facility incorporates a multitude of safety devices, safe handling procedures combined with appropriate training of our personnel are key aspects to maintaining safety at our facility.  Twin City Foods policy is \"Safety First\".\n\nWe have a written Process Safety Management (PSM) plan that complies with the regulations stipulated by WAC 296-67.  A crucial component of this plan is the Emergency Response Plan, developed in compliance with the Emergency Response provisions of WAC 296-824.  The Emergency Response Plan includes pre-emergency planning and coordinating with outside parties.  This enables those who deal with emergencies to have a course of action to effectively deal with unplanned events.  \n\n1.20 Facility Description And Substances Handled\n\n? The Twin City Foods manufacturing facility was designed for the processing of sweet corn which is harvested, processed and frozen in August through October of each year.  The plant was built in 1998 and includes a cold storage area and ammonia refrigeration system.\n\n? Access to the facility is restricted to authorized employees, management personnel, and contractors.\n\n? High efficiency screw compressors and top quality components were used throught the ammonia refrigerat"

The majority of this refrigeration equipment is support for fresh pack operations lasting 10-12 weeks per year after which the ammonia is pumped back to holding vessels until required the next season. Fifteen percent of the refrigeration equipment is online to support cold storage operations 12 months each year. Per the mechanical code our refrigeration spaces are monitored by ammonia detection systems, with audio and visual alarms, central station monitoring and automatic exhaust systems interlocked to shunt breakers which isolate protected spaces from electrically induced explosion.  A 15,000 gallon water tank is piped to all relief valves in case of overpressurization and subsequent relief valve venting. \n \n? The regulated substance handled at this facility is anhydrous ammonia.  The ammonia refrigeration system maximum inventory is 60,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.\n \n1.30 The worst-case release scenario(s) and the alternative release scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\n\nRelease scenarios were modeled using RMP*Comp (Version 1.07), a software program developed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and EPA.  Offsite receptors were defined using the LandView 5 (Version 1.0) system.  This system estimates residential population within the circle defined by the endpoint of the worst-case and alternative release scenarios.  In addition, it lists whether certain types of public receptors and environmental receptors are within the circles.\n\n1.40 General Accidental Release Prevention Program And Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nTwin City Foods complies with EPA?s Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations.  The design and construction of this facility was in accordance with published standards, tests or recommended methods of trade, industry or governmental organizations.  \n\nTwin City Foods?s written PS"

      "SummaryText": "M plan incorporates many policies and procedures to ensure safe operation and maintenance of this facility.  Plan elements essential to safe operation of the refrigeration system include employee participation, process hazard information, process hazard analysis, operating procedures, training, contractor safety, pre-startup safety review, mechanical integrity, management of change, hot-work permits, incident investigation, emergency response and planning, and compliance audits.  This plan will be reviewed annually and updated as necessary by the Twin City Foods Managment. \n\nOperations and maintenance training are on-going year 'round. Training is provided to ensure that each employee involved in operating a process has been trained in an overview of the process, the operating procedures, and safety considerations.  This training uses guidelines developed by the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) and Refrigeration Engineers and Technicians Association (RETA).  Only qualified maintenance personnel operate and interact with the refrigeration system.  This minimizes the chances of inadvertent error in operation that could lead to a release of ammonia.  Startup, shutdown, and any onstream adjustments are handled by these qualified persons.  Offsite safety training is utilized when available.\n\n1.50 Five-Year Accident History\n\nThere has been no significant release of ammonia at Twin City Foods in the past five years.\n\n1.60 Emergency Response Program\n\nTwin City Foods has a written Emergency Response Plan to ensure that precautions and procedures are in place to protect employee and public health and safety during a chemical emergency.  It complies with the provisions of WISHA Emergency Response regulations, WAC 286-824.  The Emergency Response Plan includes pre-emergency planning and coordinating with outside parties.

The refrigeration process has back-up prevention systems to keep processing malfunctions from becoming ammonia release emergencies.  If an emergency does occur, the following response personnel, facilities, and equipment are in place:\n\n? Incident Command Center\n? Emergency Alarm and Communication System\n? Emergency Response Team\n? Evacuation Plans and Assembly Points\n? Radios, SCBA's cannister masks, class A suits and monitors\n\nThe role and procedures for obtaining external emergency assistance have been formally established with the Pasco Fire Department and Benton County HAZMAT.  The Emergency Response Plan also includes procedures for notification of any potentially affected neighbors.  \n\nAll Twin City Foods personnel will be trained to fulfill their designated responsibilities in an emergency.  Mock emergency drills will be held periodically to maintain familiarity with response actions and identify plan elements requiring improvement.\n\nThis plan will be reviewed annually and updated as necessary by the Twin City Foods Plant Manager.\n\n1.70 Planned Changes To Improve Safety\n\nTwin City Foods Pasco has completed a Process Hazard Analysis of the system. \n\nOur mitigation and control systems are current state of the art and comply with the most recent codes and standards. We are continually training and searching for better and safer methods of operation. We are also upgrading our mechanical integrity program when possible with more frequent and better methods of NDT, maintenance, and inspection, etc.\n\nWe are currently replacing our fixed detection system and adding areas monitored.
