Sulfur dioxide is\nused to dechlorinate the disinfected effluent prior to discharge to the environment.  This is\nconsidered to be a single, continuous process.  The gasses are delivered, stored, and drawn from\none-ton containers. The Emergency Response Plan has been in existence since 1991 and is\ncoordinated with the local emergency response organizations.\n\nRelease Scenarios\n\n     The worst case scenario assumes the Environmental Protection Agency mandated\nelements as defined in 40 CFR 68.  The basis for the calculation is the release of one ton (2000\npounds) of chlorine or sulfur dioxide ( greatest quantity held in a single vessel) at 0 feet\nelevation, 100 degrees Fahrenheit, 10 minutes duration, with an atmospheric stability class F.\n\n     The Alternative scenario assumes the same quantity, a break in the gas withdrawal tubing\nat the tank connection, a temperature of 77.33\u00f8F (the mean monthly maximum, at the closest\nreporting station, for 5 years 1992 to 1996), and an atmospheric stability of D.  This simulates a\nspring or summer day that may occur with children occupying neighboring schools. \n\nRelease Prevention"

      "SummaryText": "The general release prevention program is based on training and material selection.  The\noperating personnel are trained in the proper operation, maintenance, connection-disconnection,\nand emergency response for the chemicals employed at the Kent Narrows-Stevensville-\nGrasonville (KNSG) Wastewater Treatment Plant.  The two chemicals a similar enough that the\noperations are essentially the same.\n\n     All gas-containing tubing and control devices are selected for specific material\ncompatibility and Code and Standard compliance.  The systems are regularly and routinely\ninspected and maintenance performed as appropriate.  The two gas handling systems have been\ncompletely rebuilt since the original construction.\n     The KNSG Wastewater Treatment Plant will be undergoing an expansion which will\ninclude the replacement of gaseous chlorine disinfection with ultraviolet light disinfection.  This\nreplacement will also eliminate the need for sulfur dioxide dechlorination.  It is expected that all\nlisted chemicals will be removed by July 31, 2001.\n\nAccident History\n\n     To date, there have been no accidental releases resulting in either employee injury on-site,\nor with off-site consequences.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\n     The Emergency Response Program is based on the use of KNSG WWTP employees\ntrained  to respond to, and control, an accidental release of either chlorine or sulfur dioxide.  The\nemployees are trained in the use of Personal Protective Equipment and specialized ton-container\npatching kits.  There is no chemical emergency or hazardous materials response organization,\neither public or commercial, off-site within a reasonable distance or response time."
