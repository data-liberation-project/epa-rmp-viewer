      "SummaryText": "INTRODUCTION\nThe City of Dallas Water Utilities maintains a policy of safe water and wastewater treatment plant operation, reducing to the greatest extent possible any hazards associated with the treatment processes, and reducing any subsequent risk to the surrounding community, their employees, and the environment. They cooperate with the surrounding community and local emergency response agencies to promote effective contingency planning in the unlikely event that a process incident occurs.\n\nAs part of this policy, Dallas Water Utilities maintains compliance with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency?s (USEPA) regulations for the prevention and mitigation of accidental releases of extremely hazardous substances under section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act.   Facilities covered by the regulations (40 CFR 68) are required to implement a risk management program and submit a description of the program (called a risk management plan, or RMP) to USEPA.  \n\nThe Forney Pump Station falls under this regulation because of the onsite storage and use of chlorine.  The amount of chlorine stored exceeds the threshold limits specified by the USEPA, thereby making the facility subject to compliance with the regulation.  Dallas Water Utilities first submitted a RMP for the Forney Pump Station to USEPA in 1999.  RMPs must be updated and resubmitted to USEPA every five (5) years.  The following information summarizes the Forney PS 2004 update and resubmission:\n\nREGULATED SUBSTANCES\nThe Forney Pump Station uses chlorine as a pretreatment disinfectant in the water treatment process.  The pump station pumps raw water from Lake Ray Hubbard into the Eastside Water Treatment Plant (WTP).  Water is treated at the plant and subsequently pumped into the distribution network of pipelines, pump stations, and storage tanks.\n\n1. Chlorine\nThe Forney Pump Station regularly has a maximum storage quantity of 50 tons of chlorine at its facility.  The chlorine is stored in two 25-ton stationary tanks. "

      "SummaryText": " The total amount of chlorine exceeds the threshold limit of 2,500 pounds set by the USEPA.  The chlorine is delivered to the Forney Pump Station by a tanker truck.  \n\nThe existing chlorine feed facility at the Forney Pump Station consist of the inside storage tanks (two 25-ton bulk tanks), liquid feed piping and miscellaneous valves, two evaporators, gas piping and miscellaneous valves, three chlorinators, and a ?once-through? scrubber system.  A release of chlorine gas could potentially occur at the chlorine storage area or at the chlorine process areas.\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT\nIn May 2004, Dallas Water Utilities and Malcolm Pirnie, Inc. reviewed and updated the offsite consequence analyses at Forney Pump Station.   Safety information and hazard analysis documentation were reviewed to determine whether the parameters and assumptions used in the 1999 analyses are still valid. The results of this review are documented and are maintained as part of the RMP records.  Any changes resulting from this review are reported in this resubmission.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nThe accident history for the Forney Pump Station was reviewed for the period from June 1999 through June 2004.  During this period of time, no accidental releases of chlorine occurred that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on-site, or off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or any environmental impact.\n\nPREVENTION PROGRAM\nThe Dallas Water Utilities maintains a consistent accidental release prevention program to eliminate or minimize releases of chlorine at Forney Pump Station.  The program consists of seven elements:\n\n1. Safety Information\nDallas Water Utilities has maintained information concerning process chemicals, technology, and equipment as part of their risk management program at Forney PS.  The information is made available to employees and contractors at Forney PS who will work in the chlorine process area.  Emergency response planners ca"

Hazard Review\nA hazard review of chlorine processes and procedures is conducted at least every five (5) years to evaluate potential causes and consequences of accidental releases.  A chlorine hazard review using the ?What-If? method was conducted by Malcolm Pirnie, Inc. with the assistance of Eastside WTP / Forney Pump Station plant management and staff familiar with the process? operation and maintenance in May, 2004.  The results of this review identified changes in operating, maintenance, and other process safety management procedures that would improve the overall safety of the chlorine systems. The changes that most effectively help prevent an accidental release have been implemented, or will be in the future.\n\n3. Operating procedures\nDallas Water Utilities have developed and implemented written operating procedures that provide instructions and steps for conducting activities associated with the chlorine processes at the Forney Pump Station consistent with the safety information. Forney Pump Station operating procedures include startup, shutdown, and emergency operating procedures, and describe how the system should be operated in order to minimize the chances of an accidental release. The procedures also emphasize safety considerations during operation and address hazardous situations that can occur and how to correct them.\n\n4. Training\nEastside WTP staff operates and maintain the Forney Pump Station. Eastside WTP staff assigned to chlorine process duties at the Forney Pump Station have been trained in the classroom and/or during on-the-job training in an overview of the processes and in the operating procedures, as is new staff assigned to the processes.  Training includes emphasis on safety and health, hazards, emergency operations including shutdown, and safe work practices.  Refresher training is provided at least every three years to ensure Eastside WTP / Forney Pump Station staf"

Maintenance\nDallas Water Utilities has developed and implemented a preventive and corrective maintenance program at the Forney Pump Station to ensure equipment used to process, store, or handle chlorine is functioning properly and installed to minimize the risk of releases.   The program addresses equipment testing, inspection, and preventive maintenance schedules, and documentation of equipment testing, inspection, and preventive and corrective maintenance activities. \n\n6. Compliance audits\nUSEPA?s risk management rule requires that Dallas Water Utilities complete a compliance audit for the Forney Pump Station risk management program at least once every 3 years. The primary goals of conducting a compliance audit are to verify compliance with risk management rule requirements and good process safety practices, identify process safety or program deficiencies and develop corrective actions, and increase safety awareness among Eastside WTP / Forney Pump Station staff.\n\nMalcolm Pirnie, Inc., with the assistance of Eastside WTP / Forney Pump Station plant management and staff familiar with the processes operation and maintenance, conducted an audit as part of the RMP update in May, 2004.  The results of this audit, in addition to recommendations made, are documented and are maintained as part of the RMP records. \n\n7. Incident Investigation\nEastside WTP / Forney Pump Station management investigates each incident that resulted in or could reasonably have resulted in a catastrophic release of chlorine or sulfur dioxide. A process to identify the underlying causes of incidents and implement procedures for preventing similar events has been developed. \n\nAn incident investigation team will be established following criteria established in the Forney Pump Station risk management program.  As part of the investigation, an incident report will be prepared to recommend system changes (i.e., operational modifications, "

The incident investigation report and any changes resulting from the report will be reviewed with all staff members who operate and maintain the applicable system.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN\nAn Emergency Response Plan (ERP) has been developed for the Forney Pump Station, which provides specific emergency response procedures for accidental releases of chlorine to ensure that emergency response coverage is available 24 hours per day, 7 days per week.  These procedures include leak investigation, operational-level response activities, and communications to coordinate response activities with outside agencies, such as the City of Dallas Fire Department HAZMAT Team, in the event of an emergency. \n\nIn 2004, the Dallas Water Utilities will update and incorporate this ERP and sections of the risk management plan into an ?all-hazard? integrated contingency plan (ICP).  The ICP format will minimize duplication in the preparation and use of emergency response and risk management plans for various regulatory requirements and will eliminate confusion for Forney PS staff that may have to decide which plan applies to a particular emergency.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n- Require an operator to be present when chlorine is delivered.\n\n- Install high-pressure alarms.\n\n- Install valve position telemetry at the Eastside Water Treatment Plant to provide operators with this information.\n\n- Consider the possibility of installing a remote sensor beneath the isolation apron.\n\n- Consider installing CCTV surveillance to allow operators at the Eastside Water Treatment Plant to monitor the Forney PS.\n\n- Develop a SOP to require a minimum of two people to work on the chlorine lines at one time."
