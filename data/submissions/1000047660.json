      "SummaryText": "1.     Facility Accidental Release Policy\n\n\n\nThe owners, management, and emloyees of Environmental Technologies Inc facility at 379 E. 300 S., Jerome Idaho are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of stored formaldehyde.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.  \n\n\n\n2.     Facility Information\n\n\n\nThe primary activity at the Jerome facility is the storage of the formaldehyde solution.\n\n\n\nThe regulated substance, 37% formaldehyde liquid solution, will be received via railcar, stored in above ground storage tanks and transfered to DOT regulated transportation vehicles for delivery to customers. The maximum quantity of formaldehyde stored at the Jerome location is 31,000 gallons which is stored in 5 seperate above ground storage tanks within a containment area.\n\n\n\nThis location has standard operating procedures in place, an inspection and maintenance program, employee training and a completed risk analysis.  The risk associated with product transfer and storage is deemed low compared to chemical processing locations.  \n\n\n\nSince the covered process is restricted to the storage of the product there are no full time employees associated directly with this location.  However, there are 2 full time employees who work for the location and assume other duties related to the transporation of the product to customers.  As such, their part time availability at the location will be indicated as 1 full time employee for the site. The storage process is located on the tenents property where employees are present on a daily basis as part of the other company located on-site.\n\n\n\n3.     The Worst-Case Scenario and Alternative Release Scenario\n\n\n\nThe Worst-Case Scenario.       Failure of the largest storage tank when filled to the greatest amount would release 81,000 pounds of 37% formaldehyde,"

      "SummaryText": " which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at capacity.  The largest volume selected is from the temporary storage tank #5 which is only utilized for temporary storage when the capacity of tanks 1 through 4 are exceeded.  The distance to the endpoint using RMP Comp is 0.30 miles. The endpoint for release from the normal storage tanks 1-4 would be less.\n\n\n\nAlternative Release Scenario.       The alternate release scenario, based on the most likely potential incident, is a release from the storage vessel at one of the connections.  This would produce a 6 square inch hole with 48inches of liquid above the hole.  The distance to the endpoint is 0.20 miles for this alternative scenario if 22100 pounds of product were released into the diked containment area.\n\n\n\n4.     Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\n\n\n  The facility has implemented a quarterly documented inspection program of all tank and associated piping.  In addition, a visual inspection is conducted each time personnel are present at the storage location.  Inspection checklist is utilized for the quarterly inspections and a list of items to visually inspect during each visit is also available.  Maintenance is performed according to manufacturer recommendations and is available as an SOP.\n\n\n\n5.     Five-Year Accident History\n\n\n\nThere have been no accidental releases or near misses of Formaldehyde in the past five years that:\n\n\n\nhave caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor\n\n\n\nhave resulted in off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n\n\n6.     The Emergency Response Program\n\n\n\nThis location will be a non-responding facility.\n\nAllowable actions for employees include the following:\n\n\"responses to incidental releases of hazardous substances where the substance can be absorbed, neutralized, or otherwise controlled at the time of release by employees in the immediate release area, or by maintenance pers"

Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the storage location.  Employee and public safety is the first priority."
