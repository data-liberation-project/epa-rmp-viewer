Piatt, Facility Manager at:\n\nSimplot AgriBusiness\nRivergate Terminal\n14003 N. Rivergate Blvd.\nPortland,  OR     97203\n\nPhone: (503) 247-7971\n\n1.  Policies and Guidelines\n\nIt is the policy of the J.R. Simplot Company (Policy Statement EN 01.1) to manufacture, handle, store and dispose of all substances safely and in compliance with the requirements of federal, state and local environmental laws while reducing the risks to human health, safety and the environment. Each manager is expected to responsibly implement this policy, and each employee is expected to comply fully with the spirit, as well as the letter of this policy. The Company will assure that the environmental, health and safety laws, regulations, and standards applicable to its products and operations are known and obeyed by employees.\n\nIt is the policy of the Simplot AgriBusiness group, of the J.R. Simplot Company (Policy Statement M & C #3) that the processing, manufacturing, storage, shipping, or disposal of products and materials shall be carried out in a manner consistent with the protection of public safety and the environment, and in full conformity with the requirements of the law.\n\nThe J.R. Simplot Company Guideline (Guideline Statement SA 01.2) states that the Company is committed to reducing incidents or occurrences in the workplace that result in human injury, illness, or death, and/or destruction or loss to the corporation's assets and to be in compliance with all laws and regulations governing workplace safety. It is, therefore, our intent to provide a safe work environment and to protect the corporation's assets. This guideline applies to all groups and separate operating entities of the J.R. Simplot Company. Emergency plans shall be developed for each operating unit outlining the practices and procedures for emergency medical care, fire response, evacuation, or"

Regulated Substance(s)\n\nThe substance(s) that are routinely stored at this facility would be Anhydrous Ammonia at or above the threshold level for the RMP. \n\nAnhydrous Ammonia is received, stored and distributed to area fertilizer suppliers and/or farms as a source of land applied Nitrogen fertilizer, or could be distributed to industrial use customers. \n\nMaximum Quantity Stored at this site is 101,000,000 pounds of Anhydrous Ammonia in 2 - 9,708,738 gallon atmospheric storage tank(s). The maximum quantity handled would be 50,500,000 pounds of Anhydrous Ammonia.  \n\n3.  Worst-Case and Alternative Release Scenario\n\nThe worst-case release scenario (yielding the greatest distance to toxic endpoint) for Anhydrous Ammonia would be the release of the total contents of the railroad tank car released as a gas over a 10 minute period. The maximum quantity released would be 145,000 pounds. This represents the contents of a tank car at 85 percent capacity, as limited by design standards. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 4.40 miles. \n\nThe alternative release scenario based on the five year accident history (or the most likely potential incident) is a release from a pressure relief valve on the top of one of the atmospheric storage tanks (F-150 or F-400), which is estimated to release 17,080 pounds. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is .40 miles. \n\n\n4.  Accidental Release Program\n         \nThis Anhydrous ammonia facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\" as published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc. (ANSI K61.1), and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\".  \n\nThe Process Safe"

The implementation of PSM, Administrative Procedures, and Safe Work Practices represent the facility's main active elements of the accidental release prevention program.\n\n\n5.  Five Year Accident History\n\nIn the past five years there have been no accidental releases at this site. \n\n6.  Emergency Response Program\n\nThis facility has developed a written emergency contingency plan (Integrated Contingency Plan). The plan addresses the regulations concerning emergency plans as mandated under: OSHA 29 CFR - 1910.38, 1910.119, and 1910.120, EPA 40 CFR - part 264 subpart D, part 265 subpart D, part 68 and 279.52, DOT/RSPA-FRP - 49 CFR part 194. Elements within this plan include employee training, SARA Title III reporting requirements and community right to know, pre-emergency planning, and emergency response planning.\n\n7.  Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nSafety and Environmental programs are very dynamic, since this is an ongoing process, changes toward improvement are evaluated and implemented periodically. The need for improvement is identified by facility employee inputs, inspections and audits which are performed regularly at this facility."
