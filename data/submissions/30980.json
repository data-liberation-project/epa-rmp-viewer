Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at Rhodia, Inc. are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances; and ensure the safety of employees and neighbors.\n\n\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur Winder, Georgia facility's primary activity is the manufacture of surfactants and specialty chemicals.  These products are used in the manufacture a variety of consumer goods, including personal care products such as soaps, shampoos, detergents, and textile processing aids.  We also make polyester based polymers which are used for soil release in detergent applications and in textile processing..  We presently have 3 substances at our facility, which are regulated under the EPA RMP regulations.  These are Epichlorohydrin  [Oxirane, (chloromethyl)-], Methylamine  [Methanamine] and Dimethylamine  [Methanamine, N-methyl-].  Epichlorohydrin  [Oxirane, (chloromethyl)-] is used for production of Episulfonate Solution - an intermediate used to produce surfactants for Industrial and Personal Care Products.  Methylamine  [Methanamine] is used for Methyl Taurine - a surfactant for commercial cleaning applications.  Dimethylamine  [Methanamine, N-methyl-] is used for production of ASC Intermediate, which is used to produce an end product used in various Industrial and Personal Care Products.\n\nThe maximum inventory of Epichlorohydrin  [Oxirane, (chloromethyl)-] at our facility is 285,000 lb. Methylamine  [Methanamine] and Dimethylamine  [Methanamine, N-methyl-] are present on-site at our facility in maximum quantities of"

The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s)\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 3 toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from Episulfonate Solution process.  In this scenario, a full railcar of Epichlorohydrin  [Oxirane, (chloromethyl)-] is released.  Passive mitigation systems such as a berm are taken into account to determine release rates and quantities. \n\nThe alternative release scenario for Epichlorohydrin  [Oxirane, (chloromethyl)-] involves a release from a gasket leak in the Epichlorohydrin transfer line from the storage tank to the Episulfonate Solution manufacturing vessel.  The scenario involves the release of Epichlorohydrin liquid, which is assumed to be limited by an excess flow valve and our emergency safety shutdown system.  \n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 3 flammable substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from our MonoMethylAmine storage tank.  In this scenario Methylamine  [Methanamine] in a flammable aqueous solution is released.  It is assumed that the entire quantity of the storage tank is released, vaporized, and then finds an ignition source.  \n\nOne alternative release scenario submitted for Program 3 flammable substances involves a release from a hose break while unloading 40% Dimethylamine from a tank truck.  The scenario involves the release of Dimethylamine  [Methanamine, N-methyl-] in a flammable aqueous solution.  Active mitigation controls taken into account to calculate the scenario for this system is that the unloading is a fully attended operation - We estimate that the operator will stop unloading within two minutes.  \n\nAnother alternative release scenario submitted for Program 3 flammable substances involves a release from a hose break while unloading 40% Methylamine from a tank truck.
