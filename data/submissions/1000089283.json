All employees are informed of hazards in the workplace. Employees who work with potentially hazardous substances receive proper training in the handling of those substances. This facility has procedures in place to safely remove employees from areas in the unlikely event that a hazardous substance release were to occur, and to put in place emergency notification and response procedures.\n\n\n\n\n\n2.Facility and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nWoodworth Inc., based in Flint, MI heat treats metal parts. The regulated substance at this facility, anhydrous ammonia, is used in a system for heat treating.  In order to protect its employees, the public and the environment, Woodworth Inc., has an integrated safety management program to prevent ammonia releases and mitigate the consequences of a release, should one occur. \n\n\n\n\n\n3.Worst Case and Alternative Case Release Scenarios\n\n\n\nOff Site Consequence (OCA) data is available for review onsite at the Woodworth facility.\n\n\n\n\n\n4.General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Ammonia Specific Prevention\n\n\n\nWoodworth Inc., has an emergency plan that addresses the response necessary for a release of ammonia from the Ammonia system. Because of the pungent odor of ammonia, any leak is easily detected.  The system is designed so that major components can be isolated by closing selected valves. Further, system operators have been trained and are knowledgeable in the safe operation of the system.  In case of a release that could travel off the plant property, calls would be made to the Fire Department and the County Disaster Services Coordinator to assist in the response. Other state and federal notifications would be made as required.\n\n\n\n\n\n5.Five Year Accident History\n\nDuring the last five years, there have been no report-able releases of ammonia.\n\n\n\n\n\n6.Emergency Response Program\n\n\n\nThis faci"
