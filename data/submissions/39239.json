Currently, TNI has an ammonia plant in operation.  In the production of ammonia, TNI uses natural gas, air and water as feedstocks.  The feedstocks are heated to a point that they are broken down into introgen, hydrogen, and carbon dioxide.  This is in the gas state.  The carbon dioxide is then removed from the gas stream as a by-product, and only nitrogen and hydrogen remain in the gas stream.  The hydrogen and nitrogen is then bonded together to form ammonia (NH3).  The ammonia is then cooled to form a liquid at -28 degrees F.  The ammonia is sent to two 30,000 ton storage tanks and the urea plant.  The urea plant takes some of the ammonia and the carbon dioxide (by-product) from the ammonia plants.  The ammonia and carbon dioxide is then mixed to"

TNI's safety and environmental record reflects this commitment.  TNI receives safety and/or environmental awards on a yearly basis from regulators, insurance companies, and associations for their exemplary performance.  The following is a summary of the multiple layers of safety and environmental protection that TNI has in place at our plants to protect our employees and the community.\n\n*Managing risks is something we do on a daily basis.\n\n*We have worked for many years to reduce risks at our site and to be prepared for emergencies.\n\n*Our employees are highly skilled and well trained.\n\n*Our equipment is routinely inspected and tested to make sure it is safe.\n\n*We have computer monitors and controls throughout our plants to detect potential leaks or releases before they occur.\n\n*Hazard reviews are done for all changes.  They involve \"what if\" scenarios where employee teams investigate every possible scenario of a new project and resolve it as part of the design phase of the project.\n\n*Emergency response includes employee responders as well as off-site responders like LEPC, State Police and HAZMAT.\n\n*We work closely with the police and fire departments and we conduct routine drills.\n\n*In the event of an emergency, we are prepared to respond.\n\nTNI has not had any accidental releases, as defined by the Risk management Program regulations, for the last five years.

The ERP is designed as a guide to help in determining the magnitude of an incident, the steps needed to bring the incident under control and the requirements to ensure that all the federal, state, and local laws are complied with.  The ERP is a definitive plan that assigns responsibilities, defines several different methods of communication, assigns control centers and safe havens, designates evacuation procedures, and coordinates with outside assistance.  The plan has detailed action plans that specifically address incidents concerning chemical spills, fire, acts of nature, civil strife, area risks from outside the facility, personnel injury or fatality, and equipment failures.  The plan also designates the type and frequency of training that each person is required to have depending on their responsibilities.  Furthermore, the plan commits the management team to devote the necessary resources to prepare, implement and audit the ERP.\n\nAlthough TNI's ERP is specifically written for the TNI facility, the plan is also part of the parish wide emergency response plan organized with the local LEPC.  All these plans are reviewed with representatives of the LEPC, State Police, Sheriff's Department, Fire Departments, regulatory agencies and industry.\n\nTNI is striving on a daily basis to try and make the facility as safe as possible for the employees, contractors and the community.  TNI literally has safety and/or environmental training going on almost daily; every employee and contractor will attend several safety and/or environmental training meetings annually.  TNI and its employees have an enduring commitment to protecting health, safety and the environment, and our success is accomplished by research, innovation and the use of good common sense."
