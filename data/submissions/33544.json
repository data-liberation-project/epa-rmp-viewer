      "SummaryText": "The Farmers Coop Elevator (Norwich) is an agricultural retail business, which serves crop producers in the area.  This facility adheres to all local state and federal rules and regulations.\n\nIn the event of an emergency, the Kingman County Fire Department will be our first responder.  They are notified annually through our Tier Two submissions, as part of the Community-right to-Know regulations.\n\nThe Anhydrous Ammonia plant consists of 1- 18,000 gallon tank (78,642#).  The bulk of our business is selling fertilizer to our crop producers who raise wheat, milo and beans.  This facility may also have a maximum of 10 - 1,000 gallon nurse tanks capable of holding up to 43,690 pounds when filled at 85%.  Total storage capacity is 122,332 pounds. \n\nThe worst case and alternate case scenarios have been removed from the executive summary at the request of the EPA.  This is due to security concerns.  All necessary information will b forwarded to the local first responders and LEPC.\n\nOur employees are trained on a rotational 2-year basis where they attend a state sponsored anhydrous ammonia school.  The receive classroom training as well as a written test.  \n\nOur facility is maintained in accordance with the Kansas Department of Agriculture requirements.  We recognize that the KDA has not adopted the most recent ANSI standards.  When the state does adopt the newest version of the standard our company will budget any necessary time and funds to bring our facility into full compliance.   \n\nOur Emergency Action Plan is shared with the County Fire Department. By definition we do not have an Emergency Response Plan because we require all employees to evacuate the area and call 911 immediately in the event of an accident or release of NH3.\n\nThe Farmers Coop Elevator Company has not experienced an injury or a reportable release in the last five years.\n\nThere are no are no known repairs or upgrades needed or required at this time."
