In addition, operators and maintenance personnel who work with the ammonia system have been instructed on the proper use and maintenance of the equipment. Several of the employees have taken HAZWOPER training, which provides additional training on the proper use of ammonia.\n\nThe City of Hastings considers the delivery of ammonia at the site to be one of the highest risk activities.  Unloading is done by the ammonia vendor's qualified personnel.  As an additional safety measure, a trained person is stationed to observe the ammonia unloading and intervene, if necessary.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:\n\nThe City of Hastings is continually evaluating the hazards of operation of the anhydrous ammonia system. Cameras with higher resolution will be installed in 2023 to better view the ammonia system from the control room. An annual test of the valve responses to the emergency stop has been added to the preventative maintenance system.  An Operation Training Coordinator position has been added to the staff to look at policies and procedures and improve initial knowledge and comfort around systems including ammonia training, ammonia awareness, and ammonia process walk-through. The City of Hastings' employees will continue to review the operation, training, and maintenance of the ammonia system to look for ways to improve safety."

Operators perform visual inspections on the ammonia process equipment as part of their plant tour, which is required at least once per day.\n\n    - A thorough and detailed compliance audit was conducted in October, 2022, and a report developed of the audit findings. The findings were addressed by December, 2022. This was the fourth compliance audit conducted for the facility.\n\n    - There have been no incidents involving ammonia at Whelan Energy Center that resulted in, or could have resulted in, a catastrophic release. However, a core incident investigation team has been identified and procedures are in place to conduct an incident investigation, should an incident occur.\n\nAll of the elements of the City of Hastings' Program 2 Prevention Program have been developed with the intent of preventing the accidental release of anhydrous ammonia.\n\nFive-Year Accident History:\n\nThere have not been any accidents, as defined in 40 CFR 68.42, in the last five years.\n\nEmergency Response Program:\n\nThe City of Hastings' employees are not trained as first responders.  In the event of a significant release, site personnel will follow the emergency action plan which includes notification of the control room. The control room will contact emergency services by dialing 911, so that the appropriate fire and rescue, police, ambulance, and emergency management services can be dispatched, as warranted by the situation.\n\nThe City of Hastings works closely with local emergency personnel to ensure that responders are familiar with site access, the anhydrous ammonia process, its location, and the potential risks.\n\nAll site personnel have received initial a"

City of Hastings employees are not trained to respond to releases, but the employees work closely with the local emergency agencies to ensure that the agencies are prepared to respond to releases.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps:\n\nThe City of Hastings' Program 2 Prevention Program for the anhydrous ammonia system is a rigorous program which incorporates all of the required elements:\n\n    - Safety information is compiled, maintained on-site, and updated as necessary. \n\n    - A hazard review was conducted in December, 2022, using a What if methodology with significant input from employees .
