We observe all necessary safety precautions in handling anhydrous ammonia to prevent unnecassary human exposure, to reduce the threat to our own personal health and to reduce the threat to nearby community. It is our policy to adhere to all applicable  federal, state and local rules and regulations. Safety depends unpon the manner in which we handle anhydrous ammonia, the safey devices inherent to the design of this facility, the safe handling procedures that we use and the training of our personnel.\r\n\r\nThis facility complies with ANSI K-61.1 and OSHA 1910.111 requirements of anhydrous ammonia storage. If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to notify the local emergency response agency. \r\n\r\nA description of your facility and regulated sustances handled:\r\nThe primary purpose of this facility is storage. We receive anhydrous ammonia by transport truck and store it as a liquid in a pressurized vesssels. Access to the process is restricted to authorized employees and contractors. The maximum amount of anhydrous ammonia that can be stored at the facility is 24,000 gallons (water capacity).\r\n\r\nThe worst case and alternative release scenarios:\r\nThe worst-case release scenario is failure of one 12,000 gallon tank when filled to its maximum allowable capacity (85% @ 60F), resulting in a release of anhydrous ammonia. The distance to the endpoint of 0.14 mg/L is 2.6 miles based on RMP Comp. This distance extends beyond the facility boundary and there are esimated to be 516 residents, commercial/industrial areas and churches within the distance to endpoint.\r\n\r\nThe alternative release scenario is failure of a 12 foot length of 3 inch hose due to a cracked hose or failed fitting. The operator observe the leak and isolates the hose by cutting off the shut-off valves. The contents of the hose are released over"

These activites are undertaken by qualified personnel with expertise in process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval. Any findings related to the hazard anaysis are addressed in a timely manner.\r\n\r\nOperating Prodedures:\r\nWe  maintain written procedures for operation of the anhydrous ammonia storage facility. These procedures address various modes of operation including initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and starup after a turnaround. The information is readily accessible to operators.\r\n\r\nTraining:\r\nWe have a training program in place to ensure employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes. Refresher training is provided as required.\r\n\r\nCompliance Audits :\r\nWe conduct compliance audits on regular basis to comfirm that the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented. These audits are performed at least every three years and any corrective actions required as a result of the aduits are undertaken in"
