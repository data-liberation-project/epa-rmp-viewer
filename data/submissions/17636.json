All applicable procedures of 40 CFR 68.170 are addressed in the plan, which seeks\nto provide for employee safety, public health and response agency interaction.\n\nThe Riverside Water treatment Facility disinfects water pumped from the Ocmulgee River. \nChlorination processes include (liquid) chlorination cylinders, chlorination equipment, and\ninstrument room, electrical equipment, and process specific safety equipment. \n\nThe chlorination process accidental release modeling was performed for the respective area\nto determine potential consequences associated with operating failures resulting in\naccidental chlorine release.  The first worst case scenario, defined by EPA, states that\nthe owner or operator shall assume that the. . . maximum quantity in the largest vessel...is\nreleased as a gas over 10 minutes.  The alternative scenario is more likely to occur than\nthe worst-case release scenario.  The Riverside Water Treatment Facility has no incident\nhistory.\n\nIn each case, atmospheric dispersion modeling was performed to determine the distance\ntraveled by the chlorine released before its concentration decrease to a theoretical toxic\nendpoint.  This is defined by the American Industrial Hygiene Association as the\nmaximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals\ncould be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing life-threatening\nhealth effects.  The residential population within a perimeter corresponding to the toxic\nendpoint distance was defined to estimate the population potentially affected.\n\nThe worst case release scenario for the Riverside Water Treatment Facility involves a\nfailure of a one-ton c"
