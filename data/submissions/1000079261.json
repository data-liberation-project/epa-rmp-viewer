The plant has a Process Safety Management (PSM) system for the covered processes as defined by OSHA. The Chlorine, Sulfur Dioxide, and Anhydrous Ammonia Processes include the following PSM elements: process safety information; process hazard analysis; operating procedures; training; mechanical integrity; management of change; pre-startup safety review; compliance audits; incident investigations; employee participation; hot work permit; contractor management; emergency planning and response. The trade secret program element is not applicable for these processes. The plant also has a safety management system for the Ammonium Hydroxide process that includes the following elements: safety information; hazard review; operating procedures; training; maintenance; compliance audits; accident investigations; emergency planning and response. \n\nThroughout the plant, a hierarchy of controls has been implemented including hazard elimination, substitution, engineering controls, administrative controls and personal protective equipment to minimize or eliminate risks associated with the release of regulated substances.
