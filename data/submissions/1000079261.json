The markets for the Kingsbury plant include water treatment, wastewater treatment, industrial applications, agriculture, and food processing. Chlorine is packaged and distributed for the water treatment, wastewater treatment, and industrial markets. Sulfur dioxide is packaged and distributed for water treatment, wastewater treatment, agricultural and industrial markets. Anhydrous ammonia is packaged and distributed for agricultural, food processing and industrial markets. Ammonium hydroxide (aqua ammonia) is processed, packaged and distributed for the wastewater treatment and industrial markets. \r\nIn addition to EPA's RMP rule, the Kingsbury plant complies with OSHA's Process Safety Management, EPA's Hazardous Waste Generator, DHS Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standard and DOT's Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration regulatory requirements.   \r\nThere were four Worse Case toxic release scenarios and eight Alternate Case toxic release scenarios assessed for the Kingsbury plant. Section 2 of this RMP submittal contains additional details regarding each Worse Case release scenario while Section 3 contains additional details for each Alternate Case release scenario. \r\nThe four Worse Case toxic release scenarios are briefly described and include: (1) chlorine rail car releasing 180,000 lbs. with a distance to end point (rural) of 25 miles; (2) sulfur dioxide rail car releasing 1"

      "SummaryText": "s EPA submittal. Since wind direction cannot be anticipated for an accidental release, EPA mandated the circle estimation method. This method greatly overestimates the population potentially exposed to a release since the prominent wind direction and other factors are not considered.\r\nThe Kingsbury Plant components for the accidental release prevention program includes a commitment to process safety, an understanding of hazards and risk, management of risk and learning from experience as well as compliance with regulatory requirements.   The plant has a Process Safety Management (PSM) system for the covered processes as defined by OSHA. The Chlorine, Sulfur Dioxide, and Anhydrous Ammonia Processes include the following PSM elements: process safety information; process hazard analysis; operating procedures; training; mechanical integrity; management of change; pre-startup safety review; compliance audits; incident investigations; employee participation; hot work permit; contractor management; emergency planning and response. The trade secret program element is not applicable for these processes. The plant also has a safety management system for the Ammonium Hydroxide process that includes the following elements: safety information; hazard review; operating procedures; training; maintenance; compliance audits; accident investigations; emergency planning and response. \r\nThroughout the plant, a hierarchy of controls has been implemented including hazard elimination, substitution, engineering controls, administrative controls and personal protective equipment to minimize or eliminate risks associated with the release of regulated substances. Recently, the Kingsbury Plant decommissioned the Anhydrous Hydrogen Chloride Process. All process equipment has been removed and the plant no longer has any anhydrous hydrogen chloride on site. Further, the Methyl Chloride Process has been decommissioned, vessel has been inerted with nitrogen and approximately 2500 lbs. (25% of the T"

      "SummaryText": "hreshold Quantity) of methyl chloride is safely stored on site. The plant has installed automatic shutoff process controls in its Anhydrous Ammonia Process. Chlorine inventory controls and procedures are rigorously followed which has resulted in an inventory reduction of one-million-pounds since 2014. Improvements to the Ammonium Hydroxide Process include tank level sensors, revised operating procedure and operator training to tightly control the maximum inventory resulting in a significant reduction of aqua ammonia stored at the plant. Infrastructure security improvements at designated areas in the plant have been implemented that provide layers of protection against deliberate man-made incidents in accordance with applicable elements of U.S. Department of Homeland Security's CFATS Risk Based Performance Standards. The plant has a DHS-CFATS Alternate Security Plan that meets DHS requirements.   \r\nThere have not been any accidental releases of regulated substances from the Chlorine, Sulfur Dioxide, Anhydrous Ammonia or Aqua Ammonia (Ammonium Hydroxide) processes in the five years prior to the submission of this Risk Management Plan (RMP) for the Kingsbury Plant.   \r\nThe Kingsbury Plant has implemented an Integrated Contingency Plan (One Plan) based on the EPA's Chemical Emergency Preparedness and Prevention Office guidelines. The Integrated Contingency Plan (ICP) provides the framework for a comprehensive Emergency Response Plan while consolidating multiple emergency planning and response requirements. The ICP is organized into three main parts including Plan Introduction and Facility Information; Core Plan Elements; and Annexes. Incident/Release Notification is an ICP Core Plan Element that includes immediate notification to the La Porte County 911 Emergency Dispatch Center and immediate notification to the La County HAZMAT Director; followed by immediate notification to the National Response Center and regulatory agencies as applicable. These immediate local"

In-plant emergency response team training includes classroom instruction, hands-on demonstrations, and exercises with local first responders including La Porte County HAZMAT Team, La Porte County Sheriff's Department, and Porter County HAZMAT Team.\r\nFurthermore, plant personnel are actively involved in emergency planning with community emergency management and response stakeholders including participation on the La Porte County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) Board. A member of the plant management staff is co-chair of the La Porte County LEPC. Alexander Chemical is listed as a resource for both personnel and equipment for incidents involving chlorine, sulfur dioxide, anhydrous ammonia and ammonium hydroxide as part of the community emergency response plan. Joint exercises and training are conducted with local first responders including members of the La Porte County LEPC.\r\nAlexander Chemical has an extensive product safety stewardship outreach program for customers including four regional training sessions held annually that are attended by approximately 400 personnel. In addition, Alexander Chemical conducts product safety stewardship training sessions on customer sites. Designated plant personnel are on-call as part of the Chlorine Institute's CHLOREP Sector 9 Response Team.  \r\nA plant management team representative attends the Chlorine Institute's Annual to learn new safety-related developments and best practices involving the safe production, use and distribution of chlorine, sodium hydroxide and sodium hypochlorite.  \r\nCarus Corporation and the Alexander Chemical, Kingsbury Plant continues to operate with the highest standards of environment,"
