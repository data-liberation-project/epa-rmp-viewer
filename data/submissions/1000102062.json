In this way we promote overall plant, employee and public safety.\r\n\r\nThese programs help this facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of toxic substances as well as fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic events. Overall, these programs help prevent accidental fatalities, injuries and illnesses and avoid physical property damage. Our safety programs are applied to any activity involving hazardous chemicals including any use, storage, handling, or combination of these activities. This facility has one refrigeration system using Anhydrous Ammonia as the refrigerant. The amount of Anhydrous Ammonia contained in this system is above the EPA threshold reporting quantity required to comply with the RMP standards. \r\n\r\nThe stationary source and regulated substances handled\r\nThe regulated substance at this plant is anhydrous ammonia. Anhydrous ammonia is used as a refrigerant in the Engine Room and production areas of the facility. The refrigeration system contains more than 10,000 lbs of anhydrous ammonia.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe general accidental release prevention program and the specific prevention steps\r\nMichael Foods believes the best way to prevent an accidental release is by being proactive in its approach to safety. This facility maintains information about the proper use of its equipment and the possible hazards. By following set operating procedures and maintenance routines, the process equipment within the facility will be operated at optimum conditions. Additionally, the r"

Compliance with all applicable state codes and regulations ensures the continued safe operations of the Michael Foods facility. Also, the accidental prevention program is conducted in accordance with Process Safety Management (PSM) rules and regulations.\r\n\r\n\r\nFive-year accident history\r\nMichael Foods- Lenox facility has not experienced a significant accidental ammonia release.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe emergency response program\r\nA well planned emergency response program can make a tremendous difference in the potential off-site impacts of an accidental release. Swift, efficient actions can minimize the damage to both human population and the natural surroundings. To this end, Michael Foods has instructed employees on the proper actions to take in the event of an accidental release. Michael Foods maintains a well-trained emergency response team and has a written emergency response plan, which specifies the details of the actions that will be taken in the event of an accidental release.\r\n\r\nPlanned changes to improve safety\r\nMichael Foods is incorporating and addressing any recommendations resulting from the Process Hazard Analysis, Offsite Consequences, and program audits. The flexibility of the program allows Michael Foods to respond effectively to prevent or minimize any potential exposure to employees, the surrounding public, and/or the environment to a release of anhydrous ammonia. Specific actions taken to improve safety are the implementation of the Program 3 Prevention Program described above, improved operator training, administrative controls, and computerized system controls."
