This is not a new submission.  The origonal was submited in 2004, with revisions and updates in 2006 and 2008.  This facility has less that 10,000 lbs. on Anhydrous Ammonia on site (9400 lbs. total. They do have an active emergency action plan and follow as if they had 10,000 lbs.or more.  \n\n\n\n1.  ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES.\n\n\n\nAt this McLane Distribution Service, we utilize anhydrous ammonia that is considered hazardous by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).  The properties that make ammonia valuable as a refrigerant also necessitate certain safety precautions.  McLane strives to protect all its valuable resources and assets - both personnel and property.  We live and have families in this community.  We want to prevent exposure to all our personnel as well as nearby members of our community, existing natural resources, and the surrounding environment.  It is our policy to comply with all Federal, State, and Local regulations.  Through continual, accurate training and various safety devices and procedures, we work to minimize potential releases.\n\n\n\nOur emergency response program has specific procedures for accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia as well as other emergencies.  We work in conjunction with the Carneys Point Fire Department and the Salem County Local Emergency Management Committee (LEPC) to prepare for necessary notification of all affected neighbors.\n\n\n\n\n\n2.  THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED.\n\n\n\nThe primary purpose of our facility is the temporary storage of refrigerated and frozen foods.  We utilize anhydrous ammonia as the primary means for refrigeration and freezing.  An outside company is used to fill our main receiver tanks.  Piping then carries the ammonia to the needed refrigeration or freez"

Access to the site is restricted to facility employees, authorized management personnel and authorized contractors.\n\n\n\nThe regulated substance used at our facility is anhydrous ammonia.  The maximum amount of ammonia stored at this facility is 8,400 pounds.  We have the capacity for more but our policy is not to exceed IIAR recommendations.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n3.  THE WORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO(S) AND THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO(S), INCLUDING ADMINISTRATIVE CONTROLS AND MITIGATION MEASURES TO LIMIT THE DISTANCES FOR EACH REPORTED SCENARIO.\n\n\n\nWorst Case Scenario\n\nThe worst-case scenario would be failure of our largest tank/recirculator.  Our policy restricts the maximum capacity of this tank to 90% of capacity of the system.   The maximum quantity stored in this receiver is 9,400 pounds.  For the purposes of this worst case scenario, we assumed 10,000 pounds are stored on-site.  It is assumed that the entire contents are released as a two-phase flow (gas and aerosol-ALOHA).\n\nNote:  Section 3 of the RMP*Submit Plan indicates total of 8,400 pounds of ammonia.  This quantity was reported instead of 10,000 pounds due to errors generated by the RMP*Submit program.  Quantity Released (Section 3, Item 2.5) must be reported less than or equal to quantity of Process Chemical (Section 1.17 Item c.3).\n\nDistance to endpoint: 1.4 miles\n\n\n\n\n\nAlternative Scenario\n\nThe alternative scenario would be the release of ammonia due to the failure of a pressure relief valve. The emergency valves shutdown release would engage and stop the flow and sounds an alarm.  The monitoring system would alert personnel to manually shut the valve.  The maximum time of the release would be 60 minutes and maximum quantity released would be approximately 1,539 pounds of ammonia.  \n\nDistance to endpoint:  0.29 miles (or 517 yards)\n\n\n\n\n\n4.  FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY.\n\n\n\nThis is a newly constructed facility that opened in April of 2004.  To date, this McLane facility has not incurred a reportable rele"

Other entities or organizations that will be coordinated with include the Carneys Point Fire Department and the Salem County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n6.  THE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND THE SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS.\n\n\n\nThis McLane facility complies with all applicable Federal, State and Local regulations including the EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule.  Our personnel are trained about this during our Hazard Communications Training and through access to our Written Programs.  Our Refrigeration Maintenance operators receive a combination of classroom and On-The-Job training (OJT).  They are observed and are able to demonstrate proper job skills and knowledge.  Also, the ammonia system is operated, tested and maintained to the standard of International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration, the most stringent standards of the industry.\n\n\n\n\n\n7.  THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM.\n\n\n\nMcLane has onsite Hazardous Materials trained personnel to immediately respond to adverse conditions.  We have monthly meetings as well as annual certification.  This helps minimize the potential of an off-site release. \n\n\n\nWe work very closely with the Salem County Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and the Carneys Point Fire Department on emergency preparedness.  We meet periodically with representatives of each to address any changes in the facility or any new concerns.\n\n\n\n\n\n8.  PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY.\n\n\n\nCurrently, McLane trains and tests all refrigeration technicians.  Our preventative maintenance program is above standard and our total ammonia Process Safety Program is reviewed annually and updated periodically.
