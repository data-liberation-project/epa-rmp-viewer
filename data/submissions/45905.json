This plan outlines procedures for emergency ammonia release response, as well as general facility response.\nPLANNED SAFETY IMPROVEMENTS\nAdditional risk reduction measures may be implemented to further reduce the potential for an accidental release. These measures may include installation of upgraded piping and equipment supports, installation of equipment labeling, and implementation of program aimed specifically at the maintenance, training, and emergency response procedures for the ammonia based refrigeration equipment."

Operations may continue at a reduced level in the off-season.\nAnhydrous ammonia (NH3) is a gas in its natural state and is extremely irritating to mucous membranes and lung tissue. The gas is pungent and may be suffocating as shortness of breath and labored breathing can develop if inhaled. Prolonged inhalation of high concentrations may cause bronchitis and/ or pneumonia, with some residual reduction in pulmonary functions. Repeated or prolonged contact of high concentrations of ammonia to the skin can cause frostbite, redness, pain and serious skin burn. \n\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\nAn offsite consequence analysis for an ammonia release was performed to determine impacts to neighboring schools, businesses, residences, recreation areas, and historical and environmentally sensitive sites. \n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\nThe accidental release prevention program consists of maintenance, emergency response, and regular training.  A thorough review of the system including a \u00bfWhat If\u00bf Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) was performed for this facility. Equipment corrections and updates were made for those items determined to have the highest potential for off-site releases. Safety and equipment operational training will be conducted on a yearly basis and will include equipment operational procedures, emergency response procedures, review of general Risk Management Plan procedures, review of Business Response Plan procedures, and evacuation procedures. Refrigeration equipment will be reviewed as required and as new equipment is placed in operation onsite.\nAdministrative controls limit the amount of ammonia in the system. A diffusion tank is a system-wide mitigation measure added to the facility. Mitigation measures are not considered for every release scenario. \nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY"

      "SummaryText": "RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICY\nSalinas Valley Cooling utilizes inspection procedures to review refrigeration equipment prior to startup and during operations.  These procedures identify potential sources of release and equipment corrections required to prevent these releases.  Onsite personnel and certified refrigeration contractors review the equipment as required.\n\nOnsite personnel provide initial emergency response.  Onsite personnel will make a preliminary assessment in the event of a release and will provide first response.  First response may include emergency equipment shutdown, system isolation, or controlled operation such as pump down to prevent or reduce an off-site release. No emergency operations will be performed that are beyond the capabilities of the operators or other onsite personnel. Local fire and police departments with mutual aide response will provide emergency response for a major release event. The refrigeration contractor would also be on-call to provide emergency response.\n\nEmergency response training will be conducted yearly for current employees and as required for new employees.  Records will be kept of all training performed at the site for a minimum of five (5) years.\nDESCRIPTION OF SOURCE AND SUBSTANCE HANDLED\nSalinas Valley Cooling utilizes anhydrous ammonia in their precooling and cold storage operations.  Fresh produce is brought from the fields and cooled to remove field heat.  The produce is then stored in a cold storage warehouse. \nThe refrigeration equipment consists of portable and permanently installed equipment.  The refrigeration system configuration includes compressor skids, a tower-frame evaporative cooling condenser and high-pressure receiver, a trailer mounted condenser and high-pressure receiver.  An ammonia pump package, a Self Contained Automatic Transfer (SCAT) ice machine, two half-car vacuum tubes, one full car vacuum tube, one portable refrigeration highside trailer, cold room evaporators, and"
