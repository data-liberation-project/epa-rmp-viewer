      "SummaryText": "The Cow Island Plant is a natural gas condensate, amine treating and gas dehydration facility (\"Facility\") which utilizes more than the threshold quantity of a \"regulated flammable substance (10,000 pounds)\" in the processing of natural gas. Therefore, this Facility is subject to the Risk Management Plan (RMP) requirements codified in Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations Part 68 (40 CFR 68) administered by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).\n\nThe Cow Island Plant is also subject to Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (29 CFR 1910.119) and public receptors are located within the worst-case release scenario for the plant. Therefore, the Cow Island Plant is subject to Program 3 requirements as stated in 40 CFR 68.10. OSHA's PSM standard closely parallels requirements outlined in USEPA's RMP Rule. All elements required by USEPA's 40 CFR 68 - Program 3 Prevention Program are also required by OSHA's PSM.\n\nWithin the last five (5) years, the Cow Island Plant has not had an accidental release of a regulated substance where exposure to the substance, its reaction products, overpressure generated by an explosion involving the substance, or radiant heat generated by a fire involving the substance led to any off-site death, injury, or response or restoration activities for an exposure of an environmental receptor.\n\nThe Cow Island Plant employs one (1) full-time employee on-site who ensures the proper operation and maintenance of the Facility.\n\nEnLink Midstream Operating, L.P. (EnLink), formerly Crosstex Energy, last submitted a full RMP to the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) in May 2012 for the Cow Island Plant. The current RMP includes administrative updates associated with the change from Crosstex Energy to EnLink.\n\n\n\n"
