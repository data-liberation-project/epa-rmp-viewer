The Emergency Action Plan (Plan) is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of the PSM/RMP document which is maintained at the facility.  This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n  1.)  To save lives.\n  2.)  To minimize and avoid injuries.\n  3.)  To protect the environment.\n  4.)  To minimize property damage.\n\nBaker Commodities maintains a safety committee whose members are the designated emergency coordinators for the facility.  The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year.  This Plan was reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations, as well as to incorporate facility changes.\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nConstruction of the ammonia refrigeration system at Baker Commodities was completed in December 2001.  The facility is located at 4100 Bandini Boulevard, Vernon, California,  90023.  It is owned by Baker Commodities and is operated by Inland Cold Storage.  The system was constructed in accordance with all applicable federal, state, and local regulations including the 1997 Uniform Fire and Mechanical Codes.\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system uses 20,000 pounds of ammonia for storage freezers and dock operations.  The majority of the system is located in the machine room including vessels and compressors.  The condensers are mounted on the roof, and all of the evaporators are located in their respective cold areas.\n\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT SUMMARY\n\n*  Worst Case Release Result Summary\n\n      Scenario Description:  Release of the maximum quantity of ammonia that can be stored in a vessel - 2"

This release reaches off site and may impact population receptors.  No environmental receptors were affected by this potential release.\n\nNote: Item 2.5 is the total quantity released and item 2.6 is the mitigated release rate rounded to 1 significant digit.  \n\n*  Alternative Release Result Summary\n\n     Scenario Description: A release of ammonia from resulting from a 1/4 inch diameter hole in a pipe.  The release rate of ammonia due to the pressure of the tank is 128 pounds per minute.  The meteorological conditions used were 3.0 meters per second wind speed, and D stability.  The Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration reference tables were used to determine the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 200 ppm in urban conditions.  This release reaches off site and may impact other commercial/industrial neighbors.

Much of the safety of the system is inherent in the policies and procedures that govern the operation of the system.  For example, the Baker Commodities facility operates in accordance with Cal/OSHA's Process Safety Management regulation. \n\nThe Baker Commodities facility including the ammonia system was designed and constructed in accordance with the 1997 Uniform Mechanical Code which specifically outlines requiremen"

These safety features include a water diffusion tank, ammonia sensors in the machine room as well as sensors near the evaporators, and automatic shut down systems.  In addition, the majority of the ammonia is maintained inside the machine room and just outside of the machine room (condensers).  All pressure vessels are equipped with pressure relief valves that are commonly piped to the water diffusion tank.\n\nIn addition to the 1997 Uniform Mechanical Code, the facility will operate in accordance with the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) guidelines. \n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nBecause this is a new ammonia refrigeration system, there have been no accidental ammonia releases at the Baker Commodities facility within the last five years.  In addition, Inland Cold Storage, who will be operating the Baker facility, currently operates three other ammonia refrigerated warehouses and none have had an accidental release of ammonia in the last five years (December 1996 - December 2001).\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe Baker Commodities has an emergency action plan in effect at the facility.

Baker Commodities plans to coordinate emergency response efforts with the fire department on a periodic and ongoing basis.\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThe Process Hazard Analysis, Seismic Assessment, and Hazard Assessment (Off-Site Consequence Analysis) provided mitigation measures to improve safety at the Baker Commodities facility located at 4100 Bandini Avenue, Vernon, California. \n\nR01:   Obtain a hand held ammonia detector to determine ammonia concentration in engine room.\n\nR02:    Coordinate emergency response activities with the local emergency responders (i.e., fire department) on a periodic and ongoing basis to determine fire department requirements, and to communicate operator's abilities to the fire department. \n\nR03:    Either test water pH in diffusion tank periodically or install ammonia detector at the top of diffusion tank.  Include in Mechanical Integrity program.\n\nR04:    Do not store flammable materials such as pallets or extra oil drums in engine room.\n\nR05:   Implement a maintenance program to replace/reseat relief valves every five years (as per industry standard).  Automatically replace any relief valves that unseat.  Include in Mechanical Integrity program.\n\nR06:   Conduct annual visual inspections of vessels, paint and repair any signs of corrosion as necessary.  Include in Mechanical Integrity program.\n\nR07:    Reassess if system should require manual restart after power outage.\n\nR08:   Implement and document maintenance procedures per IIAR Bulletin 110 as well as establish a procedure to have operators complete a daily walkthrough of refrigeration equipment and daily log sheet.
