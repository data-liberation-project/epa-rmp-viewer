Experience shows that actions taken during an emergency are seldom effective unless planned in advance.  For example, a fire or other emergency could require the rapid evacuation of large numbers of employees from the facility. Plans to accomplish evacuation quickly, efficiently and safely plans are developed and provided to all employees.\n\nThe Emergency Response Program of the Denver Distribution Center has been developed and coordinated Aurora Fire Department Haz-Mat Team.  The employees receive PSM training in orientation and refresher held annually.  The Distribution Center conducts a minimum of one evacuation drill annually\n\nAny release that registers 200ppm will result in immediate notification to 911. The facility maintains a \"Telephone Tree\" which is used to notify the community in the event of an emergency. \n\nThe Aurora Fire Department (AFD) responds in case of an emergency provides advance Medical Life Support.  Practically all managers, superintendents, and supervisors are trained in basic first aid and CPR and can provide assistance to AFD when needed.\n\nThe anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system design in operation at this facility, remains state-of-the-art to this day.  The system operates at approximately 50 percent of capacity reducing the amount of pressure and anhydrous ammonia in the system at any given time.  All piping for the conveyance of anhydrous ammonia and refrigeration units is at ceiling level, approximately 20 feet above maximum forklift height.  \n\nAmmonia detectors throughout the facility provide an instantaneous alert should an ammonia leak occur in an isolated part of the facility.  Modifications to the system occur when innovations in refrigeration come on the market. "

      "SummaryText": " A Y2K compliant computer system performs monitoring and control of the entire refrigeration system.  Human monitoring of the computer system occurs routinely throughout the business day, 363 days a year.\n\nThe emergency response system is multi-tiered system involving the system operators, all other employees at the facility as well as the Aurora Fire Department Haz-Mat Team.  As far as emergency polices are concerned, those employees who are required to operate the system receive constant training to hone their skills while all other employees at the facility receive initial and annual training on emergency evacuation procedures.  \n\nWholesale grocery distribution is the sole function of this facility.  The only regulated substance in use at this facility is anhydrous ammonia.  Anhydrous ammonia provides refrigeration for fruit, vegetables, meat, and diary products.  The refrigeration system contains approximately 22,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWORST-CASE SCENARIO for this site is the complete and instantaneous release of 3,200 pounds of anhydrous ammonia if the high-pressure receiver were to rupture.  Based on the RMP*Comp v 1.06 this worst case scenario would result in a 0.8 mile toxic end-point release.  Since this site is sparsely populated, the release would effect approximately 1000 people.\n\nALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO for this site would be the failure of a high-pressure valve, which would result in approximately 1650 pounds released over a 10-minute period.  Using the RMP-Comp method of release, we could expect an end-point of approximately .2 miles, which is well within the confines of the site property\n\nThe Denver Distribution Center falls under OSHA's PSM rule.  The Denver Distribution Center's goal is the prevention of catastrophic releases and minimizing the consequences of such release.  Employee involvement, education, and training occurs on a regular basis to maintain employee The essential points of the prevention plan of this site inclu"

Supervalu is a member of the Local Emergency Planning Committee and attends meetings.  Supervalu also works with the Aurora Fire Department to access and train with our response team in emergency shut down of the system.  Supervalu is working with the Aurora Fire Department in scheduling practice drills with their haz-mat team.\n\nSupervalu reviews the SACHS Program on at least an annual basis.  When changes to the SACHS Program occur, the information changing is communicated to all employees within the facility through training. \n\nThe SUPERVALU Denver Distribution facility went on line in August 1982.  The heart of this facility's Accidental Release Prevention Program is based on the Supervalu Ammonia Hazard Control System, SAHACS, an ever-evolving system that provides continuos improvement in system design and emergency response policies.

The majority of threats received are via telephone calls.  Most will be hoaxes perpetrated by someone intent upon disrupting our operations.  Historically, most bombers provide adequate time to evacuate personnel.  A good rule of thumb to remember is that callers providing clear and specific information are more likely to be legitimate bombers.  Personnel receiving bomb threat calls are advised to follow these procedures:\n    1.    Keep the caller on the line for as long as possible.\n    2.    Ask specifically the location of the device and the time of detonation.  Additional questions regarding its physical appearance, how it will be activated, and - very importantly - why the bomb was planted.\n    3.    Listen to the caller's voice and note any special distinguished characteristics.\n    4.    Note background noises that may help in identifying the caller's location.\n    5.    Record the exact time of the call.\n\n    B.    Notify the"

Generally, the motive of most callers is to harass, intimidate and disrupt operations.  For example, it may be detrimental to employee safety.  Improperly executed evacuations may result in panic and injuries.  Finally, the bomb(s) may be planted in assembly areas and/or along evacuation routes if the bomber feels compelled to harm personnel.\n\n    1.    In most instances, the decision to evacuate should be made only when a suspect device is identified or if other evidence exists that suggests the threat is real.\n    2.    The evacuation decision should be reached jointly between the ranking person in the warehouse and the Loss Prevention Manager.  All decisions should be made on a case-by-case basis.\n\n    B.    Permission to re-enter the evacuated building will be given by the responding emergency agencies - not SUPERVALU personnel.\n\nIII.    Bomb Searches\n\n    A.    The following methods should be employed to conduct safe bomb searches.\n\n    1.    Only key personnel in a department or area should participate.  This may include bargaining unit personnel.\n    2.    Search areas should be divided into grid zones to ensure maximum efficiency. \n    3.    Upon entering areas, search teams should listen for any unusual sounds such as ticking, etc.\n\n    B.    Proper documentation should be recorded immediately after all incidents.\n\nFinally, management should keep hoaxes in a low-key manner without giving employees the perception that we are not sensitive to their safety needs.\n\n\n\nBOMB THREAT CHECK LIST\nTelephone Procedures\n\nDate _____-_____-_____    Time: _____:_____    Location: ______________________________\n\nCall Received by: ________________________        Transferred to: _________________________                                               \n\nCaller's Voice:\n(  )  Accent    (  )  Angry    (  )  Calm\n(    )  Clearing Throat    (    )  Cracking voice    (    )  Crying\n(    )  Deep    (    )  Deep breathing    (    )  Disguised\n(    )  Distinct    (    ) "

When emotions control actions small spills can become major disasters.\nThe size of the spill and the hazard level associated with it will dictate the immediate steps you take to control the spill.  These steps include;\n\nSTEP 1:  IDENTIFY\n\nBe sure you can identify the spilled substance and understand its potential hazards.  Look for the container labels, signs, placards and packaging labels.  (Refer to work area MSDS).\nIf you cannot identify the spilled substance, leave the area immediately!  Then go directly to step #5.\n\nSTEP 2:  SH"

      "SummaryText": "UT OFF THE SOURCE\n\nIf possible, without endangering your health, shut off the source of the spill.  This may involve closing a valve, uprighting a spilled drum or turning off a pump.  If required, use personal protective equipment such as gloves, goggles, respirators or splash protection.  Act quickly to minimize the spill, but remember, don't let your emotions control your actions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSTEP 3\"  SECURE THE AREA AND EVACUATE\n\nSecuring the area prevents anyone that might happen on to the scene from being exposed to the spilled hazard.  It also prevents possible sources of ignition, such as forklifts, from entering the area.  All workers not involved in controlling the spill should be cleared from the area to prevent potential exposure to the hazardous substance.\n\n**SPILL RESPONSE FOR AMMONIA, IN ACCORCANCE WITH THE DENVER DISTRIBUTION SAHCS PROGRAM, IS INCLUDED AT THE CONCLUSION OF THIS PROGRAM.\n\nSTEP 4:  ELIMINATE SOURCES OF IGNITION\n\nSome chemicals involving solvents or gasoline have extremely low flash points.  When a spill occurs, eliminate all sources of ignition.  Sources can vary from lift trucks, electrical contacts, automobile ignition systems to careless smoking.\n\nSTEP 5:  REPORT\n\nIt is important for your own protection that you report the spill as soon as possible to your supervisor.  Should you be alone or unable to contact a Supervisor, notify security at the post by dialing.  When reporting a spill, you should vie your name, location of the spill, identification and quantity of the spilled substance any other information you feel pertinent.  Remember to stay calm and speak slowly and as accurately as you can so a Response team can respond as quickly as possible to the correct location.\n\nSTEP 6:  SPILL RESPONSE TEAM\n\nThe Supervisor will notify the Spill Response Team to come and clean up the spill.  The materials used in the containment and clean up will be stored in a designated container to hold for proper disposal.\n\nNote:  The facilities manager or t"

They can run down slopes, off loading docks and into storm drainage systems.  Reduce the contaminated surface area by using absorbents to stop the flow of spilled substances.\n\nDrains, manhole covers and other devices and areas susceptible to spill runoff should be diked or covered with an absorbent.\n\nSpill kits containing petroleum absorbent materials, acid neutralizers are located in maintenance and the garage.\n\nIf the spilled substance is of the nature which released hazardous vapors, air vents, air conditioning systems and other air circulation systems should be closed off or shut down.\n\nSTEP 8:  CLEAN UP\n\nOnce the spill has been contained, it needs to be cleaned up.  Absorbents have proven to be the most effective means of cleaning a spill.\n\n\n\nDepending upon the substance spilled and its hazardous properties, special precautions may need to be taken during the cleanup process such as the use of anti-static absorbents, neutralization, personal protective equipment and clothing. And static resistant tools.  The contaminated material needs to be packaged so it will not leak or escape its disposal container.\n\nSTEP 9:  DECONTAMINATION\n\nAll reusable personal protective clothing, protective equipment, tools and contaminated surfaces must be disposed of or decontaminated immediately after cleanup has been completed.  Contaminated clothing or equipment should not be taken home because it could expose others to the hazardous material.\n\nContaminated surfaces should be rinsed with a neutralizing solution until the hazardous residue has been eliminated.  Contaminated equipment and tools should be scrubbed in a washing solution and rinsed thoroughly before being dried and stored for the next use.
