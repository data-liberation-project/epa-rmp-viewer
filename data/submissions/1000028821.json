      "SummaryText": "Enable Midstream Partners, LP (Enable Midstream) has a commitment to workers and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of facility processes. The Enable Midstream policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of substances.\r\n\r\nEnable Midstream operates the Anderson Plant located in Amite County, Mississippi.  The Anderson Plant is located in a remote area and is not normally occupied.  The Anderson Plant is a newly constructed refrigeration facility that recieves gas from two wells.  The liquids generated from the refrigeration process are temporarily stored in a 30,000 gallon bullet tank stored on site and are then trucked offsite.  Residue gas is flared onsite.\r\n\r\nA total rupture of the 30,000 gallon NGL tank resulting in a vapor cloud explosion would pose the worse-case scenario for the Anderson Plant. The 30,000 gallon tank has been evaluated for total tank rupture using the RMP*Comp offsite consequence analysis resulting in a distance to endpoint of 0.4 miles.  Because no public receptors are within a 0.4 mile radius of the NGL tank and the facility is not normally occupied, this RMP has been evaluated for a Program 1 Level RMP under 40 CFR 68. Since the facility is newly constructed, there is no accident history to report. If an emergency involving the NGL product tank occurs, the Enable Midstream policy is to notify the Amite County Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency."
