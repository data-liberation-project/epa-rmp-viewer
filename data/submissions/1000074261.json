Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response\n\n     Policies\n\n\n\nThe ARKEMA COATING RESINS (ACR) Alsip Plant is committed to operating and maintaining all of our processes in a safe and responsible manner.  We have implemented a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public, as well as to protect the environment.  These programs include both Arkema Coating Resins Responsible Care requirements and governmental requirements, such as the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) rule and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard.\n\n\n\n2. Description of the Facility and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nThe ARKEMA COATING RESINS (ACR) Alsip Plant is a manufacturing facility that produces synthetic latex polymer products, which are sold to customers that convert them into finished products such as latex paint, caulk and adhesives.  The RMP rule requires that if a facility, such as the Alsip Plant, has a specific amount (threshold) or more of any one of 140 toxic and flammable chemicals, the facility must follow the RMP rule requirements for that chemical.  The ACR Alsip Plant has the following RMP-regulated toxic substance at levels above threshold quantities: \n\n\n\nVinyl Acetate Monomer (Acetic acid ethenyl ester)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Alsip Plant does not utilize any chemicals on the RMP-regulated list of flammable substances.\n\n\n\n3. General Accidental Release Prevention Program \n\n\n\nOur general accident prevention program consists of compliance with the EPA RMP rule and OSHA's PSM standard.  Key elements include:\n\n\n\nEquipment Design:  Vessels (including shipping containers) and other process equipment are designed according to recognized industry standards and/or governmen"
