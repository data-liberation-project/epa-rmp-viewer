This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that encompasses design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training. Robust engineering controls are in place to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. The Fall River facility is a responding facility for releases of the RMP-listed chemicals, so the site utilizes an Emergency Response Plan.\n\nThe stationary source and regulated substances handled [40 CFR 68.155(b)]:\n\nThere are 2 production units that facilitate 3 listed chemicals \u0096 anhydrous ammonia, aqueous ammonia, and chlorine. The Aqueous Ammonia Production unit where Anhydrous Ammonia and Ammonia Solution (conc. > 19%) are used and the Bleach Production Plant, where bleach is manufactured from chlorine.\n\nThe Aqueous Ammonia Production Unit produces 29% Ammonium Hydroxide by mixing Anhydrous Ammonia with de-ionized water. This process also includes storage of ammonium hydroxide in tanker trucks while on-site while awaiting shipment off site or for us in the drumming operation.\n\nIn the drumming operation ammonium hydroxide manufactured in ammonia plant is drummed into containers for shipment offsite.\n\nBleach is manufactured by mixing chlorine and sodium hydroxide and water in a specialized reactor. After the bleach is manufactured, it is stored and shipped off-site in bulk quantities and/or is drummed for shipment. This process is shut down at the time of submission but may be used at a later time and thus submitted using predictive filing.\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps [40 CFR 68.155(c)]:\n\nBoremco has a program in place to comply with the provisions of the accidental release prevention regulations under 40 CFR Part 68.

The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of 5 years. Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nWritten Operating Procedures [40 CFR Part 68.69]\nTo ensure safe operations, Boremco maintains detailed written operating procedures. These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations and normal shutdown. The information is reviewed annually and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nEmployee Training [40 CFR Part 68.71]\nBoremco has a training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating plant processes are competent in the applicable operating procedures. Refresher training is provided at least every three years and more frequently as needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity [40 CFR Part 68.73]\nBoremco carries out documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations. Inspected process equipment include pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, pressure relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls, and pumps. Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices. Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.
