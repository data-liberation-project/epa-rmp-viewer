No accidental releases of sulfur dioxide have occurred at this facility since the HARWWTF started to use sulfur dioxide in March 1999.  Therefore, there have been no accidental releases of chlorine or sulfur dioxide within the 5-year review period stipulated for this RMP.\n\nThe facility has an emergency response program that has been reviewed and coordinated by the Adams County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania.  The operation and response procedures are reviewed and updated on an annual basis by the Adams County LEPC.  The Adams County Hazardous Materials (HAZMAT) team is the designated first responder in the event of a chlorine or sulfur dioxide leak incident.  The Adams County HAZMAT team is trained only at the Technician Level and, therefore, is not state certified; however, they can provide limited support for leak containment.  Under a mutual aid agreement between Adams County and York County, the York County HAZMAT team will provide additional support for a chlorine or sulfur dioxide leak.  The York County HAZMAT team is state certified and undergoes extensive training in dealing with a variety of hazardous material incidents, including chlorine and sulfur dioxide gas leaks. \n\nRecommendations to improve safety were made following the November 9, 2023 inspection of the chlorination and dechlorination facilities by the Borough's Consulting Engineer. These recommendations included third party training in the safe handling of the regulated substances, which should include annual notification exercises; conducting a compliance audit in between the fiv"

The maximum inventory for planning purposes is 12,000 pounds.\n\nTo improve the water quality of the effluent discharged to the receiving stream, the HARWWTF utilizes sulfur dioxide gas, another regulated substance, to de-chlorinate its effluent through a process called sulfonation.  The sulfonator is similar to the chlorinator and injects sulfur dioxide gas into wastewater to remove excess chlorine.  A maximum of four (4) one-ton containers may be on-site simultaneously; therefore, the maximum intended inventory for planning purposes is 8,000 pounds. \n\nAtmospheric dispersion modeling was performed using the RMP*Comp program distributed by the Chemical Emergency Preparedness and Prevention Office of the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA).  This model determines the distance traveled by chlorine and sulfur dioxide released until concentrations decrease to the toxic endpoint of 0.0087 milligrams per Liter (mg/L) and 0.0078 mg/L, respectively, as selected by USEPA.  Both toxic endpoint concentrations in air represent the American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA) Emergency Response Planning Guideline (ERPG)-2, defined as the maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to 1 hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects or symptoms which could impair an individual's ability to take protective action.  This amount corresponds to 3.0 parts per million by volume.   \n\nThe HARWWTF Accidental Release Prevention Program is based upon the following elements:\n1.\tRoutine training for the operators;\n2.\tPreventative maintenance program for equipment;\n3.\tUse of industry-standard process and safety equipment;\n4.\tUse of effective standard operating procedures, written with the participation of the operators;\n5.\tPerformance of a Hazard Review of the equipment and procedure"

      "SummaryText": "The Borough of Hanover owns and operates the Hanover Area Regional Wastewater Treatment Facility (HARWWTF). The plant service area includes Hanover Borough and a portion of Penn Township in York County, and a portion of McSherrystown Borough and Conewago Township in Adams County, Pennsylvania.  The HARWWTF, located at the end of O'Brien Lane in Conewago Township, is permitted for an Annual Average Flow of 5.6 million gallons per day of wastewater and discharges to the South Branch Conewago Creek and Plum Creek under National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System Permit No. PA0026875.  Wastewater treatment processes include grit and screenings removal, primary clarification, activated sludge treatment process, final clarification, denitrification filters, disinfection, and dechlorination.  Biosolids are stabilized in anaerobic digesters, dewatered, and utilized for agricultural purposes through land application.  The HARWWTF is operated 24 hours per day, 365 days per year.  The HARWWTF is manned from 7 am to 3 pm Monday through Friday and 6 am to 11 am on weekends and holidays.\n\nThe HARWWTF includes a disinfection system comprised of a gas chlorine container room, which contains two (2) one-ton containers of chlorine liquefied under pressure online simultaneously, a chlorinator, various safety equipment, and instrumentation consisting of flow recorders, electrical panels, and a gas detector/alarm unit.  Up to four (4) additional one-ton containers may be stored offline in the chlorine disinfection system building, for a total of six (6) one-ton chlorine containers in the building at one-time. The chlorinator system extracts chlorine gas from the online  containers through vacuum regulators and dissolves this gas in water to form a disinfection solution that is used to kill pathogenic bacteria and microorganisms in the treated wastewater effluent prior to its discharge into the receiving stream. Treatment plant operators regularly check the chlorinator room and its e"
