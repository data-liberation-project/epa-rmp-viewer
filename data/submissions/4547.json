The alternative release scenarios took active and passive mitigation systems into consideration, which significantly reduced off site impact.  \n\nWater Campus and Off-site Facilities Release Prevention Program\n\nThe City of Scottsdale has a number of plans, processes and procedures in-place to prevent or minimize the consequences of a hazardous chemical release.  In 1994 a process hazard analysis team was formed to develop a program to prevent or minimize the consequences of any release of highly hazardous chemicals.  \n\nProcess Safety Management Plan - In 1995 the PHA Team developed the city's Process Safety Management  (PSM) Plan to comply with OSHA 29 CFR 1910.119.  The program established minimum requirements for preventing or minimizing the consequences of any hazardous chemical release, provided guidelines for employee training.  The PSM plan is reviewed annually and updated if necessary.\n\nEmployee Education and Training - The City of Scottsdale recognizes that it is essential to provide on-going training to employees who work with highly hazardous chemicals.  The following is a listing of training provided:\n\n* Equipment and Process training\n* Joint emergency preparedness training - city staff routinely trains with Rural Metro Haz Mat Team on A, B & C, Kits, SCBA's and emergency response.\n* OSHA required training\n* 40 hour HAZWOPER training \n* On-going training at weekly tailgates and monthly safety meetings.\n\n\n\nActive and Passive Chemical Release Mitigation Systems - all city facilities with highly hazardous chemical quantities above OSHA and EPA threshold limits are equipped with scrubbers to effectively neutralize any major release.\n\nWater Campus Hazardous Materials Management Plan (HMMP) - was published in 1998 to present inventory and emergency response procedures for all chemicals used and stored at the facility.\n\nFire Department Emergency Response Plan - was developed through a joint effort by Rural Met"

The plan contains an emergency information sheet indicating agencies that may need to be contacted during an emergency.  The effectiveness of our emergency response program is evaluated through periodic unannounced emergency preparedness drills.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThe Water Campus Safety Team meets monthly to discuss plant safety issues.  Any safety recommendations developed by the safety team are implemented on a timely basis.  \n\nThe Process Hazard Analysis Team continues to meet annually to review the RMP/PSM plan in order to ensure that the programs continue to work effectively."

The Water Campus Hazardous Materials Management Plan (HMMP) provides specific procedures for receipt, inventory and storage of hazardous chemicals used at the facility.  The HMMP also contains specific emergency response procedures should an accidental release of chemical(s) occur.  \n\nThe Rural Metro Fire Department Response Plan provides procedures for how the fire department and plant operator personnel will interact during the initial phases of an emergency.  In addition, the Water Campus Risk Management Plan contains a four level emergency response procedure for managing accidental chemical releases.  \n\nFacilities and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe Water Campus occupies 140 acres on the west side of Pima Road bounded by Union Hills Drive on the south, WAPA utility easement on the southwest and Hualapai Drive on the northwest and north.  State of the art wastewater treatment and water reclamation facilities are used to produce high quality reclaimed water for irrigation.  Collectively, these facilities are called the Water Campus Reclamation Plant.\n\nChemical feed and storage is provided for ammonium hydroxide antiscalent, chlorine and sodium hydroxide.  Ammonium hydroxide is used to combine with chlorine to enhance disinfection.  Chlorine is used to disinfect WRP effluent, control bulking in the activated sludge process, control biological growth in the in the filter basins and provide product water chlorine residual for groundwater recharge.  Chlorine is delivered and stored in tanker trucks that are located in the Chlorination/Dechlorination facilities.  Chlorine is delivered in one ton cylinders at the CAP Plant.  Both facilities are equipped with scrubber systems to mitigate a release.\n\nSulfur"
