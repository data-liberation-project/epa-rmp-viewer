The tanks will probably be stored at this location from October 1 to December 15 and March 1 to May 30 of any given year depending upon the weather conditions.\n\n1. Facility Policy: The owners, management, and employees of the Bode Cooperative, LuVerne, Iowa (the\nfacility) are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia from nurse tanks. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department or other authorities to mitigate and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information: Anhydrous Ammonia may be stored in up to 20 nurse tanks of 1000 gallons each for retail sale to local farmers or to be custom applied. The maximum amount potentially to be stored would be 86,700 pounds. \n\n3. Worst Case and Alternate Case Release Scenarioes: a) The Worst Case Scenario would be the release of the total contents of the largest nurse tank. This would be 4300 pounds to a distance of 0.4 miles to the endpoint of dipersion of 200 parts per million (ppm). b) The Alternate Scenario would be a release from a transfer hose failure. This would be 4300 pounds of release to a distance of 0.2 miles to the endpoint of 2090 ppm.\n\n4. Accidental Release Prevention: The facility has been reviewed for general compliance with the provisions of the US Occupational and Safety Administration (OSHA) Standard 29 CFR 1910.111, \n\"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\". \n\n5. Five Year Accident History: There has been no accidental  releases of anhydrous ammonia from these tanks within the last five years. \n\n6. Emergency Response Program: The facility has a) written Emergency Action Plan (EAP) in accordance with OSHA Standard 29 CFR 1910.38 and b) provided state and local authorities with the emergency pla"
