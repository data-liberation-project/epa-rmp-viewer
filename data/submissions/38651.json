      "SummaryText": "Sherrill Manufacturing, Inc. is a manufacturer of stainless steel and silver plated flatware.  The main manufacturing facilities are located in Sherrill, New York and employ approximately 120 people.  Anhydrous ammonia, a regulated toxic substance, is used in the manufacturing activities.\n\nSherrill Manufacturing has shown a long-standing concern for protection of the environment and the health and safety of the surrounding community.  Sherrill Manufacturing maintains accidental release prevention and emergency release policies in the factory offices.   A current spill plan is maintained, and local hospital, police and fire departments possess a copy of that plan.  An annual chemical inventory that identifies locations of hazardous chemicals on-site, including anhydrous ammonia,  is provided to the New York State Emergency Response Commission, as well as the Local Emergency Response Commission and the Sherrill - Kenwood Fire Department.  \n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia within the past five years that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage.\n\nThe ammonia tank system has secondary containment and a water spray system to reduce ammonia vapors in the event of a leak and to contain the aqueous ammonia, or to cool the tank in the event of a fire in an adjacent building. \n\nThese mitigation systems reflect Sherrill Manufacturing's efforts to prevent any releases of hazardous chemicals, including anhydrous ammonia.  In the event of an accidental release, we are prepared to take all necessary steps to minimize the effect on both the local community and the environment.\n"
