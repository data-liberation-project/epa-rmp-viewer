      "SummaryText": "The Andersons Marathon Holdings LLC\nAlbion Ethanol RMP Executive Summary\n\nThe Andersons Marathon Holdings LLC is located at 26250 B Drive North in Albion, Michigan. The facility is located near the intersection of Michigan Ave. and B-Drive North in Sheridan Township, which is in Calhoun County.\n\nThe Andersons Marathon Holdings LLC facility operates 24 hours a day, 7 days a week with a staff of approximately 60 people. The following operations are performed at this facility: grain receiving and storage; hammer milling; fermentation; distillation, dehydration and evaporation (DDE); separation; wet and dry distillers grain and solubles (WDGS / DDGS) drying, storage and shipping; corn oil separation; and ethanol storage and shipping. A CO2 plant is co-located on the property on a parcel that is leased to a third-party business.\n\nThe plant receives corn by way of the pre-existing grain elevator or the secondary truck dump at the ethanol plant. Corn is stored temporarily in the concrete silos, prior to being fed to eight hammer mills where the corn is dry-milled into a powder and then conveyed to the production area. \n\nAdditives are incorporated into the process and the product is fermented, creating a beer mash. The product goes through a scrubbing process to removed residual volatile organics and then enters the distillation and condensation process. The beer is approximately 14% ethanol and 86% non-fermentable corn solids. The ethanol is separated from the beer at this stage and leaves as 190-proof ethanol, which is sent to a bulk storage tank. The 190-proof contains residual water, so it is filtered one more time, which produces 200-proof ethanol. Lastly, the 200-proof ethanol is mixed with a denaturant and stored in either of three tanks prior to transferring to the truck or rail load-out areas. \n\nThe distillation process separates the ethanol from the beer, non-fermentable corn solids and water. The remaining water is then removed from the residual mash or whole sti"

A small amount of WDGS will be maintained as \"wet cake\" - having a moisture content of 65 - 70% -- and sold directly to customers as high quality animal feed. Storage of wet cake is very limited, on the south side of the Energy Center. The majority of WDG will be dried to approximately 12% moisture. The resulting product is called dried distillers grain (DDG), which can be stored for extended periods of time in the large barn at the southeast corner of the property. After leaving the dryers, the DDG is cooled before going to storage.\n\nA recuperative thermal oxidizer (RTO) and thermal oxidizer (TO) serve as the primary emission control devices for the four dryers, cooling drum, and various process vents. The RTO and TO are very efficient at controlling particulates, carbon monoxide, VOC's, HAP's and nuisance odors. The facility also has two water cooling towers for non-contact cooling water used in the fermentation process and two fire pumps for emergency use.\n\nRMP Applicability & Chemical Description\n\nThe presence of four constituents in the natural gasoline used to denature the ethanol requires participation in the Risk Management Plan. Natural gasoline is used to denature the ethanol and a flammable mixture. There are multiple constituents of natural gasoline however, based on SDS analysis, four of those constituents butane, pentane, isobutane, and iso-pentane or 2-methylbutane. Butane makes up 15% of the natural gasoline, pentane makes up 20%, isobutane makes up 9.5%, and iso-pentane or 2-methylbutane makes up 23%.\n\nNatural gasoline is stored in a 169,200 gallon steel tank in the facility's tank farm. Secondary containment consisting of a diked structure containing an impermeable liner and gravel overlay surrounds the tank farm.\n\nWorst Case Release\n\nThe worst case release scenario would be a total loss of a full tank of natural gasoline resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.

Of the 930,600 pounds, 635,135 pounds are made up of the materials subject to the Risk Management Plan.\n\nAlternative Release\n\nThe most likely cause of a natural gasoline emergency is a release during a delivery due to a faulty hose or valve resulting in a vapor cloud explosion. Deliveries are made by truck or railcar and pumped into the storage tank. The alternative case scenario uses a railcar as it involves the largest quantity. Deliveries by railcar are typically 30,000 gallons or 165,000 pounds of which 111,375 pounds are made up of the materials subject to the Risk Management Plan.\n\nAll truck deliveries are made during business hours and are observed by the truck driver and facility personnel. If a release were to occur the truck delivery, attendants could stop the flow within minutes. The railcar unloading is attended by facility personnel at all times who would stop the flow from the pump and close the valve on the railcar in the event of a release. The truck load-out area has a catchment basin with underground piping to secondary containment. The railcar unloading area has a containment dike.\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nThere have been no denaturant-related accidents in the last five years.\n\nPrevention Program\n\nPreventive maintenance is an integral piece of this facility's hazard management program. All equipment including hoses, tanks, and valves are inspected at least monthly. A good PM program is our strongest defense against a release of denaturant. All hose replacements are documented. Records of all maintenance tasks performed on the tank or appendages are also on file.\n\nExplanation of How Natural Gasoline (Denaturant) Releases are Prevented\n\nPassive Mitigation\n\nThe natural gasoline storage and unloading areas are equipped with secondary containment.

Some of the fire hydrant(s) around the tank farm are equipped with water cannons to allow for fire suppression/control from a safe distance.  \n\nTraining\n\nAll employees receive annual training on flammable liquids, emergency action plan and spill procedures, and hazard communication.  Documentation and attendance rosters are on file at the facility.\n\nContractors\n\nContractors that are hired by The Andersons, Inc. go through a documented Prequalification process.  Records of this evaluation are kept on file.\n\nAll contractors also receive a \"contractor safety review\" prior to performing work at the facility.  During this review, they are informed of any potential hazards at the facility, emergency procedures, site-specific safety rules and the ability to request a SDS for any product at any time.\n\nSteps Taken to Address Hazards\n\nThe Andersons Marathon Holdings LLC has many systems in place for hazard assessment and mitigation.\n\nA Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) has been performed at this facility, as part of the Process Safety Management Program.  The analysis will be updated every five years, or as changes in the process are made.  PHA's are performed using the What-If/Checklist or Haz Op protocol and analyze all aspects involved in the production of ethanol.  The evaluation team includes representatives from the business EHS support, facility management and operations employees.\n\nStandard operating procedures have been established for all activities related to the natural gasoline storage and handling. These procedures are reviewed annually by employees and management to ensure they are current.  The procedures are available to the employees at the facility in hard copy and"
