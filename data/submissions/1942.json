The RMP covers the following facilities which are under common\ncontrol by SNF Holding Company (SNF):  Chemtall Incorporated, and NCF Manufacturing, Inc.\n\nAs part of complying with the Risk Management Program Rule, SNF has reviewed and enhanced\npreviously existing accidental release procedures and emergency response policies.  These\npolicies include:\n                    Emergency Response Program\n                    Emergency Action Plan\n                    Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasure Plan\n                    Process Safety Management Plan\n                    Hurricane and Tropical Storm Plan\n                    First Responder Team\n                    Hazard Communication Plan\n                    Hazardous Waste Management Plan\n                    StormWater Pollution Prevention Plan\n                    Safe Work Practices\n                    Hazmat/Hazwoper Team\n\nThere are four substances at the SNF facility that are regulated by the Chemical Accident\nPrevention Provisions defined at 40 CFR 68.  These substances are used in various processes\nthroughout the facility to produce water treatment polymers.  These substances and the specific\nprocesses covered include:\n\n     Toxic Substances:\n\n          Methyl chloride: This material is used in the chloromethylation (CM) plant at Chemtall. \n     The CM Plant uses methyl chloride as a reactant to produce quaternized monomers that\n     are subsequently used in other facility processes to produce water treatment chemicals. \n     The CM plant products are also sold to off-site customers.  The maximum quantity of\n     methyl chloride stored on-site is 210,000 pounds.\n\n          Ammonium hydroxide: Ammonium hydroxide is received and stored at the facility as a\n     30 percent aqueous solution.  Ammonium hydroxide is used in Chemtall's emulsion plant\n     pro"

The maximum amount\n     of 30 percent ammonium hydroxide stored on-site is 50,000 pounds (15,000 pounds pure\n     ammonia).\n\n          Formaldehyde: Formaldehyde is used as a reactant in Chemtall's Mannich process. \n     Formaldehyde is received and stored as a 50 percent solution in water.  The maximum\n     amount of 50 percent formaldehyde stored on-site is 96,000 pounds (48,000 pounds pure\n     formaldehyde).\n\n     Flammable Substances:\n\n          Dimethylamine: Dimethylamine (DMA) is also used in the Mannich process as a\n     reactant.  Dimethylamine is received and used as a 60 percent solution in water.  The\n     maximum amount of 60 percent dimethylamine stored on-site is approximately 200,000\n     pounds (120,000 pounds pure dimethylamine).\n\nAs required by the Risk Management Program Rule, worst-case and alternate (or realistic)\nrelease scenarios were evaluated and discussed in this RMP.  As required, worst-case scenarios\nare presented in the RMP for one toxic substance and one flammable substance.  Alternate\nscenarios were prepared for each of the toxic substances with worst-case endpoints located\noffsite (methyl chloride, formaldehyde, and ammonium hydroxide) and for one flammable\nsubstance to represent all flammable substances.  The endpoint represents the distance at which a\nreleased substance must travel before it disperses sufficiently to no longer pose a hazard to the\npublic.  \n\nFor the worst-case scenario, EPA has defined a worst-case release as the release of the largest\nquantity of a regulated substance from a vessel or process line failure that results in the greatest\ndistance to a specified endpoint.  For the worst-case analysis, the possible causes of the\nworst-case release or the probability that such a release might occur are not considered.  The\nrelease is simply assumed to take place by suddenly releasing the entire contents of the vessel. \nThe results of the worst-case scenario "

      "SummaryText": "analysis were as follows:\n\n          Toxics: The methyl chloride storage tank was assumed to fail and to instantaneously\n     release the entire tank contents.  No passive mitigation controls were considered in\n     limiting the release impacts.  The distance to the toxic endpoint was estimated to be less\n     than 1.06 miles.\n\n          Flammables: The DMA storage tank was assumed to fail and subsequently produce an\n     instantaneous release of the entire tank contents that results in a vapor cloud explosion. \n     No passive mitigation controls were considered in limiting the release impacts.  The\n     distance to the explosion endpoint was estimated to be less than 0.37 miles.\n\n\nAlternate release scenarios are more realistic scenarios that result in off-site endpoints.  For\nmethyl chloride, ammonium hydroxide, and formaldehyde, releases were assumed to occur as a\nresult of the uncoupling or rupture of a transfer hose during unloading operations for each\nsubstance.  For flammable materials, the alternate release scenario assumed that dimethylamine\nwas released as a result of the uncoupling or rupture of a hose during unloading operations.  The\nresults of the alternate release scenario analysis were as follows: \n\n          Ammonium hydroxide: In the alternate scenario, 6,600 pounds of ammonium hydroxide,\n     30 percent (2,000 pounds pure ammonia) were assumed to be released.  The release was\n     assumed to be mitigated because the transfer operation is monitored closely by personnel. \n     The release was assumed to occur over a 5-minute period.  The distance to the toxic\n     endpoint for this scenario was 0.31 miles.\n\n          Formaldehyde:  In the alternate scenario, 8,500 pounds of formaldehyde, 50 percent\n     (4,200 pounds pure formaldehyde) were assumed to be released.  The release was\n     assumed to be mitigated because the transfer operation is monitored closely by personnel. \n     The release was assumed to occur over a 5-minute period.  The distance"

The release was assumed to be mitigated because of leak\n     detector sniffers that detect leaks during the transfer operation and automatically shut-\n     down the transfer operation and alert personnel of the occurrence of leaks.  The release\n     was assumed to occur over a 2-minute time period.  The distance to the toxic endpoint for\n     this scenario was less than 0.37 miles.\n\n          Dimethylamine:  For the alternate scenario, 14,000 pounds of dimethylamine, 60 percent\n     (8,700 pounds pure dimethylamine) were assumed to be released and result in a vapor\n     cloud fire. The release was assumed to be mitigated because the transfer operation is\n     monitored closely by personnel and the system is equipped with automated shut-off\n     valves.

The accident was believed to have been\ncaused by excess iron in the methyl chloride which subsequently acted as a catalyst for\npolymerization of the product monomer.  As a result of this release, Chemtall has modified the\nprocess by installing a magnetic filter between the methyl chloride storage tank and the reactors\nand by increasing the relief vent line size. \n\nSNF is committed to continuous improvement of safety.  Planned changes and policies to\npromote this improvement include continuous review and update of the facility's ERP and\nvarious environmental, health, and safety polices, procedures, and practices.
