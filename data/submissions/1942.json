One release\nwas identified that involved off-site injuries related to the release of methyl chloride from\nChemtall's chloromethylation plant reactor.  Due to the unusually high pressure in the reactor,\nthe pressure relief valve on the reactor vessel opened releasing part of the reactor contents to a\ncontainment vessel.  However, due to the high pressure, the vessel manway gasket also blew out\nand released methyl c"

As a result of this release, Chemtall has modified the\nprocess by installing a magnetic filter between the methyl chloride storage tank and the reactors\nand by increasing the relief vent line size. \n\nSNF is committed to continuous improvement of safety.  Planned changes and policies to\npromote this improvement include continuous review and update of the facility's ERP and\nvarious environmental, health, and safety polices, procedures, and practices. These include all the\nprograms and plans listed above in the prevention programs as well as safety incentive programs\nto promote employee safety and community awareness programs."

The RMP covers the following facilities which are under common\ncontrol by SNF Holding Company (SNF):  Chemtall Incorporated, and NCF Manufacturing, Inc.\n\nAs part of complying with the Risk Management Program Rule, SNF has reviewed and enhanced\npreviously existing accidental release procedures and emergency response policies.  These\npolicies include:\n                    Emergency Response Program\n                    Emergency Action Plan\n                    Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasure Plan\n                    Process Safety Management Plan\n                    Hurricane and Tropical Storm Plan\n                    First Responder Team\n                    Hazard Communication Plan\n                    Hazardous Waste Management Plan\n                    StormWater Pollution Prevention Plan\n                    Safe Work Practices\n                    Hazmat/Hazwoper Team\n\nThere are four substances at the SNF facility that are regulated by the Chemical Accident\nPrevention Provisions defined at 40 CFR 68.  These substances are used in various processes\nthroughout the facility to produce water treatment polymers.  These substances and the specific\nprocesses covered include:\n\n     Toxic Substances:\n\n          Methyl chloride: This material is used in the chloromethylation (CM) plant at Chemtall. \n     The CM Plant uses methyl chloride as a reactant to produce quaternized monomers that\n     are subsequently used in other facility processes to produce water treatment chemicals. \n     The CM plant products are also sold to off-site customers.  The maximum quantity of\n     methyl chloride stored on-site is 210,000 pounds.\n\n          Ammonium hydroxide: Ammonium hydroxide is received and stored at the facility as a\n     30 percent aqueous solution.  Ammonium hydroxide is used in Chemtall's emulsion plant\n     pro"

The maximum amount\n     of 30 percent ammonium hydroxide stored on-site is 50,000 pounds (15,000 pounds pure\n     ammonia).\n\n          Formaldehyde: Formaldehyde is used as a reactant in Chemtall's Mannich process. \n     Formaldehyde is received and stored as a 50 percent solution in water.  The maximum\n     amount of 50 percent formaldehyde stored on-site is 96,000 pounds (48,000 pounds pure\n     formaldehyde).\n\n     Flammable Substances:\n\n          Dimethylamine: Dimethylamine (DMA) is also used in the Mannich process as a\n     reactant.  Dimethylamine is received and used as a 60 percent solution in water.  The\n     maximum amount of 60 percent dimethylamine stored on-site is approximately 200,000\n     pounds (120,000 pounds pure dimethylamine).\n\nAs required by the Risk Management Program Rule, worst-case and alternate (or realistic)\nrelease scenarios were evaluated and discussed in this RMP.  As required, worst-case scenarios\nare presented in the RMP for one toxic substance and one flammable substance.  Alternate\nscenarios were prepared for each of the toxic substances with worst-case endpoints located\noffsite (methyl chloride, formaldehyde, and ammonium hydroxide) and for one flammable\nsubstance to represent all flammable substances.  The endpoint represents the distance at which a\nreleased substance must travel before it disperses sufficiently to no longer pose a hazard to the\npublic.  \n\nFor the worst-case scenario, EPA has defined a worst-case release as the release of the largest\nquantity of a regulated substance from a vessel or process line failure that results in the greatest\ndistance to a specified endpoint.  For the worst-case analysis, the possible causes of the\nworst-case release or the probability that such a release might occur are not considered.  The\nrelease is simply assumed to take place by suddenly releasing the entire contents of the vessel. \nThe results of the worst-case scenario"
