Policy dictates that Rinchem personnel continuously identify methods to reduce the risk of handling hazardous materials and to reduce the risk to the community and environment through implementation of new technology and procedures. This commitment to safe and environmentally sound operations is documented in the Team Member Handbook, and the mission statement, which are available to all employees. The Safety and Health policy states: SAFETY FIRST is more than a slogan at Rinchem...it is a way of life.

We recognize that the responsibilities for safety and health are shared: Management, in particular the Director of Quality, ES&H, accepts the responsibility for leadership of the safety and health program, for its effectiveness and improvement, and for providing the safeguards required to ensure safe conditions. Managers and supervisors are responsible for ensuring processes are documented which reinforce safety as well as the use of engineering controls as the preferred method of promoting safety and eliminating unsafe conditions. Staff members are responsible for cooperation with all aspects of the safety and health program including compliance with all rules, documented procedures, and regulations and for continuously practicing safety while performing their duties.

Management continues to do all it can to protect the Health and Safety of all staff and to provide a safe working environment. However, safety requires the participation of everyone...only you can make safety a reality. Be alert for conditions which appear unsafe. Report unsafe conditions immediately. Report any accident, \"near miss\", exposure, incident, spill or release.\n\n1.2. A Description of the Dallas, TX  Facility and Regulated Substances Handled\nThe Dallas, TX  facility is located at 4143 Singleton Blvd. The facility provides transportation and public warehousing services for manufacturers, distributors and end users of prepackaged specialty chemicals. Warehousing activities include shipping, receiving and storage of chemicals as specified by customer requirements. The chemicals stored at the Dallas, TX  Warehouse include chemicals containing toxic flammable hazards. Arsine,  ammonia >20%, ethylenediamine, and titanium tetrachloride are the toxic RMP regulated substances handled and stored and tetramethylsilane is the only flammable RMP regulated substance handled and stored at the site.\n\nRinchem receives arsine,  ammonia >20%, ethylenediamine, titanium tetrachloride and  tetramethylsilane by truck as shipped from the manufacturer or distributor. It is unloaded from the truck using a forklift and staged for inspection. After the material passes quality and safety inspection, it is placed into the hazard specific storage area until it is shipped to the end user. The storage location of each material is tracked in an electronic inventory management system. After an order is received, Rinchem ships the above listed chemical as ordered by the end us"

The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps.  Rinchem management realizes that implementation of appropriate administrative and technological safeguards ensure the safety of the workers and the continued safety of public receptors. Those recommendations that are planned for implementation will be discussed in \"Planned Changes to Improve Safety\". The safeguards taken include both administrative and technological safeguards that prevent, detect, or mitigate releases of arsine, ammonia >20%, ethylenediamine,  titanium tetrachloride, and tetramethylsilane.\n\n1.4. The Five Year Accident History\nThere has never been a reportable accident involving Arsine, ammonia >20%, ethylenediamine, titanium tetrachloride, tetramethylsilane or any other chemical at the Rinchem Company LLC, Dallas, TX Warehouse.\n\n1.5. The Emergency Response Program\nOverall safety at the Rinchem Company, Inc, Dallas, TX  Warehouse is governed not only by our ability to prevent accidental releases of arsine, ammonia >20%, ethylenediamine, titanium tetrachloride, and tetramethylsilane from occurring, but also by the ability to mitigate any accidental releases of the above mentioned material. Rinchem has developed an emergency response program to minimize the effects of accidental releases of arsine, ammonia >20%, ethylenediamine, titanium tetrachloride, and tetramethylsilane to employees and a community notification process. Rinchem management has opted to respond to releases of these chemicals by containing the spill when it can be safely done and using contracted services for spill cleanup.

The Emergency Action Plan and documents are reviewed at least annually and revised as necessary to reflect changes that may occur to content and structure of the plan.\n\nNotification exercises:\nIn response to the requirements set forth in 40 CFR 68.96(a), Rinchem has developed procedures to conduct an exercise of the stationary source's emergency response notification mechanisms. As all Rinchem Company, LLC facilities are nonresponding stationary sources, Rinchem management and EHS recognize the importance of communication to emergency\nresponse organizations that hazards that are present at Rinchem facilities. Rinchem has, and will continue to send community outreach letters to emergency response organizations (LEPC, Fire and Police) and invite these organizations to tour our stationary sources and participate in accidental release drills.\n\n1.6 Planned Changes to Improve Safety\nThe facility evaluates, resolves, and implements employee suggestions and recommendations resulting from routine hazard reviews, audits, process hazard analyses, and incident\ninvestigations. Changes may be made to improve safety based on comments and information developed within our organization and the industry. Rinchem is always looking at ways to minimize risk through process improvement, upgrades to equipment used in the process, and review of operating procedures. Rinchem believes that no changes are necessary at this time to address improvement to safety at our facilities.  Rinchem's procedures, safety policies, facility design, and many other preventative measures are adequate to keep its employees, the community and the environment safe. Rinchem remains committed to continued improvments to our safe work and corrective action processes to ensure the safe performance of all operations."
