Given the quantity handled, anhydrous ammonia is considered a hazardous substance by EPA. Many of the properties that make ammonia valuable as a refrigerant also requires that precautions and procedures be in place to protect team member and public health and safety during a chemical emergency. It is the policy of BrucePac to be in compliance with applicable federal and state rules and regulations.\n\nSafety at BrucePac is inherent on the manner in which anhydrous ammonia is handled. While the design of the facility incorporates a multitude of safety devices, safe handling procedures combined with appropriate training of our personnel are key aspects to maintaining safety at our facility.\n\nWe have a written Process Safety Management (PSM) plan that complies with the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) PSM requirements in Title 29 of CFR 1910.119. A crucial component of this plan is the Emergency Response Plan, developed in compliance with the emergency response provisions of 29 CFR 1910.120. The Emergency Response Plan includes pre-emergency planning and coordinating with outside parties. This enables those who deal with emergencies to have a course of action to effectively deal with unplanned events.\n\n\n\nFacility Description and Substances Handled\n\n\n\nBrucePac is a manufacturing facility that produces, stores, and distributes meat products. Production requires the use of a refrigeration system to preserve the integrity of the processed foods. This refrigeration process uses ammonia as a refrigerant. Access to the facility is restricted to authorized team members, management personnel, and contractors. \n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nBrucePac complies with EPA's Accidental Release Preventio"

The design and construction of this facility was in accordance with published standards, tests or recommended methods of trade, industry or government organizations.\n\nBrucePac's written PSM plan incorporates policies and procedures to ensure safe operation and maintenance of this facility. Plan elements essential to safe operation of the refrigeration system include team member participation, process safety information, process hazard analysis, operating procedures, training, contractor safety, pre-startup safety review, mechanical integrity, management of change, hot-work permits, incident investigation, emergency response and planning, and compliance audits. This plan will be reviewed annually and updated as necessary by the BrucePac personnel.\n\nTraining is provided to ensure that each team member involved in operating a process has been trained in an overview of the process, the operating procedures, and safety considerations. Only qualified personnel operate and interact with the refrigeration system. This minimizes the chances of inadvertent error in operation that could lead to a release of ammonia. Startup, shutdown and any onstream adjustments are handled by these qualified persons. \n\n\n\nFive-year Accident History\n\n\n\nThere have been no reportable accidents at BrucePac in the past five years. \n\n\n\nEmergency Planning and Response\n\n\n\nBrucePac has a written Emergency Response Plan to ensure that precautions and procedures are in place to protect team member and public health and safety during a chemical emergency.

This plan will be reviewed periodically and updated as necessary by BrucePac.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nAny upgrades or extensive maintenance work performed in the future will be in compliance with those standards applicable at that time. \n\nBrucePac has completed a process hazard analysis to identify recommendations to reduce the risk of an accident. Higher priority items are scheduled to be completed before the end of 2016. Lower priority items will be addressed before the next scheduled analysis in 2021.\n\n"
