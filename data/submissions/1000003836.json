All three ammonia refrigeration systems are closed-loop processes which recirculate and reuse the same materials.  Infrequent makeup to the systems is only to replace material lost due to maintenance activities and small intermittent purging.   The systems consist of vessels, compressors, chillers, evaporators, condensers, safety relief systems, ammonia detectors and alarms.  All leaks are addressed and the system charges are maintained at intended levels.\n\n\n4.  Release Scenario Analysis\n\nRelease scenarios were analyzed using the EPA Model Risk Management Program and Plan for Ammonia Refrigeration (May 1996), the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) Risk Management Guidelines for Ammonia Refrigeration (1998) and the EPA Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration (November 1998).  A worst-case release scenario was defined to determine the potential emergency response procedures needed for the facility and community; however, it is important to emphasize that a worst-case release is extremely unlikely to occur because of the many safety features inherent in the design and operational systems for the plant.  On the other hand, the alternative release scenarios are based on credible assumptions.  The alternative scenario was selected from a number of possible scenarios from the Ammonia Model RMP and is representative of a pipe, valve or flange gasket leak or a pump seal leak.\n\n\n5.  Prevention Programs\n\nFor the New Albany Plant ammonia systems, Pillsbury/General Mills followed the ANSI/IIAR 2-1992 Standard for Equipment, Design, and Installation of Ammonia Mechanical Refrigeration Systems and implemented an RMP Program 3 Prevention Program which is equivalent to the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) program.  This is one of the most important ways for preventing ammonia releases and for minimizing the impacts of any release that does occur.  Some of"

The PSI includes data on the chemicals, the equipment design and the technology of the process.\n\nProcess Hazards Analysis (PHA) - An initial PHA was conducted to satisfy the PSM requirements in 1994 for the Rear Engine Room, and in 1997 for the Front Engine Room and the South Engine Room.  The hazard analyses of the ammonia processes are re-validated at least every 5-years.  Recommendations made by the most recent PHA team to improve the safety of the systems are being addressed to further reduce the risk of an accidental release or incident.\n\nOperating Procedures - An Operations and Maintenance Manual provides detailed written operating procedures for the ammonia systems and for safe work practices.  Safe work practices include the use of ammonia personal protective equipment, lockout/tagout procedures, confined space entry procedures, safe use of motorized vehicles around ammonia equipment, and access control to critical areas.  Operating procedures are reviewed and re-certified annually to make sure they are current.\n\nTraining - Training is provided to each ammonia system operator and maintenance person before they are certified to operate the system.  The company follows IIAR guidance for ammonia operator training and certification which includes initial and refresher training.\n\nMaintenance - All of the covered ammonia equipment is included in the New Albany preventive maintenance program.  Equipment inspections, testing and preventive maintenance activities are performed following a structured schedule according to IIAR Bulletin 109 and a company developed mechanical integrity program.\n\nManagement of Change (MOC) - An MOC procedure is followed for all changes made to the ammonia systems, including the safety systems, to ensure that the system safety and integrity are"

Checklists are used to direct the PSR process.  The checklists are used to ensure that all essential elements of the prevention program (i.e., engineered systems and documentation) were in place prior to startup of new or modified systems. \n\nCompliance Audits - An initial compliance audit was conducted in 1995 and at least every 3 years.  The most recent audit was completed in April 2007 and findings and recommendations for improvement are being addressed.  All findings from earlier audits have been addressed.\n\nIncident Investigation - General Mills routinely investigates any ammonia related incident or accident that occurs at the New Albany Plant.  An Incident Investigation procedure has been developed to help the investigation team determine the root cause of an incident and to help them develop measures to prevent recurrence. \n\nEmployee Participation - An employee participation program (for safety and risk management) is in place and training in PSM has been conducted for all affected employees.  Employee involvement in PHA studies and review of operating procedures is an important way in which employees take and retain ownership of the risk management programs. \n\nHot Work Permit Program - A hot work permit program is being used at the New Albany Plant whenever hot work is conducted in and around the ammonia systems. \n\nContractor Safety - Contractor safety procedures are in place and include reviews of contractor performance and the inclusion of safety performance and programs in selecting contractors for work on or adjacent to the ammonia processes.\n\n\n6. Five-Year Accident History\n\nThere has been no release of ammonia from the New Albany Plant in the last five years that meets the RMP reporting criteria. \n\n\n7.

This plan includes procedures for evacuations, notifying response agencies and adjacent businesses, emergency equipment list with maintenance schedule, and procedures for responding to any release that may occur.  The plan also includes first aid procedures for toxic exposures to ammonia.  The facility has an on-site trained hazardous material (hazmat) team for responding to ammonia releases, isolate, and minimize off-site consequences.  The ERP is coordinated with the New Albany Fire Department and the Floyd County Emergency Management Agency and consistent with the county hazmat response plan.   The facility conducts annual drills with community first responders.\n\nThe facility has conducted risk management plan communication meetings with employees and has notified immediate offsite receptors.  A public communications meeting was held on May 13, 1999 in cooperation with the New Albany Fire Department and the Floyd County Emergency Management Agency.\n\n8. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nAll recommendations from PHAs, MOCs, PSRs, mechanical integrity inspections, incident investigations, and compliance audits are addressed on an on-going basis.  It is also General Mills' policy to review operating, maintenance and emergency response procedures on a routine basis to ensure they are always applicable and effective.  This continuous review process generates further recommendations for improved safety during the course of operations and these measures are typically addressed in a very short time frame. \n\n9.

Summary\n\n[This facility was previously owned and operated by The Pillsbury Company and was acquired by General Mills, Inc. effective October 31, 2001.]\n\n\n1. Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies\n\nIt is General Mills' policy to comply with all of the requirements of the EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Program regulation as well as all other applicable Federal and State rules and regulations.  The New Albany Plant has developed an OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) Manual that documents safety and risk management policies pertaining to the prevention of accidental releases and emergency response preparedness.  In addition to the PSM Manual, the New Albany Plant has developed a Risk Management Program that includes the OSHA PSM elements, a description of the risk management system, an Offsite Consequence Analysis (OCA), and the five-year accident history. \n\n\n2. Stationary Source Activities\n\nThe New Albany Plant is located in Floyd County, Indiana.  The facility produces refrigerated dough products, such as biscuits, rolls, and cookies.  The dough is processed, kept chilled, packaged and stored in a refrigerated goods warehouse prior to shipment.  Ammonia is used to provide refrigeration for process cooling and for refrigerated finished goods storage.\n\n\n3.
