THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO WOULD HAVE AN 11,908 POUND RELEASE IN APPROXIMATELY 2 MINUTES WITH A DISTANCE TO ENDPOINT OF .83  MILES AFFECTING 100 AREA  RESIDENTS.\n\nOUR EMPLOYEES ARE TRAINED ANNUALLY AND RECEIVE SPECIFIC TRAINING IN SAFETY INFORMATION, HAZARDS, MAINTENANCE AND OPERATING PROCEDURES.  EMPLOYEES ALWAYS WEAR THE PROPER GLOVES AND GOGGLES DURING FILLING OPERATIONS.  CLEAN SAFETY WATER IS ALWAYS ON HAND DURING NURSE TANK FILLING OPERATIONS.\n\nWE ARE EXTREMELY PROUD TO REPORT THAT NO ACCIDENTAL AMMONIA RELEASES HAVE OCCURRED AT THIS FACILITY DURING THE LAST FIVE YEARS THAT HAVE CAUSED ANY HUMAN  INJURIES OR RESULTED IN PROPERTY DAMAGE.\n\nOUR EMERGENCY REPONSE PLAN HAS BEEN SHARE WITH THE COUNTY LEPC AND THE LOCAL FIRE DEPARTMENT.
