The facility is located on Highway 225 in Deer Park, Texas. Hexion sells resins & its precursors to other chemical companies that transform them into thousands of consumer products ranging from plastics and coatings to electronics and wind energy. About 150 full-time employees work at the site.\n\n\n\nINTRODUCTION AND POLICIES\n\nHexion is committed to the continuous improvement of chemical safety management. Hexion maintains Environmental, Health, and Safety (EHS) management systems to ensure the safe operation of its facilities is safe for our workers, the public, and environment. As part of this commitment, Hexion invests resources in various areas of accident prevention, such as:\n\n\n\n* Safety in process design;\n\n* Safe operating policies and procedures;\n\n* A comprehensive mechanical integrity program;\n\n* Management of process changes;\n\n* Training;\n\n* Incident investigation and auditing; and\n\n* Emergency response participation.\n\n\n\nHexion works closely with our Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and Community Advisory Council (CAC).  Hexion is also committed to the principles outlined under the American Chemical Council's Responsible Care program.  \n\n\n\nThis document provides an overview of the risk management activities at Hexion, including:\n\n\n\n* A description of the facility and substances regulated by the EPA RMP rule (68.155(b))   \n\n* An overview of the Prevention Program to prevent accidental chemical releases (68.155(a) & (c))\n\n* A five-year history of accidental releases of chemicals regulated by EPA's RMP rule (68.155(d))\n\n* An overview of the emergency response program (68.155(e))\n\n* Planned changes to improve safety.

The facility is classified as Program Level 3 under the RMP regulation since the site is also required to comply with Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) 1910.119 Process Safety Management regulations. The RMP regulated substances stored or processed at this facility include methyl mercaptan, epichlorohydrin and pentane.  \n\n\n\nACCIDENT PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nHexion's committed and engaged leaders and associates strive to create a safe environment for ourselves and the communities.  Part of our program involves identifying and taking steps to avoid potential accidental chemical releases. This is accomplished through Process Hazard Analyses and periodic review of policies and procedures. Additionally, the site has various safety features to detect, contain and control, and mitigate the consequences of a release that include:\n\n\n\n1. Release detection\n\n   Process alarms\n\n   Operator surveillance\n\n   Portable hydrocarbon monitoring equipment \n\n\n\n2. Release containment and control\n\n   Relief systems designed to prevent equipment over-pressurization (i.e. relief valves and flare)\n\n   Dikes to contain liquid releases\n\n   Automatic control valves to allow rapid isolation of the process\n\n\n\n3. Release Mitigation\n\n   Area firewater monitors\n\n   Mobile emergency response equipment\n\n   Trained emergency response personnel\n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere have been no incidents that require inclusion in the five-year accident history as there were no accidental releases from covered processes that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe overall emergency response program for the Hexion facility is coordinated with the Shell Deer Park Chemical Plant and Shell Deer Park Refining Company through a service agreement with "

Shell and Hexion maintain trained and fully equipped firefighting, HAZMAT, and medical/rescue teams capable of managing a broad range of emergency incidents. \n\n\n\nHexion also maintains 24 hour communications capability with relevant public agencies, as well as area emergency response organizations (i.e. local fire department, local pollution control agencies, federal agencies, etc.).  Hexion Environmental, Health and Safety personnel are trained to make required notifications to the public agencies as well as to the public via the CAER phone line and emails to the Deer Park Community Advisory Council in the event of a release.\n\n\n\nHexion (through Shell) maintains a written emergency response program designed to protect workers, public safety, and the environment. This program consists of policies and procedures for responding to releases, including actions to be taken in the event of a fire, explosion, or chemical release. These procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including first aid and medical treatment, evacuation, and personnel accountability plans. In addition, there are procedures that address maintenance, inspection, testing, and use of emergency response equipment. Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific response duties. \n\n\n\nThe emergency response program is updated as needed to address changes to Hexion processes. The Management of Change process is used to trigger updates to the emergency response plan, including notification and training of personnel affected by the change. \n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nHexion implemented a p"

Due to the toxic nature of methyl mercaptan, Hexion invested in facilities to import an alternate raw material that dissociates into methyl mercaptan and other components on an as needed basis.  This resulted in no on-site storage of methyl mercaptan.  The alternative release scenario represented in the current RMP is from the potential in process losses of the generated methyl mercaptan.\n\n\n\nDiligent compliance with our RMP Prevention Program forms the framework on which we will continue to improve the level of safety at the facility. Some of the key components of the safety improvements we expect to achieve are as follows:\n\n\n\n1.  The Management of Change provisions ensure that we consider the potential safety and health impacts of any change we make to process chemicals, technology, equipment or procedures.\n\n\n\n2.  The Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) provisions serve as a tool to ensure continual evaluation of potential hazards, thereby leading to continual improvements in our safety standards.  PHAs are revalidated at least every 5-years by a team of process operators and unit engineers.\n\n\n\n3.  Following a maintenance turnaround or change implementation, Pre-Start-Up Safety Reviews are conducted to ensure that the process is safe to operate, procedures are in place and affected personnel are adequately trained to operate or maintain the process.\n\n\n\n4.  The Mechanical Integrity provisions ensure that process equipment and instrumentation are designed, constructed, installed and maintained to minimize the risk of hazardous releases, thereby serving as an integral part of our safety program.\n\n\n\n5.
