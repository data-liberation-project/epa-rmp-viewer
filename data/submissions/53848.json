      "SummaryText": "Since 1988, the Hess Port Reading Refinery has implemented and continues to maintain and improve a Risk Management Program as outlined in the New Jersey Toxic Catastrophe Prevention Act (NJTCPA) . The refinery's Risk Management Program addresses the requirements of NJDEP, OSHA and EPA regulations, as well as internal company standards. Our policy is to protect the community and our workers from accidental releases of chemical substances by training and retaining skilled workers and implementing design,operational and and maintenance controls and procedures to prevent releases and mitigate any consequences should a release occur.Procedures have been adopted that govern how equipment and process designs, operations, inspections, maintenance, training, accident investigations and modifications are conducted. These procedures arew an integral part of the Risk Management Program and and of the refinery's routine operations. In the event of an accidental release of a hazardous substance, our personnel are trained to respond, contain the release and mitigate the consequences of the release.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF FACILITY\nThe refinery is located at 750 Cliff Road in Port Reading, New Jersey. The facility is located on approximately 210 acres in a mixed industrial/commercial area with the nearest residences to the west. The refinery and facility was refurbished and commissioned in 1985 based on State of the Art Technology available at that time. All subsequent modifications were designed with the best available technology consistent with our Risk Management Program. The facility is designed to catalytically crack heavy vacuum gas oil and residual oil using a fluid catalytic process to make gasoline blending components, fuel oils, liquefied petroleum gases fuel gas and sulfur. The facility does not process crude oil and has fewer types on units than a typical crude refinery. It has a minimum processing capacity of 70,000 Barrels per day of raw materials. \n\nGENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE "

      "SummaryText": "PREVENTION PROGRAM STEPS   \nThe Environmental, Health and Safety Department has the primary responsibility for the implementation of the Risk Management Program through the leadership of the Senior Risk Engineer and Process Safety Engineer.  Each department manager and supervisor has an active role in the implementation process.\n\nThe elements of the RMP are outlined below.\n\nEmployee Participation\nEmployees are encouraged to make suggestions to continuously improve the safety of our workplace. In addition, employees actively participate on the Plant Safety Committee and Process Hazard Analysis Teams. They also participate and make suggestions during  department meetings and project reviews.\n\nProcess Hazard Analyses \nThe HAZOP methodology is used to conduct process hazard analyses at the facility.  The PHA Program was revised in 2008 to include Inherently Safer Technologies as part of the analyses of each process. Processes are analyzed every five years or whenever a change occurs which results in a change to the process safety information.  All findings identified by the hazard analyses teams are resolved. \n\nOperating Procedures \nWritten operating procedures are maintained for all processes. The procedures address normal operations, emergency operations, start-up, shut down and emergency shut down procedures. These procedures are available and used by experience operators for reference and provide excellent materials for training new operators. The procedures are periodically revised for accuracy and updated to reflect current operating conditions and changes to process safety information. Potential upper and lower limit process deviations are addressed in the procedures, providing guidance to operating personnel on maintaining the safety of the process within the prescribed operating limits. \n\nTraining \nInitial process orientation safety training is provided to all personnel. For personnel involved in operating or maintaining a process, the training is on-going. Cla"

      "SummaryText": "ssroom and field training is provided for specific operating tasks. Personnel must demonstrate that they are capable of performing their assigned tasks and must periodically pass a written examination and demonstrate their understanding of process operations.\n\nContractors \nContractors are required to perform their tasks safely and understand that safe work practices must be followed. Contractors receive safety orientation consisting of the safe operating practices for the refinery, emergency procedures, the hazards of the substances at the facility, and a process overview. The entrance and exit of contractor personnel into the refinery is controlled. An assessment of the contractors safety program is conducted prior to beginning work at the refinery and periodically thereafter. \n\nManagement of Change \nAny process changes resulting in a change to the process safety information is assessed and reviewed prior to implementation.  The assessment assures that any changes in operating procedures, maintenance/inspection procedures, process safety information, and required training are established prior to implementing the change.\n\nPre-Startup Review   \nPrior to the implementation of any new or modified process, the changes identified as necessary by the management of change assessment are documented and implemented prior to start-up. \n\nMechanical Integrity \nThe facility has a computerized Maintenance Management System to facilitate scheduling and performing inspections on critical equipment. Internal and external inspections of process vessels , service of pressure safety devices and testing of safety controls and interlocks are performed on all pertinent equipment, when practical, and during planned turnarounds. Piping and remaining equipment is serviced regularly in accordance with industry practice and  manufacturers\" recommendations.\n\nSafe Work Practices \nWritten procedures secify the control for performing hot work in process areas.

A Tap Root Investigation is performed on incidents having a catastrophic potential.\n\nCompliance Audits \nInternal auduts are conducted to verify conformance with program requirements. Additional internal audits are conducted annually by external consultans to verify the effectiveness of the systems, programs and procedures relative to conformance with the TCPA.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nDuring the past five years, the facility did not experience any accidents resulting in on-site or off--site fatalities, serious injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, significant property damage or environmental damage. \n\nEMERGENCY PLANNING AND RESPONSE\nThe refinery's written emergency response plan is cooordinated with the Woodbridge Office of Emergency Management. In addition the facility works closely with the Woodbridge Fire Department to coordinate an effective emergency action plan. To provide immediate response to any emergency situation, the facility maintains a well trained emergency response team to respond to fires and releases. \n\n:"
