The OSHA PSM standards are not applicable to operations in Greenup, IL because it is a retail Facility.  At this Facility, Helena engages in the formulation, distribution and sale of chemicals (i.e. retail) to customers, most of who use Helena's products to support agricultural operations (See Section 3.0).  \r\n\r\nThis electronic submittal provides conservative estimates of the offsite consequences of an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia from the Greenup Facility located approximately 0.5 miles north of Greenup at 612 IL Route 130, Greenup, IL 62428.  The electronic RMP summarizes the policies and procedures implemented by the Greenup Facility to minimize the likelihood of an accident.  The electronic RMP also summarizes the actions that the Greenup Facility has taken to ensure that a response to a release (even though a release is unlikely) will be implemented in a proper and timely manner.\r\n\r\nPURPOSE FOR UPDATING RMP\r\n\r\nThe Facility is submitting this as an update to change the Emergency Contact and to remove nurse tanks from the chemical inventory.\r\n\r\nFACILITY\r\n\r\nThe Greenup Facility is a retail agricultural chemical facility and operates a single covered process: Anhydrous Ammonia Storage and Handling.  Anhydrous ammonia is transported to the Facility via a commercial tanker truck and then transferred to a 30,000-gallon or 18,000-gallon stationary pressure vessel.  The commercial tanker truck operator (Contractor) performs these transfer operations.  \r\n\r\nHelena stores the anhydrous ammonia in its pressure vessels and then transfers the anhydrous ammonia from the pressure vessels to nurse tanks at point of retail sale to the end user (e.g. the farmer).  The nurse tanks are stored and managed at a nearby Facility.  Helena pe"

      "SummaryText": "rforms this operation in accordance with its RMP Operating Procedures.  \r\n \r\nOFF-SITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nWorst case and alternative case consequence analyses were completed for the single covered process. The worst case scenario release assumed that all the contents in the largest single pressure vessel were released.  The release was modeled as if the pressure vessel was punctured on the side at the ground level. The resulting release of ammonia was modeled as a ground level horizontal jet.\r\n\r\nThe alternative (or more likely to occur) scenario assumes a rupture of a 2-inch transfer hose caused by an impact from a vehicle or some other source during a loading or unloading operation.  \r\n\r\nACCIDENT PREVENTION PROGRAM\r\n\r\nThe Warehouse Manager implements the risk management planning process at this Facility.  The Warehouse Manager is assisted by other Helena staff, as directed.  The Warehouse Manager is responsible for ensuring that Helena Staff are properly trained in the implementation of the Program 2 Accident Prevention Program elements: Management System, Safety Information, Hazard Analysis, Operating Procedures, Training, Maintenance, Incident Investigation, Compliance Audits, and Emergency Response.\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\r\n\r\nHelena's Greenup Facility is a non-responding facility. Helena has coordinated emergency response activities with its local emergency response agency and local fire department.\r\n\r\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nThere have been no on-site deaths, injuries, or significant property damage; or off-site deaths, injuries, property damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place, in the past five (5) years because of the ammonia operations at the Greenup Facility.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nThe Risk Management Plan implemented by the Greenup Facility complies with the requirements of the Clean Air Act, Section 112(r). The RMP will be updated as the Greenup Facility adds, deletes, or changes processes. The Emergency Response Program has been coordinated"
