This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of the facility.  L'Oreal's policy is to implement reasonable measures to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. Well-defined safety programs are applied to all activities involving hazardous chemicals including storage, handling, on-site movement of chemicals, or any combination of these activities listed.\r\n\r\nII. Description of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\r\n\r\nThe L'Oreal Facility located in Cranbury, New Jersey, is a warehouse used for the distribution of cosmetic products.  The facility currently receives and stores aerosol cans containing compressed gases and liquids.  The aerosol cans contain a flammable mixture.  The facility does not have any regulated toxic substances.  The L'Oreal Facility is an EPA RMP Program 1 Level facility and a NJ TCPA Program 3 Level facility.\r\n\r\nIII. General Accident Release Prevention Program & Chemical -Specific Prevention Steps\r\n\r\nThe L'Oreal Facility will continue to address the RMP release prevention program with the following elements. \r\n- Safety Information: The L'Oreal Facility keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to ensure safe operation of the process.  These documents address hazards of the aerosols at the facility, process technology, and process equipment.\r\n- Hazard Review:  Within this program, the process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\r\n- Operating Procedures: The L'Oreal Facility uses skilled personnel that have appropriate training to assure the work they are doing is completed correctly and in a manner that safeguards the property and safety o"

The Facility maintains the following safety equipment: spill kits, fire extinguishers, non-sparking fork truck forks, smoke and heat alarms, fire water sprinklers, separate aerosol storage room with fire door, and ventilation system.\r\n- Training: The L'Oreal Facility has an effective emergency response training program for all employees, which includes chemical spill response measures.  The facility also has a comprehensive fork truck driver training program to minimize driver error.   \r\n-Incident Investigation:  The L'Oreal Facility has an Incident Investigation procedure in place, in the event it will need to be used.  \r\n\r\nIV. Five-year Accident History\r\n\r\nThe L'Oreal Facility has an excellent record of accident prevention over the past five years. There have been no accidental releases of regulated substances in the past five years.\r\n\r\nV. Emergency Response Information\r\n\r\nThe L'Oreal Facility has developed and implemented written emergency response procedures to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment. The plan consists of elements such as: communication procedures for responding to a chemical spill; response to a fire, severe weather response, security emergency, or medical emergency.  The emergency response program is updated when necessary based on factors such as modification made to the site or change in the communication procedures.\r\n\r\nVI. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\r\n\r\nThe L'Oreal Facility will continue to improve employee training resources, safety information and conduct safety audits and incident investigations as applicable to continuously improve the worker and public safety."
