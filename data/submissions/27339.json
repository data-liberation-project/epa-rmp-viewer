Westover Dairy also complies with the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard for ammonia. If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to notify the Lynchburg City Fire Department and request that they respond.  \nStationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nWestover Dairy receives, stores and processes milk products. Many of the products must be stored at temperatures near or below freezing and, therefore, ammonia refrigeration systems are needed to cool and/or freeze different areas throughout the process. \n\nThe facility was inventoried to determine the amount of ammonia typically stored on-site, as well as the amount of ammonia that could be stored in each piece of process equipment. The total system ammonia charge is 10,200 pounds. The largest vessel present in the system is the high-pressure receiver.   This vessel is filled to 80% of its capacity by NFPA codes, therefore the maximum quantity of 6,125 lbs. which is the amount used in the worst case release calculations.\n\nWorst Case Release Scenario and the Alternate Release Scenario\n\nThe Worst-Case Release Scenario was determined to be the failure of the high-pressure receiver (6,125 lbs), when filled for storage. The high-pressure receiver is contained within a building. Using PhastProfessional computer modeling the distance to endpoint is a circle centered at the Compressor Room, with a 1.31 mile radius equivalent to the toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L.  \n\nFor the Alternative-Case Release Scenario, a rupturing of a 3/4 \" pipe was used.  The impact zone encompasses a circle with a radius of 0.20 miles. The alternative scenario extends to neig"
