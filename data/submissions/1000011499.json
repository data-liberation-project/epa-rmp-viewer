      "SummaryText": "procedures remain current.\n\nLake States has a training program to ensure that employees are knowledgeable in facility operations and to reduce the risk of accidents during normal operations and emergencies.\n\nWritten procedures have been developed to maintain the mechanical integrity of the process equipment.  This includes preventative maintenance and inspection procedures, the frequency of such procedures, inspection responsibility, and guidance documents for these procedures.\n\nLake States has procedures to ensure that changes are properly reviewed and that hazards introduced by the implementation of the change are identified and controlled prior to placing the change in operation. \n\nA pre-startup safety review procedure has been enacted to ensure that adequate safety measures are in place and are operational and that other aspects of the PSM/RMP program are updated and implemented as needed prior to placing the equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance audits are a critical component of the PSM/RMP program and will provide management with information on the success of the program and on areas that need improvement.  Audits are conducted every three years to ensure that the procedures and practices developed under the RMP standards are being followed.\n\nLake States has an incident investigation procedure for incidents involving the covered process.  The purpose of the RMP incident investigation requirement is to ensure that: 1) incidents involving regulated substances are investigated, 2) recommendations for preventing a recurrence are identified and implemented, and 3) appropriate personnel are briefed on the causes of each incident.\n\nLake States has an employee participation plan to ensure that employees who may be potentially affected by process operation have knowledge of and access to information relative to the process.  This plan is intended to outline the employees's participation and responsibilities within Lake States PSM/RMP program.\n\nLake States has a Contr"

      "SummaryText": "Lake States Yeast, LLC\nRhinelander, Wisconsin\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nLake States Yeast, LLC (Lake States), a subsidiary of Lallemand USA, operates a Torulla yeast manufacturing facility in Rhinelander, Wisconsin.  Following drying and packaging, the yeast is sold.\n\nIn 2009 Lake States was purchased by Lallemand USA from Wausau Paper Specialty Products, LLC (WP).  WP operates a manufacturing facility adjacent to Lake States, all processes in this RMP were previously covered by the RMP for Wausau Paper Specialty Products, LLC.\n\nProcesses conducted at Lake States require the use of two regulated toxic substances: anhydrous ammonia and aqueous ammonia, in amounts exceeding the respective threshold quantities.  Anhydrous ammonia is used to make aqueous ammonia which is used as a nutrient in the yeast production process.  The anhydrous ammonia process is a RMP Program 3 covered process.  The aqueous ammonia process is a RMP Program 2 covered process.\n\nRELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICY\n\nLake States is committed to managing and operating the facility in accordance with pertinent regulations and good operating practices to minimize the risk of an accidental release of a regulated substance from the yeast production process.  If an accidental release were to occur, Lake States has response measures in place to minimize the impact of the release.  The relief valves (2) were replaced on the anhydrous ammonia storage tank on October 7, 2009.\n\nRELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nIn November 2007, WP performed process hazard analyses for the two covered processes at Lake States in order to identify potential hazards.  WP installed several process controls such as sight gauges, relief valves, check valves, and response procedures in the event of a release.  These controls and procedures remain at Lake States.\n\nWP developed a set of operating procedures that are contained within the Process Safety Management/Risk Management Program (PSM/RMP)manual, now utilized by Lake States.  These"

      "SummaryText": "actor Safety Program to insure that contractors comply with PSM/RMP requirements and implement an effective industrial safety program for work at the Lake States facility.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere have been no accidental or CERCLA reportable releases of anhydrous ammonia or aqueous ammonia in the past five years.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nIn the event of an emergency, Lake States has an audible alarm system for notifying facility personnel.  In the event of the release of a toxic material, the Plant Manager of Lake States will immediately notify the Rhinelander Fire Department.  Lake States relies upon the Rhinelander Fire Department and EMS personnel to respond in the event of an emergency.  Lake States has a designated employee, trained in the use of a self contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) and other respiratory protection, who, in the event of an ammonia release, is charged with investigating the release source, and, if possible, halting the release.  Furthermore, Lake Sates is currently in the process of developing a written Emergency Response Plan.\n\nThe Lake States Plant Operations Manager, as well as the designated employee discussed above, will coordinate with emergency response personnel.\n\nCHANGES TO SAFETY\n\nThe PSM/RMP Manual documents the required program elements for the covered process.  Lake States has developed a set of operating procedures that are contained within the PSM/RMP program.  These operating procedures are reviewed on an annual basis to maintain current and accurate instructions.  Lake States has developed a training plan to ensure that employees are knowledgeable in facility operations and to reduce the risk of accidents both during normal operations and emergencies.  Up-to-date instructions and continued employee training procedures will aid in future facility safety."
