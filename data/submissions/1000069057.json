The flammable material is composed of a mixture of methane, ethane, propane, butane, isobutane, pentane, and isopentane.  For both the worse case and alternative scenario, the mixture was assumed to be composed entirely of the chemical that would cause the worst damage, i.e. highest heat of combustion or pooling factor.\n\n\n\nThe Red Hills Gas Processing Plant is an OSHA PSM facility and as such is subject to 29 CFR 1910.119.  In addition, the facility is subject to 29 CFR 1910.120 (HazWhoper), 29 CFR 1910.38 (EAP), 29 CFR 1910.146 (confined spaces), 29 CFR 1910.1200 (hazard communications), 29 CFR 1910.252 (hot work), and 29 CFR 1910.147 (lock out/tag out).  Specific practices that are important to the prevention program include a rigorous maintenance program, ongoing safety training, compliance audits, incident investigation, written operating procedures, and process hazard analysis.\n\n\n\nLucid Energy Delaware LLC (Lucid) has provided onsite tours of the facility to local fire and rescue departments.  Lucid has also provided such entities with a written emergency action plan.  Facility personnel are trained in several aspects of emergency response including the proper use of facility SCBA's, fire extinguishers, and H2S safety.  \n\n\n\nLucid is committed to the gathering and processing of natural gas. Our corporate objectives are to continually increase capacities while minimizing our costs, preventing significant impact to the environment, and protecting the health and safety of employees and the public.\n\n\n\nLucid is committed to complying with all existing and relevant safety and environmental laws and regulations.
