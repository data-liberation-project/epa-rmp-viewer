Many of our employees are members of Local Emergency Planning Committees.  Our facilities have written emergency preparedness plans that are updated regularly.  \n\nAshland facilities typically host open houses every 3 to 5 years as an opportunity for neighbors to learn about our commitment to safety.  Ashland makes an effort to support our communities through sponsorship of local activities and participation in many local organizations.\n\nA description of your facility and the regulated substances handled:  \n\nThis facility is a chemical distribution warehouse.  The regulated substances arrive at the warehouse loading dock, are transferred to storage, and subsequently loaded for shipment without ever opening the containers.  The regulated substance handled is trimethylchlorosilane.\n\nFor more information, visit our web site at www.ashdist.com or contact the Plant Manager.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario:\n\nThe USEPA RMP regulations require the worst-case release scenario to assume that the entire contents of the largest vessel of a regulated substance in a process are released.  Based on our analysis using USEPA-approved methods, the worst-case release scenario could potentially affect offsite industrial/commercial rec"
