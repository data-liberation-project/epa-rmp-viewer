The Facility Policy\n\nThe owners, management, and employees of Agronomy Services, LLP,  are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information\n\nThis facility is a retail farm supply center. We handle a variety of farm supplies, including pesticides and fertilizers. We are distributors of Anhydrous Ammonia, a product regulated by U.S. E.P.A. We receive Anhydrous Ammonia by truck (40,000 lbs.) and rail cars (160,000 lbs.), store on site in one 90,000 gallon tank (394,000 lbs.) and distribute to our farm customers in 35 individual nurse tanks(154,000 lbs.).\n\n3.The accident release prevention program\n\nThe facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc., the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia\" and the Office of Indiana State Chemists \"Indiana Ammonia Law\". \n\n4. The Five-year Accident History \n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility or to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite injuries, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n5. The emergency response program\n\nThis facility has a written emergency response plan, in accordance with OSHA standards 29 CFR 1910.38, and 29 CFR 1910.120. We have also provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).\n\n6. Planned changes to improve safety\n\nSa"
