Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nWe at the Dan River Inc. \u00bf Schoolfield Complex are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is best demonstrated by the fact that we have not experienced a release of chlorine in the past 25 years.  We have accomplished this by having a comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n2.  Stationary Source and the Regulated Substance Handled\n\nOur facility\u00bfs primary activities encompass textile yarn manufacturing, dyeing, finishing, screen printing and sewing of home fashions.  We have one (1) regulated substance present at our facility.  This substance is chlorine, which is used for water treatment.  Dan River Inc. - Schoolfield Complex has not experienced a release of chlorine in over 30 years.\n\nThe maximum inventory of chlorine at our facility is 16,000 pounds.\n\n3.  General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR Part 68 of the EPA.  This facility was designed and construction in accordance with NFPA-58 Standard, 1967 Edition.
