      "SummaryText": "ROHM AND HAAS CHEMICALS LLC - KNOXVILLE SITE\n\nEPA Risk Management Plan (RMP) Executive Summary\n\n\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n\n\nThe Rohm and Haas Chemicals LLC Knoxville site is a manufacturing facility located in Knoxville, Tennessee.  Rohm and Haas first came to Tennessee in 1943 as part of the national defense effort in World War II.  In a government-owned facility, the company began production of Plexiglas acrylic sheet for use in American military aircraft.  Following the war, Rohm and Haas purchased the Knoxville facility and expanded its production capabilities to include acrylic polymers.\n\n\n\nAlthough no longer a Plexiglas manufacturer, the Knoxville site employees approximately 200 personnel and produces over 150 different products which are sold to other manufacturers who use them as key components in consumer products such as paints, laundry detergents, and paper coatings.  \n\n\n\nThe site contributes to a variety of charitable organizations within the community and works closely with its Community Advisory Panel (CAP) to identify and address needs and community concerns.\n\n\n\nWe are pleased to provide information on our safety and emergency preparedness plans, as well as the systems and training at Rohm and Haas designed to prevent accidental releases.\n\n\n\nTHE EPA RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAM \n\n\n\nIn a series of rules promulgated between 1994 and 1998, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency established the Risk Management Program (RMP) under Clean Air Act Section 112(r).  The RMP contains a list of toxic and flammable chemicals.  Facilities that manage more than a threshold amount of a listed chemical may be subject to the RMP.  Covered facilities must assess the risks associated with their management of the listed chemicals and produce a plan to prevent releases and incidents.  In order to assist in emergency planning, covered facilities must evaluate \"worst case\" and \"alternative case\" scenarios that would result from the release of a listed chemical.  Finally, the covered fac"

This summary is part of the Rohm and Haas Chemicals LLC Knoxville site's communication effort.\n\n\n\nREGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n\n\nThe RMP regulated chemicals used by the site in the manufacture of acrylic polymers are Acrylonitrile and Aqueous Ammonia (~30% Ammonia Gas in Water).   Each chemical is listed as an RMP toxic chemical.  Acrylonitrile is a raw material that is chemically combined to form acrylic polymers.  Aqueous Ammonia is used as a neutralizer to adjust the pH of polymers.  \n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policy\n\n\n\nThe Rohm and Haas Chemicals LLC Knoxville site has a long standing commitment to providing a safe workplace and implementation of procedures and practices to prevent accidental releases.  This commitment is clearly stated in the site Environmental, Health, and Safety (EH&S) policy: \n\n\n\n?X    EH&S considerations are as important as production and operational concerns when decisions in these areas are required.\n\n\n\n?X    We will provide a secure workplace free of unacceptable risk to our employees, our community, and the environment.  \n\n\n\n?X    We are committed to compliance with all relevant EH&S regulations and standards, including the American Chemistry Council Responsible Care?Y Guiding Principles and Codes.\n\n\n\n?X    We will provide our employees with the necessary training, information, and equipment to work safely and in an environmentally acceptable manner.\n\n\n\n?X    Each employee will be responsible and accountable for working safely and protecting the environment.\n\n\n\n?X    We will have emergency response and contingency plans in place to address potential incidents.\n\n\n\n?X    We will provide opportunities for each employee to participate in the process of continually improving our EH&S performance.\n\n\n\n?X    We will provide programs to assist employees in maintaining good health.\n\n\n\n?X    We will manage our emissions, discharges, and wastes so as to minimize or eliminate harmfu"

The site complies with OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) rule, which is nearly identical to EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP) rule. Additionally, the site follows corporate and site-specific safety standards (which in some cases are more stringent than the OSHA general safety standards) while also complying with other applicable Federal, State, and Local regulations and standards.  The following items are part of our ongoing program to prevent releases and incidents for RMP chemicals as well as any other chemicals:  \n\n\n\n?X    Employee Participation:  Employees are involved in many activities to continuously improve site EH&S performance.   Participation includes, but is not limited to, audits, design and pre-startup safety reviews, process hazard analysis, training, procedure development, incident investigations, and various site teams.\n\n\n\n?X    Process Hazard Analysis:  Various process hazard analysis techniques are used to identify and analyze the potential hazards associated with chemicals and processes. Corrective action plans are developed and implemented as part of the analyses.  Updates occur at least every five years.  Safety systems are designed into the processes.  These are designed to create several layers of protection, such that, if one system fails, other systems will maintain the process in a safe state.  Examples of these engineering and administrative controls include, but are not limited to:\n\n\n\n-    "

The ERP has been designed to meet the requirements of all relevant regulations requiring emergency response plans, and is intended to prevent and mitigate the consequences of a hazardous material spill, protect the well-being of Rohm and Haas employees, the surrounding community, and the environment, and serve as a reference to responders in the event of an emergency.  Copies of the response plan have been provided to the local Police and Fire Departments, a local hospital, and the local and state Emergency Management Agencies.  \n\nA trained on-site incident commander (Emergency Response Leader) is assigned the responsibility of coordinating the site response to any incident which may occur, including communicating response needs with the local responders.  A trained incident commander is on duty 24 hours per day.  Evacuation drills are held at least annually.  Furthermore, the site holds \"table top\" exercises and other drills to discuss and drill on the proper response to potential emergency scenarios.  Alarm systems are also periodically tested.  All personnel are trained on the relevant aspects of the ERP.  \n\n\n\nWORST CASE AND ALTERNATIVE CASE RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\n\n\nThe RMP rule provides detailed requirements that define a worst case scenario, namely a release of the entire contents of the largest storage vessel occurring under very stable weather conditions and at a low wind speed.  EPA notes that the worst case scenario is designed principally to support a dialogue between the source and the community on release prevention, and not to serve as the sole or primary basis for emergency planning.  Based on previous site history, in addition to the several layers of protection in place, the worst case scenarios is highly unlikely to actually occur.\n\n\n\nThe site worst case scenario is documented and is based on the detailed requirements for worst case scenarios as prescribed"

Unlike worst case scenarios, the alternative release scenario can be limited by active mitigation and safeguards, such as alarms, automatic shutdowns, and operator interventions.  According to EPA, the alternative release scenario is a more useful communication tool for the public and first responders for emergency response preparedness and planning.\n\n\n\nThe site alternative case scenarios were chosen after review of the spill history, process hazard analyses, and discussions regarding potential scenarios with knowledgeable and experienced operating personnel.  The identified scenarios are more credible than the worst case scenario, but remain unlikely due to the design of equipment, implementation of prevention programs, and training of our personnel.\n\n\n\n \n\nCHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nIt is our belief that effective EH&S systems must be continually improved.  We constantly strive to recognize areas for improvement and implement the changes necessary to achieve our goals.
