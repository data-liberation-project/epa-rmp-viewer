      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\n\nThe Stop & Shop Supermarket Company will begin operations of a new Distribution Center in Freetown, Massachusetts.  The Freetown Distribution Center is one of three refrigerated facilities utilized by Stop & Shop for the storage and distribution of products to almost 200 stores.  Since many of these products must remain refrigerated, Stop & Shop operates a refrigeration system using anhydrous ammonia as the refrigerant.   Anhydrous ammonia is identified as a toxic gas in the EPA regulation \"Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Program\" or \"RMP\". \n\nRefrigeration systems that use anhydrous ammonia are an established and recognized technology and have been in use for decades.  EPA recognizes that ammonia refrigeration plants are very different from complex chemical processing operations.  The complex level of operations involved in chemical processing plants are not found in refrigerated facilities where there are no chemical reactions.  While there are new developments leading to more efficient operations, the design principles are fully available.  A complete understanding of the safe design and operating guidelines has been available to design and operating practitioners in the industry for some time.  As is common for most commercial systems, the Stop & Shop refrigeration system operates in a sequential mode based on the heat load.  The heat load is determined by the material being moved into the warehouse and by the outside air temperature.  As such, the process control parameters of greatest consequences are the temperature and pressure readings throughout the system.\n\nAs part of the RMP, Stop & Shop has conducted analyses of two ammonia release scenarios, the \"worst-case\" scenario and the \"alternative release\" scenario.  Following EPA guidance, the worst-case release was defined as the largest ammonia containing vessel, specifically the high pressure receiver with a maximum inventory of 32,000 pounds.  The worst-case rel"

      "SummaryText": "ease scenario further assumed that all the mechanical controls and all active safety systems failed to operate.  The area affected by the worst-case release was determined using the EPA's own Offsite Consequence Analysis dispersion model RMP*Comp.  Under the hypothetical scenario, ammonia vapor would travel past the boundary of the facility as it dispersed with air, reaching approximately two and six tenths miles from the point of release.  Although the probability of such a release is extremely remote, an estimated population of 13,153 could potentially be impacted by such a release.\n\nThe alternative release scenario is defined to be a more plausible case then the worst case scenario, and is useful as a planning case for the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and other emergency responders.  The approach for selecting the alternative release involved an examination of three sources: 1) the Process Hazards Analysis conducted on the system, 2) past release events at other Stop&Shop Distributions facilities and, 3) the industry-specific Model Risk Management Program and Plan for Ammonia Refrigeration guidance document, sponsored by the EPA.  The scenario selected for analysis was a 1/4-inch diameter opening resulting from external corrosion in the process piping.  These process lines are located on the roof to limit employee exposure in confined areas.  This selected example is consistent with those suggested in the EPA guidance document.  For such a release, the computer controls would detect the associated pressure drop in the process piping and would automatically shut the appropriate valve to isolate the leaking section.  The leak would continue for approximately 10 minutes until that section of piping had emptied its contents.  Incorporating the same dispersion model used in the worst-case release, the alternative release was determined to result in the ammonia vapor cloud reaching a distance of three tenths of a mile to one and six tenths of a mile from t"

However, since this is a new facility, no such records exist.  Many efforts have been made to reduce the potential risks associated with the refrigeration system.  Should a significant ammonia release occur, the facility's Emergency Response Plan would be activated.  The Emergency Response Plan has been developed to define what actions Stop & Shop employees are to take in the event of an ammonia release, and to identify those actions to be performed by the Fire Department and emergency response contractors.\n\nStop & Shop maintenance department employees act as primary responders only for those releases of less than 50 parts per million (ppm).  For releases exceeding this level, the Freetown Fire Department would be notified along with designated emergency response contractors.  The building would be evacuated and the maintenance department employees would provide secondary assistance to the responders, as needed.  The Freetown Fire Department would act as the incident commanders and will initiate any public notification, if deemed necessary.\n\nTo promote community awareness and emergency preparedness, Stop & Shop has participated in the LEPC meetings, and our Emergency Response Plan has been submitted to and reviewed by the LEPC, and is routinely updated.  In the event of a real emergency, we are all prepared to respond as a coordinated team.\n\nThe Stop & Shop Freetown Distribution Center is dedicated to maintaining a safe operation.
