There are no public receptors within the distance to the end point from the worst case scenario.  The acetylene process falls under the EPA RMP Level 3 requirements due to requirements of PSM.  An alternative release scenario was an uncontrolled release of acetylene.  The alternative release scenario did not affect a public receptor.  \nThe worst case scenario for Ammonia would affect an offsite receptor and falls under the EPA RMP Level 3 requirements.  The alternative release scenario would affect an offsite receptor. \nThe worst case scenario for Chlorine would affect an offsite receptor and falls under the EPA RMP Level 3 requirements.

The Airgas Emergency Response Organization (AERO) would also be dispatched from our Albany NY location.  All employees have access to and have been trained on the localized emergency action plan (Emergency Preparedness SMS section 14).  \nIn addition to these steps Airgas is always looking to improve safety practices by investigating all accidents, near misses and determining root causes and implementing changes as identified.  Additionally trending of accidents, incidents and near misses also provides our management team with tools to identify and improve our best safety practices.  During the Process analysis, which included a thorough review of process equipment and procedures, a number of action items were identified to improve the overall safety for this facility. Implementing each of these items will be an ongoing process.\n"
