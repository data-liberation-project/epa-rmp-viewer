BASF's objective is to minimize the risk of a release of anhydrous ammonia (ammonia) and, if a release occurs, to minimize the potential impact to BASF's employees, the public, and the environment. This objective will be accomplished by utilizing general good operating practices, providing appropriate training to all employees, complying with pertinent codes and regulations, and proactively planning and coordinating emergency response activities with BASF's local emergency response providers.\n\nBASF's management is committed to providing the resources necessary to implement this policy.\n\n2    Facility Description\n\nBASF manufactures petroleum catalysts, including fluid cracking and moving bed catalysts, for sale to oil refineries.  As part of this process, BASF uses ammonia for pH control in various applications in sufficient quantities to be subject to the requirements of 40 CFR Part 68, Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions. The Attapulgus Site has one 12,000-gal ammonia storage tank.  \n\n3    General Chemical Accident Prevention Program and Ammonia-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nBASF is governed by a set of OSHA and EPA (and corresponding Georgia) regulations that require a number of activities intended to prevent a release of hazardous materials, or if a release inadvertently occurs, to minimize the consequences of a release to the facility's employees, the public, and the environment. Some of these OSHA and EPA regulations include:\n\nA?    29 CFR Part 1910.120, 1910.38, 1910.165 "

Key concepts of this program include periodic Process Hazard Analyses (PHA), up-to-date operations and maintenance procedures and training, Management of Change and Pre-Startup Review processes, periodic compliance audits and incident investigations, and employee participation in site safety processes.\n\n3.1    Process Hazard Analyses\n\nA multi-departmental team of BASF employees recently conducted an ammonia system Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) in June 2009 using current Process Safety Information.  The PHA was designed to proactively identify and address any system weaknesses in order to prevent accidental ammonia releases.  Items identified were documented and appropriate work orders submitted.  Procedures are in place to maintain this PHA consistent with the current ammonia process and to update and revalidate it at least every five years.\n\n3.2    Procedures and Training\n\nIt is the Attapulgus Site's policy to ensure that its employees are provided clear instructions for safely conduct"

Employees operating the ammonia system receive various forms of training in these SOPs and safe work practices to ensure that they have the knowledge, skills, and abilities to safely carry out their duties.\n\nIt is also the site's policy to inspect, test, and maintain its process equipment in a manner consistent with applicable manufacturer's recommendations and recognized good engineering practices.  Accordingly, BASF has ammonia-related maintenance procedures addressing preventative maintenance and repairs, hot work permits, etc designed to prevent accidental ammonia releases.  Maintenance mechanics and technicians receive appropriate training in these procedures to ensure that they have the knowledge, skills, and abilities to safely carry out their duties.  In addition, the Attapulgus Site works with its maintenance contractors to ensure that they are familiar with and meet or exceed all site safety standards and practices.\n\n3.3    Management of Change and Pre-Startup Review Processes\n\nBASF management recognizes that processes and equipment constantly change.  To ensure that these changes are managed and implemented safely, BASF has Management of Change and Pre-Startup Review processes in place to ensure that safety and health considerations and procedural and training requirements are addressed in conjunction with any change being implemented.\n\n3.4    Compliance Audits and Incident Investigations\n\nBASF conducts routine audits of its ammonia accident prevention program to ensure the program's effectiveness and continuous improvement.  However, should an ammonia release occur, BASF has an Incident Investigation process designed to quickly identify root causes and appropriate actions to prevent future releases.  These investigations are reviewed regularly for trends, etc as a means of further managing the safety of BASF's ma"

An ongoing objective in support of this goal is to include all employees in all facets of safety.  Participation in site safety efforts is therefore expected and rewarded.  Employees participate in various safety processes such as Workplace Inspections, Behavioral Safety Observations, Job Safety Analyses, Root Cause Analyses, Process Hazard Analysis, etc.\n\n4    Five Year Accident History\n\nBASF has had no releases of ammonia that have affected onsite personnel, the public, or the environment in the past five years.\n\n5    Emergency Response Program\n\nBASF does have an onsite emergency response capability to respond to an ammonia-related emergency. Therefore, BASF trained personnel will serve as first responders  and will contact offsite emergency responders, Decatur County Emergency Management Agency and Decatur County Fire Department, for assistance in the event of an ammonia-related emergency. \n\nIn the event of a non-emergency ammonia release, BASF employees trained in the safe operation of the ammonia system will close automatic and manual shutoff valves to terminate the flow of ammonia.  \n\n6    Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nBASF has made the following improvements to the safety of its ammonia system, \n\nA?    Installed a deluge suppression system with leak detection\nA?    Installed hydrostatic vents between block valves\n\n"
