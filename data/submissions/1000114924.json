(Rinchem) is committed to being a responsible member of the community in which it operates by giving top priority to operating in a safe and environmentally sound manner. Rinchem Company LLC. manages the safety of the regulated processes as identified in Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) with engineering controls, administrative controls and industry best practices. Policy dictates that Rinchem personnel continuously identify methods to reduce the risk of handling hazardous materials and to reduce the risk to the community and environment through implementation of new technology and procedures. This commitment to safe and environmentally sound operations is documented in the Team Member Handbook, and the mission statement, which are available to all employees.\nThe Safety and Health policy states: SAFETY FIRST is more than a slogan at Rinchem...it is a way of life.

Staff members are responsible for stopping activities that may lead to injuries to themselves or others. Staff members, being the most familiar with actual operations, are responsible to document suggestions for continual\nimprovements. Each employee is granted the authority to stop work if it is deemed unsafe. The job will not be continued until the work methods are evaluated and changed, if necessary, to make the work area safe.

The facility provides transportation and warehousing services for manufacturers, distributors and end users of pre-packaged specialty chemicals. Warehousing activities include shipping, receiving and storage of chemicals as specified by customer requirements. The regulated substances are delivered to this facility in portable, DOT approved, shipping and storage containers.

After inspection, the order is loaded on to a truck for shipment using a forklift or dolly for delivery to the end user. Due to the growth of the computer chip manufacturing in the area, the chemicals stored at the Phoenix, AZ gas pad to support this growth is anticipated to increase.  \n\n1.3  \tThe general accidental release prevention program and specific prevention steps:\nThe facility developed prevention program elements based on the Federal EPA Accidental Release Prevention Plan along with the OSHA PSM rule.  This facility was designed and constructed to comply with applicable state and industry codes.\n\nChemical specific prevention steps begin with the decision that all regulated substances would be on-site for storage only.  Products are segregated by compatible hazards to minimize any potential reactions should an accident occur. Rinchem management realizes that implementation of appropriate administrative and technological safeguards to prevent, detect, or mitigate releases of arsine and anhydrous hydrogen chloride ensures the safety of the workers and general public and protects the environment. \n\n1.4  \tFive-year accident history:\nThere have been no accidents involving or accidental releases of any of the covered chemicals that resulted in any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n1.5  \tThe emergency response program:\nOverall safety at the Rinchem Company, LLC, Phoenix, AZ gas pad is governed not only by our ability to prevent accidental releases of the RMP regulated arsine or anhydrous hydrogen chloride from occurring, but also by the ability to mitigate any accidental releases of a"

Rinchem management has opted to respond to releases of\nthese chemicals by mitigating migration of a spill when it can be safely done and using contracted services for spill cleanup. The Phoenix gas pad Emergency Action Program consists of a Business Continuity Plan and facility-specific Emergency Action Plan. The Emergency Action Program outlines the instructions and required information in order to respond to fire,\nchemical spills, natural disasters and other emergencies that may arise. The Emergency Action Plan is reviewed at least annually and revised as necessary to reflect changes or updates to the plan.\nNotification Exercises:\nIn response to the requirements set forth in 40 CFR 68.96(a), Rinchem has developed procedures to conduct an exercise of the stationary source's emergency response notification mechanisms. As all Rinchem Company, LLC facilities are nonresponding stationary sources, Rinchem management and EHS recognize the importance of communication to emergency\nresponse organizations that hazards that are present at Rinchem facilities. Rinchem has, and will continue to send community outreach letters to emergency response organizations (LEPC, Fire and Police) and invite these organizations to tour our stationary sources and participate in accidental release drills.\n \n1.6  \tPlanned changes to improve safety:\nThe facility resolves recommendations from PHAs, RMP/PSM and internal safety compliance audits, and incident investigations, some of which may result in modifications to the facility design and operating procedures."
