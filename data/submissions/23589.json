We operate under the policy for Safety, Health & Environment (SHE) of our parent company - Hercules Incorporated.  Our SHE policy states: \n\nOur Commitment to \"Zero Harm\"\n\nAs full participants in Responsible Care?, Hercules is committed to the pursuit of zero harm to our employees and customers...zero incidents...and zero damage to the environment.\n\nAt all Hercules locations worldwide, we work to:\n\n? Provide a safe and healthful environment for employees, customers, and communities.\n\n? Comply with laws, regulations, and corporate guidelines that apply to safety, health, the environment, and product quality.\n\n? Drive continuous improvement by using management systems to meet goals and measure performance.\n\n? Foster positive reinforcement to improve and reward employee behavior, systems, and performance.\n\n? Invest in products and processes to maximize safety, health and environmental values, and to minimize adverse consequences.\n\nBy these actions, we ensure our contribution to the growth of Hercules? shareholder value.\nProtecting People, the Workplace, and the Environment\n\n\n\nFacility Description and The Regulated Substances Handled\n\nBetzDearborn Inc., manufactures specialty water-treatment chemicals that are primarily used for the treatment of water and wastewater in industrial process systems such as boilers, refineries and cooling towers.  Most of our products are water based made by blending several raw materials within a mixing vessel and then packaging into various size containers.  Depending on our customers' need, our package types can range from small 5-gallon pails to 6000 gallon truckload quantities.  Similarly, the raw materials we receive from suppliers come in various size containers depending on customer demand for the product and the amount necessary to"

The balance of the property consists of access roads, open lawn and idle areas.\n\nAt the facility, Ethylenediamine (EDA) is a liquid chemical stored on site in 55-gallon drums.  It is used as a raw material in our manufacturing process to make products that are used by the oil industry.  Our products which contain EDA help prevent the release of hydrogen sulfide to the environment when they are added to the manufacturing process in the oil industry.  This material is stored in a protected area and removed from any combustion sources.  We also store Allyl Alcohol, Epichlorohydrin, Formalin, Propylene Oxide and Dimethyamine onsite in tanks.  Each of these products have unique properties used by our customers to help treat their waste or process waters.  Propylene oxide is used as a component of a polymerization inhibitor product used by the chemical industry. The use of such inhibitors help the chemical industry save energy and reduce waste and fouling in the equipment.  Epichlorohydrin (EPI) and Dimethylamine (DMA) are \"building block\" chemicals we use to make some of our other products.  Products made with EPI are used in the paper industry to help equipment function efficiently.  The benefit is the waste reduction.  Products made with DMA are used to clean water in water treatment facilities.  Allyl alcohol is used to manufacture dispersants used to reduce fouling in boilers and heat exchange equipment. The benefits are reduced energy consumption and increased equipment life.  Formalin is a raw material used in the production of flocculants used to clarify water.\n\nThe Worst-Case Release Scenario(s) And The Alternative Release Scenario(s)\n\nAt the facility, Epichlorohydrin, Propylene Oxide and Dimethylamine are delivered "

Our \"Worst Case\" event involves a scenario where a tanker of Allyl Alcohol is lost as an instantaneous release to an uncontained pavement outdoors during material delivery.  Using  the RMP*Comp modeling program data, the scenario that would have an offsite consequence.  We did not consider any passive controls although these materials are normally stored in protected containment areas when not in transit.  We also conservatively viewed that a whole tanker or railcar (as applicable) of any of these materials would be released without any intervention by plant personnel to stop the release or to control the spread of the release.\n\nWithin the Ethylenediamine drum storage process, our \"Worst Case\" event involves a scenario where the contents of several drums are lost as an instantaneous release to an uncontained pavement outdoors during material transfer.  Using the U.S. EPA Offsite Consequence Guidance modeling data, this scenario would have an offsite consequence.  Although this material is normally stored in a protected containment area when not in transit, for the purposes of meeting the EPA requirements we did not consider any \"passive\" controls.  We also conservatively viewed that an amount of several drums would be released without any intervention by plant personnel to stop the release or to control the spread of the release, even though our facility personnel are capable of responding to mitigate a release of this chemical in various ways.  Because all plant operators are well trained in hazardous chemical handling procedures, forklift operation, and spill response, we think that a release event of this sort is unlikely to occur.\n\n\n\"Alternative Scenarios\" for Allyl Alcohol, Epichlorohydrin, Formalin and Propylene Oxide, events more likely to occur than the \"Worst Case\" considered release events of where a spill occurs during unloading but the release is terminated b"

We chose to evaluate this scenario because the EPA required an \"Alternate Scenario\" that extended beyond the fenceline. \n\nAlso as an \"Alternative Scenario\", an event more likely to occur than the \"Worst Case\" involving Ethylenediamine, we considered a release event of a single drum, again using the EPA methodology.  Mitigation systems were not included in this scenario.  The analysis indicates that this scenario would have an offsite consequence but no public receptors would be involved.  We chose to evaluate this scenario because the EPA required an \"Alternate Scenario\" that extended beyond the fenceline, although we feel an event involving a minor drum puncture of substantially less than a drum quantity would be more likely and would have no offsite consequences.\n\nAs an \"Alternative Scenario\" for Dimethylamine, an event more likely to occur than the \"Worst Case\", we considered a release event of a single tank to be lost as gas, again using the EPA methodology.  Mitigation systems were not included in this scenario.  The analysis indicates that this scenario would have an offsite consequence but no public receptors would be involved.
