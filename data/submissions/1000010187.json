COMPRESSED GAS.  STRONG OXIDIZER.  Contact with combustible materials may cause fire or explosion.  Reacts violently or explosively with many substances.  Reacts with water to form corrosive hydrochloric and hypochlorous \n\nacids.  Confined space hazard.  VERY TOXIC.  May be fatal if inhaled.  Extremely irritating to the respiratory tract.  Causes lung injury and effects may be delayed.  CORROSIVE to the eyes and skin.  Liquefied gas can cause frostbite and corrosive injury to the eyes and skin.  Burns and permanent damage, including blindness may result.  Very toxic to aquatic organisms.  Can cause damage to vegetation.  Read the entire MSDS for a more thorough evaluation of the hazards.\n\n \n\nPotential Health Effects:\n\n \n\nGeneral: Chlorine normally exists as a gas at room temperature and the most important route of exposure is inhalation, followed by eye and skin exposures.  Liquefied chlorine can freeze skin tissues. \n\n\n\nInhalation: Chlorine is a severe nose, throat and upper respiratory tract irritant.  People exposed to chlorine, even for short periods of time, can develop a tolerance to its odor and irritating properties.  In mild exposures, clinical signs include rhinorrhea, cough, headache, sore throat, chest pain, dyspnea, nausea and pulmonary function deficits.  After more severe exposures, clinical signs include rhinorrhea, ulcerative tracheobronchitis, \n\npulmonary edema, respiratory failure and death.\n\n \n\nThe following is a listing of chlorine exposure thresholds and estimated clinical effects:\n\n> 0.2 - 0.4 ppm - odor thresh"

Direct contact with the liquefied gas escaping from its pressurized cylinder can cause frostbite.  Symptoms of mild frostbite include numbness, prickling and itching in the affected area.  Symptoms of more severe frostbite include a burning sensation and stiffness of the affected area.  The skin may become waxy white or yellow.\n\n \n\nEye Contact: Chlorine gas is a severe eye irritant.  Stinging, a burning sensation, rapid blinking, redness and watering of the eyes have been observed at concentrations of 1 ppm and higher.  Direct contact with liquefied chlorine escaping from its high-pressure cylinder may cause frostbite.  Burns and permanent damage, including blindness may result.\n\n \n\nIngestion: Ingestion is not an applicable route of exposure for gases.\n\n \n\nExisting Medical Conditions Possibly Aggravated by Exposure: Asthma, bronchitis, emphysema and other lung diseases and chronic nose, sinus or throat, and cardiac conditions.\n\n \n\nChronic Effects: A small number of human population studies conducted have not shown significant respiratory system effects in workers with long-term, low-level (typically less than 1 ppm) chlorine exposure.  One study examined 332 workers exposed to time- weighted average (TWA) concentrations of between 0.006 and 1.42 ppm (0.15-ppm average) for an average of 10.9 years.  No relationship was found between exposure to chlorine and the occurrence of colds, breathing difficulties, and abnormal heartbeat or chest pain.  Significant effects on lung function were not observed.  Studies of workers who have had experienced one or more expos"

Remove source of contamination or move victim to fresh air.  If breathing is difficult, oxygen may be beneficial if administered by trained personnel, preferably on doctor's advice.  DO NOT allow victim to move about unnecessarily.  Symptoms of pulmonary edema can be delayed up to 48 hours after exposure.  Apply artificial respiration if victim is not breathing. Induce artificial respiration with the aid of a pocket mask equipped with a one-way valve or other proper respiratory medical device.  Give Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) if there is no pulse AND no breathing.  Obtain medical attention IMMEDIATELY. \n\n\n\nSkin Contact: Quickly remove victim from source of contamination and flush with lukewarm, gently flowing water for a minimum of 20 minutes.

However, chlorine is a strong oxidizing agent and poses a serious fire and explosion risk because it promotes combustion, like oxygen.  Most combustible materials will ignite and/or burn in chlorine atmospheres, forming irritating and toxic gases.  Containers or cylinders may rupture \n\nviolently due to over-pressurization, if exposed to fire or excessive heat for a sufficient period of time.  Intense local heat (above 200A?C) on the steel walls of chlorine cylinders can cause an iron/chlorine fire resulting in rupture of the container.  Cylinder and ton containers will vent through fusible plugs at 71A?C (160A?F).  Chlorine gas is heavier than air and will collect and persist in pits, hollows, depressions, and other confined or low-lying \n\nareas.\n\n \n\nExtinguishing Media: Use extinguishing media appropriate to surrounding fire conditions, such as dry chemical powder, carbon dioxide, or foam.\n\n \n\nFire Fighting Procedures: Apply water from as far a distance as possible, in flooding quantities as a spray or fog to keep fire-exposed cylinders,"

      "SummaryText": " containers or equipment cool and absorb heat, until well after the fire is out.  If there is a chlorine leak, stop the flow of gas, if this can be done safely.  A chlorine fire can be extinguished only by stopping the flow of chlorine gas.  Use water spray to protect personnel attempting to shut off the flow. Remove all flammable and combustible materials from the vicinity, especially oil and grease.  Use water with caution.  Do not apply water directly to the liquefied or gaseous chlorine.  Reverse flow into cylinder may cause rupture.  Take care not to block pressure relief valves.\n\n \n\nStay away from ends of tanks (but realize that shrapnel may travel in any direction).  In an advanced or massive fire, the area should be evacuated; use unmanned hoseholders or monitor nozzles.\n\n \n\nFire Fighting Protective Equipment: Use specialized protective equipment suitable for the situation.  Firefighter's normal protective clothing (Bunker Gear) will not provide adequate protection.  A full-body encapsulating chemical resistant suit with positive pressure self-contained breathing apparatus (MSHA/NIOSH approved or equivalent) may \n\nbe necessary. \n\n\n\nEvacuation: If tank, rail car or tank truck is involved in a fire, ISOLATE for 800 meters (0.5 mile) in all directions; also, consider initial evacuation for 800 meters (0.5 mile) in all \n\ndirections.\n\n \n\nNOTE: Also see: \"Section 10 - Stability and Reactivity\". \n\n\n\n\n\nSECTION 6 - ACCIDENTAL RELEASE MEASURES \n\n\n\nSpills, Leaks, or Releases: \n\n> Restrict access to area until completion of clean up.

The following addresses the hazards of the chlorination process, the engineering and administrative controls applicable to chlorine leaks and their relationships, consequences of failure of those controls, and the consequences of the effects on all workplace employees in or near the process area.\n\n\n\n1. Chemical Release\n\n\n\na) Continuous Release:\n\n\n\nChlorine can be released from a point source over a period of time.  An example of such a release is a leak through a faulty flange or improper connection.  Such a leak will get worse until the condition is corrected.  Until that time, the downwind hazards will continue.\n\n\n\nb) Slug Release:\n\n\n\nA slug release will occur if a vessel incurs a large puncture or rupture.  In the case of a puncture in the upper (vapor) portion of the vessel about one-fourth of the liquid (depending on the liquid temperature) will rapidly evaporate or \"flash off.. \n\n\n\nThis will cool the remaining liquid to the atmospheric boiling point.  The evaporation rate of the remaining liquid primarily depends on the heat input from the atmosphere.\n\n\n\nIn the case of a puncture in the liquid phase, liquid will be expelled through the hole until the liquid level drops to the lip of the opening.  Most of the liquid expelled will \"flash off\" as it comes out of the tank, but some may spill on the ground.  The evaporation rate of the spilled liquid depends on heat input from the ground and from the sun.  Reducing the surface area of the spill will reduce the evaporation rate.  The addition of water streams \n\nwill provide additional heat and will increase the evaporation rate.\n\n\n\nThe area and exposure duration depend upon the total quantity released, the rate of release, the height of the release point, and weather conditions.  Chlorine downwind can vary from barely detectable to high concentrations.\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Hazards to Health\n\n\n\na) General\n\n\n\nChlorine gas is primarily a respiratory irritant it is so intensely irritating that low con"

As the concentrations increase from the level of detection from smell so does symptomatology in the exposed individual.  At chlorine concentrations above 5 PPM the gas is very irritating and it is unlikely that any \n\nperson would remain in such an exposure for more than a very brief time unless she/he is trapped or unconscious.\n\n\n\nb) Acute Toxicity\n\n\n\nIn concentrations near the threshold of smell, chlorine gas will, after several hours of exposure, cause mild irritation of the eyes of the mucous membrane of the respiratory tract.  As concentrations increase there is an increase in the irritation effect on the eyes coughing mechanism and on the upper and lower respiratory tract with eventual difficulty in breathing.  As the duration of exposure and/or the concentration increase, the affected \n\nindividual may become apprehensive and restless with coughing accompanied by throat irritation, sneezing, and excess salivation.  At higher levels there is vomiting associated with labored breathing.  In extreme cases difficulty in breathing can progress to the point \n\nof death through suffocation.\n\n\n\nLiquid chlorine in contact with the eyes or skin will cause local irritation and/or burns.  All symptoms and signs result directly or indirectly from its direct irritation action.  There are no known systemic effects.\n\n\n\nc) Chronic Toxicity\n\n\n\nLow concentrations of chlorine gas in the air may have minor irritation effects or may produce slight symptoms after several hours of exposure, but careful examination of persons repeatedly exposed to such conditions reportedly has shown no permanent physiological effect. \n\n\n\nThe maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects or symptoms which could"

HAZARD ASSESSMENT\n\n\n\nA. Five Year Accident History/ Reporting\n\n \n\nAs of the date of this plan, no accidental releases of chlorine have occurred resulting in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n\n\n\n\nB. External Event Analysis\n\n\n\nThe external event reviewed due to its high probability of occurrence was an earthquake event.  The analysis methodology selected is the \"What-if\" analysis.\n\n\n\nIn the event that an earthquake with a significant level of magnitude were to occur at the Cement Hill Water Treatment Plant what types of failure may take place in relation to the chlorination equipment operation and spill containment processes?  \n\n\n\n1. What if the chlorine cylinders housed within the containment "

      "SummaryText": "vessels were too severe the interior chlorine transfer lines to the exterior vacuum regulators during an earthquake?\n\n\n\nTo minimize the possibility of this occurring the chlorine cylinders are fastened to the interior containment structure wall via welded C-type clamps at the cylinders chimes.  Also, original copper type \"pigtail\"feed lines were replaced with Monel 400 transfer hoses with type 302 stainless steel guard.  If these were to fail the escaping gas from this hose would be contained within the containment vessel. \n\n\n\n2. What if an earthquake induced power outage was to occur?\n\n\n\nAll ancillary emergency electrical equipment for the containment vessels (leak detectors, shut-off valves, alarms) are powered during electrical outages with on-site diesel powered electric generators.  If for some reason these generators do not respond as designed all chlorine delivery will be automatically stopped via back-up nitrogen supplied shut-off valves.\n\n\n\n3. What if the containment vessels were to be moved from their foundations and exterior ancillary equipment on the containment vessels were to be damaged or detached? \n\n\n\nThe containment vessels are mounted to an 8-inch concrete slab with 12 stainless steel bolts.  If these were to fail allowing the vessel to move severing the chlorine transfer piping to process, the automatic vacuum operated chlorine regulators would close stopping the flow.  Consequences of failure or damage to the automatic shut-off valve are \n\ndescribed in the RMP description of \"Alternative release data analysis\" for an opening in the vessel.\n\n\n\nOperations staff is trained biannually in the use of self contained breathing apparatus and the application of emergency leak repair kits for use on one ton chlorine cylinder."
