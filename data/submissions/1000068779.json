All elements of the submittal have been verified and updated as applicable and the worst-case and alternative scenarios have been reevaluated. The modeling reevaluation did not result in an increase in the off-site impact of the Butane Blending system as measured by the distance to end point of the worst-case scenario and the population affected .  Due to a recent change in company policy, the maximum intended inventory was changed as a part of this resubmission. Previous practice was to include the operational safeguard that restricted the butane storage vessel to 85% capacity. While that control is still in place, current company policy is to assume that the vessel is 100% full for RMP related calculations. This resulted in an increase of approximately 40,000 lbs. of butane but was not significant enough to alter the worst-case scenario. \n\n\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RELEASE POLICIES\n\n\n\nSunoco Partners Marketing and Terminals L.P. - Romulus Terminal is an onshore, light products, bulk petroleum storage terminal used in the storage and distribution of petroleum products to retail and commercial end-users in the vicinity of Romulus, Michigan. The Terminal handles and stores various grades of unleaded gasoline, diesel, butane, ethanol, and petroleum based additives.\n\n\n\nSunoco Partners Marketing and Terminals L.P.- Romulus Terminal in Romulus, MI, hereafter referred to as Romulus Terminal, is committed to operating in a safe, reliable, and environmentally sound manner, in keeping with the core philosophy that a strong and emphasized health, safety, and environment program goes hand in hand with operating reliably and integrity. Outstanding HSE performance is of paramount importance.\n\n\n\nRomulus Terminal is d"

A description of the facility and the use of regulated substances\n\nB. An overview of the accidental release prevention programs\n\nC. A five-year accident history for accidental releases of regulated chemicals\n\nD. An overview of the emergency response program\n\nE. An overview of planned changes to improve safety\n\n\n\nA. STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n\n\nThe primary function of the Romulus Terminal is to act as a refined petroleum distribution facility. The Butane Blending process has been classified as Program level 3. No Program level 1 or Program level 2 processes containing regulated substances were identified at Romulus Terminal. Due to the flammable effects associated with butane, it is necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling butane to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to employee health, and to minimize the threat and impact to nearby members of the community. Romulus Terminal is strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety and health. Safety at the Facility depends upon the manner in which butane is handled as well as the various safety devices incorporated into the design of the process. Furthermore, comprehensive training is provided to employees, which reinforces the safety policies and procedures of the Romulus Terminal.\n\n\n\nThe facility has fixed inventories of butane. Butane is received by truck (transports) and stored in one (1) 59,784-gallon storage vessel. Specifically, liquefied butane is off-lo"

The butane is pumped to the Butane Injection Skid for direct injection into regular and premium unleaded gasoline lines feeding the site gasoline truck-loading rack.  Injection quantities are controlled via the Injection Skid and Bartec-Benke Analyzer. Process safety controls include excess flow valves, low-melting point feeds (fusible links) to pneumatic valves that fail in a safe position, 85% fill shutoff (80% alarm) on the vessel, emergency shut-off devices on the system, in-line hydrostatic reliefs, and grounding/interlock devices. Access to Romulus Terminal is restricted to authorized employees, management personnel, authorized contractors/visitors and tenants.\n\n\n\nB. GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION MEASURES\n\n\n\nAccidental release prevention programs and emergency planning and response programs are in place to effectively manage the hazards posed by the regulated substances to employees, the public, and the environment. The covered process is regulated by the EPA RMP regulation 40 CFR Part 68, as well as the OSHA Process Safety Management standard 29CFR 1910.119. The following accident prevention program elements are in place at the Romulus Terminal:\n\n\n\n1) Employee Participation\n\n2) Process Safety Information\n\n3) Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) with Risk Assessments\n\n4) Standard Operating Procedures\n\n5) EHS Operator Training\n\n6) Contractors\n\n7) Pre-startup Safety Review\n\n8) Mechanical Integrity with Preventive Maintenance\n\n9) Work Permits\n\n10) Management of Change\n\n11) EHS Accident or Potential Catastrophic Event Investigation\n\n12) Emergency Response\n\n13) Compliance Audits\n\n14) Trade Secrets\n\n\n\nThe fourteen (14) individual elements of the prevention program work together to prevent accidental chemical releases.
