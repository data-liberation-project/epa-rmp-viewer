      "SummaryText": "Southwest Chemical Services, Inc. engages in the business of providing chemicals to end users.  Its warehouse and storage facilities are located at 1227 E. Washington, McAlester, Oklahoma.  Chemicals are purchased from manufacturers brought to our warehouse where they are unloaded, stored temporarily then reloaded and shipped to the customer.  All products are contained in the manufacturers package (drums, bags, totes, etc.).  Key elements of our Risk Management Plan:  1) Storage of compressed Chlorine gas in 150 lb. cylinders.  Cylinders are contained in steel racks and loaded and unloaded using a forklift.  2) Storage of compressed Sulfur Dioxide in 150 lb. cylinders.  Handling and storage is the same as Chlorine.  3) Worse Case Scenario would be the mechanical failure of one of the Chlorine cylinders and have off site consequences. 4)  An alternative scenario would be the release of Chlorine gas or Sulfur Dioxide gas due to vessel failure caused from corrosion.  Southwest Chemical Services has in place an emergency response plan that includes accidental releases of compressed gases.  Our ERP contains safety and hazardous information along with operating instructions.  Southwest Chemical Services has never had  any accidental releases.  Southwest Chemical Services coordinates its activities with all applicable governmental agencies and is committed to safe and responsible distribution of chemical products."
