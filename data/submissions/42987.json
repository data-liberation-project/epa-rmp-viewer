      "SummaryText": "This is to inform all interested persons, including employees that York Cold Storage is complying with OSHA?s Process Safety Management Standard (called Process Safety Management or PSM), Title 29 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 1910.119, and EPA?s Risk Management Program regulations (called RM Program), Title 40 CFR Part 68, to deal with the risks involved with the storage, handling, and processing of hazardous chemicals, In this way we promote overall plant, worker, and public safety.  These programs enable our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of toxic substances as well as fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents.   Overall, these programs prevent accidental fatalities, injuries and illnesses and avoid physical property damage.  Our safety programs are applied to any activity involving hazardous chemicals including any use, storage, manufacturing, handling, or the on-site movement of such chemicals, or combination of these activities.  Any group of vessels which are interconnected and separate vessels which are located such that a hazardous chemical could be involved in a potential release shall be considered a single process.  \n\n    Our safety programs prevent accidents because they focus on the rules, procedures, and practices which govern individual processes, activities, or pieces of equipment.  These rules are detailed and improved as necessary.  They are also communicated to and accepted by all employees at the facility.\n\n    York Cold Storage is a facility in York, Nebraska which is a cold storage warehouse and food processing plant.  The facility operates an ammonia refrigeration system to provide cooling and freezing capabilities.  The system is operated as a two-stage system.  On the low stage portion of the system, a low temperature accumulator operating at ?28?F pumps liquid to the blast freezers, freezers, and the ice room.  The low temperature ammonia liquid flows through coil"

      "SummaryText": "s where it picks up heat, changing the ammonia from a liquid to a vapor.  The low-pressure ammonia vapor is sent from the plant to the accumulator via a suction header.  Vapor from the low temperature accumulator is fed to low stage compressors. The compressed vapor from the low stage compressors is sent to an intercooler operating at +10?F. \nThe high stage portion of the system consists of a cooler, process coolers, and tempering.  Liquid flows from the high-pressure receiver to the accumulators, then through the coils where it picks up heat, changing the ammonia from a liquid to a vapor.  The low-pressure ammonia vapor is sent from the plant to the intercooler via a common suction header.  Vapor from the intercooler is then fed to the high stage compressors.  During the compression phase in the high stage compressors, the temperature of the ammonia vapor will rise as the pressure of the ammonia vapor is increased to approximately 150#-180# psig. The high-pressure ammonia vapor flows from the high stage compressors to an evaporative condenser and shell and tube condensers where heat is removed, turning the vapor into a high pressure liquid.  The high-pressure liquid is collected in the high-pressure receivers.  The liquid collected in the high-pressure receivers provides liquid make-up for the intercooler and for the accumulator."
