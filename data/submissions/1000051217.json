      "SummaryText": "ONS: Propane vapor is heavier than air and can collect in low areas that are without sufficient\r\nventilation. Conduct system checks for leaks with a leak detector or solution, never with flame. Make certain the\r\ncontainer service valve is shut off prior to connecting or disconnecting. If container valve does not operate properly,\r\ndiscontinue use and contact AmeriGas. Never insert an object (e.g., wrench, screwdriver, pry bar, etc.) into pressure\r\nrelief valve or cylinder valve cap openings. Do not drop or abuse cylinders. Never strike an arc on a gas container or\r\nmake a container part of an electrical circuit. See Section 16, OTHER INFORMATION, for additional precautions.\r\n\r\nSTORAGE PRECAUTIONS: Store in a safe, authorized location (outside, detached storage is preferred) with adequate\r\nventilation. Specific requirements are listed in NFPA 58, LP-GAS CODE. Isolate from heat and ignition sources.\r\nContainers should never be allowed to reach temperature exceeding 125\u00b0F (52\u00b0C). Isolate from combustible materials.\r\nProvide separate storage locations for other compressed and flammable gases. Propane containers should be separated\r\nfrom oxygen cylinders or other oxidizers by a minimum distance of 20 feet, or by a barrier of non-combustible material at\r\nleast 5 feet high having a fire rating of at least 1/2 hour. Full and empty cylinders should be segregated. Keep cylinders\r\nin an upright position at all times so that each pressure relief valve communicates with the vapor space. Keep container\r\nvalve closed and plugged or capped when not in use. Install protective caps when cylinders are not connected for use.\r\nEmpty containers retain some residue and should be treated as if they were full.\r\nAll American Propane has had no product release in the last five years that resulted or exposure to the general public and or residential parties"
