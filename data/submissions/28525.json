There are no environmental receptors within this distance from the release point.\n\nAn \u00bfalternate release scenario\u00bf for 1,3-pentadiene involves the failure of a gasket in a tank truck loading line.  For this scenario, the gasket failure causes the leak of 1,3-pentadiene which flashes/pools, and is ignited, resulting in a pool fire.  The endpoint of 5 Kw/m2 for 40 seconds which can cause 2nd degree burns was used. Under the EPA alternate release weather conditions, the heat could potentially travel 341 feet to reach an adjacent off-site roadway; however, public receptors are not expected to be affected.

The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Specific Prevention Steps (\u00a7 68.155(d))\n\nUnder the EPA RMP criteria for establishing a prevention program, a Program 3 prevention program is required for all SCDPP covered processes.  A Program 3 prevention program is essentially the same as OSHA PSM, except that the program also focuses on protecting the public and the environment beyond the plant's boundaries.  The following sections briefly describe the 12 elements of SCDPPlant's Program 3 prevention program that address EPA's RMP rule prevention program requirements.\n\n4.1  Process Safety Information \nSCDPP maintains technical documents that are used to help ensure safe operation of the plant processes. These documents address (1) physical properties of hazardous substances handled at the plant, (2) operating parameters of the equipment used at the plant and (3) design basis and configuration of the equipment at the plant.

PHAs are revalidated at least every five years by a team made up of individuals with engineering, and process operating experience.  One member of the team is knowledgeable in PHA methodology and serves to facilitate the PHA.  Potential hazards identified during the PHA are risk-ranked to ensure that highest priority is given to those having the highest consequence and likelihood of occurrence. After management review of the identified potential hazards and confirmation of proposed considerations, a written PHA report is prepared describing the results of the analysis.

In the event of an accidental release, plant operators and emergency responders work together closely to control and contain the release in a manner that will be safe for workers and will minimize the impact to the public and the environment.  The facility maintains an active Emergency Response Team that is on call at all times to respond to accidental releases of any hazardous chemical handled at SCDPP.  In addition, SCDPP has a leadership role in Channel Industries Mutual Aid (CIMA).  This is a state chartered non-profit mutual-aid cooperative that combines the fire fighting, rescue, hazardous material handling and emergency medical capabilities to its members in the Houston Ship Channel area.

The results of the investigation are documented, recommendations are assigned to people to be resolved, and appropriate process or system enhancements are implemented.  The facility has a formal program in place for reporting incidents, conducting incident investigations, report generation, and tracking of actions resulting from incidents. \n\n4.10  Employee Participation\nSCDPP has a written employee participation program for the facility to help ensure that the safety concerns of the plant's workers are addressed.

The mechanical integrity program includes:\n(1)  an administrative procedure that defines the inspection and testing program\n(2)  equipment inspection procedures that define methods of inspection, acceptance criteria, and inspector qualifications\n(3)  specific non-destructive inspection procedures\n(4)  a quality assurance program to help ensure that new and replacement equipment meets the design standards required for service in the plant's processes\n\n4.6  Management of Change\nSCDPP Management of Change procedures define the requirements for review and approval of all proposed changes to chemicals, equipment, and procedures for processes to ensure safety, health and environmental affects of changes are considered.  The Management of Change system ensures that the affected employees are notified of the changes, training is provided, and that process safety information and procedures are updated accordingly.  Plant personnel receive training on how to identify potential changes and the types of changes that are covered by the Management of Change procedure.\n\n4.7   Pre-startup Review\nSCDPP performs a Pre-startup Safety Review (PSSR) for all new/modified facilities, and facilities being restarted following a maintenance turnaround before they are put into service to help ensure that the process is safe to operate, procedures are in place, and affected personnel are adequately trained to operate or maintain the process.  Startup of the applicable process or equipment cannot commence until all Priority 1 issues identified by the Pre-startup Safety Review are complete, and readiness approval has been authorized.\n\nSpecific items that the PSSR confirms are:\n\u00b7  Construction and equipment are in accordance with design specifications\n\u00b7  Adequate safety, operating, maintenance, and emergency procedures are in place\n\u00b7"

Employees are consulted on and informed about all aspects of the RMP rule prevention program.\n\n4.11  Hot Work Permits\nSCDPP has a hot work permit program to control spark or flame-producing activities that could result in fires or explosions in all processes at the plant.  The plant reviewed the OSHA fire prevention and protection requirements in 29 CFR 1910.252(a) and enhanced the Hot Work Permit procedure to assure compliance with these requirements.  Personnel who are to perform hot work are required to receive a Hot Work Permit.  Qualified individuals who issue hot work permits receive specialized training in the procedure and activities related to hot work.  Refresher training on hot work is required every three years.\n\n4.12  Contractors\nSCDPP has established a Contractor Safety Program to help ensure that contractors who perform work in the facility are competent and responsible.  SCDPP requires that contractors undergo a qualification process before being allowed to work at the facility. Contractors are required to submit information regarding their safety, health, and environmental programs and performance.  This information is evaluated to ensure that the plant only hires contractors who can perform the desired job tasks in a safe and environmentally sound manner.  All contractor employees are required to take a Basic Safety and Hazard Communication course offered by the local area contractrors Association of Reciprecal Safety Councils, Inc. establishment, followed by a plant orientation and test on the plant\u00bfs safe work practices and emergency alarm system.  Unit-specific orientations and tests are also given to contractor employees to ensure that they understand the hazards of the process on which they will work and the area emergency response procedures.

The facility\u00bfs offsite transportation response team is called the Response Action Team (RAT).  The team maintains a mobile hazardous materials vehicle with the necessary equipment to respond to chemical emergencies. In addition, SCDPP has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment.  Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties.  The emergency response program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to chemical processes or other chemical facilities.  All employees review the emergency response program annually.\n\nThe SCDPP emergency response program is coordinated with the Deer Park, Texas \u00bf Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  This coordination includes periodic meetings with the committee, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials, and industry representatives.  SCDPP has 24 hour a day communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials, municipal emergency response organizations, and industrial mutual aid emergency response organizations.
