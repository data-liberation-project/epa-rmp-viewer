PACKAGED FOOD INCLUDES:  CITRUS CONCENTRATES, USDA COMMODITIES, GROCERY ITEMS, INGREDIENTS FOR FOOD PROCESSORS AND MANUFACTURERS, AND SOME NON-RELATED BUILDING PRODUCTS SUCH AS PUMPS AND THRESHOLDS.  FOOD RELATED PRODUCTS INCLUDE:  CARDBOARD PACKAGING MATERIALS, EMPTY CONTAINERS, ETC.\n\nTHOSE BUILDINGS UNDER AMMONIA REFRIGERATION ARE OPERATED BY THREE SEPARATE AND DISTINCT AMMONIA COMPRESSOR SYSTEMS (MOTOR ROOMS 1,2,AND3).  ALL SYSTEMS AND FACILITY INTERIORS, AS WELL AS EXTERIOR GROUNDS ARE MONITORED AROUND THE CLOCK, 365 DAYS PER YEAR BY ON-SITE PERSONNEL, AS WELL AS AN EXTENSIVE SAFETY ARRAY, INCLUDING:  AMMONIA DETECTION DEVICES,ALARMS, RELAYS, PROTECTIVE SHUT-DOWN SYSTEMS (AUTOMATIC AND MANUAL), CONTRACTED SECURITY AND MONITORING SERVICES, AND AN AGGRESSIVE, PROACTIVE RISK CONTROL COMMITTMENT FROM THE OWNERS AND MANAGEMENT OF THE COMPANY.\n\nMOTOR ROOM NR. 1 SERVICES 90,000 SQUARE FEET WHICH INCLUDES 7 SEPARATE BUILDINGS, AND IS LOCATED SOUTHERNMOST ON THE PHOENIX PROPERTY.  THIS LOCATION IS NOT THE SITE CONSIDERED FOR BOTH WORST AND ALTERNATIVE CASE SCENARIOS INVOLVING THE RELEASE OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA, EVEN THOUGH THIS LOCATION IS APPROXIMATELY .1 MILE FROM THE CLOSEST PUBLIC RECEPTOR--SNIVELY ELEMENTARY SCHOOL; RATHER, MOTOR ROOM NR. 3 IS CLASSIFIED FOR BOTH WORST AND ALTERNATIVE AS THE LARGEST VESSEL RULE APPLIES (40 CFR PART 68).

SNIVELY ELEMENTARY SCHOOL CLASSES HAVE VISITED PHOENIX FOR \"FIELD TRIPS\" AND PHOENIX IS ESTABLISHED AS A BUSINESS PARTNER WITH THE SCHOOL.\n\nTHE CHEMICAL SAFETY RECORD AT PHOENIX INDUSTRIES HAS BEEN EXCELLENT.  DURING THE PAST 20 YEARS, THERE HAVE BEEN NO REPORTABLE RELEASES OF AMMONIA, NO TREATABLE INJURIES ASSOCIATED WITH AMMONIA,  AND NO ACCIDENTS WITH AMMONIA.  CONSTANT VIGILANCE, METICULOUS RECORDKEEPING TO EVALUATE PROPER AMMONIA SYSTEM OPERATION, CONTINUOUS SAFETY TRAINING, AND PLANNED MAINTENANCE HAVE CREATED A SAFE WORK SITE AND A SAFE NEIGHBORHOOD.\n\nTHE FIRST RESPONDER TO ANY CALL FOR ASSISTANCE INVOLVING A TOXIC REPORTABLE RELEASE IS THE POLK COUNTY FIRE DEPARTMENT (HAZMAT CAPABLE).  PHOENIX ROUTINELY PRACTICES DRILLS SIMULATING A TOXIC RELEASE, TESTING RESPONSE OF BOTH PERSONNEL AND EQUIPMENT.  PHOENIX IS REGISTERED WITH THE STATE OF FLORIDA AND POLK COUNTY EMERGENCY RESPONSE COMMISSIONS (LERC DISTRICT 7).
