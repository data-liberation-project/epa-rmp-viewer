PACKAGED FOOD INCLUDES:  CITRUS CONCENTRATES, USDA COMMODITIES, GROCERY ITEMS, INGREDIENTS FOR FOOD PROCESSORS AND MANUFACTURERS, AND SOME NON-RELATED BUILDING PRODUCTS SUCH AS PUMPS AND THRESHOLDS.  FOOD RELATED PRODUCTS INCLUDE:  CARDBOARD PACKAGING MATERIALS, EMPTY CONTAINERS, ETC.\n\nTHOSE BUILDINGS UNDER AMMONIA REFRIGERATION ARE OPERATED BY THREE SEPARATE AND DISTINCT AMMONIA COMPRESSOR SYSTEMS (MOTOR ROOMS 1,2,AND3).  ALL SYSTEMS AND FACILITY INTERIORS, AS WELL AS EXTERIOR GROUNDS ARE MONITORED AROUND THE CLOCK, 365 DAYS PER YEAR BY ON-SITE PERSONNEL, AS WELL AS AN EXTENSIVE SAFETY ARRAY, INCLUDING:  AMMONIA DETECTION DEVICES,ALARMS, RELAYS, PROTECTIVE SHUT-DOWN SYSTEMS (AUTOMATIC AND MANUAL), CONTRACTED SECURITY AND MONITORING SERVICES, AND AN AGGRESSIVE, PROACTIVE RISK CONTROL COMMITTMENT FROM THE OWNERS AND MANAGEMENT OF THE COMPANY.\n\nMOTOR ROOM NR. 1 SERVICES 90,000 SQUARE FEET WHICH INCLUDES 7 SEPARATE BUILDINGS, AND IS LOCATED SOUTHERNMOST ON THE PHOENIX PROPERTY.

ALTERMAN AND FRESH JUICE BOTH OPERATE SIMILAR AMMONIA REFRIGERATION SYSTEMS; CONSEQUENTLY, ALL THREE COMPANIEW WORK CLOSELY IN COORDINATING TROUBLESHOOTING, REPAIR ASSISTANCE, AND EXCHANGING INFORMATION.  SNIVELY ELEMENTARY SCHOOL CLASSES HAVE VISITED PHOENIX FOR \"FIELD TRIPS\" AND PHOENIX IS ESTABLISHED AS A BUSINESS PARTNER WITH THE SCHOOL.\n\nTHE CHEMICAL SAFETY RECORD AT PHOENIX INDUSTRIES HAS BEEN EXCELLENT.  DURING THE PAST 20 YEARS, THERE HAVE BEEN NO REPORTABLE RELEASES OF AMMONIA, NO TREATABLE INJURIES ASSOCIATED WITH AMMONIA,  AND NO ACCIDENTS WITH AMMONIA.  CONSTANT VIGILANCE, METICULOUS RECORDKEEPING TO EVALUATE PROPER AMMONIA SYSTEM OPERATION, CONTINUOUS SAFETY TRAINING, AND PLANNED MAINTENANCE HAVE CREATED A SAFE WORK SITE AND A SAFE NEIGHBORHOOD.\n\nTHE FIRST RESPONDER TO ANY CALL FOR ASSISTANCE INVOLVING A TOXIC REPORTABLE RELEASE IS THE POLK COUNTY FIRE DEPARTMENT (HAZMAT CAPABLE).  PHOENIX ROUTINELY PRACTICES DRILLS SIMULATING A TOXIC RELEASE, TESTING RESPONSE OF BOTH PERSONNEL AND EQUIPMENT.  PHOENIX IS REGISTERED WITH THE STATE OF FLORIDA AND POLK COUNTY EMERGENCY RESPONSE COMMISSIONS (LERC DISTRICT 7).  FIRE DEPARTMENT PERSONNEL ROUTINELY INSPECT THE INTERIOR AND EXTERIOR FACILITIES AND OPERATING EQUIPMENT TO KEEP THEMSELVES FAMILIARIZED WITH WAREHOUSE CONTENTS, FIRE HYDRANT LOCATIONS AND FLOW TESTS, AND GENERAL OPERATING PARAMETERS.
