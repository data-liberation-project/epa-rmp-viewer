Standards codified by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration at 29 CFR 1910.119 are not applicable to the operations at this facility because the facility is operated as a retail operation and is exempt from the OSHA standards.  However, the OSHA standards at 29 CFR 1910.111, Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, are applicable and are included in the Risk Management Program (RMPr) document that is implemented by this Facility.\n\n\n\nThis electronic submittal provides conservative estimates of the offsite consequences of an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia from the Falls City, NE Facility located at 5th and Wilson Street, Falls City, NE 68355.  The electronic RMP summarizes the policies and procedures implemented by the Falls City, NE Facility to minimize the likelihood of an accident.  The electronic RMP also summarizes the actions that the Falls City, NE Facility has taken to ensure that a response to a release will be implemented in a proper and timely manner.\n\n\n\nPURPOSE FOR UPDATING RMP\n\n\n\nHelena is submitting this as a 5-year update because it has significantly altered the prior Storage & Handling Process by removing all of the stationary pressure vessels from service at this Facility. Removal of the stationary pressure vessels required the revision to the off-site consequence analysis.  The updates are reflected in both the EPA RMP Submit report and the Facility Risk Management Plan Program Document (RMPr).\n\n\n\nFACILITY\n\n\n\nThe Falls City, NE Facility is a retail agricultural chemical facility and operates one (1) covered process that includes Storage of anhydrous ammonia Nurse Tanks.  Anhydrous ammonia is not transferred at this Facility.  At certain times of the year, the Facility may store Nurse Tanks i"

The covered process includes storing anhydrous ammonia Nurse Tanks.  The worst case scenario release for the Retail Facility assumes that all the contents in the largest single nurse tank are released.  For this Facility, the largest nurse tank is 1,465-gallons.  The release was modeled as if the ammonia tank was punctured on the side at the ground level. The resulting release of ammonia was modeled as a ground level horizontal jet.\n\n\n\nThe alternative release for the Nurse Tank Storage assumes a 60-minute release from a pressure relief valve on the Nurse Tank that fails to re-seat.  \n\n\n\nACCIDENT PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe Branch Manager implements the risk management planning process at this Facility.  The Branch Manager is assisted by other Helena staff, as directed.  The Branch Manager is responsible for ensuring that Helena Staff are properly trained in the implementation of the Prevention Program which includes Safety Information, Hazard Analysis, Operating Procedures, Training, Maintenance, Compliance Audits, Incident Investigations, and Emergency Contingency Plans.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nHelena's Falls City, NE Facility is a non-responding facility.
