      "SummaryText": "THE FACILITY AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\r\nThe Greenfield Global USA Inc. (Greenfield Global) - Shelbyville, Kentucky facility primarily manufactures and blends ethyl alcohol related products. The plant also receives, stores, and distributes containers of pentane, petroleum ether (composition is assumed to be primarily pentane), ethyl ether, chloroform, and hydrochloric acid (37%) based on customer demand. There is no handling of these substances other than transporting drums and other containers from the shipping dock to storage and vice versa as needed. The plant will maintain a typical storage of approximately 24 55-gallon drums of pentane and 24 55-gallon drums of petroleum ether for a total of approximately 13,860 pounds of pentane. The plant also anticipates that the storage of ethyl ether, chloroform, and hydrochloric acid (37%) will normally be less than the threshold quantity (TQ) for each substance; however, that storage may occasionally exceed the TQ for each substance.  Therefore, the storage and handling process for pentane, petroleum ether, ethyl ether, chloroform, and hydrochloric acid (37%) is subject to the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Plan (RMP) Rule 40 CFR Part 68 since pentane, ethyl ether, chloroform, and hydrochloric acid (37%) are listed substances in the RMP rule. The facility's Risk Management Plan (RMP) addresses the storage and handling of pentane, petroleum ether, ethyl ether, chloroform, and hydrochloric acid (37%) at the facility. \r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM and EMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN\r\nThe Greenfield Global - Shelbyville facility has established an Accidental Release Prevention program for the storage and handling process that complies with the regulatory requirements of both OSHA PSM and EPA RMP, including elements for employee participation, process safety information, process hazard analysis, operating procedures, training, contractors, pre-startup safety review, mechanical integ"

      "SummaryText": "rity, hot work permit, management of change, incident investigation, emergency planning and response, compliance audits, and trade secrets. \r\n\r\nThe company has developed programs, procedures, and policies to minimize the possibility of releases. These programs include compliance with appropriate OSHA and EPA regulations and sound safety practices. Training for employees is conducted to maintain a high awareness level when working with hazardous materials.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the facility has an Emergency Action Plan that complies with various regulatory programs, including OSHA Emergency Response Planning requirements (29 CFR 1910.120(q). These plans have been coordinated with the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC). Drills are conducted periodically for on-site response teams. Additional training with outside organizations is also conducted as needed.\r\n\r\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\nThe storage and handling process for pentane, petroleum ether, ethyl ether, chloroform, and hydrochloric acid (37%) at the Greenfield Global facility in Shelbyville, Kentucky is a new facility and has not had any related process incidents to date.\r\n\r\nSAFETY IMPROVEMENTS\r\nSince this is a new facility, no planned changes to safety system have been identified at this time.  However, Greenfield Global is committed to continuous improvement of its safety, health, environmental, and security management systems and processes."
