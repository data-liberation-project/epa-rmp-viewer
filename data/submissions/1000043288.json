The sub-cooled liquid is sent back to the main liquid line to be fed to the system except for AHU #6.  It serves as an energy efficient device for the system which uses ammonia to cool ammonia.\r\n\r\nThe +20\u00b0F Cooler Recirculator feeds controlled pressure liquid ammonia to Air Handling Units #1 - #3 and #9 - #11 (+35\u00b0F). At the evaporators, the liquid ammonia, flowing through coils in the unit, is partially boiled as it absorbs heat from the product and room.  The resulting 'wet suction' (liquid/vapor mix) from AHU #1 - #3 and #9 - #11 and the Chillers is returned to the +20\u00b0F Cooler Recirculator, wherein the liquid drops to the bottom of the vessel (to be reused in the refrigeration process or transferred to the -10\u00b0F Freezer Accumulator) and vapor is drawn from the top of each vessel by the Compressors.  \r\n\r\nResulting 'wet suction' (liquid/vapor mix) from AHU #6 & #8 returns to the -10\u00b0F Freezer Accumulator.  Evaporator AHU #6 is currently valve off.  Liquid ammonia drains to the -10\u00b0F Freezer Accumulator Liquid Transfer Unit.  When the Liquid Transfer Unit (LTU) fills, hot gas from the compressors is fed to the LTU, which pressurizes the vessel, pushing high pressure liquid back to the +20\u00b0F Cooler Recirculator.  A pump is also used to aid in the transfer process.\r\n\r\nThe Chillers use the high pressure liquid ammonia from the High Pressure Receiver to cool product in the process areas at the facility.  The liquid ammonia boils off, and the Chillers return cooler suction (vapor) to the +20\u00b0F Cooler Recirculator.\r\n\r\nThe Frick Compressors (#3 - #6) draw vapor from the +20\u00b0F Cooler Recirculator.  The Vilter Compressor (#2) draws vapor from the -10\u00b0F Freezer Accumulator.  The Vilter Compressor (#1) can draw liquid off either of these vessels depending on system demand.

The system is checked on a regular basis to ensure it is functioning properly and in good repair.\r\n\r\nThe facility has an emergency evacuation plan that includes ammonia leaks.  If an ammonia leak or an alarm indicating an ammonia leak is observed by facility personnel, the decision to evacuate the building is made by management.  Professional emergency responders and the facility's professional refrigeration service firm are called to assist with the ammonia leak. \r\n\r\nThe management at Tropicana is committed to safety.  The emergency action plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\r\n\r\nThe facility is located at 240 North Orange Avenue in Industry, California.  The system was constructed in accordance with all applicable federal, state, and local regulations including the Uniform Fire and Mechanical Codes.\r\n\r\nThe ammonia refrigeration system uses 16,149 pounds of ammonia for the cold storage of fruit juice and fruit juice beverages.  The majority of the system is located inside the Machine Room, Process Area, Glycol Chiller #9 room, outside, and in the Freezer and Storage areas.  \r\n\r\nThe refrigeration process equipment at the facility operates continuously.  The compressors and condensers cycle on and off to comply with system demand during operation.  \r\n\r\nThe refrigeration cycle begins with the transfer of liquid ammonia from the Condensers to the High Pressure Receiver.  The High Pressure Receiver feeds high pressure liquid ammonia to the +20\u00b0F Cooler Recirculator, the Liquid Subcooler, the +10\u00b0F and +0\u00b0"

The system is also equipped with an Automatic Purger that removes non-condensables, i.e. air, from the system.\r\n\r\nAll process equipment and piping are designed according to ASME standards.  All ASME vessels are equipped with pressure relief valves that vent to the water diffusion tank at 150 psig, 250 psig, or 300 psig.\r\n\r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\n\r\nThe Tropicana ammonia refrigeration system has many safety features.  Much of the safety of the system is inherent in the policies and procedures that govern the operation of the system.  For example, the facility operates in accordance with Cal/OSHA's Process Safety Management regulation.  The facility conducts maintenance and any necessary minor repairs in house, but an outside contractor is hired for major repairs. The facility also maintains a contract with a professional refrigeration contractor to conduct preventative maintenance and any necessary repairs.\r\n\r\nThe facility including the ammonia system was designed and constructed in accordance with the Uniform Mechanical Code which specifically outlines requirements for the safe operation of the ammonia refrigeration system.  These safety features include two water diffusion tanks, ammonia sensors in the engine room as well as sensors near the evaporators, and automatic shut down systems. In addition, the majority of the ammonia is maintained inside the engine room and just outside of the engine room (Condenser and High Pressure).  All pressure vessels are equipped with pressure relief valves that are commonly piped to the water diffusion tanks.\r\n\r\nIn addi"

The PHA Revalidation was comprised of one session that included a discussion of any changes to the ammonia refrigeration system since the previous HAZOP Revalidation study, a detailed review of the recommended action items generated during the 2009 PHA Revalidation study, a discussion of the facility's accident history dating back five years, the completion of checklists, the completion of the HAZOP log tables, and a site inspection walkthrough.  The recommended changes are scheduled to be completed by April 2015.  \r\n\r\nIn addition, the Tropicana safety committee is planning to complete several items over the next year, as a continual effort to provide a safe work environment for their employees.  These changes include the following items:\r\n\r\n1. Continue to train all employees in the facility Safety Plan/Programs.\r\n\r\n2. Continue to have employee involvement in Safety Plan Development.\r\n\r\n3. Continue employee involvement through safety team participation.\r\n\r\n4. Continue internal and external safety audits/inspections and implement changes as needed."
