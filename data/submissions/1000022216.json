Additionally, under the Emergency Planning and Community Right-To-Know Act (Section 302) Avon Zanesville is required to notify state and local authorities of the hazardous and extremely hazardous substances stored over a threshold quantity.  These material disclosures assist the state and local authorities when developing a chemical emergency preparedness plan and coordinating response capabilities and communication.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nAvon, Zanesville has had no accidental releases of the subject flammable mixture in the past five years.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\nAvon, Zanesville has coordinated with Muskingum County Emergency Management Agency Director and 911 Coordinator, Bo Keck, and the Washington Township Fire Department Chief Gene Hanning.   Mr. Keck and Chief Hanning are very familiar with the site.  Chief Hanning has visited and photographed the location since construction activities were first initiated.  A PowerPoint presentation of the development of the site, its characteristics and features are included in the Washington Township Fire Department's training and the facility is accounted for in the most recent Zanesville Muskingum Area Haz-Mat Plan.  Fire personnel have been trained at the site three (3) times, at the time of the issuance of this plan.  Washington Township Fire Department does have a response plan for the facility, but at this time it is not in written form.  The Washington Township Fire Department is part of the Muskingum County Mutual Aid which is a coordinated effort between multiple Fire Departments in the area.  The Washington Township Fire Department has the most recent building, and fire plans, and completed the 200-foot grid for the fire hoses multiple times.  \n\nChief Hanning and his team are aware of the Aerosol Product Flammable Mixture Storage Area and the possible contents.

The facility's fire detection system is connected to the Muskingum County 911 Emergency Directory, which is housed at the Muskingum County Sheriff's Department to ensure a rapid response to an emergency.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\nPlanned changes to improve safety at the Avon Zanesville facility include, but are not limited to:\n\u00c2\u00bfAvon has install additional ventilation equipment in the Aerosol Product Flammable Mixture Storage Area within the next year.  This additional equipment will help to provide better air flow throughout the Aerosol Product Flammable Mixture Storage Area and prevent elevated ambient temperatures in the area.\n\n\u00c2\u00bfThe Avon Products, Inc. Aerosol Safety Procedure (Handling and Storage of Aerosol Products Bulletin No. E1-15) has been revised by the Area Supervisor as a part of the Branch's Safety Action Plan.  Next steps include but are not limited to: reviewing the procedure with a representative population of Avon associates impacted by these procedures, developing training materials, presenting the revised procedure and training materials to the branch Leadership Tem, and communicating the procedure to the branch Warehouse associates.  The tentative target date for communication and completion of this task is July 2011."

At our Zanesville facility, capital went directly into the design and construction of the facility, which includes the Aerosol Product Flammable Mixture Storage Area.  This area was designed and built with the following attributes:\n\u00c2\u00bfA labyrinth design so that shrapnel could not escape the room should an explosion occur;\n\u00c2\u00bfA two (2) hour rated firewall;\n\u00c2\u00bfAn in-rack sprinkler system, eighteen sprinklers per rack section that, once activated, will release 30 gallons of water per minute;\no\tSprinkler heads protected by a cage against damage;\no\tThe system is triggered at 155 F;\n\u00c2\u00bfAn independent overhead sprinkler system;\no\tThe system is triggered at 165 F;\n\u00c2\u00bfExterior doors that are clearly marked to designate the Aerosol Product Flammable Mixture Storage Area; and\n\u00c2\u00bfA facility-wide fire alarm system.\n\nAvon's commitment to safety continues with our material handling policies.

The site has one (1) covered process, Program Level 1, Aerosol Product Flammable Mixture Storage, that is subject to chemical accident prevention regulations under Section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act and 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) part 68.  The covered process has no public receptors within the distance to the endpoint (0.2 miles or 1,056 feet) from a worst-case release and has had no accidents with specific off-site consequences within the past five years.\nAvon's Global Safety Strategy has six (6) dimensions:\n1.\tIncrease management involvement;\n2.\tStrengthen basic safety;\n3.\tSet goals and measure performance;\n4.\tCommunicate and increase awareness;\n5.\tIncrease safety and health competence; and\n6.\tEstablish global standards.\n\nAssociates responsible for coordinating health and safety management report directly to the facility's Local Crisis Management Team (CMT Leader, Global Security Designee, Human Resources, Legal, Communications, Finance, Facilities, IT, Security, and EHS); the North American Regional Crisis Management Team (SVP & President NA, VP Finance, GVP NA Legal, VP Communications and Events, Executive Director IT, and VP HR NA); and the Global Crisis Management Team (CFO/Chief Strategy Officer, SVP General Counsel, SVP Global Communications, and SVP Human Resources).
