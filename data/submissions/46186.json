      "SummaryText": "\nExecutive Summary for The Dow Chemical Company\n\n    We at The Dow Chemical Company are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated \n\nwith the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\nWe have one regulated substance present at our facility.  This substance is Propylene oxide  [Oxirane, methyl-]. \n\nThe Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\n\nTo evaluate the worst case scenarios, we have used the EPA's OCA Guidance Reference tables or Equations.  For alternative release scenario analyses we have employed PHAST 5.01.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from Marine Terminal.  In this scenario 29507 lb. of Propylene oxide  [Oxirane, methyl-] is released.  The toxic liquid released is assumed to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to evaporate over 3.24 minutes. Passive mitigation systems such as dike(s) are also taken into account to calculate the scenario.  At Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s windspeed, the maximum distance of 2.6 miles is obtained corresponding to\n\na toxic endpoint of 0.59 mg/L.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for Propylene oxide  [Oxirane, methyl-] involves a release from Marine Terminal.  The scenario involves the release of 14040lb. of Propylene oxide.  Toxic liquid is assumed to be released to\n\nform a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to "

The release is also assumed to be\n\ncontrolled by Operator intervention.  This active mitigation will have the effect of limiting the amount released.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.59 mg/L of Propylene oxide  [Oxirane, methyl-] is 0.02 mi\n\nThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with API-620, 41 Ill Adm Code Part 120.    The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nDow Chemical Company maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses is Dow Fire & Explosion Index, Dow Chemical Exposure Index and a Reactive Chemicals/Process Hazard Analysis.\n\nThe studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.  The most recent PH\n\nupdate was performed on 06/11/2002.\n\nOperating Procedures \n\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, The Dow Chemical Company maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary"

The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operator\n\ninvolved in the processes.\n\nTraining\n\nThe Dow Chemical Company has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Refresher training\n\nis provided at least every three years and more frequently as needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nThe Dow Chemical Company carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nManagement of Change\n\nWritten procedures are in place at The Dow Chemical Company to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures.  The most recent review/revision of maintenance procedures was performed on 09/19/2002.  Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification.\n\nPre-startup Reviews\n\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at The Dow Chemical Company.  The most recent review was performed on 09/11/2002.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipme"

The most recent comliance audit was conducted on \n\n04/18/2002.  These audits are carried out at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nThe Dow Chemical Company promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nThe Dow Chemical Company truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.  Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  In addition, our employees have access to all information created as part of the facilitys implementation of the RMP rule, including information resulting from process hazard anayses in particular.\n\nContractors\n\nOn occasion, our company hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities.  Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is carried out.  The Dow Chemical Company has a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related the contractors work and the processes.  Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of regulated substance occur.\n\nFive-year Accident History\n\nThe Dow Chemical Company has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last 5 years.
