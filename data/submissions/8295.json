As part of this commitment, IP Moss Point has established a system to help ensure safe operations of the processes at the mill.  One component of this system is a risk management program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at Moss Point and that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) regulation 40 CFR part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule).   \n\nOne of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit a risk management plan (RMPlan) describing the risk management program at Moss Point.  This document is intended to satisfy the RMPlan requirements of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program at Moss Point.\n\nThe risk management program at IP Moss Point consists of three elements:\n\n     1.  Detailed hazard assessments performed to help understand the potential for both on-site and off-site consequences of hypothetical accidental releases of regulated substances\n\n     2.  Prevention program established to help maintain and safely operate the processes containing more than a threshold quantity of a regulated substance \n\n     3.  Emergency response program implemented to help respond to accidental releases of regulated substances from a covered process.\n\nInformation further describing these elements is provided in this RMPlan.\n\nAlthough the risk management program at IP Moss Point helps provide assurance that the mill is maintained and operated in a safe manner, it is only one component of the safety program at IP Moss Point.  In fact, IP Moss Point has a comprehensive safety program in place establishing many levels of safeguards against release of a hazardous substance and injuries and damage from a release of a hazardous substance.\n\nBefore using a hazardous substanc"

When a hazardous substance is used at IP Moss Point, the mill considers the potential for this substance to adversely effect mill workers, the public, and the environment and takes steps to prevent any such effects.

Industry, company and government standards are closely adhered to in the design, construction, and operation of the equipment.\n\nIP Moss Point trains workers to respond to an accidental release, reducing the consequences of a release if it occurs.  In addition. IP Moss Point works with the local fire department and with the local emergency planning committee (LEPC) to help ensure that injuries and/or environmental damage will not occur if a release does occur.\n\nThe safety and environmental programs at IP Moss Point consist of a number of elements, only some of which are required by the RMP rule.

Chlorine Dioxide (ClO2), which is manufactured on-site and is used as a bleaching agent for pulp, is the only substance regulated by the RMP rule that is present onsite above the EPA threshold quantity.  \n\n     Process: Chlorine dioxide generation and storage\n     Program Level: 3\n     Regulated Substance: Chlorine dioxide\n     Process Quantity: 38,305 pounds (total for two tanks)\n\nThe chlorine dioxide generation and storage system was built in 1989.  The bleach plant at the mill operates an R8 reactor to generate chlorine dioxide aqueous solution (ClO2) for the bleaching process.  The generated aqueous chlorine dioxide solution is pumped to two large outdoor tanks for storage and process and used at a maximum concentration of 1.2 percent.  Each tank has a maximum storage capacity of 183,600 gallons of aqueous solution (19,200 lbs CLO2). The chlorine dioxide system is a Program 3 process for RMP rule compliance purposes. \n\n1.3  Off-site Consequences Analysis\n\nIP Moss Point performed an off-site consequence analysis to estimate the potential for an accidental release of a regulated substance to affect the public or environment.

An alternative release scenario represents a release that (1) is more creditable than the worse case release scenario and (2) would result in the potential for an off-site consequences if the release occurred.\n\nThe main objective of performing the off-site consequences analysis is to determine the distance at which certain effects might occur to the public because of an accidental release (called the endpoint).  The following effects could occur at the end point distance.  At distances less than the endpoint distance, the effects would be greater; at distances greater than the endpoint distance, the effects would be less.\n\nWhen considering the release of a toxic substance such as chlorine dioxide, most people at the endpoint distance would be able to walk away from the exposure without any long-term health consequences, although some short-term consequences (e.g., strong eye or throat irritation) could occur.   \n\nThe RMP rule requires that IP Moss Point report the worst-case and alternative release scenario information for its only regulated substance, chlorine dioxide. \n\nThe following information summarizes the off-site consequence analysis performed for IP Moss Point by Hung-Ming (Sue) Sung, Ph.D., P.E., Senior Technical Associate for Trinity Consultants.

Several public and environmental receptors are also located within this endpoint distance from the chlorine dioxide storage tanks (e.g.; schools, residences, hospitals, prisons/correctional facilities, recreational areas, commercial, office, and industrial areas, and officially designated wildlife sanctuaries/refuges).  The details of this release scenario have been shared with the Jackson County LEPC.\n\n1.3.2 Program 3 Process Toxic Substance; Chlorine Dioxide Alternative Release Scenario\n\nThe alternative release scenario for chlorine dioxide is rupture of the chlorine dioxide solution (1.2%) main transfer line from the storage tank outside of the containment area.  This scenario assumes that the solution is released through either the ruptured transfer line or an associated failed gasket for 10 minutes before workers detect the release and isolate the line.  \n\nThe released chlorine dioxide solution forms a pool and the chlorine dioxide evaporates from the pool, forming a vapor cloud.

The PHA team prepared a written report describing the results of the analysis, including a list of recommendations for management to consider.  Responsibility to resolve the recommendations were assigned to unit personnel and where appropriate, changes to enhance the safety of the process were implemented.  In December of 1998, IP Moss Point provided training for key personnel in PHA techniques and methodologies, including PHA revalidation process.  The chlorine dioxide PHA HAZOP was revalidated in April of 1999.\n\n1.4.1.3.

The following describe some of these safety features for chlorine dioxide.\n\nChlorine Dioxide is produced at the IP Moss Point mill and stored as a dilute aqueous solution to avoid the necessity of transporting large quantities of the solution.  Chlorine Dioxide is produced in the chlorine dioxide generator (R-8 plant) and piped to an absorber column, where a 1.2% (max.) chlorine dioxide solution is generated.  Storing this substance as a solution helps to reduce the consequences of a release.  A containment area around the storage tanks helps reduce the consequences of a release.  The dike area is piped to the mill's waste water treatment facility and all spills in the diked area would be immediately treated in the waste water system.
