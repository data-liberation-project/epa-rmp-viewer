Fertilizer Service are committed to the preventionof any accidental reeases of anhydrous ammonia by utilization ofproper equipment,regular inspections, maintainance  and training of all persons that work with the material. Should and accidental release occur,the facility has orientated the local fire department and the local emergency planning committe so they can plan for response toany release and minimize the impaact of the release to the people and the environment.\n\n2.Facility Information: The primary activity at the facility is the storage of anhydrous ammonia for sale to the farming and agriculture community. Anhydrous ammonia is received,stored,and distributed for direct application as a croop nutrient. The maximum quantily stored would be 140,000 Pounds in the facility one tank.\n\n3. The worst case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of the tank as a gas over 10 minutes. The maximum quantity release would be 140,000 pounds,which represents the volume of the storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards and commmpany procedured. The distance to the endpoint of dispersion based on the model used is 1.1 miles\n\n4. The accidental release program: The facility complies with rules and regulations relating to the Handling of Anh;ydrous Ammonia and Low Pressure Nitrogen Solutions,Equipment, Containers and Storage Facilities. These regulations administered by the Illinois Department of Agriculture and consistant with ANSI K61.1and OSHA 29 CFR1910.111 regarding storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia\n\n5. The Five Year Accident History: There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia for the covered process in the past five years that have caused any death,injuries,or significant property damage on site;nor our knowledge,have and accidental releases resulted in offsite deaths,injuries,evacuations,sheltering in place, property or environmenta"
