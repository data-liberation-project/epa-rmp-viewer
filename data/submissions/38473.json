(PDSI) is provided with a General Safety and Environmental Handbook.  In the handbook, the corporate (Phelps Dodge Corporation) and site-specific (Phelps Dodge Sierrita, Inc.) Safety and Health policies are presented.  \n\nPDSI has an excellent record for safety and lost-time accidents.  In 1993, 1997, 1999, and 2001, PDSI received the most prestigious award in the mining industry, the Sentinels of Safety Award. The Sentinels of Safety Award is cosponsored by the American Mining Congress (AMC) and the U.S. Department of Labor's Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) for recognition of achieving one of the best records for number of employee work-hours without a lost-time injury or fatality.\n\nYOUR FACILITY AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED.\n\nPDSI operates a copper and molybdenum mining and concentrating facility located approximately seven miles west of Green Valley, Arizona.  Ore containing low-grade porphyry copper and molybdenum deposits, is excavated, crushed, conveyed, milled and concentrated to produce a separable copper and molybdenum concentrate slurry. A final flotation and conditioning process is used to separate the copper minerals. The copper sulfide product is filtered and shipped to a smelter by either truck or rail for further processing.  The molybdenum sulfide concentrate is filtered to produce a damp cake, which is dried and stored for further processing.  \n\nThe final molybdenum sulfide concentrate still contains a small percentage of copper, which cannot be effectively removed using the final flotation process.  The copper content in the molybdenum concentrate can be significantly lowered using a ferric chloride leach process.  A hot ferric chloride solution is agitated in a series of mixing tanks with the moly concentrate.  The slurry exiting the last tank is a high-grade molybdenum sulfide concentrate.  The copp"

One 90-ton railroad tank car of chlorine is connected to each of the two 7,000 gallon chlorination tanks.  Typically, three back-up chlorine railcars are stored near the chlorinator area at the west-end of the rail line and/or by the copper concentrate storage area near the mill maintenance shop. The maximum number of railcars anticipated on site at any one time would be seven. Each chlorine railcar provides approximately a seven-day supply of chlorine for the chlorination process.\n\nThe separated molybdenum sulfide is roasted to yield a molybdenum trioxide, which is packaged for distribution.\n\nTHE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS.\n\nPDSI is regulated by the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA).  Every six months, MSHA performs a comprehensive inspection of PDSI's facility for compliance with the Federal Metal and Nonmetallic Mine Safety and Health Standards listed in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), 30 CFR, Parts 1 to 199.  The role of MSHA is to enforce compliance with 30 CFR, Parts 1 to 99 as a means to eliminate fatal accidents; to reduce the frequency and severity of nonfatal accidents; to minimize health hazards; and to promote improved safety and health conditions in the Nation's mines.  All PDSI employees and contractors are reqired to receive MSHA refresher training on an annual basis.\n\nSeveral mitigation devices are located in the chlorination area to prevent a chlorine release from occurring. Six chlorine sensors are located around the perimeter of the chlorinator area for identifying the presence of chlorine. The sensors are capable of detecting chlorine in concentrations equal to or greater than 1 ppm.  If a release is sensed, the latching relays are de-energized and"

      "SummaryText": " the two valves from the railcar and the automatic addition valve close.  The valves are set up to fail in a closed position in the event of a power or air supply loss.  In addition, all of the railcars supplied by Pioneer Chlor Alkali, PDSI's chlorine supplier, are equipped with check valves, which cut off the chlorine supply if the flowrate were to increase rapidly. PDSI maintains a chlorine remote video monitoring system in the Moly Control Room.  The system allows the operator(s) to monitor the loading and unloading of chlorine railcars.  If an incident involving chlorine were to occur during the unloading process, the operator could quickly cease the chlorine supply from the control room.\n\nIn addition to the mitigation devices described above, a main chlorine shut-off device can be triggered to cease chlorine supply by manually hitting a \"red button\" located in the Moly Control Room.\n \nThe chlorination process is also equipped with an absorption system to prevent over-chlorination of the process, which may result in a chlorine release. The absorption system consists of a 265-gallon tank containing an 25% caustic soda solution.  Chlorine in excess of the process required amount is vented to the chlorination tank, where it is neutralized.  The tank is emptied twice daily (once per shift) and recharged by the Moly Operations Crew.  \n\nPDSI conducts a hazard review in order to identify hazards associated with the process and chlorine, opportunities for equipment malfunctions or human errors that could cause an accidental release, the safeguards used or needed to control the hazards or prevent equipment malfunction or human error, and any steps used or needed to detect or monitor releases.                        \n\nPDSI prepares written operating procedures, also known as \"Tasks\", in accordance with International Standards Organization (ISO) 9000 standards. The procedures are written to provide clear instruction or steps for safely conducting activities associated wit"

The inspections are used to monitor any signs of tank deterioration, leaking and corrosion of tanks, valves and all associated piping.  \n\nEvery three years, PDSI preforms a compliance audit to assess compliance with the Risk Management Program.  The compliance audit team consists of personnel knowledgeable in the chlorinator process and Program requirements. The team may include personnel from the Moly Department, Health & Safety, Environmental Departments, and an outside consultant.\n\nTHE FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nPDSI has had no chlorine releases in the past five years requiring medical treatment other than minor first aid. As a safety precaution, PDSI requires first aid for any and all types of chlorine releases, regardless of the extent of the release.  There have been no reportable releases and no environmental impacts from chlorine releases.\n\nTHE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM.\n\nPDSI developed a detailed Chlorine Emergency Response (ER) Plan which addresses general and chemical specific emergency response procedures.  PDSI offers the ER Plan to the Pima County Sherriff's Department, Pima County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC), Rural/Metro Fire Department, Green Valley Fire District, Arizona Emergency Response Commission (AZERC), and St. Mary's Hospital for local emergency response coordination.\n\nIn the event of a chlorine release, an audible alarm will sound in various facilities at the site.  Evacuation routes have been developed and are posted throughout the Moly area as well as the entire Plant site.

Installing a closure device for the automatic rail car shutoff valve if the safety valve fails when connecting or disconnecting a rail car to or from the chlorine system. \n2.  Ensuring the most current version of the system diagram is included in the SOPs.\n3.  Evaluating the need for annual replacement of the nitrogen tubing in the nitrogen padding line.\n4.  Evaluating alternate control valves that are less prone to plugging in the flex line to eductor.\n5.  Evaluating installation of transmitters for distributive control system if a pressure gauge fails in the flex line to eductor.\n6.  Evaluating installation of interlock system and/or manual valve before air operated valve if the caustic tank valve is opened while the chlorine system is in service."
