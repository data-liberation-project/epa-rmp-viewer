Equipment integrity is maintained by following proper design, fabrication, and installation, and maintenance practices and design codes.  Solid, well written operating procedures and training programs for personnel in the facility are used to prevent process upsets and equipment damage.   Continuous monitoring of the facility's processes is accomplished by both process operators and computer control to operate within equipment and process limitation.  Advisory alarms and emergency shutdown systems are designed and tested to automatically limit the potential for a release.  Incident investigations are used to learn the cause of both near misses and incidents so those corrective action steps may be implemented to prevent the future incidents.\n\nFollowing is a partial listing of chemical specific programs in the facility to prevent releases.   The use of portable ammonia specific detection equipment to detect and repair minor leaks in the facility.   Fixed ammonia detection in the ammonia storage process. Continuous monitoring of propane rail car and truck unloading and ammonia rail car unloading by video camera and personnel.  Remote operated  emergency shut-off  to limit releases from ruptured offloading hoses. Chlorine release detectors at chlorine storage cylinder.  Chlorinators for delivery of chlorine to cooling water system, which automatically stop the flow of chlorine in the event of a break in the delivery tubing.\n\nFive-year Accident History\n\nDNI experienced one accident which meet the criteria for RMP reporting. The accident involved an employee exposure to ammonia which resulted in a OSHA Recordable incident.\n \nEmergency Response Program\n\nDNI maintains a written emergency response program with proced"

The facility has actively implemented the Nevada Division of Environmental Protection for the Assessment of Risk Through the Analysis of Hazards (ARTAH) for the processes.  This program incorporates all of the elements of the OSHA Process Safety Management System to review the safety of processes that could pose a hazard to employees and the public.  These Process Safety Management policies for the facility define the manner in which the processes are maintained and inspected, operated, and modified.  The PSM policies also define the manner in which the processes are evaluated for safe operation and the training of the personnel employed to operate and maintain the facility.  Safe Work Procedures are in place for hot work, lock-out/tagout, line break, and hot tap work to prevent accidental releases and maintain the integrity of the equipment.\n\nIn the event that an accidental release were to occur, DNI has established an Emergency Response Plan which is used to guide the response.  The facility has a well-trained emergency services team comprised of fire fighters, medical personnel, hazardous materials technicians, and rescue personnel.   DNI is a member of the Lander County Local Emergency Planning Committee.  The facility personnel have participated in training with the local emergency responders through table top exercises and response drills.\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nDNI produces industrial chemicals and fertilizer products.
