      "SummaryText": "The Farmers Coop Elevator (Anness) is an agricultural retail business which serves crop producers in the area.  This facility adheres to all local state and federal rules and regulations.\n\nIn the event of an emergency, the Sedgwick County Fire Department will be our first responder.  They are notified annually through our Tier Two submissions, as part of the Community-right to-Know regulations.\n\nThe Anhydrous Ammonia plant consists of 3- 12,000 gallon tanks for a total of 157,284#.  The bulk of our business is selling fertilizer to our crop producers who raise wheat, milo and beans.  There can also be up to 30 - 1,000 gallon nurse tanks that can hold up to 131,070# when filled to 85%.  This leaves a total of 288,354 pounds.\n\nThe worst case scenario and alternative scenario have been removed at the request of the EPA.  This is due to security issues as dictated in the Homeland Security Act.  All relevant material shall be sent to the local first responders for their consideration.\n\nOur employees are trained on a rotational 2-year basis where they attend a state sponsored anhydrous ammonia school.  The receive classroom training as well as a written test.  \n\nOur facility is maintained in accordance with the Kansas Department of Agriculture requirements. We realize that the Kansas Department of Agriculture has not adopted the most recent ANSI standards.  When the KDA does adopt the most recent standards our company will budget the needed time and money to insure that all facilities are up to code.  \n\nOur Emergency Action Plan is shared with the County Fire Department. By definition we do not have an Emergency Response Plan because we require all employees to evacuate the area and call 911 immediately in the event of an accident or release of NH3.\n\nThe Farmers Coop Elevator Company has not experienced an injury or a reportable release in the last five years.\n\nThere are no are no known repairs or upgrades needed or required at this time."
