The Sanitary District of Michigan City (SDMC) maintains quantities of chlorine and sulfur dioxide above the RMP threshold quantity of 2,500 and 5,000 pounds, respectively, and as such, is subject to the requirements of 40 CFR Part 68. A hazard review was completed to determine that RMP program level 3 is applicable to SDMC's chlorine and sulfur dioxide systems. \n\n\n\nThe information presented in this section is intended to describe the elements of SDMC's Risk Management Program. The format of the section corresponds to the executive summary data elements as dictated in 40 CFR Part 68 Executive Summary Section. \n\n\n\nExecutive Summary Data Elements\n\n\n\nAccording to EPA guidance the executive summary must include a brief description of the facility's Risk Management Program. The following sections list each of the required executive summary data elements by rule citation. \n\n\n\n68.155(a) Accidental Release and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe Sanitary District of Michigan City Wastewater Treatment Plant (SDMC's WWTP) has operated their chlorination and sulfur dioxide systems without incident since starting operations. This successful operating record is due to the WWTP's commitment to training programs, operating procedures, and maintenance activities. \n\n\n\n68.155(b) Stationary Source and the Substance Handled\n\nThe Sanitary District of Michigan City WWTP operates a 15-MGD municipal wastewater treatment plant in the City of Michigan City. Chlorine is used at the treatment facility as the disinfectant for the discharge water. Sulfur dioxide is used at the treatment facility to remove chlorine prior to final discharge.\n\n\n\nChlorine for the chlorination "

To ensure a common basis for comparisons, EPA defined the worst-case scenario as the release of the largest quantity of a regulated substance from a single vessel or process line that results in the greatest distance to an endpoint. The alternative release rate is a release that is considered more reasonable or \"more likely.\" \n\n\n\nThe toxic endpoint for chlorine has been defined by EPA to be 0.0087 mg/L (3 ppm)and sulfur dioxide to be 0.0078 mg/L (3 ppm). This airborne concentration that is used as the toxic endpoint is the maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals can be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other s"

Residential population within the circle is required to be determined based on available census information. The population number is reported as part of the EPA submittal. This method greatly over estimates the population potentially exposed to a single chlorine or sulfur dioxide release, because the chlorine and/or sulfur dioxide plume would seek lowest elevations in the direction of the prominent winds. Since wind direction cannot be anticipated for an accidental release, EPA mandated the circle estimation method.\n\n\n\nRelease scenarios and distances to toxic endpoints are discussed in more detail in the subsequent paragraphs.\n\n\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario is determined in accordance with the req\n\nuirements provided in 40 CFR 88.22 and 40 CFR 68.25(b,c). \n\n\n\nAs described in USEPA 40 CFR Part 68.25(b) the worst-case release shall be the greater of the following:\n\n\n\n1.
