The process is used to manufacture products that may be sold to customers, such as fabric softners and ag chemical emulisifiers.  Ethylene Oxide is classified as a toxic gas in the RMP Rule.\n\nPropylene Oxide (PO) is delivered by rail car, stored on site, and used in the alkoxylation process. The process is used to manufacture products that may be sold to customers, such as fabric softners and ag chemical emulisifiers.Propylene Oxide is classified as a toxic liquid in the RMP Rule.\n\n1.3 Offsite Consequence Analysis\n\nStepan Company\u00bfs Winder Plant performed an Offsite Consequence Analysis (OCA) to estimate the potential for an accidental release of the regulated substances and its effect on the public and environment.  The OCA consists of both Worse Case Scenarios (WCS) and Alternative Release Scenarios (ARS).  An ARS represents a release that might occur during the lifetime of a facility.  Both WCS\u00bfs and ARS\u00bfs help the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) improve the community emergency response plan.  The scenarios also assist the Winder Plant for emergency response pre-planning by identifying potentially impacted off-site areas.  The WCS and ARS are completed as defined in the RMP rule.\n\nThe main objective of performing the OCA is to determine the distance at which certain effects might occur off-site because of an accidental release.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nStepan Company is committed to operating in a manner that is safe for Stepan Company\u00bfs employees, the public, and the environment.  As part of this commitment, Stepan Company has established operations and management systems to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility.  One part of this system is a risk management program (RMP) that helps manage chemical risk at the Stepan Company\u00bfs Winder facility and complies with the Environmental Protection Agency\u00bfs (EPA) regulation 40 CFR part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Program Rule (RMP Rule).  One of the requirements associated with the RMP Rule is to submit a Risk Management Plan (RMPlan) describing the risk management program at Stepan Company\u00bfs Winder Plant.  This 2004 revised RMP is intended to satisfy the RMPlan requirements associated with the RMP Rule and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program at Stepan Company\u00bfs Winder Plant.  \n\n1.1 Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nStepan Company is committed to the safety of Stepan Company employees, public, and preservation of the environment, through the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances.  Stepan Company implements controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous substances.  In the event of a chemical release, trained personnel will respond to control and contain such releases.  Stepan Company evaluates each situation, evacuates employees as necessary, and contacts the local fire department to control and contain the release to prevent and/or reduce the consequences of the release.  The Winder Plant will also contact the Barrow County Emergency Management Agency (EMA) and LEPC to assist with emergency management.  \n\nThe Winder facility conducts training and practice exercises on a regular basis to assure effectiveness in emergency response."

Endpoints have been defined for toxic and flammable substances and defined by the EPA lookup tables.  \n\nThe toxic endpoints are defined as concentrations in the RMP Rule.  The concentrations vary among the covered substances based on potential health effects upon exposure.  The endpoints have been defined in a manner that minimizes the potential for long term health effects if exposure to the concentration occurs.\n\nThe distances to endpoints are estimates using EPA\u00bfs RMP*Comp Ver. 1.07.\n\nThe RMP Rule requires regulated facilities to estimate the population within a radius defined by the distance to endpoint from the release source.  The populations within the circles associated with WCS and ARS have been estimated using 2000 census data and the Landview 6 software.  \n\n1.4 Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at Stepan Company\u00bfs Winder Plant.  The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) RMP regulation and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation regulate processes at Stepan Company\u00bfs Winder facility.  The following summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\nManagement System\n\nThe overall RMP program is managed by the Environmental/Health/Safety (EHS) Manager.  Delineation of specific management responsibilities for each element of the RMP plan is noted in Winder\u00bfs Integrated Process Safety Management (PSM) and Risk Management Plan (RMP) section 4.0. \n\nThe EHS Manager at the Winder Facility is responsible for assuring that the necessary process risk program elements are performed and that the documentation supporting the elements are in place. \n\nEmployee Participation\n\nStepan Company\u00bfs Winder Plant encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accide"
