      "SummaryText": "l.  The Ritzville Terminal receives anhydrous ammonia by rail, then distributes it into rail cars and tank trucks.  Ammonia solutions are blended on site and shipped by truck.  The Terminal stores anhydrous ammonia in one refrigerated above-ground tank, in addition to two pressurized storage tanks known as bullets.  Ammonia solutions are also stored in above-ground tanks.  An extensive EHS program assures compliance with applicable local, state and federal rules and regulations.\n\nCF Industries' anhydrous ammonia is used primarily as a fertilizer.  Ammonia is a source of nitrogen that is essential for plant growth.  It is classified by the Department of Transportation as a non-flammable, compressed gas.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nCF Industries' Layers of Protection\nCF Industries has implemented a comprehensive program at its distribution facilities designed to safeguard the environment, its workers and the surrounding communities.  The  layers of protection are the numerous prevention mechanisms implemented at the Company's fertilizer storage facilities to help manage the risks inherent in handling anhydrous ammonia.  The key safety features are listed below.\n\n?  The facility conducts comprehensive reviews to insure that hazards associated with CF Industries' processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  These reviews are conducted in accordance with the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration's Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard.  One of these reviews is a Process Hazards Analysis (PHA) which is designed to identify all failure scenarios that could lead to a significant exposure of ammonia to workers, the public, or the environment.  The review is undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and is revalidated every five years.\n?  Critical operating conditions at the Ritzville Terminal are monitored through two independent sets of instrumentation.  Pressu"

A flare helps control tank pressure by burning ammonia vapor before it can be released to the atmosphere.  This is performed when the ammonia compressors are unable to maintain the tank pressure.\n?  The ammonia tank system is protected by pressure/vacuum relief valves and compressors which operate automatically.\n?  Emergency shutdown buttons are located throughout the facility.  These buttons can be used by anyone to shutdown the product flows in the event of an emergency.\n?  CF Industries has instituted a comprehensive tank inspection program that requires every tank be inspected at twenty year intervals.  Tanks are emptied and subjected to a series of tests.  This program is designed to identify and correct any tank problems.  A tank outage typically lasts three months and costs the Company $300,000.  Although an inspection is costly in terms of money and distribution logistics, CF Industries believes the safety benefits far outweigh the costs.\n?  Through CF Industries' PSM program, all covered equipment used at the facility undergoes routine performance tests and maintenance.  This PSM program forms the foundation for the RMP prevention program.\n?  The Ritzville Terminal is staffed around-the-clock.  Thus, operating temperatures and pressures, and other parameters, are monitored 24 hours a day.  Such monitoring allows Terminal personnel to quickly respond to operational problems in their early stage; thereby preventing releases of ammonia to the environment.\n?  Every truck which enters or leaves the facility with anhydrous ammonia is inspected by facility personnel.  Each truck is checked for leaks, and surveillance cameras provide operating personnel additional views of truck loading conditions.  Any truck that fails the inspection is not permitted to remove anhydrous ammonia from the facility.\n?  Another essential element of our Layers of Protection is employee training and con"

They also receive documented training covering 49 specific topics.\n?  The Ritzville facility maintains industrial hygiene and medical programs that meet or exceed standards of good professional practice.\n?  CF Industries also works extensively with the local emergency  and fire responders through simulation training and drills.  The Company believes it is important that first responders are prepared to deal with any emergency on site.\n?  CF Industries routinely carries out highly documented maintenance checks on its process equipment to ensure proper functions.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.\n?  CF Industries maintains and enforces formal procedures and policies on environmental protection, safety awareness, facility design and operation, and contractor compliance that, in many cases, go beyond legal and regulatory requirements.  The Company's internal EHS audit program is designed to make the Ritzville Terminal the best in the industry.  In addition, the Terminal maintains written operating procedures which describe what tasks a process operator must perform, define safe operating parameters that must be maintained, and set safety precautions for operations and maintenance activities.  Each facility is assessed for compliance with federal, state and local regulations every year.\n\nEmergency Response Program\nCF Industries has developed Emergency Manuals for all of its distribution facilities, including the Ritzville Terminal.  Copies of the Ritzville Emergency Manual are kept at the facility and the Company's corporate headquarters.  Copies are sent to the Local Emergency Planning Committee, the State Emergency Response Commission, and the Ritzville Fire Department.  The Manual in"

The Manual is reviewed annually with the first responders.  In addition, CF Industries trains its employees annually on the use of this Manual.\n\nWorst-Case Scenario\nThe worst-case release scenario for the Ritzville Terminal was calculated using the methodology included in the EPA's RMP Off-Site Consequence Guidance.  This methodology was applied to the refrigerated anhydrous ammonia storage tank, an ammonia solutions tank, a pressurized anhydrous ammonia storage tank (bullet), and a pressurized anhydrous ammonia railcar.  Applying the RMP's mandated assumptions, the bullet resulted in the largest downwind impact.  Thus, the worst-case release scenario, which is highly unlikely, involves a complete release of the volume of the bullet to the atmosphere in 10 minutes.  Under the worst-case weather conditions of low wind speed and minimal atmospheric dispersion, off-site impacts will occur.  A USEPA-approved model was used to determine the maximum downwind distance the ammonia release could impact the general public and/or the environment.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario\nIn addition to the worst-case scenario, the RMP rule also requires the submittal of an alternative release scenario, or more realistic release scenario for each regulated toxic pollutant.  For the Ritzville Terminal, the alternative release scenario for anhydrous ammonia involves a release of anhydrous ammonia vapor from a pressure relief valve on the top of the refrigerated anhydrous ammonia storage tank.  The scenario further assumes that the pressure relief valve properly re-seats, as has been shown in prac"

No active mitigation measures were considered in evaluating a release under this scenario.\n\nThe above-described release was chosen because it represents the most common type of release, as determined from an evaluation of all recent releases from CF Industries terminals.  CF Industries believes this release represents the most probable type of release which could occur at the Ritzville Terminal, which has off-site impacts to the general public and/or the environment.  Under average weather conditions of low/moderate wind speed and neutral atmospheric dispersion, the release will cause off-site impacts.  A USEPA-approved model was used to perform the off-site consequence analysis.\n\nThe alternative scenario for ammonia solutions was defined as a truck pull-away from a loading arm.  The flow of ammonia is assumed to be stopped within 2 minutes.  The pooled ammonia solution will vaporize from the operational containment area.  Under average weather conditions of low/moderate wind speed and neutral atmospheric dispersion, the release could cause off-site impacts to the public and/or the environment.  A USEPA-approved model was used to perform the off-site consequence analysis.\n\nThe Five-Year Accident History \nThere has never been a catastrophic failure of a refrigerated storage tank at any of the 21 CF Industries-owned ammonia storage and distribution facilities.  Additionally, CF Industries' Ritzville Terminal has had no releases in the last five years that resulted in any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on-site, or known off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\nCF Industries will continue to coordinate information and training with emergency responders.  This information-sharing will occur during face-to-face discussions and emergency response drills.\n\nCF Industries will continue its long standin"
