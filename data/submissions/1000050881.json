ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\n\n\nHuisken Meats has a comprehensive approach to chemical safety.\n\nOur policies include:\n\nA?A?    Safety team meetings that identify and address concerns in all areas of plant operations including release prevention and emergency response policies.\n\nA?A?    Scheduled reviews of all crisis management plans.\n\nA?A?    Safety reviews are a portion of quarterly Management Review Meetings.\n\nA?A?    Voluntary participation and achievement of certification in MNSHARP program administered by Minnesota Department of Labor and Industry (OSHA).\n\n\n\n\n\n2.    FACILITY INFORMATION AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED \n\n\n\nThe Huisken Meat facility in Sauk Rapids, Minnesota is subject to the US EPAA?A?s Risk Management Program (RMP) for Accidental Chemical Release regulation (40 CFR 68) because it has a refrigeration system that contains more than the threshold quantity (10,000 pounds) of anhydrous ammonia (CAS Number 7664-41-7).  The anhydrous ammonia (ammonia) refrigeration system is used to control the temperature for beef processing and packaging.  The entire system contains approximately 20,000 pounds of ammonia in various physical states (gas, liquid, and saturated vapor).  Most of the ammonia equipment is located indoors.  The condensing towers and some piping are located outdoors.\n\n\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system at the Huisken Meats facility is a two-stage system consisting of a high-pressure side and a low-pressure side.  The low side (i.e., low pressure) is intended to quickly freeze product, while the high side (i.e., high pressure) is intended to refrigerate the product.  Equipment and piping carry the necessary gas, liquid, and saturated vapor throughout the system.\n\n\n\n\n\n3.    ACCIDENTIAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS    \n\n\n\nThe facility has carefully considered the potential for accidental releases of ammonia.

The development of an employee participation program, which includes employees from all areas within the plant.\n\nA?A?    The development, documentation, and operator availability to critical process safety information regarding the hazards of ammonia, the design basis of the system, and the equipment is used to facilitate the full understanding and safe operation of the ammonia refrigeration system.\n\nA?A?    A regular formal process hazard analysis (PHA) on the ammonia refrigeration system using A?A?HAZOPA?A? Protection Analysis procedures.  A team with expertise in engineering, operations, maintenance, and safety evaluated the existing refrigeration system in depth and developed recommendations to improve the safety and operability of the system.  The PHA is updated and revalidated every five years.\n\nA?A?    Standard operating procedures (SOPs) are used to provide the basis for proper and safe operation of the ammonia refrigeration system.  The SOPs include procedures for normal operations, startup, shutdown, emergency operations, and emergency shutdown.  They also describe safe operating limits for temperature and pressure, the consequences of operating outside these safe operating limits, and a description of safety systems and how they operate.\n\nA?A?    Refrigeration system operators receive refresher training at least every three years.  The training content is based on the process safety information and operating procedures.\n\nA?A?

Formal authorization systems (i.e., management of change procedure, pre-startup safety review) are in place to ensure that system changes or expansions are as safe as the original design and that an independent check confirms that changes made are consistent with the engineering design and in a safe operating condition prior to startup.\n\nA?A?
