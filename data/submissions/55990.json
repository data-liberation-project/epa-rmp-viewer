The plant primarily manufactures anhydrous ammonia and urea-ammonium nitrate (UAN) solutions.  As a nitrogen fertilizer-manufacturing complex, this facility is subject to the Environmental Protection Agency?s Risk Management Program rules under the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990.\n\nThe following is the Executive Summary of the Risk Management Plan for the CRNF Plant.\n\nFacility Overview\n\nThe CRNF Plant is a nitrogen fertilizer-manufacturing complex producing anhydrous ammonia and urea-ammonium nitrate (UAN) solutions.  The complex produces for market approximately 670,000 tons of UAN and 145,000 tons of anhydrous ammonia annually for use as agricultural fertilizers.  The design of the facility, which started production in July 2000, incorporates state-of-art safety and environmental controls for the protection of the employees and the surrounding community.  \n\nThe facility consists of an air separation unit, a gasification unit, an ammonia synthesis unit, and an UAN unit.  The air separation unit, while located on the CRNF site, is independently owned and operated by Linde Gases.  The air separation unit makes high purity oxygen and nitrogen for use in the gasification and ammonia production units.  In addition, Linde markets these gases along with argon to off-site customers. \n\nThe gasification unit produces hydrogen gas using the GE Energy Hydrogen Generation Process.  The gasifier produces raw hydrogen and carbon oxides by the partial oxidation of petroleum coke with oxygen in the presence of water.  The petroleum coke is provided primarily by the neighboring Coffeyville Resources Refining and Marketing, LLC (CRRM) refinery and supplemented with coke from other locations.  The "

      "SummaryText": "hydrogen is purified by shift conversion of carbon monoxide to carbon dioxide, the removal of hydrogen sulfide and carbon dioxide, and pressure swing absorption removal of trace contaminants.  \n\nIn the ammonia synthesis unit the hydrogen from the gasification unit reacts with nitrogen from the air separation unit to make anhydrous ammonia.  The ammonia is either sold for direct fertilizer applications or upgraded for UAN solutions.  Ammonia along with by-product carbon dioxide from the gasification unit is used to produce liquid urea in the UAN plant.  In the UAN plant, ammonia and air are also used to produce a weak nitric acid solution that is subsequently neutralized with ammonia to produce ammonium nitrate.  The liquid urea and ammonium nitrate are mixed forming the urea-ammonium nitrate solution product. Ammonia and UAN solutions can be shipped to bulk distributors by both truck and railcar.  On-site storage tanks have been constructed to safely hold the ammonia and UAN products based on seasonal demand requirements.\n\nPollution Prevention Policy\n\nCoffeyville Resources Nitrogen Fertilizers is committed to protecting the environment and preserving our natural resources for future generations by pursuing elimination or reduction of our use of toxic substances and minimizing our use of energy and generation of wastes to the extent technically and economically feasible.  CRNF strives to prevent the generation of pollution at the source, but, where that cannot be achieved, CRNF is committed to environmentally sound methods of recycling, treatment, and disposal.  By preventing pollution at the source, we strive to achieve cost savings, increase operational efficiencies, improve the quality of our products and services, maintain a safe and healthful workplace, and improve the environment.\n\nThe above goals were applied to the design and construction of the Coffeyville Resources Nitrogen Fertilizers Plant.

Substituting coke for natural gas in our process conserves over 10 billion cubic feet of natural gas per year, which can be used for home heating, electrical power generation, or in the production of other materials.  The reliable source of raw material from the adjacent refinery reduces the energy required to transport the coke and allows for the potential return of energy or raw materials to the refinery.\n\nThe environmental design objective for this plant was to achieve significant emission reduction compared to the conventional nitrogen plant.  No hazardous solids are produced during normal operations.  The water effluent is sufficiently clean to enter the Coffeyville's municipal water treatment system.  \n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nThe gasification unit, ammonia synthesis unit, and the UAN solution unit, along with the associated product ammonia storage and handling areas, and water treatment constitute the processes covered by the EPA Risk Management Program rule.  Regulated substances include the primary product of the plant, anhydrous ammonia, which is also the main feed stock for urea-ammonium nitrate production.  In addition, flammable substances as a class, such as hydrogen produced by coke gasification, are regulated under Risk Management.  Finally, chlorine is also present in regulated threshold quantities on the site.  It is used as a biological control agent in the cooling water systems associated with the production units.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policy\n\nThe management and employees of this facility are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases.  It is this facility?s policy to eliminate significant accidental releases of any substance, in particular hazardous and regulated substances, as well as strive to eliminate to the extent possible even "
