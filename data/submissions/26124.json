Facility accidental release and emergency response policy.\n\nThe management and employees of New Horizon FS, Inc. are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release\nshould occur, the facility is prepared to work with the  Prairieburg  Fire Department,    \n Linn Co.  Local Emergency Planning Committee or other authorities, to mitigate any\nRelease and minimize the impact of the release to people and environment.\n\n2.      The stationary source and the regulated substance handled.\n\nThe primary activity at the facility, which is located at, Prairieburg is the storage\nhnd blending of fertilizer for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored,\nAnd distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient.  The storage and \nhandling system consists of   18,000    gallon storage tanks, loading risers\nassociated plumbing and nurse tanks.  Access to the site is restricted to authorized \nfacility employees, authorized management personnel and authorized contractors. \n\nThe maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia that can be stored would be  133,000                \npounds, this includes the amount of anhydrous ammonia that could be stored in nurse tanks.\n\n3.      The worst-case scenario and the alternative release scenario.\n\nThe worst-case release would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 84,000           \npounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank as limited by design standards.\n\nThe distance of the endpoint of .14mg/L for the worst-case scenario is   1.9 miles.\n\nThe alternative release scenario based on the most likely potential incident is a release \nfrom a break in a transfer hose.  Emergency shutdown procedures, which include the \nclosing of tank valves if possible, otherwise excess flow valves was the only active mitigation considered to limit the amount"

This release has the possibility of extending beyond the facility boundary.\n\n4.      The accidental release prevention program.\n\nThis facility complies with EPA?s Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations.  This facility has implemented the provisions of ?Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1?, published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc. as adopted by state regulation and the standards of the U. S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR1910.111.  ?Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia?.  Compliance with these regulations and on-going training of our employees make up our accident release prevention program.\n\n5.      Historical information on this facility.\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past fine years , that to our knowledge have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, shelter in place, or environmental damage.\n\n6.      The emergency response program.\n\nThis facility has:\n\n-A written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard,\n 29 CFR 1910.38:\n\n-provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).\n             \n          In the event of an emergency involving anhydrous ammonia, it is our policy to notify\n          Priarieburg   Fire Department and    Linn County   LEPC and request that       \n          they respond to the emergency.  Our emergency action plans have been coordinated                 \n           with both  the fire department and LEPC"
