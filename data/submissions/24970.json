      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY (40 CFR 68.155)\n\nBackground Data\n\nIn accordance with Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations Chapter 68 (40 CFR 68) promulgated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Ingles Markets, Inc. (Ingles) has prepared this Risk Management Plan (RMP) for operations at their Black Mountain, North Carolina facility.  Ingles distribution operations include the receiving and shipping of both perishable and dry goods grocery products.  Ingles has been in operation at this facility for over 24 years and provides over 700 jobs to the local community and nearly 12,000 company wide.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policy\n\nIngles is committed to protecting the health of its employees, the surrounding community, and the environment; therefore it is Ingles policy to maintain compliance with 40 CFR 68 as well as Occupational Safety and Health Organization (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations promulgated as Title 29 of the Code of Federal Regulations Chapter 1910, Section 119 (29 CFR 1910.119), and OSHA's Hazardous Operations and Emergency Response regulations (29 CFR 1910.120).\n\nStationary Sources and Regulated Substances\n\nIngles uses anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant to maintain a 90,000 ft2 storage area within the required range of operating temperatures.  Ingles' refrigeration system consisting of a high-pressure receiver, recirculator, compressors, evaporators, condensers, and piping can contain a quantity of anhydrous ammonia in excess of the 10,000 pound threshold given in 40 CFR 68 Appendix A.\n\nWorst Case Release Scenario\n\nAs required by 40 CFR 68 Subpart B, Ingles has evaluated a worst-case release scenario for anhydrous ammonia using the parameters specified by the EPA.  Ingles' worst-case release scenario is the rupture of the largest single tank (high-pressure receiver) over a 10 minute period.  In developing the release parameters of this worst-case scenario, Ingles considered passive mitigation provided by the"

Using the EPA's RMP*Comp program, it was determined that the distance to the toxic endpoint in this worst-case scenario has the potential to result in an offsite release.  The worst-case release scenario was developed following EPA regulations and is not considered to be a likely release scenario.\n\nAlternative Release Scenarios\n\nIngles evaluated several options to be considered as alternative release scenarios.  After careful consideration, Ingles decided to include two alternative release scenarios in their RMP document.  The alternative release scenarios were developed for evaluation because they are expected to be more likely to occur than the worst-case scenario.\n\nThe first alternate release scenario (Alternative Release Scenario 1) identified by Ingles would be the failure of a transfer hose.  In developing the release parameters of Alternative Release Scenario 1, Ingles considered average response time to shut the system down.  The other alternate release scenario (Alternative Release Scenario 2) identified by Ingles would be a ?-inch process piping break.  In developing the release parameters of Alternative Release Scenario 2, Ingles considered average response time to shut the system down and passive mitigation provided by the building structure.  Using EPA's RMP*Comp program and EPA's RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance Document, the distance to the toxic endpoint in either alternative release scenario has the potential to result in offsite consequences.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\nTo prevent and mitigate accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia, Ingles has implemented several precautionary measures.  Ingles has developed and implemented a process safety management (PSM) program.  As such, the anhydrous ammonia system has been evaluated for release potential.  Some of the controls installed to prevent catastrophic releases of ammonia are process equipment (vents, relief valves, check valves and manual shutoffs) and au"

Ingles encourages employee participation in the development of the control measures used at the facility.  Employees have the opportunity to voice opinions, concerns, questions, or ideas during the monthly training sessions or during the quarterly safety meetings.  Conversely, Ingles employees may approach their supervisor directly or place suggestions in the suggestion box for topics that require more immediate attention.\n\nIngles understands that maintaining the refrigeration system in good working order is essential to preventing accidental releases.  The preventive maintenance program is scheduled, documented and managed to ensure that regular maintenance occurs on the system.  Ingles will be using an independent third party to conduct testing (thermographic studies) semi-annually to ensure the mechanical integrity of critical refrigeration system components.\n\nTo confirm that control measures are effective in maintaining safe operation of the plant, regularly scheduled audits are performed on the ammonia refrigeration system.  In accordance with the PSM program, Ingles will conduct compliance audits every three years.  Since the ammonia system was installed in 1995, an audit was completed by Mark Curtis of Ammonia Refrigeration Engineering and Safety during 1999.  The next audit is scheduled for completion during May 2002.  \n\nThe local fire department does not conduct formal audits; however, Ingles occasionally invites the fire department to tour the facility.  In addition, the following agencies audit the Ingles facility on a regular basis:\n\nNorth Carolina Department of Agriculture\nCompany's Insurance Carrier\nDepartment of Labor - OSHA\nFood and Drug Administration\nWe"

Included in the emergency response program are measures to be taken internally by Ingles and procedures to inform local emergency response agencies.\n\nIngles has trained on-site personnel to respond to accidental ammonia releases and other emergencies.  These personnel are trained in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.120, OSHA's Hazardous Operations and Emergency Response regulations according to their duties and function.  Four of these personnel are trained to the level of Incident Commander and three personnel are trained to the technician level.  They will receive annual update training.\n\nTo assure that the local municipal response agencies are familiar with Ingles' emergency response procedures, copies of the emergency response document have been submitted for review and approval by the local agencies.  Buncombe County Emergency Management Committee (EMC) has reviewed Ingles' emergency response procedures.  In the event of an anhydrous ammonia release resulting in offsite consequences, the general public will be notified by the EMC.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nIngles has implemented a continuous training program to improve safety awareness."
