This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of our processes.  Our plant adheres to process safety policies, guidelines, and best practices that have been developed based on company and industry experience over the years.  Our policy is to implement the controls necessary to prevent releases of regulated substances to the environment.  However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain the incident.\n\n\nDESCRIPTION AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe Joliet Plant is located at 23425 Amoco Road in Joliet (Channahon Township), Illinois.  The plant is owned by BP Amoco PLC.  Various chemicals are processed to produce materials for polyester fibers, fiberglass gasoline tanks, paints, wire coatings, plastics, insecticides, and food additives.  The only RMP-regulated substance at the plant in excess of the threshold quantity is butane, which is the primary material used in the Maleic Anhydride (MAN) production process.\n\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENTS\n\nWorst Case Scenarios\n\nThe worst case scenario (WCS) for flammable substances is a vapor cloud explosion (VCE) with an overpressure endpoint of 1 pound per square inch (psi).  The WCS endpoint is based on the instantaneous release of the entire contents (2,635,000 pounds) from our butane sphere resulting in a VCE.  The effects of administrative controls, mitigation systems, and safety systems are not included in determining the effects of a VCE.  Distances to the endpoint were calculated using the methodology outlined in EPAs RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance.  Nearby residences and business"

      "SummaryText": "es could be affected by this type of release.  Specific information on this release is presented in more detail in the plan.\n\nAlternative Release Scenarios\n\nThe alternative release scenario for flammable substances at the plant is a VCE resulting from the release of butane from a pressure relief valve at the top of the butane sphere.  The release is expected to be isolated by process operators within ten minutes.  This release would not reach the plant fenceline. Specific information on this release is presented in more detail in the plan.\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe Joliet Plant has an excellent record of accident prevention over the past five years.  If an incident were to occur, it would be investigated very carefully to determine ways to  prevent a recurrence or a similar incident from occurring.  There have been no accidental releases of butane within the past five years. \n          \n\nPREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention efforts in place at the Joliet Plant.  Because the MAN production process that is regulated by the EPA RMP regulation is also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard, this summary also addresses the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the prevention program.\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nThe Joliet Plant encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation range from compiling and updating technical information to participating as a member of a team that systematically analyzes new and and modified processes for hazards.  Teams that represent a good cross-section of levels and areas of the plant are formed to revise and update safety standards and to investigate accidents and issue reports to all personnel.  Safety focus teams in each area promote individual responsibility for safe work behaviors.  Some individual emp"

These documents describe chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters, chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  Chemical specific information, including exposure hazards and treatments, and emergency response considerations are provided in material safety data sheets which are also located the the control room.  The process operators use modern instrumentation to assist them in controlling the process within the design ranges.\n\nThe plant also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical ratings of equipment, piping and instrument drawings, etc.  This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are properly maintained.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nThe Joliet Plant has a structured program to help ensure that hazards associated with the RMP-regulated process is controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place.\n\nThe Joliet Plant uses the Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  HAZOP analysis is recognized by OSHA as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  The analyses are conducted using a team of p"

All recommendations are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each recommendation is documented and retained.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nThe Joliet Plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, including such activities as unit startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, normal shutdown, and initial startup of a new process.  These procedures are used as a reference by experienced process operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new process operators.  All operating procedures are reviewed annually by each operator.  The procedures are located in the unit control room for ready-reference by process operators.\n\nTraining\n\nIn addition to the written operating procedures, operators receive two other elements of formal training.  Basic operator training is available at the local junior college and consists of the essentials that process operators need to know about process equipment and controls, regardless of their work location.  Basic operating training is completed before an operator starts the training specific to the process unit.  Unit-specific training is self-paced and conducted in the unit with experienced process operators or foremen over a period of several months.  An operator must become qualified on each section of the unit by demonstrating a hands-on mastery of every section task before operating that section independently. \n\nContractors\n\nContractors are utilized at the Joliet Plant for construction and maintance activities.

This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to work starting.  All contractors must complete the Three Rivers Manufacturing Council Safety Course for contractors before being allowed into the plant to work.  They must recertify in this course annually.  In addition, the Joliet Plant evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of the contractor.  Plant personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\nPre-Startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\n\nThe Joliet Plant conducts a PSSR for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, equipment, procedures, and personnel are properly prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready.  The PSSR review team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness.  A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention measures are properly implemented.\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nWell-established practices and procedures are in place to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in safe operating condition.
