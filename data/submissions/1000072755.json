              "Description": "Prevention Program\n\n\n\nAnheuser-Busch has implemented a comprehensive program to prevent accidental releases.  Designed to reduce both the likelihood and severity of releases of ammonia, this program integrates technology, procedures,  management practices, and years of operator experience.  This prevention program ensures that safe design principles and practices are followed for the brewery ammonia system and related projects by properly managing change to the system, as well as ensuring proper operation, maintenance and control of hazards.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\n\n\nThe brewery has compiled information on the hazards of ammonia, the design basis for the refrigeration system and the specific equipment to help identify and understand the inherent hazards of ammonia and help in the safe operation of the system.  This information consists of:\n\n\n\nSafety data sheets (SDSs)\n\nProcess flow diagram\n\nStandard operating procedures (SOPs)\n\nSARA reports\n\nEquipment drawings and specifications\n\nDesign and construction codes and standards compliance\n\nList of process safety relief valves that shows location, design basis and capacity\n\nManufacturer's equipment operating instructions\n\n\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\n\n\nAn initial Process Hazard Analysis was conducted at the brewery in 1993, in the form of a Hazard and Operability study (HAZOP).  Process Hazard Analysis databases show equipment and operations, potential deviations and their causes, consequences and recommended actions that were part of the HAZOP analysis.  Additional Process Hazard Analyses were conducted when triggered by the Management of Change Program.  A subsequent site-wide Process Hazard Analysis using the What-If methodology was conducted in 2015.\n\n\n\nPotential hazards associated with the ammonia system that were evaluated in detail as part of these analyses are listed below.\n\n\n\nabnormal operation\n\naccessibility\n\nimpaired body movement\n\nclarity of instructions\n\nloss of containment\n\ncontamination\n\ncorrosion\n\naccuracy of drawings\n\nhigh/low/no/reverse flow\n\nhigh/low/no level\n\nhigh/low/no pressure\n\nhigh/low temperature\n\ninstrumentation issues\n\nfrequency/lack of information\n\nleakage\n\nequipment failure\n\nmaintenance\n\nlack of/too much/wrong action\n\nrelief valve discharges\n\nutilities failures\n\nvacuum\n\nvisibility\n\nwrong component\n\nwrong sequence\n\nnatural disasters (tornado, hurricane, earthquake)\n\n\n\nA system is in place to address the findings and recommendations resulting from each Process Hazard Analysis.  This system is driven by a risk matrix.  The status of the findings and action items are tracked in the previously mentioned database.\n\n\n\nProcess Controls\n\n\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system has the following process controls:\n\n\n\n-monitoring by Utility operating personnel 24 hours a day, 7 days a week\n\n-relief valves that relieve vessel pressure at a specified setpoint and reseat at pressures below the setpoint.  Many of these valves relieve back into the system, thus preventing a release to atmosphere.\n\n-burst disc indicators on some pressure relief valves that vent to atmosphere.  These burst disc indicators, upon rupture, immediately signal the Utilities central control room.\n\n-check valves that prevent backflow in piping\n\n-a water scrubber that absorbs ammonia prior to venting to atmosphere during system pumpouts\n\n-manual shutoff valves\n\n-interlocks that prevent activation of equipment under certain conditions\n\n-warning alarms and procedures that activate in the event of process upsets\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\n\n\nProper operation of the refrigeration system minimizes the likelihood of errors that could lead to an accidental release of ammonia.  Clearly written, detailed procedures, guidelines, rules, and practices ensure safe operation of the system during all phases of operation, including startup, normal operation, emergency shutdown and emergency operation, normal shutdown, and startup following a shutdown.  Operating procedures provide all employees involved with the operation and maintenance of the ammonia refrigeration system with the written information and precautions necessary to safely perform their tasks in a consistent manner. These procedures are updated when used and all are reviewed in their each year.  As of this RMP update, these procedures were last reviewed in December of 2017.\n\n\n\nOperator Training\n\n\n\nAll employees who operate, maintain and supervise the ammonia refrigeration system are trained and qualified to ensure proper, safe operation .   One of the most important elements of proper operation of the refrigeration system is a knowledgeable, well-trained work force of system operators and maintenance personnel.  Towards that end, initial extensive training on basic refrigeration procedures via a teacher/tape/text/test program was completed in 1995.  Initial training sessions on specific ammonia system standard operating procedures via a teacher/tape/text/test program were completed in 1995. Every new employee receives an updated version of this training.  Additionally, Refresher training is performed every three years.  As of this RMP update, instructor-led Refresher Training is being completed from October through December, 2018.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity \n\n\n\nMECHANICAL INTEGRITY PROCEDURES AND DOCUMENTATION FOR ORIGINAL OR NEW EQUIPMENT, VALVES AND PIPING\n\n\n\nAssuring the mechanical integrity of a new system or new addition to an existing system are engineering and maintenance responsibilities. The following items relate to documented procedures used by Anheuser-Busch engineering and maintenance to assure mechanical integrity:\n\n\n\nEquipment Identification\n\nAll major pieces of equipment are initially assigned an equipment number.  This number also identifies equipment on Anheuser-Busch engineering drawings and in design premise documents for the ammonia refrigeration system hereafter referred to in this document as \"the system\". \n\n\n\nEquipment Design Criteria\n\nA design premise document is prepared for each major piece of equipment that has been assigned an equipment number.  The design premise provides the original design details, governing codes and specifications for the equipment.  A copy of the design premise is normally kept on file with plant engineering.\n\n\n\nEquipment Shop Drawings\n\nOn file with Plant Engineering or Utilities are manufacturer's shop drawings, approved by Anheuser-Busch engineering and filed by equipment number.  These approved drawings offer certification that the equipment item was fabricated in accordance with design specifications.  Details pertinent to the mechanical integrity of the system such as equipment dimensions, mass/energy balance, materials of construction, code requirements, pressure/temperature limits, special construction and installation instructions, etc. are normally noted on these shop drawings.\n\n\n\nOther Related Equipment\n\nOther technical provisions, (TP-60) for piping specifications, (TP-67) for electrical specifications, (TP-68) for instrumentation specifications, and (TP-59) for mechanical equipment installation, are also provided by engineering.  The technical provision documents are for use in purchasing, installing and testing piping systems to assure the mechanical integrity of the system.  Plant Engineering applies the same technical provisions, where applicable, for any system modifications, maintenance and repairs implemented at the plant level.\n\n\n\n\n\nPROCEDURES AND DOCUMENTATION FOR MAINTENANCE OF MECHANICAL INTEGRITY\n\n\n\nThe program for maintaining the mechanical integrity of the system includes the following procedures:\n\n\n\n-training of operators and maintenance personnel in awareness of system deviations that jeopardize the mechanical integrity of the system\n\n-daily inspections and testing of the system by shift operators\n\n-use of computerized programming to issue and document repetitive work orders for routine inspections, testing, and maintenance of major equipment and piping\n\n-use of joint, periodic, inspections by Plant Engineering and insurance underwriter\n\n-implementation of special guidelines for safety valve and control device inspection, testing, and replacement\n\n-a policy on system spare parts and material\n\n\n\nOperator and Maintenance Personnel Training\n\nOne of the most important elements involved in an on-going mechanical integrity program is a knowledgeable, well-trained work force of system operators and maintenance personnel.  Towards that end, extensive training on basic refrigeration procedures via a teacher/tape/text/test program was completed in 1995.  Training sessions on specific ammonia system standard operating procedures via a teacher/tape/text/test program were completed in 1995. Every new employee receives an updated version of this training.  Additionally, Refresher training is performed every three years.  As of this RMP update, instructor-led Refresher Training is being completed from October through December, 2018.\n\n\n\nInspection and Testing of Pressure Relief Valves\n\nPressure relief valves are set up on a computer documented identification, inspection and testing program. This program requires quarterly, annual, and five year inspections and testing.  A documentation review is conducted upon receipt of Pressure Relief Valves serviced by the factory-certified valve rebuilder.  Additionally, an annual site audit of the factory-certified valve rebuilder is conducted to ensure proper methods are being used to service the Pressure Relief Valves.\n\n\n\nSensors, Alarms and Safety Interlocks\n\nThe following devices are identified by an equipment number or listed on the repetitive work order for the major piece of equipment on which they are mounted.  If not covered by a special maintenance program, the following category of equipment or device is to be inspected annually as a minimum, or more frequently as recommended by the manufacturer or as determined by good engineering practices:\n\n\n\ncellar ammonia alarms\n\nsuction traps\n\n- level switches\n\n- alarms\n\n- liquid pumps\n\n-pressure transmitters\n\ncompressor cutouts and alarms\n\n- high discharge pressure\n\n- high discharge temperature\n\n- low suction pressure\n\n- low oil pressure\n\n- high oil temperature\n\n- cooling water flow/ temperature /level switch(s)\n\nevaporator accumulators\n\n- liquid level control\n\n- high refrigerant level switch\n\n\n\nSpare Parts and Materials Policy\n\nSpare parts for system equipment and controls are to be original equipment manufacturer's parts. Any exception must meet industry standards and be approved by plant engineering.  Parts suppliers are to be documented on spare parts order forms.  The purchase and use of other materials such as valves and piping must meet the specifications in the latest corporate engineering technical provisions covering the material. (see previously explained, \"TP\" documentation).\n\n\n\nManagement of Change\n\n\n\nThe brewery has in place a formal system to identify, assess,  authorize, and implement changes that may affect  the ammonia refrigeration system.  Prior to making a change in equipment or operation, an appropriate analysis must be completed and authorized.  In addition to this formal system, two management system components were developed, in part, in an effort to ensure that changes that may affect the ammonia refrigeration system are identified, assessed, and authorized.  The two management systems are called Management of Change and Chemical Material Management Review.\n\n\n\nPre-Startup Safety Review\n\n\n\nThis procedure ensures that a new system, or a significant modification to an existing system, is ready to operate safely.  The actions required are done before start-up (introduction of ammonia into the system for operational purposes).  They constitute a \"final check\" that the system is safe to place into service.\n\n\n\nThe Pre-Startup Safety Review follows Management of Change as the logical next step.  Management of Change asks, \"Is what you intend to do at least as safe as the rest of the system?\".  Pre-Startup Safety Review asks, \"Did you build it the way you intended to?\"\n\n\n\nSeveral of the actions of a Pre-Startup Safety Review are confirmation that other sections of the prevention plan have been accomplished.  In this way, Pre-Startup Safety Review is integrated into the whole of the management system.",

We have completed this report under the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) to communicate our efforts to achieve a safe workplace.  \n\n\n\nThe brewery uses ammonia as a key part of the cooling system that maintains beer at the proper temperature during certain stages of the brewing process.  Ammonia is one of the materials covered under the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration's Process Safety Management standard (PSM) and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Risk Management Program (RMP) regulations.  The brewery follows these regulations, as well as others, to ensure that it safely handles, uses, and stores ammonia and other potentially hazardous chemicals safely.  The brewery has had no releases of ammonia that resulted in injuries to people, harm to property, or damage to the environment within the last five years.\n\n\n\nOur company environmental, health, and safety (EHS) policy and requirements promote the overall safety of this brewery, employees, and the public.  This policy includes risk reduction programs that provide assurance for the safe management of process risks to prevent environmental, health and safety incidents and to protect the workplace, the community and the environment. These programs enable the brewery to prevent the occurrence, or minimize the consequences of, significant releases of ammonia.  \n\n \n\nIt is Anheuser-Busch's policy to conduct our business in accordance with all applicable laws, regulations, and permits and to promote a safe workplace and a quality environment.  Each employee is trained and required to comply strictly with this policy.  We do not allow production goals or financial objectives to override safety and environmental concerns.  \n\n \n\nAlso, it is Anheuser-Busch's pol"

We are committed to the spirit as well as the letter of our EHS policy and promote, throughout the organization, responsibility and accountability for strict compliance with that policy.  Anheuser-Busch employees whose actions in the performance of their duties may affect the environment and/or public health are trained sufficiently to permit them to comply strictly with our EHS policy. \n\n\n\nIn conducting our businesses, we continue to seek and implement cost effective methods to reduce the EHS impact of our operations.  We integrate EHS considerations into our business planning and decision-making processes, including product research and development, packaging, and new manufacturing methods.  Our continuous EHS improvement goals include pollution prevention and resource conservation.  We ask our contractors to adopt EHS standards, ethics, and policies similar to our own and we give preference to suppliers that do so.\n\n \n\nWe encourage our employees, customers, and the public to share with us their EHS concerns.  We continually talk with local authorities in communities in which we operate to share ideas about preventing incidents with materials we use or store.\n\n \n\nAmmonia System\n\n \n\nAmmonia is used in the refrigeration system of the brewery.  As part of the brewing process, the beer is cooled to ensure its consistency, flavor and overall quality.  Beer packaged in kegs is stored in a refrigerated area in our facility until it is shipped.  Because of the characteristics of ammonia, our employees observe certain safety precautions to prevent unnecessary human and environmental exposure, both within the brewery and in the surrounding community.\n\n \n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\n \n\nAnheuser-Busch has years of experience operating ammonia-based refrigeration systems at its b"

      "SummaryText": "reweries.  This experience has helped bring about designs and operating plans that produce a safe system.  No ammonia releases from any of the company's North American breweries have ever resulted in consequences off brewery property.  The following elements have produced this safe operating record:\n\n\n\nProcess hazard analysis and review, including identification of corrective actions which are tracked to closure;\n\nStandard operating procedures that all operators of the refrigeration system must follow;\n\nFormal operator training (80 hours minimum);\n\nPreventative maintenance to ensure that the entire refrigeration system is mechanically sound;\n\nProcedures to ensure that changes to the refrigeration system are managed so that system operation remains safe;\n\nSafety review prior to the startup of new or modified equipment;\n\nAudits of the PSM and RMP programs;\n\nIncident investigations to ensure that lessons are learned to prevent future incidents;\n\nEmployee involvement in risk reduction programs;\n\nContractor safety procedures are reviewed to ensure outside workers exercise the same safety consciousness as brewery employees;\n\nA hot work permit system that ensures all welding work is conducted safely.\n\nProcess safety information; and \n\nEmergency planning and response.\n\n \n\nThe brewery additionally complies with the requirements of the OSHA PSM standard (40 CFR 1910.119), the EPA RMP rules (40 CFR 68), and the ANSI/IIAR standards for Equipment, Design, and Installation of Ammonia Mechanical Refrigerating Systems.\n\n \n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\n  \n\nThe brewery has had no covered releases that have caused on-site or offsite injuries or damage to property within the last five years. \n\n \n\nEmergency Response Program\n\n \n\nThe St. Louis brewery has established emergency response procedures in the event of an incident involving ammonia.  The emergency response program is based on OSHA's requirements for emergency action plans (29 CFR 1910.38) and HAZWOPER (29 CFR 1910.120 (q)).  We h"

      "SummaryText": "ave trained employees for emergency response and maintain a plan entitled  \"Environmental, Health and Safety Incident Plan\" (EHSIP) which is provided to the City of St. Louis Fire Department.  We conduct periodic drills with local agencies as one of the methods we use to train on implementation of the EHSIP at the brewery. \n\n \n\nBrewery personnel notify local agencies when emergency response is needed.  Local agencies determine if the public needs to be notified.  If it is determined that the public needs to be notified, the local agencies perform the notification task.\n\n \n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n \n\nAnheuser-Busch's St. Louis brewery ammonia refrigeration system is periodically modified to improve safety.  In 1996, an entirely new state-of-the-art refrigeration plant was placed into service.  Additional changes to improve safety are planned in the future.\n\n\n\nConclusion\n\n\n\nAnheuser-Busch is pleased to share its record of safe operations.  We believe the Risk Management Plan under which we are providing this information is an important tool for encouraging communications with our neighbors.  Although we are confident the \"worst case\" and \"alternative\" scenarios presented in this report are highly unlikely,  we are prepared to respond quickly and effectively should one ever occur.  Anheuser-Busch has worked hard over the years to ensure the highest standard of safety.  Our goal is to continue the excellent and safe track record."
