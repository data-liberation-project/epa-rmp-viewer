Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies at the Facility:\r\n\r\nThe Coop board, management and employees at Central Farm Service (CFS), 77 Cedar Street, Easton, MN location, are committed to the prevention of accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\r\n\r\n2. Facility Information and Regulated Substance:\r\n\r\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage of fertilizers for sale to farmers. Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, handled and distributed for direct application. Anhydrous ammonia is used for crop production nutrients.  CFS-Easton also periodically retains two OUTSIDE contractors who utilize mobile units for the purpose of blending anhydrous ammonia with phosphoric acid to produce a non-hazardous liquid fertilizer, 10-34-0.  CFS is neither involved in the conversion process, nor does CFS own the conversion equipment.  Raw materials used in the conversion process include anhydrous ammonia, super phosphoric acid and water. When one of the contractor's portable conversion equipment arrives at the site to conduct the conversion, CFS Easton's RMP is meshed with the contractor's PSM to satisfy regulatory requirements during the conversion process. \r\n\r\nThe facility has one 18,000 gallon storage tank and one 30,000 gallon storage tank for a maximum quantity of BULK ammonia storage of approximately 308,000 pounds; and approximately 135,000 pounds of additional storage is available in 1,000 and 1,450 gallon nurse tanks.  The maximum quantity handled at one time would be the unloading of a tank truck holding 40,000-45,000 pounds.\r\n\r\nThis facility is not constantly manned every work day.  Approximately 10 or so different employe"

General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps:\r\n\r\nThe facility has implemented Minnesota Department of Agriculture rules, the Standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia; and 40 CFR part 68 as they apply to this facility. The facility is required to conduct a semi-annual inspection of all bulk and nurse tank equipment, including load and unload equipment, and perform any needed maintenance to the equipment found during the inspections. \r\n\r\nAs it relates to Process two and Process three (conversion to 10-34-0 by outside contractors) our contractors have provided CFS with information to support they have a mechanical integrity program in place along with written operating procedures, safe work procedures, emergency action plan and a training program. \r\n\r\n4. The Five-year Accident History PROCESS 1 - HANDLING AND STORAGE:  \r\n\r\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years on site that have: \r\n\r\na) Caused any death, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; or \r\nb) To our knowledge resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage.\r\n\r\n\r\n4.  The Five-year Accident History PROCESS 2 and PROCESS 3 - CONVERSION OF 10-34-00 BY OUTSIDE CONTRACTORS (MOBILE UNIT)\r\n\r\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that have:\r\na) Caused any death, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility in question during the conversion process; or \r\nb) To our knowledge resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage at the facility in question during the conversion process.  \r\n\r\nHowever, both the conversion"
