Facility accidental release and emergency response policy.\n\n     The management and employees of Adams FS, Inc. are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidential release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the enviroment.\n\n2. The stationary source and the regulated substances handled.\n\n     The primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers. Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and dristributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient . Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel  and authorized contractors.\n     The maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia that can be stored is 110,000 pounds this incudes the volume of two 12,000 galllon storage tanks manifolded together.\n\n3. The worst-case  release scenario and the alternative release scenario.\n\n    The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of the largest storage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes. The maximum quantity released would be 56,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank as limited by design standards.\n     The distance to the endpoint of .14 mg/L for the worst-case scenario is 1.6 miles.\n     The alternative release scenario based on the most likely potential incident is a release from a break in a transfer hose.\n     The distance to the endpoint of .14 mg/L for the alternative scenario is .19 miles. This release has the possibility of extending beyond the facility boundary.\n\n4. The accidental release prevention program.\n\n     This facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations. This facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Han"

Five year accident history.\n\n     There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that:\n       - have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor\n       - to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, shelter in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n6. The emergency response program.\n\n     The facility has:\n      - a written emergency response plan, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.38;\n      - provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and  community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA);\n       - a written emergency response plan, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.120, including pre-emergency planning and employee training.\n\n7. Planned changes to improve safety.\n\n     Safety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaulations are performed to asses the maintenance of safe conditions. There are no specific safety recommendations for implimentation at this time."
