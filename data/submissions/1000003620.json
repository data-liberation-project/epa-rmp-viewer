This group is responsible for collecting all necessary information from employees (and contractors as necessary) regarding a reported incident through interview sessions. Following the data collection, the Accident Review Committee will meet to hypothe potential causes and develop mitigation measures to prevent future occurrences.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nThe chlorine system for the James M. Rez Pump Station of City of Glendale Water and Power is located at 1111 East Glenoaks Boulevard in Glendale, California.  The chlorine system for the James M. Rez Pump Station consists of chlorine one-ton containers which are the storage vessels.  Chlorine gas is drawn from a maximum of two tanks at a time through a vacuum regulator to the chlorinators.  Still under vacuum from the chlorinators, it is drawn to injectors and mixed with water from the treatment processes. The maximum quantity of chlorine that can be stored on site is 4,000 pounds.\n\nVarious pump stations throughout the City of Glendale use 150-pound chlorine cylinders to treat drinking water.  The 150-pound cylinders are delivered to the James M. Rez Park Pump Station until needed at the other pump stations.\n\nThe maximum quantity of chlorine that can be stored in the storage location is 2,700 pounds (18 150-pound cylinders).\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe City "

      "SummaryText": "of Glendale Water and Power has a Process Safety Management program in place to manage the handling of chlorine.  In addition, common industry standards, policies, and procedures are utilized to ensure safe practices are being performed.  This includes common practices outlined by the Chlorine Institute.  In addition to the Management Programs, there is a chlorine gas detector with sensors in the storage rooms that are set at 1 ppm and will activate the visual alarm and turn on the ventilation system.  At 3 ppm, the operator on duty receives a page notification from GWP Dispatch.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nAn investigation into the facility's accident history revealed that in the last five years (February 2006 - February 2011), there have been no releases of chlorine that exceeded the Federal Reportable Quantity of 10 pounds or the California threshold of \"any\" release at the James M. Rez Pump Station. In addition, there have been no injuries resulting from a chlorine release.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe City of Glendale Water and Power has an emergency response plan in effect at the facility.  The Emergency Response Plan (Plan) is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of the PSM/RMP document.  This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives: \n\n1.)
