In addition, common industry standards, policies, and procedures are utilized to ensure safe practices are being performed.  This includes common practices outlined by the Chlorine Institute.  In addition to the Management Programs, there is a chlorine gas detector with sensors in the storage rooms that are set at 1 ppm and will activate the visual alarm and turn on the ventilation system.  At 3 ppm, the operator on duty receives a page notification from GWP Dispatch.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nAn investigation into the facility's accident history revealed that in the last five years (February 2006 - February 2011), there have been no releases of chlorine that exceeded the Federal Reportable Quantity of 10 pounds or the California threshold of any release at the James M. Rez Pump Station. In addition, there have been no injuries resulting from a chlorine release.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe City of Glendale Water and Power has an emergency response plan in effect at the facility.  The Emergency Response Plan (Plan) is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of the PSM/RMP document.  This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives: \n\n1.) To save lives.\n2.) To minimize and avoid injuries.\n3.) To protect the environment.\n4.) To minimize property damage.\n\nThe City of Glendale Water and Power maintains a safety committee whose members include the emergency coordinators for the facility.  The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility. \n\nThe Plan also includes the Emergency training for all City of Glendale Water and Power employees. Since the James M. Rez Pump Station is an unmanned facility, no evacuation would be required in case of a chlorine release."
