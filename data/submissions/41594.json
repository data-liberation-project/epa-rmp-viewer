AK., has implemented Emergency Action Plans as required by The Occupational Safety and Health Administrations 29 CFR 1910.38(a) and Emergency Response Plans 29 CFR 1910.120. All safety personnel and operators of the process will be trained in these emergency procedures.\n\nThis facility complies with the Occupational Safety and Health Administrations Chemical Process Safety Management 29 CFR 1910.119 and the Environmental Protection Agencies Risk Management Program 40 CFR Part 68. \n\nRegulated substances: Anhydrous Ammonia\nQuantity: 46,000 lbs.\n\nAlyeska Seafoods, Inc. is located on Unalaska Island in Dutch Harbor, Alaska. The facility is staffed year-round and also employs a large seasonal workforce during the spring and summer months.  The plant produces fresh and frozen seafood products, using Anhydrous Ammonia in a closed system as a refrigerant in freezers and cold storage. \nAlyeska Seafoods, Inc. has no chlorine gas on site in any amount. Engineering solutions have been utilized to eliminate any need for chlorine gas.\n\nWorst-case scenario\n - Failure of high pressure receiver when full releasing 14,660 pounds of ammonia in 10 minutes. The high pressure receiver will be full only when the entire system is being pumped down for repairs.  This situation occurs once every other year, on average.  Therefore even the possibility of a worst-case scenario exists infrequently and is considered highly unlikely to ever happen.  This facility has never had a failure of a high pressure receiver. \n\nAlternative release scenario\n- The alternate scenario is the rupture of the largest line feeding the plate freezers. We\u00c2\u00bfve used this scenario because it was estimated to be the most likely event to occur.  All ammonia tanks and piping are routinely inspected and maintained to minimize the chances of a release.  This facility has had 0 releases in the past five year"

      "SummaryText": "s and our preventative maintenance program will prevent any future release. \n\nRelease Prevention Program \n - Alyeska Seafoods, Inc. has an OSHA based Process Safety Management (PSM) program, which is designed to prevent accidental releases of ammonia.  The PSM program addresses all required elements including employee participation, process safety information and system drawings, operating procedures, hot work permits, management of change, mechanical integrity, training, pre-startup review, compliance audits, process hazard analysis, contractor safety, incident investigation and emergency response. Plant personnel responsible for the system receive offsite customized training for their Industrial Refrigeration Operator I certification, from the Garden City Ammonia Program, as well as completion of the RETA Course Industrial Refrigeration I.\n\nFive Year Accident History \n - Per the requirements of 40 CFR 68.42, facilities must include a five-year accident history for all accidental releases from covered processes that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.  There have been no such accidents at this facility in the past five years. \n\nEmergency Response Plan\n - A written Emergency Response Plan has been developed and is on record at the Facility.  This plan includes Pre-Emergency Planning with Outside Agencies, Personnel Roles and Lines of Incident Command Authority, Evacuation Routes and Procedures, provisions for Emergency Medical Treatment, Emergency Notification Procedures, Chemical Response Procedures, Post Incident Critique, Personal Protective Clothing and Emergency Equipment."
