Orion Refinery is currently operating its Crude Unit, Vacuum Unit, Delayed Coking Unit, three Hydrodesulfurization Units, two Sulfur Units and associated utilities facilities.  The facility's Fluid Catalytic Cracking Unit (FCCU) and Alkylation Unit are scheduled to be operational in late 1999.  This facility represents the first new refining capability constructed in the United States over the last 16 years.  The new FCCU will make this refinery one of the highest complexity, lowest-cost-feedstock refineries on the Gulf Coast.\n\nThe purpose of this Risk Management Plan (RMP) is to provide information about regulated substances and release scenarios at the facility, policies and programs to prevent accidental releases, emergency response planning, accident history and planned changes to improve safety at the facility.  Each of these aspects are summarized below and fully detailed in the RMP.\n\nRegulated Substances and Release Scenarios.  The Orion Refinery has six flammable substances in amounts estimated to exceed the thresholds for covered substances.  They are Propane, Propylene/Propane mix, Butane, Isobutane, Butylene/Butane mix, and Pentane.  No RMP toxic substances occur over threshold quantities. \n\nUsing the worst case scenario specified for flammables by the EPA, a vapor cloud explosion of the largest vessel containing a regulated flammable substance, the Butylene/Butane sphere would have the greatest impact.  Using the EPA model known as RMPComp (version 1.06) the distance impacted by such an explosion was calculated to be 1.4 miles.  Although numerous in-place controls prevent such an event from occurring, none of those controls are considered in modeling the worst case scenario.\n\nThe alternative release scenario is "

      "SummaryText": "the worst of what are considered potential release scenarios.  Based on a review of existing Process Hazard Analysis documentation, a flange leak at the Propylene/Propane vessel was calculated to have the greatest off site impact by affecting up to 0.3 miles from the vessel.  No residential areas are located in the area of impact, however, a neighboring chemical facility would be affected if this scenario occurred.  A strategically placed isolation valve, an in-place water curtain safety feature, on site presence of a fire brigade, operator intervention, and other Emergency Response Team actions would be expected to reduce the distance of impact.\n\nPrevention Policies and Programs.  The Orion  Refinery operates under the strict guidelines of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Program.  Facility personnel strive for excellence in PSM by thoroughly integrating PSM into the organization's culture.  The PSM program is designed to:\n\n( Reduce the potential for serious incidents\n( Increase plant reliability, efficiency and product quality\n( Minimize the time and resources expended in achieving compliance\n( Promote improved worker morale\n( Diminish the potential for releases with environmental impact\n( Enhance the company image in the community.\n\nEmergency Response Planning.  Orion Refinery has its own Emergency Response Team (ERT) to respond to all on site emergencies.  This team would coordinate with the St. Charles Parish Emergency Operations Center personnel during any incidents with potential for off site impacts.  Copies of the Emergency Response Plan as well as ERT planning activities and exercises are coordinated  with the EOC Director on an ongoing basis.\n\nAccident History.  No accidents related to RMP substances have occurred at the facility in the past five years.  \n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety.  Continuing compliance with PSM/RMP guidelines and regulations forms the basis of the refinery's commitment to "
