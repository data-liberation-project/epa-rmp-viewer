McCutchenville, Ohio \nCompany Policies: \nThe management and employees of Diversified Agri-Services, Inc. are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. It case an accidental release should occur; the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department and other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release on people and the environment. \nGeneral Operations: \nWe are located in a sparsely populated rural area. Our business is manufacturing liquid fertilizers and selling these fertilizers and other fertilizers, pesticides, seeds, and related items to the farmers in our surrounding area. We also provide custom application of fertilizer and pesticides to farms owned by our customers. We have employees who are well versed in the safe handling of all of our hazardous materials. Any new employees are trained by management plus are given on-the- job training by experienced employees. \nAmmonia: \nWe have an 12,000 gallon storage tank for anhydrous ammonia. We use the ammonia only to mix the ammonia with other products to produce liquid fertilizers. We receive all of our ammonia by truck; the incoming trucks are unloaded by the truck drivers with their equipment according to DOT and other regulations. The truck drivers are well trained. \nAfter the ammonia is in our storage tank it is piped to our fertilizer mixer as needed. A trained operator will release ammonia into the mixer into the midst of acidic phosphoric products with which the ammonia will immediately react to form stable compounds. This mixing is done in a batch reactor and an operator is present at all times. Most of the handling of ammonia takes place in April-May-June in the spring and then also in October-November in the fall. \nAccident History: \nWe have had no accidents in the last five years. We have a safe history of handling anhydrous ammonia. Our employees re"

We modeled a release of the entire contents of our largest storage tank, 12,000 gallons of ammonia. The estimated population within the maximum distance of 4.0 miles is 2,429. \nIn the alternative scenario we also used same modeling program with a supposed transfer hose failure and a 10 minute release of ammonia. The estimated population within the maximum distance of .10 miles is 2 residents."
