The following topics are addressed in this Executive Summary:\n\n* Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n* Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\n* Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\n* Five Year Accident History\n\n* Emergency Response Program\n\n* Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nNote: Although the facility has only 4,000 pounds of sulfur dioxide on site, less than the RMP threshold quantity of 5,000 pounds, the sulfur dioxide is regulated under the California Accidental Release Prevention Program, and thus was included in RMP submittal documentation.\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nThe Wine Group - McFarland, California facility, located in McFarland, California, utilizes anhydrous ammonia and sulfur dioxide in wine making and storage processes.  \n\nAnhydrous ammonia is utilized as a refrigerant in a closed system that cycles the refrigerant, or ammonia, from liquid to gas and back again.  The system, consisting of vessels, piping, valves, and process equipment, cycles ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration to accommodate the storage and production of wine products.  \n\nSulfur dioxide, also in a closed system, is used at The Wine GroupA?s facility to sparge the headspace of the wine tanks, which displaces air from the surface of the wine, preventing unwanted organism growth on the surface of the wine.  Sulfur Dioxide is also injected directly into the wine products to meet sulfur compound level specifications. \n\nSenior management at the facili"

Senior management administers the safety and environmental policies and programs.  These programs include but are not limited to forklift safety, hazard communications, lockout/tagout, Hazardous Materials Emergency Business Plan, employee safety manuals, manufacturersA? documentation, Emergency Response, as well as the Risk Management Plan.\n\nThe Wine Group - McFarland, California facility has independently coordinated emergency response efforts with the local Fire Department.  In the case of an ammonia or sulfur dioxide related emergency, it is the policy of The Wine Group - McFarland, California to evacuate the employees and to allow the fire department/HazMat team to respond to the emergency.  In the specific case of a sulfur dioxide emergency, the facilityA?s supplier of sulfur dioxide, Snowden Enterprises, is also available, and qualified, to assist in the response effort.  If an ammonia or sulfur dioxide release could potentially impact the local community, a Community Notification Plan would be activated. If an ammonia or a sulfur dioxide release were to extend into the neighboring community, a Shelter In Place plan would go into effect.  \n\nThe ammonia systems and the sulfur dioxide system are closed loop, and there are no emissions or planned releases of ammonia or sulfur dioxide.\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nThe Wine Group - McFarland, California facility is located at 31795 Whisler Road in McFarland, California. The facility is on Highway 99 at Whisler Road.  The area immediately surrounding the facility is rural with a mixture of agricultural and sparse residential areas.     \n\nAmmonia Systems\n\nIn order to conduct operations, The Wine Group - McFarland, California maintains a refrigeration system that contains a total of approximately 14,000 pounds"

The one-ton containers serve as the supply to fill smaller hand-held sulfur dioxide cylinders A?gunsA? (6 pound and 100 pound portable gun cylinders).  The portable dispensing A?gunsA? are filled at the one ton container and transported throughout the facility as needed for the wine making process. The sulfur dioxide containers and guns are always outdoors.  Sulfur dioxide is used at The Wine GroupA?s facility to sparge the headspace of the wine tanks, which displaces air from the surface of the wine, preventing unwanted organism growth on the surface of the wine.  Sulfur Dioxide is also injected directly into the wine products to meet sulfur compound level specifications.    \n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe Wine Group - McFarland, California ammonia and sulfur dioxide systems have many safety features.  Much of the safety of the system is inherent in the policies and procedures that govern the operation of the system. \n\nThe Process Safety Management program ensures that all security and safety procedures are addressed.  The staff at the facility is trained in operation, maintenance and emergency procedures related to the operation of the ammonia and sulfur dioxide systems.  All pressure vessels in the ammonia system are equipped with relief valves that vent to the atmosphere at a certain pressure set point. Also, all sulfur dioxide one-ton containers are equipped with fusible relief plugs to prevent pressure "

A preventative maintenance program assures that equipment is maintained and serviced on a regular schedule and that worn, aging, or defective components are replaced as required to maintain equipment in good operating condition.  Controls and safety devices are inspected regularly to ensure proper operation.\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere have been no significant releases of ammonia or sulfur dioxide that exceeded the Federal Reportable Quantity (100 pounds for ammonia, 500 pounds for sulfur dioxide) or the state requirement mandating immediate reporting of any release or threatened release of a hazardous material in the past five years (May 2004 through May 2009).  In addition, there have been no injuries resulting from an ammonia release, nor any releases or A?near missesA? that warranted an internal incident investigation.  \n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe Wine Group - McFarland, California facility has an emergency response plan in effect.  The Emergency Response Plan (Plan) is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of the PSM/RMP/CalARP document, which is maintained at the facility:\n\n  1.) To save lives.\n  2.) To minimize and avoid injuries.\n  3.) To protect the environment.\n  4.) To minimize property damage.\n\nThe Wine Group - McFarland, California facility maintains a safety committee whose members include the designated Emergency Coordinator for the facility.  The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures, which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year.  This Plan was reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM, RMP, and CalARP regulations, as well as to incorporate facility changes.\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThe Process Hazards Analyses (performed separate"
