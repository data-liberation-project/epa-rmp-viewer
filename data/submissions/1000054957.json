BCO-Plaq consists of Chlor-Alkali and Chlorinated Organics operating units that were previously owned and operated by The Dow Chemical Company at their Louisiana Operations Site (Dow-LAO).   On October 5, 2015, BCO-Plaq became a subsidiary of Olin Corporation.  All BCO-Plaq units were previously included in DOW-LAO Site RMP.\n\n\n\n1.  Accident Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nBlue Cube Operations LLC Plaquemine Site (BCO-Plaq) continues to be strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety, as demonstrated by BCO-Plaq's comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at the facility. It is BCO-Plaq's policy to implement the necessary and appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. If such a release does occur, BCO-Plaq plant personnel along with contracted services of the Dow Chemical Company, Louisiana Operations well-trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release. BCO-Plaq is also completely coordinated with the Iberville Parish Office of Emergency Preparedness (LEPC) which provides additional emergency response expertise.\n\n\n\n2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nAs previously stated above, BCO-Plaq process units were previously part of The Dow Chemical Company Louisiana Operations (Dow-LAO). Of the all process units, only 2 units are RMP covered processes: Chlorine Unit and Solvents/EDC Unit.  There are only 4 regulated substances present at the facility that are above the threshold limits: Chlorine, Chloroform [Methane, trichloro-], Hydrogen chlor"

Inhalation can cause coughing, choking, inflammation and ulceration of the respiratory tract.\n\n\n\nChlorine is an element that occurs naturally as sodium chloride (table salt). It is used to purify 98% of our nation's drinking water, is in 85% of all medicines, and is used in hospital sanitation.  It is a product of the Chlorine Unit and is the basic building block in the production of many of Solvent/EDC's products as well as other costumers. Some of these consumer products are laundry bleach, garden and lawn herbicides, vinyl siding for homes, and PVC piping and fittings. Chlorine is a greenish yellow gas with a strong, irritating odor. The vapor can be irritating to the eyes, nose and throat. High concentrations could cause more serious problems.\n\n\n\n3. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nBCO-Plaq has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR Part 68 of the EPA. This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with BCO Loss Prevention Principles and BCO Engineering Standards. The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nBCO-Plaq maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes. Some of this documentation includes Safety Data Sheets, equipment spec sheets, and reactive chemicals tests. \n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nBCO-Plaq conducts periodic comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled ef"

The methodology used to carry out these analyses is What If/Checklist (combined), HAZOP, the BCO Fire and Explosion Index, the BCO Chemical Exposure Index, and Reactive Chemicals/Process Hazards Analysis. The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of 3 years. Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner. The most recent PHA/update was performed on December 8, 2015.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within the covered processes, BCO-Plaq maintains and periodically updates written standard operating procedures (SOPs). These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround. The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\nBCO-Plaq has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes. All new employees are provided the applicable training (initial class-room training and on-the-job mentoring), depending on the nature and location of their assignments, before they are allowed to perform on their own. Refresher training is provided as needed.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nBCO-Plaq carries out and documents periodic maintenance checks on process and safety equipment to ensure proper operations and to minimize/prevent incidents resulting from mechanical failures or equipment breakdowns. Process equipment examined by these checks includes, but is not limited to, pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, process instrumentation and controls and pumps.

Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and provided training to deal with the modification.\n\n\n\nPre-startup Reviews\n\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at BCO-Plaq. These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\n\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nBCO-Plaq conducts audits on a regular basis to verify that the provisions and requirements of the RMP rule are complied with. These audits are carried out at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\n\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nBCO-Plaq promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance. These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.

Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is carried out. BCO-Plaq has a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related to the contractor's work and the processes involved. Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.  Contractors are also required to inform BCO of any hazards they may introduce at the site.\n\n\n\n4.Five-year Accident History\n\nBCO-Plaq has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last 5 years. Due to our stringent release prevention policies, the number of accidental releases has been reduced to a minimum.\n\n\n\nThere has been 1 RMP-reportable accidental releases as defined by the RMP rule of regulated substances from our facility within the last 5 years.
