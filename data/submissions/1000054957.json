BCO-Plaq consists of Chlor-Alkali and Chlorinated Organics operating units that were previously owned and operated by The Dow Chemical Company at their Louisiana Operations Site (Dow-LAO).   On October 5, 2015, BCO-Plaq became a subsidiary of Olin Corporation.  All BCO-Plaq units were previously included in DOW-LAO Site RMP.\r\n\r\n1.  Accident Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\nBlue Cube Operations LLC Plaquemine Site (BCO-Plaq) continues to be strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety, as demonstrated by BCO-Plaq's comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at the facility. It is BCO-Plaq's policy to implement the necessary and appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. If such a release does occur, BCO-Plaq plant personnel along with contracted services of the Dow Chemical Company, Louisiana Operations well-trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release. BCO-Plaq is also completely coordinated with the Iberville Parish Office of Emergency Preparedness (LEPC) which provides additional emergency response expertise.\r\n\r\n2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\r\nAs previously stated above, BCO-Plaq process units were previously part of The Dow Chemical Company Louisiana Operations (Dow-LAO). Of the all process units, only 2 units are RMP covered processes: Chlorine Unit and Solvents/EDC Unit.  There are only 4 regulated substances present at the facility that are above the threshold limits: Chlorine, Chloroform [Methane, trichloro-], Hydrogen chlor"

Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and provided training to deal with the modification.\r\n\r\nPre-startup Reviews\r\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at BCO-Plaq. These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\r\n\r\nCompliance Audits\r\nBCO-Plaq conducts audits on a regular basis to verify that the provisions and requirements of the RMP rule are complied with. These audits are carried out at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\r\n\r\nIncident Investigation\r\nBCO-Plaq promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance. These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring. All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years. There has been 1 RMP-reportable incidents at BCO-Plaq facility in the last 5 years.\r\n\r\nEmployee Participation\r\nBCO-Plaq truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention are a team effort.\r\nCompany employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.

Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is carried out. BCO-Plaq has a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related to the contractor's work and the processes involved. Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.  Contractors are also required to inform BCO of any hazards they may introduce at the site.\r\n\r\n4.Five-year Accident History\r\nBCO-Plaq has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last 5 years. Due to our stringent release prevention policies, the number of accidental releases has been reduced to a minimum.\r\n\r\nThere has been 1 RMP-reportable accidental releases as defined by the RMP rule of regulated substances from our facility within the last 5 years.
