This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program in place that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, we are completely coordinated with the Bowman Fire Department which provides highly trained emergency response personnel to control and mitigate the effects of the release.\r\n\r\n\r\n2.\tThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\r\nOur facility's primary activities encompass Distribution center for oil field customers.  We have one (1) regulated substances present at our facility.  This substance is Acrolein [2-Propenal].    The regulated substance at our facility is stored and distributed to our oil field customers.  Acrolein is stored in pressurized vessel to minimize emissions during storage.  There is no material handling of acrolein except moving containers.\r\n\r\nThe maximum inventory of Acrolein [2-Propenal] at our facility is 11,000 lb.  The daily average is usually much less.\r\n\r\n3.\tThe Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\r\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used the TRACE model.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\r\n\r\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 3 toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from Acrolein Storage.
