Facility Policy: The owners, management and employees of Peve Crop Service, Inc., Hopkins, MO (the facility) are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate and minimize the impacts of the release to the people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information: The primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers. Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for both direct application and for blending into mixed-grade fertilizers for crop production nutrients. Anhydrous ammonia is stored at the facility in one (1) storage tank of 12,000 gallons capacity. The maximum quantity stored would be 51,000 pounds.\n\n3. Worst-Case and Alternate Case Release Scenarios: A. The Worst case Scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank as a gas over a period of 10 minutes. The maximum quantity released would be 51,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85% capacity as limited by design standards. The distance to the end-point (point of dispersion to 200 parts per million, or ppm) is 1.8 miles. B. The Alternate Case Scenario, based on the five year accident history or the most likely potential scenario is a release from a break in a transfer hose. The distance to the end-point (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 1.6 miles.\n\n4. Accidental Release Prevention Program: The facility has been reviewed for general compliance with the provisions of the standards of the US Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\". The OSHA standard is referenced in the Registration Form Section 8.3.b.\n\n5. Five Year Accident History: There have been no accidental"

      "SummaryText": " releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that have caused any deaths, injuries or significant property damage at the facility, nor to our knowledge, have resulted in off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage.\n\n6. Planned Changes to Improve Safety: Safety improvement is an on-going process at the facility. Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions. There are no additional specific safety recommendations regarding storage or use of anhydrous ammonia for implementation at this time."
