The refrigeration is supplied to Fleming as a utility and is the sole responsibility of Wisvest Ther-Max, LLC. \n\n1.\tAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at Wisvest Ther-Max, LLC are committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at this facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, our employees are trained to evacuate the facility and allow emergency response personnel to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  We will be completely coordinated with the La Crosse Fire Department which provides the emergency response expertise.\n\n\n2.\tThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nThis facility's primary activities revolve around the storage and distribution of refrigerated and frozen foods.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is the only regulated substance present at this facility.  The entire ammonia inventory is attributed to its use as a refrigerant.\n\nThe maximum inventory of ammonia at our facility is 18,000 pounds.\n\n3.\tThe Worst Case Release Scenario and the Alternative Release Scenario, includes administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario.  To evaluate the worst case and alternative release scenarios for ammonia we have used the methodology given in the Model Risk Management Program and Plan for Ammonia Refrigeration by SAIC.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for"

The scenario involves the release of 6,000 pounds of ammonia in a gaseous form over 10 minutes.  At Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s windspeed, the maximum distance of .90 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L.\n\nOne alternative release scenario has been submitted for the toxic substance present in the Program 3 process.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for ammonia involves a release from a relief valve in the ammonia refrigeration process.  The scenario involves the release of 600 pounds of ammonia in a gaseous form over 10 minutes.  Under neutral weather conditions and 3.0 m/s windspeed, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L of ammonia is 0.10 miles.\n\n\n4.  The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nThis facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR Part 68 of the EPA.  In addition, this facility is subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119.  This facility is also subject to EPCRA Section 302 notification requirements.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nWisvest Ther-Max, LLC maintains a detailed record of written safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all the processes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nThe methodology used to carry out the analysis is What If-Checklist.  The analysis was undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are to be revalidated at a regular interval of 5 years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor th"
