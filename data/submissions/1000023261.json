      "SummaryText": "n 2001.  The facility serves as a distribution point for chilled goods that are shipped to Costco Wholesale retail outlets.  Costco Wholesale is located at 3800 North Division Street, in Morris, Illinois.  The facility is approximately 0.06 miles (318 feet) miles west of State Route 47 and 0.36 miles north of Highway 80.  Morris is located approximately 55 miles southwest of Chicago.  The immediate area is primarily rural with some developed land (the town of Morris) south of Interstate 80.  The ammonia system was constructed in accordance with all applicable federal, state, and local regulations including the Uniform Fire and Mechanical Codes.\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system uses approximately 30,000 pounds (5,400 gallons) of ammonia for cross dock operations, warehouse cold storage, and freezer storage.  Refrigeration process equipment at the facility operates continuously.  Compressors and condensers cycle on and off to comply with system demand during operation.  The ammonia refrigeration system provides cooling for four cold storage areas: Cross Dock (35 F), Cooler Storage (28 F), 2010 Cooler (33 F), and Freezer Storage (-10 F).  The majority of the system equipment is located in the ammonia engine room.  The condensers are mounted on the engine room roof, the water diffusion tank is located outside the engine room, and the evaporators are placed in their respective cold storage areas.\n\nThe refrigeration cycle begins with the transfer of high pressure liquid ammonia from the high pressure receiver to the high temperature pump accumulator.  The high pressure receiver also supplies liquid ammonia to the compressors for oil cooling.  As the ammonia enters the high temperature pump accumulator, it is expanded through a hand expansion valve, reducing the pressure (and hence the temperature) in order to maintain a predetermined internal pressure.  The high temperature pump accumulator feeds a similar vessel that maintains an intermediate pressure, the medium temper"

Each accumulator vessel supplies pumped liquid ammonia to a distinct set of evaporators.  The high temperature accumulator serves twenty-six (26) cross dock/cold storage evaporators and eight (8) evaporators in 2010 Cooler.  The medium temperature accumulator typically serves eight (8) 28 F Meat Cooler evaporators (that can also be supplied by the high temperature accumulator as needed), and the low temperature accumulator serves two (2) 0 F freezer evaporators.  Fans in each evaporator are used to blow air across and through the coils, which partially vaporizes the liquid ammonia as heat from the room is transferred to the ammonia.\n\nThe resulting two-phased (liquid/vapor) ammonia from each set of evaporators is returned to each accumulator respectively in which constant pressures (temperatures) are maintained based on the suction pressure of the corresponding compressors.  The vapor from the accumulators is then drawn to nine (9) compressors where the pressure and temperature of the gas is increased.  All eight compressors work in combination to compress the vapor pulled from the three accumulator vessels.  Compressor discharge (high pressure ammonia vapor, or hot gas) is routed to two (2) condensers where it is condensed to a high pressure liquid and drained back to the high pressure receiver.  Hot gas is also used for defrost of the freezer and meat evaporators.  An auto purger periodically purges the system of non-condensibles collected in the condensers.  Dual pressure relief valve assemblies are installed on each vessel to relieve high pressure ammonia to a water diffusion tank through a common header in case of a high pressure event.\n\n\nRISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe Costco Wholesale ammonia refrigeration system has many safety features.

For example, the Costco Wholesale facility operates in accordance with OSHA's Process Safety Management regulation.  Refrigeration contractors, experts in the ammonia refrigeration industry, are contracted at the facility to maintain the system and perform any repairs.\n\nAmmonia sensors are strategically located in the engine room and refrigerated areas.  In the event of ammonia detection, an audible and visual alarm is triggered throughout the cold storage warehouse.  Low level ammonia detection (150 ppm) also activates exhaust fans that ventilate the engine room, close the King Solenoid Valve, and triggers a phone call to the appropriate facility personnel.  The fire department is alerted if the alarm is deemed an emergency.  In the event of a high level ammonia detection (300 ppm), the \"shunt trip\" is activated, shutting down all electrical equipment in the Engine Room.\n\nThe system also incorporates a pressure relief system.  In the event of over-pressurization, vessels will vent to a common header which relieves to the Water Diffusion Tank until the system pressure decreases sufficiently to reseat the valves.  This mechanism prevents vessels from rupturing in case they come over pressurized.\n\nAmmonia refrigeration systems do not experience any chemical reactions or internal corrosion.  The only composition change that occurs within the systems are phase changes, as ammonia is cycled through various stages of liquid and vapor, similar to a household refrigerator.  The refrigeration system is a closed-loop system without any regular emissions or releases.  Any leaks are noted and repaired immediately.\n\nCostco Wholesale personnel circulate throughout the plant, taking note of unusual conditions in any portion of the system.  If a leak is detected or observed by any Costco Wholesale employee (or contractor), it is immediately reported to the area Manager.  Action is promptly taken to mitigate th"

These safety features include a water diffusion tank, ammonia sensors in the machine room as well as sensors in the cold storage areas, and automatic shut down systems that prevent equipment damage and ammonia releases.  In addition, the majority of the ammonia inventory is maintained inside the machine room and just outside of the machine room (condensers).  All pressure vessels are equipped with pressure relief valves that automatically engage in case of a high pressure situation and vent through a common header to a water diffusion tank.\n\nIn addition to the Uniform Mechanical Code, Costco Wholesale has developed a preventive maintenance program that utilizes the services of a professional refrigeration contractor to complete regularly scheduled inspections and tests of the ammonia refrigeration system as well as repairs as needed to process equipment.  This program is implemented throughout the company.\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe Costco Wholesale facility has not had any reportable ammonia releases over the past five years (June 2006 to June 2011).  No injuries have occurred at the facility due to the operation of the ammonia refrigeration process.  In addition, there have been no accidents or near-misses that have warranted an internal investigation at the Costco Wholesale facility in Morris, IL.\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nCostco Wholesale has an emergency action plan in effect at the facility.

The Depot Manager will assume command in an emergency situation with backup personnel appointed to serve if he/she is not available.  Costco Wholesale maintains a safety committee whose members include the designated emergency coordinators for the facility including the maintenance manager and the assistant depot managers.  The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  The facility holds evacuation drills at least once per year.\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThe Costco Wholesale facility conducted a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) Revalidation (June 9, 2011) and a PSM/RMP Three-Year Compliance Audit (June 8, 2010).  \n\nThe 2011 PHA Revalidation study includes the results from the two elements:  1) the Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) study and 2) a Site Inspection.   These studies were performed to define potential hazard associated with operational deviations of the ammonia system.  \n\nThe 2010 PSM/RMP Three-Year Compliance Audit and 2011 Process Hazard Analysis Revalidation generated recommendations to improve safety at the facility.
