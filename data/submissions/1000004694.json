Simplot Company to provide a safe work environment for every employee and to protect them from injury and illness resulting from unsafe acts or conditions during hours of employment.  J.R. Simplot will also comply with all federal, state and local laws.  The California Manufacturing Manager  has the responsibility for leadership of the safety and health program, for its effectiveness and improvement and for providing the safeguards required to ensure safe conditions.\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia, Butane and 98% Nitric Acid safety programs are key items in the plant safety and health program.  J.R. Simplot takes many precautions to prevent or minimize accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia, Butane or 98% Nitric Acid.  These precautions include safety controls (alarms and automatic shutdown devices) which are designed to identify and prevent potentially unsafe conditions like pressure increase that could cause a system failure, a preventive maintenance program designed to maintain the on-going integrity of the systems.  A training program designed to ensure that the systems are operated by qualified personnel, and emergency action procedures which enable trained personnel to respond quickly to system upsets.\n\nB.  Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nJ.R. Simplot Company, Helm facility produces fertilizer and industrial chemicals.  There are 3 chemicals listed in 40 CFR 68.130, anhydrous ammonia, 98% nitric acid and butane that are processed, stored and handled in quantities exceeding threshold limits for this report.\n\nC.  Description of the Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe facility has three programs level 3 accident release prevention programs for anhydrous ammonia, butane and 98% Nitric Acid systems that complies with OSHA's Process Safety Management Standard and EPA's Risk Management Program Regulation.  The anhydrous ammonia, butane and 98% Nitric Acid sy"

Five-Year Accident History\n\nThere has not been any anhydrous ammonia, butane or 98% Nitric Acid-related incidents at the Helm Facility during the previous five years that resulted in significant on-site or offsite consequences.\n\nE.  Description of the Emergency Response Program\n\nThis facility does not have an Emergency Response Plan but does have an Emergency Action Plan.  This program contains procedures describing how the facility will respond to fires, chemical leaks and other emergencies, including evacuation procedures.\n\nThe Emergency Action Plan includes the following elements:\n\nA?    Fire Plan\nA?    Chemical  Leak Procedures\nA?    Evacuation Procedures\n\nF. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nChanges were recommended to improve the equipment and the system operating procedures when the anhydrous ammonia, butane and 98% Nitric Acid systems was analyzed in August 20, 2008.  The recommended changes have been evaluated and will be implemented as required.\n"
