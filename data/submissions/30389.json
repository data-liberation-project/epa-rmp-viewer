Safety and security of the chemicals is guided by safety and environmental audits.  Security is specifically addressed through a security and vulnerability assessment (SVA)  performed under the the ACC guidelines.  The SVA was verified by the Phoenix Police Department to ensure effectiveness.   \n\n1.1  \tAccidental release prevention and emergency response policies:\n\nThe containers are unloaded from a delivery vehicle for various periods of time, and then are loaded and delivered to the final user. These products, in the amounts handled by our facility, are considered hazardous under the RMP regulation.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal and state rules and regulations.  Air Products manages the safety of the regulated processes by means of operating procedures, equipment testing and inspections, safety devices (e.g., alarms, shutdowns, instrumentation, relief devices) inherent in the design of this facility and other controls and systems designed to prevent accidental releases of hazardous chemicals. Safe work practices and training of our personnel supplement the inherent safe design of the facility.\n\nOur emergency response program is based upon OSHA\u00bfs HAZWOPER regulation.  The emergency response plan includes procedures for the notification of the local fire authority and Hazardous Materials unit so that appropriate measures can be taken by local emergency responders to control accidental releases. Employees at our site are members of the site\u00bfs emergency response team, which is trained to respond to and control accidental releases of hazardous materials.\n\n1.2  \tThe stationary source and regulated substances handled:\n\nThe primary purpose of this facility is the storage and the redelivery of a variety of compressed gases and chemicals to the end user.

They are stored here until needed by the final user, at which time they are inspected prior to shipment and loaded onto a transport vehicle and delivered to the final user location.  There is no chemical reaction involved, and neither is there any transfer of product from one container to another.  The regulated process is strictly the storage of the listed regulated substances in the containers in which they were received until they undergo a pre-shipment quality assurance inspection and are loaded onto a delivery vehicle to be transported to the end user.\n\n1.3  \tThe worst-case release scenario(s) and the alternative release scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distance for each reported scenario:\n\nAir Products employs a number of administrative controls to limit the potential and magnitude of releases.  Foremost has been the decision to limit all activity for the four regulated substances to storage only.  There will be no transfer of any of the four regulated substances at the site.  Further, Air Products segregates toxic gases so as to reduce the potential of incompatible gases coming in contact with one another.  Segregation is accomplished through a combination of distance and/or masonry barriers.  Air Products consciously controls the on-site inventory of gases to limit the potential magnitude of a site release.  The facility has been designed with the storage area at ground level, to reduce the potential of damaging a cylinder through a fall.  Though these administrative controls will make the facility inherently more safe, the actual worst case and alternate case scenarios and resulting endpoint calculations have not been altered as a result of their presence.\n\nAir Products has employed a series of mitigating measures to limit the severity of a potential release.  Air Products provides manned coverage during normal business hours and manned response 24 hours a day."

Though these mitigation measures can help limit endpoint distances, the actual worst case and alternate case scenarios and resulting endpoint calculations, have not been altered as a result of their presence.\n\n1.4  \tThe general accidental release prevention program and specific prevention steps:\n\nThe facility developed prevention program elements based on the Federal EPA\u00bfs Accidental Release Prevention Plan.  This facility was designed and constructed to comply  with applicable state and industry codes.\n\nChemical specific prevention steps begin with the decision that all three regulated substances would be on-site for storage only.
