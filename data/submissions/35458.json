A combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs are used to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public as well as  protect the environment.  As a company, we are committed to excellence in health, safety, and the environment.  Arch Chemicals operates under the philosophy that all accidents are preventable?all of the time.  We recently revitalized this commitment with an ambitious  initiative,  ?The Goal is Zero?.  This initiative is all about striving to achieve zero recordable injuries, zero environmental incidents, zero manufacturing process incidents, and zero distribution incidents.  The same dedication to excellence marks our Product Stewardship initiative, under which we address health, safety, and the environment throughout each product's life cycle.\n\nThe following sections provide a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities in practice at the Brandenburg facility.  Also attached are the data elements from our risk management program that are required by EPA?s RMP rule.\n\n2.0    Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\n    The Arch Chemicals Brandenburg facility is a 220-acre site located east of Brandenburg, Kentucky.  The facility is divided into 10 distinct units:  Ethylene Oxide, Polysolvs?, Light Hydro Carbons (LHC), Polychemicals, Polymer Polyol, TDI Terminal, Microelectronics, Pilot Plant, Utilities and Waste Water Treatment.  Primary products of the facility include ethylene oxide, ethylene, propylene glycols, polyether polyols, glycol ethers and microelectronic chemicals.  Note at this time (June 2004) that the ethylene oxide and light hydrocarbon facilities are shut down.  \n\nIn our processes, we use the following toxic chemicals that E"

      "SummaryText": "on measures to limit the exposure distances for each scenario:\n\nToxics:  Worst Case Release Scenario\n\nEthylene Oxide:  The selected worst case release scenario assumes the failure of a storage tank containing up to 99,000 pounds of ethylene oxide.  The required assumption is that the entire contents of the tank are released in 10 minutes.    Using the EPA OCA tables, rural topography and stipulated meteorology (wind speed of 1.5 m/sec and F stability class), and passive mitigation measures, the ethylene oxide could travel a significant distance before dispersing enough to no longer pose a significant hazard to the public.  A release of this magnitude could potentially impact area residences and both the Meade County and Harrison County schools.  There are no EPA listed receptors within the impact distance.  Although unrealistic, this scenario meets the requirements of a release of the largest quantity from a vessel that has the potential for the farthest off-site impact.  Although passive mitigation in the form of dikes were considered for this release scenario, the facility also has sprinkler and deluge systems that would be utilized in a release of this type but were not considered in the consequence analysis. Arch has voluntarily implemented administrative controls to reduce the maximum inventory in the ethylene oxide tanks to less than or equal to 99,000 pounds.\n\nToxics:  Alternate Release Scenario\n\nIn accordance with the EPA RMP rule, a more credible ?alternate? release scenario was considered for each toxic chemical.  This scenario is often called the planning scenario because we use the information to develop our detailed emergency response plan.

      "SummaryText": "e alternate release scenario for formaldehyde considers a leak in a 1.5 inch line.  The line has isolation valves at each end which will be manually shut by operators required to oversee all material transfers.  Approximately 38 pounds of formaldehyde would be released over a ten-minute period.  The formaldehyde would travel only a  short distance before dispersing enough to no longer pose a significant hazard to the public.  Potentially impacted public receptors would include the Ohio River.  \n\nEthylenediamine:  An evaluation of credible releases of ethylenediamine (EDA) from the facility produced no scenarios that could potentially result in an off-site impact.  The most credible alternate release scenario for EDA considers a transfer hose rupture.  Because of shutoff valves at the tank truck and the reactor, only 12 pounds of EDA (the contents of the hose) would be spilled.  The resulting plume  would remain onsite.\n\nEthylene Oxide:  The more credible alternate release scenario for ethylene oxide considers a release from a process safety valve in the polychemical area.  Approximately 370 pounds is released to the air in five 30-second lifts.  The resulting plume could travel a short distance offsite before dispersing enough to no longer pose a significant hazard to the public.  Potentially impacted public receptors would include area residences and the Ohio River.\n\nPropylene Oxide:  The more credible alternate release scenario for propylene oxide considers a release from a process safety valve in the polychemical area.  Approximately 2,270 pounds is released to the air at a height of almost 50 feet in five 30-second lifts.  The resulting plume could travel a short distance offsite before dispersing enough to no longer pose a significant hazard to the public.  Potentially impacted public receptors would include area residences and the Ohio River.\n\nAcrylonitrile:  The more credible alternate release scenario for acrylonitrile is the rupture of an unloading hose fro"

Approximately 833 pounds of liquid acrylonitrile would be spilled, resulting in a plume that could travel a short distance offsite before dispersing enough to no longer pose a significant hazard to the public.  Potentially impacted public receptors would include the Ohio River.\n\nToluene Diisocyanate:  The more credible alternate release scenario for toluene diisocyanate (TDI) considers the failure of a pressure relief valve on an incoming railcar.  Approximately 100 pounds would be released from the vapor space of the railcar.  The resulting plume could travel a short distance offsite before dispersing enough to no longer pose a significant hazard to the public.  Potentially impacted public receptors would include Doe Run Creek.\n\nAmmonia:  The more credible alternate release scenario for ammonia considers the failure of an ammonia process line due to external erosion.  Liquid ammonia is spilled to the gravel surface and 116 pounds is released to the air.  The release lasts for approximately 20 minutes and travels a short distance offsite before dispersing enough to no longer pose a significant hazard to the public.  Potentially impacted public receptors would include the Ohio River.\n\nHydrochloric Acid (37%):  An evaluation of credible releases of 37% HCl from the facility produced no scenarios that could potentially result in an off-site impact.  The most credible alternate release scenario for 37% HCl considers the puncture of a 55-gallon drum.  Approximately 550 pounds of HCl would spill to the ground.  The resulting plume would stay within the plant site.\n\n4.0    General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nA systematic, proactive approach is taken to preventing accidental releases of hazardous chemicals.

Administratively limit the maximum allowable inventory for toxic chemicals handled at the facility, including ethylene oxide, propylene oxide, hydrochloric acid and acrylonitrile.\n2.    Conduct extensive in-process and effluent wastewater monitoring in excess of NPDES permit requirements for derivatives of ethylene oxide and propylene oxide.\n3.    Designed a closed loop cooling tower for installation in the Polychemicals process area to prevent the accidental release of ethylene oxide or propylene oxide to the Ohio River.\n4.    Designed and installed a refrigeration system for the ethylene oxide storage tanks to prevent the accidental release of ethylene oxide to the Ohio River.\n\nThe individual elements of our prevention program, along with the chemical-specific prevention steps, work together to prevent accidental chemical releases.

      "SummaryText": "es under the philosophy that ?all accidents are preventable?all of the time.?   Arch is committed to providing a safe environment for all employees, visitors and the surrounding community.  An Emergency Response Plan has been developed for the Brandenburg facility in order to provide an effective and efficient response to any type of incident.  The Emergency Response Plan addresses all federal, state and local regulatory requirements for emergency planning.  To assist us in the event of an emergency, local area emergency responders have been provided with our Emergency Response Plan.  Drills and training for the Arch-Brandenburg Emergency Response Team (ERT) are conducted independently and in conjunction with the Brandenburg Fire Department.  Emergency Response Team members are onsite 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.  The Meade County Fire Department is responsible for notifying the public of any release which has potential off-site impacts.\n\n7.0    Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThe Brandenburg facility has planned facility improvements that will help prevent accidental chemical releases from occurring and adversely affecting our employees, the public, and the environment.  A USEPA Chemical Safety Audit was conducted at the Arch Chemicals-Brandenburg facility in March, 1999.  A Security Vulnerability Assessment was completed during May, 2004 with the assistance of the Meade County Local Emergency Planning Council (LEPC).  A variety of recommendations are being implemented as a result of our participation in this program, including:\n\n1.    Increased operator training for emergency response activities.\n2.    Expanded drills to include the local medical community and LEPC.\n3.
