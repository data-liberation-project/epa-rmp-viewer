Also included in the RMP are programs for the prevention of accidental releases and worker safety which reflect the key elements of OSHA's PSM requirements deemed essential for safe management of hazardous substances.\n\n\n\nCalabrian's Hazard Assessment Program has identified theoretical Worst-Case Scenarios (WCS) for release of the largest quantities of regulated substances that results in the greatest distance to an endpoint as defined by the United States Environmental Protection Agency. WCS for Sulfur Dioxide are normally gases at ambient temperature and handled as a liquid under pressure, assume the quantity of a 564000 pounds storage tank is released as a gas over 10 minutes. The distance to endpoint is 25 miles including an estimated population of 343,000 individuals.\n\n\n\nHazard Assessments of alternative Release Scenarios (ARS), which are more likely to occur than the theoretical WCS , identified a hole in a loading hose with a distance to endpoint of 0.2 miles. Population within this distance to endpoint is 860 individuals.\n\n\n\nAdministrative controls as well as passive and active migration measures were considered in the Hazard Assessment. These include excess flow valves, field monitors, scrubbers, and neutralization, and emergency shutdown systems. Additionally, Calabrian's accidental release prevention program for Sulfur Dioxide include accepted techniques for developing process safety information and conducting process hazard analyses. All OSHA Process Safety Management and RMP programs have been im"

Calabrian did not have any reportable releases in this time period.\n\n\n\nCalabrian's written Emergency Response Plan is coordinated with the community emergency response network and includes action to be taken in response to accidental releases of the regulated substance. These plans include procedures for informing local agencies responding to accidental releases, the public, and local medical community as well as information on emergency health care. Training for site workers is conducted annually with information provided to municipal responders and local emergency planning committees."
