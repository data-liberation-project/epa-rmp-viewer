(PDI) is committed to operating in a safe and environmentally sound manner and being a responsible member of the community by making safety information available to the community.  Safety is a top priority at PDI as reflected in its proactive planning, state-of-the-art equipment, employee training, and its coordination with the Contra Costa County Health Services Department (CCCHSD) to prevent accidental releases from occurring and instituting controls to rapidly mitigate a potential release if it does occur.  Risk management planning has been initiated at the facility's inception.  A Hazardous Materials Management Plan (HMMP) was submitted to the CCCHSD in 2002. The HMMP included a hazardous materials inventory, emergency response plan, evacuation plan and planned employee training.\n\nFacility Description\n\nPDI specializes in the distribution of industrial and medical gases (NAICS Code 422690, SIC Code 5169).  The PDI facility at 1930 Loveridge Road, Pittsburg, California (Figure 1) will be a compressed gas distribution center with operations commencing in February 2003.  The plant, occupying approximately 6.3 acres, is a state-of-the art facility constructed in 2002. PDI places a high priority on safety and has had no chemical accidents or releases with offsite consequences in the last five years. Access to the manufacturing and office building is strictly controlled through a chain link fence and a security alarm system. The plant is located off Loveridge Road and California Avenue in Pittsburg near Highway 4.  The surrounding area is used for industrial manufacturing and commercial warehousing activities.  The nearest body of water is the San Joaquin River to the North.  Residences are located 1/4-mile to 1-mile south and west of the site.\n\nRegulated Substances and CalARP Program Levels\n\nPDI uses a number of chemicals that, depending on the quantities handled, are potentially"

Planning requirements for regulated substances are defined in a three-tier program (Programs 1 through 3) based upon: The potential for off-site consequences associated with a worst-case accidental release, accident history; and, applicability of the OSHA PSM Standard. \n\nProgram 1 processes are those with no public receptors within the endpoint distance from a worst-case release and with no accidents with offsite consequences (deaths, injuries or requiring response or restoration activities for an environmental receptor) during the past five years.  Program 2 processes are those not eligible for Program 1 or subject to Program 3 requirements.  Processes ineligible for Program 1 and subject to OSHA PSM or California OSHA programs; or that are described by one of ten specified NAICS codes, are placed in Program 3.  Since this new plant has no accident history, the Offsite Consequence Analysis (OCA) and applicability of OSHA PSM will determine the Program Level.  The local administering agency (AA) for the CalARP Program is the CCCHSD.  This Risk Management Plan (RMP) has been prepared using the CCHSD CalARP Program Guidance Document (CCHSD 1998). \n\nProcess Descriptions\n\nLiquid hydrogen is received at the southwest side of the distribution facility via truck trailer rig (Figure 2).

Liquid hydrogen from the storage tank is maintained at a low temperature to maintain a constant pressure in the system.  Parallel pumps are used to boost the pressure to approximately 2000 psi and transfer liquid hydrogen to an ambient vaporizer where the liquid is evaporated.  High-pressure hydrogen gas from the vaporizer is then piped to tubular gas receivers, a cylinder-filling machine or to tube trailers.  Excess hydrogen in vented through a stack.

For flammable substances the end point is the distance to an overpressure of 1 psi.  For toxic substances the end point distance is the distance to reach a concentration specified in the CalARP Tables.

This scenario would correspond to the catastrophic failure of the hydrogen tank.  This scenario is the WCS as defined in the CalARP regulation sections 2750.3 (a)(2)(A) and (c)(1).  The release results assumed the following conditions for a WCS:\n\n\u00b7Neutrally buoyant gas;\n\u00b7Ten-minute release at the rate of 888.4 pounds per minute (actually flash vaporized almost instantaneously);\n\u00b7Urban topography;\n\u00b7F stability class; and,\n\u00b7Wind speed of 1.5 meters per second.\n\nResults of the worst-case analysis are presented below.\n\n\u00b7Using RMP comp with the worst-case meteorological conditions, the end point distance for hydrogen is estimated at about 0.2 miles from the facility shown on Figure 3.\n\u00b7Using 2000 census data from Land View V, no residences, schools or hospitals are located within the worst-case distance (Figure 3).\n\nHydrogen Alternative Release Scenario\nThe alternative release scenario for the hydrogen is a process piping failure with a liquid release occurring for 10 minutes at grade.  Under typical process conditions (1-inch pipe, 80 psig pressure), using Compressed Gas Association (CGA) guidelines in Pamphlet P-28, Praxair estimated the hydrogen release rate to be 57.6 pounds per minute.
