The present rated capacity of the refinery is 46,500 barrels per day (BPD) of crude.  The current operating rate is about 39,000 BPD.  In its current operating mode, known as \"topping mode\", Paramount does not operate its hydroprocessing units, but sells the intermediate feedstocks that would have been processed in these units to a neighboring refinery.  Paramount's main product is asphalt.\n\nThe Refinery occupies approximately 63 acres of land located in Paramount, Southern California.  The address is 14700 Downey Avenue, Paramount, CA 90723.  The site is bordered on the north by Contreras Street, on the south by Somerset Boulevard and Southern Pacific Railroad track, on the east by Lakewood Boulevard and on the west by Downey Avenue.  On the north side of the refinery, a trailer park, a shopping center,  Wirtz Elementary School and single family houses are located. On the west side, Paramount High School and a new housing development are located. On the east side, there are single family homes and mobile home development. Across the railroad tracks on the south side is an apartment complex.\n\nThe primary business of Paramount is the processing of local crude oils to finished hydrocarbon products, primarily asphalts for road construction and roofing materials.

The contents are primarily butane.  \n\nThe worst case scenario is an unlikely scenario for the following reasons:\n\n1. Comprehensive mechanical integrity program\n2.

It is assumed that the tank is 50% full (of butane) at the time of the accident (max. operating volume is 80%).  No credit is taken for any of the mitigation measures available.  Several alternative scenarios were considered, per the guidelines provided by the EPA, and the BLEVE radiation hazard distance to the endpoint was the largest. \n\nToxic Regulated Substances - No toxic regulated substances exist at the refinery in quantities equal to or greater than the threshold quantities specified in 40 CFR 68.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nParamount has a comprehensive process safety management program in place. This program is audited periodically to evaluate performance and identify opportunities for improvement.  All equipment is subject to inspection and maintenance under a refinery wide mechanical integrity program.  Most rotating equipment is duplicated.  Operations manuals provide process safety information and operating procedures.  There is a strong ongoing training and certification program.

There have been two releases in the last five years at processes that are no longer in operation.  Those two releases also did not result in injuries, deaths or evacuation.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nParamount Petroleum is committed to providing a safe and healthy work facility for its employees, the surrounding community and the environment.  The prevention of accidents, injuries, fires, emergency releases and other emergency situations is of utmost importance and shall be the first priority for all persons working at the refinery.\n\nIt is anticipated that accidents, injuries and emergency situations may still occur.  The Emergency Response Plan (ERP) will provide guidelines for a coordinated emergency management system in the refinery to respond to such situations.  The Plan utilizes proven techniques of the Incident Command System.  When situations dictate, the system will utilize the combined effort from all departments, mutual aid groups and municipal agencies in order to mitigate emergency incidents in a safe, effective and timely manner.\n\nThe ERP is implemented through an Incident Command System (ICS).  The ICS has two levels of application.  Small emergencies are responded to by an Emergency Response Team (ERT) consisting of a Shift Incident Commander, an operations chief, and a team of members responsible for coordinating issues related to off-site releases, rescue, and hazardous materials spills.  The Shift Incident Commander also coordinates with the Los Angeles County Fire Department (LACoFD) via telephone.\n\nFor larger emergencies an Emergency Management Team (EMT) is activated.  The EMT is lead by the Vice President of Refining, the Emergency Management Officer and the Director of Fire, Safety, and Security serves as the Incident Commander.

The plant emergency alarm system is tested weekly.\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nParamount has a tracking system for implementing recommendations that result from Process Hazard Analyses.  There is a continuing training and certification program in place.  \n\nA comprehensive seismic assessment of equipment in covered processes has been performed in accordance with revised seismic design guidance criteria issued in 1999 The recommendations from that study are being evaluated.  \n\nAs noted earlier an audit of the process safety management program was completed in 1999.  Findings and recommendations from that audit are being evaluated for implementation of program improvements."
