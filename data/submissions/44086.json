(Innovene) is committed to operating in a manner that is safe for our employees, the public, and the environment.  As part of this commitment, Innovene has established a system to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility.  One component of this system is a risk management program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at Innovene and that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's Regulation 40 CFR 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule).  One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit a summary of the risk management plan (RMP Plan) describing the risk management program at BP.  This plan summary is intended to satisfy the RMP Plan requirement of the RMP Rule (40 CFR 68.150 though 40 CFR 68.185) and to provide the public with a description of the risk management plan in place at Innovene.\n\n2.0   Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nBP is committed to the welfare of their employees, the public, and to the preservation of the environment.  Innovene implements reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous substances.  In the event of an accidental release, Innovene will conduct emergency response actions to help prevent or minimize injury to the public and the environment.\n\n3.0   Facility Process and Regulated Substances\nInnovene manufactures polypropylene resins for a wide variety of industrial and consumer applications such as plastic bottles, chip bags, children's toys, and car parts.\n  \nThe manufacturing process uses propylene as the basic building block for producing polypropylene.  Titanium tetrachloride is used as a catalyst for the polypropylene reaction.  Propane is inherent to polypropylene processes.  \n\n4.0   Offsite Consequence Analysis\nAn offsite consequence analysis was conducted on the polypropylene facility.  The subject analysis consisted of worst-cas"

This scenario is an instantaneous release of titanium tetrachloride liquid from a storage vessel, resulting in a gas cloud.  The resulting cloud could reach offsite industrial endpoints but is not predicted to reach residential populations.\n\nOne worst-case scenario was completed for flammable RMP compounds.  This scenario is a release of propylene, resulting in a vapor cloud.  The pressure effects from this scenario could reach the offsite industrial endpoints is not predicted to reach residential populations.\n\nEach worst-case scenario is considered a conservative analysis.  These scenarios are based on stable conditions and low wind speed.  In addition, the worst-case scenarios did not consider any existing safety systems or mitigation activities.\n\nOne alternative release scenario (ARS) was completed for toxic RMP compounds.  This scenario is a release of titanium tetrachloride liquid from a punctured storage vessel, resulting in a gas cloud.  The resulting cloud may reach the offsite industrial endpoints but is not predicted to reach residential populations.\n\nTwo ARS were completed for flammable RMP compounds.  The first scenario is a leak from piping in the metering yard, resulting in a vapor cloud.  The second scenario is a vapor cloud fire from the metering yard leak.  The pressure / thermal effects from these scenarios may reach the offsite industrial endpoints but are not predicted to reach residential populations.\n\nThe alternative release scenarios are based on the most common weather conditions.  It should be noted that these scenarios did not consider any existing safety systems or mitigation activities other than emergency response.\n\n5.0   Accident Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nThe polypropylene process is currently covered by the PSM standard.  As such, a Program Level 3 prevention program is in place.  T"

Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) document the physical properties of all hazardous substances handled at BP.  The engineering design documents include the operating parameters, the design basis and configuration of the equipment of the covered process, and references to applicable codes and standards.\n\n5.2   Hazard Review \nInnovene performs and periodically updates hazard reviews of the processes to help identify and control process hazards.  Checklists include items to help ensure that Innovene operates and maintains the equipment in a manner consistent with the applicable design specifications, codes, standards, and regulations.\n\n5.3   Operating Procedures \nInnovene maintains it's operating procedures under an ISO9000 program.  As such we are required to develop and maintain operating procedures to define how tasks related to process operation should be performed.  The operating procedures are used to (1) train employees and contractors and (2) serve as reference guides for appropriate actions to take during both normal operations and process upsets.\n\n5.4   Training \nInnovene trains personnel in the operating procedures to help ensure safe and effective performance of their assigned tasks.  A training documentation file is maintained to help ensure that refresher training is provided, as necessary.\n\n5.5   Maintenance \nInnovene properly maintains the process equipment.  The maintenance program includes (1) procedures to safely guide workers in their maintenance tasks, (2) worker training in the maintenance procedures, and (3) an inspection and testing program to help identify equipment deterioration and damage before the equipment fails.\n\n5.6   Management of Change \nInnovene has a program in place to document changes to the process."

The program is designed to (1) evaluate the impact of the change on the process, (2) update records on the process and (3) ensure that workers are informed and trained on any significant changes.\n\n5.7   Pre-startup Review \nInnovene performs audits on a new process or an existing process that has undergone a modification affecting the safety information.  This review is done prior to operating.  The review (1) confirms proper equipment was used, (2) safety, operating, maintenance, and emergency procedures are updated, (3) a hazard evaluation has been conducted, and (4) training has been updated.\n\n5.8   Compliance Audits\nInnovene performs periodic compliance audits of the covered process to verify that the process is operating in compliance with the Process Safety Management standard.  Compliance audit reports are prepared after each audit, with documented deficiencies and corrections.\n\n5.9   Incident Investigations\nInnovene investigates all incidents that could reasonably have resulted in a serious injury to personnel, the public, or the environment.  Innovene procedures require an investigation team to be assembled, and the investigation to be initiated within 48 hours of the incident.  The results of the investigation are documented, recommendations are resolved, and appropriate process enhancements are implemented.\n\n5.10   Employee Participation\nInnovene requires participation by the affected employees in development (1) of the process hazard evaluation, (2) process safety management, and (3) operating procedures of all covered processes.  The employees that work with or maintain the processes are given access to all information required under the rule.\n\n5.11   Hot Work Permits\nInnovene has written safety practices in place for fire protection and process operation.

The contractor must submit information that indicates the work can be performed competently and safely.  The company will provide information on the hazards of the process and the safety practices in place.  Documents are kept to confirm that the information was received and understood.  In addition, Innovene has procedures in place, which require the entrance, presence, and exit of contractors to be controlled.\n\n5.13   Chemical-specific Prevention Steps\nIn addition to engineering review and hazard analyses previously mentioned, workers who perform operations involving RMP listed compounds receive training emphasizing safe handling procedures developed by BP.  In addition, several equipment safeguards are in place.  Examples of such safeguards include: hydrocarbon detection and water deluge systems, related piping and vessel periodic inspection and maintenance, and continuous process monitoring for operations involving RMP listed compounds.\n  \n6.0   Five-Year Accident History\nInnovene maintains a 5-year accident history that fulfills the requirements of the RMP rule (?68.42).  This history indicates a good record of accidental release prevention.  No releases of regulated substances have occurred from Innovene during the subject five year period that resulted in consequences of interest (i.e., deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site; or known deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering-in-place, property damage, or environmental damage off site).\n\n7.0 Emergency Response Program\nInnovene has established a written emergency response plan that complies with the RMP rule and with other federal contingency plan regulations.
