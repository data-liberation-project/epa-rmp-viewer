Reducing the impact of our operations on the environment is also a priority. NuStar Energy LP is committed to achieving Health, Safety and Environmental (HSE) excellence throughout the organization.\r\nNuStar management has also agreed to correct in a timely manner all hazards identified through self inspections, employee reports, accident investigations, or any other means with interim protection as necessary.\r\nWe will provide the results of self-inspections and accident investigation to our employees upon request.\r\nWe will continuously seek areas for improvement and ways to raise our employees level of awareness regarding all aspects of safety and health.\r\nThe North Platte Terminal was built and put into service in 1982. The facility was built to store and transport propane (RMP regulated substance), refined products and a Liquid Mixture (LM) of the two products. The propane, refined products and the LM are delivered, via an 8 pipeline, to the North Platte Terminal from the NuStar Terminal in Geneva, Nebraska. The 3,850,000 lbs. of propane, which exceeds the 10,000 lbs. threshold quantity (TQ) of the OSHA PSM requirements, is stored in, one of eight, pressurized bullet tanks. The LM is stored in two pressurized bullet tanks and is routed through a Depropanizer distillation process, which removes any excess propane from the LM and this propane is then stored in the propane A\u00bfbulletA\u00bf tanks with the good propane. The propane is then removed from the site by propane trucks that deliver it to various customers. The refined products are also stored in tanks and pumped to various customers by trucks and the refined products can also be piped to the Union Pacific Bailey Yard to be consumed by the railroad.\r\nThe North Platte Facility complies with many different regulatory agencies, which include, but not limited t"

We have had no accidental releases in the last five years and in fact the North Platte Terminal was built in 1982 and to this date we have had zero propane releases. \r\nThe North Platte Emergency Response Program works together with the North Platte Fire Department. The North Platte employees are not first responders, but have received training in the notification process of the North Platte Fire Department (first responder). The employees also participate in an annual evacuation drill, in the event an evacuation is required. \r\nVarious employees at the North Platte Terminal have received CPR training, and all employees have received annual HAZWOPER training. Numerous other drills are conducted at the North Platte Terminal as stated previously.\r\nSafety is the #1 core value of our company. Whether in performing everyday work or in the planning and maintenance of project work, safety is top priority. Some of the future improvements towards safety are: \r\nManagement and employees have teamed together to earn the OSHA VPP Star award and the recertification 3 years later. In thi"
