      "SummaryText": "S&S Produce Executive Summary\n\n\n\nS & S Produce has a large farm and fresh vegetable cold storage located in a rural area SW of Mendota California. Anhydrous ammonia is used as a refrigerant in three separate refrigeration systems for making ice and removing field heat for short term storage. We operate 12 months a year with seasonal fluctuations. We have completed training, maintenance, revalidation of PHA's, replacement of SRV's and seismic walkdowns since the last registration.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Risk Management Program at S & S Produce complies with US EPA and California Accidental Release Prevention requirements. Specifics of our potential off site impacts are not included in this executive summary as recommended for security. Publication or sharing of OCA portions of RMP materials can be in violation of the Chemical Safety Information, Site Security and Fuels Regulatory Relief Act (PL106-40). \n\n\n\n1.Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nWe at S & S Produce are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  Our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training demonstrates this commitment.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n\n\n2.The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nOur facility's primary activities revolve around processing and storage of corn, broccoli, bell peppers and melons.  This activity is consistent with SIC 0723/ NAICS 115114 post harvest crop activities. Anhydrous ammonia is the major regulated substance present at our facility.  The entire ammonia inventory is attributed to use as a refrigerant. Ammonia (anhydrous) is used as a refrigerant in 3 separate closed loop refrigeration systems. \n\n\n\n3.

According to the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration \"The worst-case situation represents an extremely improbable (and for many facilities impossible) set of circumstances rather than a credible accident scenario. Release quantities and hazard distances derived there from for the worst-case scenario should not be used as a basis for emergency response planning.\"\n\n\n\nTo evaluate the worst case and alternative release scenarios for ammonia we have used the methodology given in the Model Risk Management Program and Plan for Ammonia Refrigeration by SAIC.  Specific details are not provided in the Executive Summary as required in recent rulemaking. It's a rural area, new facility and includes modern diffusion tanks and ammonia detectors. Off site impacts are not expected.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR Part 68 of the EPA.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with applicable California Building Codes and updated to RAGAGEP standards as part of the PHA process. The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nS & S Produce maintains a detailed record of written safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all the processes.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses is What if /Checklist.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of 5 years.

These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved with the processes.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\nS & S Produce attends regional training classes to ensure that employees who are operating processes are completely competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Refresher training is provided at least every 3 years and more frequently as needed.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nS & S Produce carries out documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Maintenance procedures are carried out by qualified Refrigeration Contractors with a strong background in maintenance practices.  Specialized training is provided to these personnel as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified during maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\n\n\nManagement of Change\n\nWritten procedures are in place at S & S Produce to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures.  Process operators, maintenance personnel and all other employees whose job tasks are affected by a change in a process are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the changes.\n\n\n\nPre-startup Reviews\n\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at S & S Produce.

These audits are carried out at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\n\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nS & S Produce promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years. Any incidents that release a reportable amount of Ammonia require updating the 5 year Accident History and filing a revised RMP with the EPA.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nS & S Produce truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.  Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  In addition, our employees have access to all information collected as part of the facility's compliance with the RMP Rule including information resulting from process hazard analyses.\n\n\n\nHot Work Permit\n\nAt S & S Produce Hot Work Permit procedures are in place and enforced. Preventing accidents related to welding and cutting while alerting others at the facility that this type of work is occurring are important prevention steps.\n\n\n\nContractors\n\nOn occasion, our company hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities.  Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is carried out.

Due to our stringent release prevention policies, there has been no accidental release during this period at our previous Cold Storage facility. Any reportable release requires updating the Accident History within 6 months.\n\n\n\n6.Emergency Response Plan\n\nS & S Produce has a written emergency action plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials.  The plan includes defensive actions that can be taken without entering a hazardous area. These actions include training for recognition of a hazard, evaluation, initial evacuation or protection measures, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas. Our employees will only respond to minor leaks that do not exceed levels requiring PPE. PPE is used for comfort only.\n\n\n\nTo ensure proper functioning, our emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced.  In addition, the plan is regularly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within our processes that would require a modified emergency response. Any changes in Emergency Contact information is reported within 30 days.\n\n\n\n7.Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nSeveral developments and findings have resulted from the implementation of the various elements of our accidental release prevention program. We are repairing insulation, adding emergency showers and eye washes to the mechanical rooms and testing emergency notification systems."
