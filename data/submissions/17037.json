      "SummaryText": "The City of Newport Utilities Department accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that combines technologies, procedures and management practices.  All applicable prevention procedures of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Risk Management Program will be adhered to.  The City of Newport Utilities Department's emergency response policy involves the preparation of evacuation and notification procedures and coordination of emergency response procedures with the Local Emergency Response Committee (LEPC) and the local fire department.\n\nThe Water Pollution Control Treatment Plant, installed in 1990, serves the Newport, Rhode Island community by disinfecting wastewater.  The  treatment plant is located at 250 Connell Highway.  The wastewater treatment plant contains a chlorine storage room, which contains liquid chlorine ton cylinders, an evaporator/chlorinator room, which heats the liquid chlorine, mixes the chlorine with water and regulates the flow of chlorine to various stages of the treatment process, an instrument room, which contains flow recorders and other electronic panels, and various safety equipment.  Within the storage room, one one-ton cylinder is on-line, one one-ton cylinder is in reserve, and five one-ton cylinders are in storage.  Additionally, as many as two one-ton cylinders may be located outside in a secured storage area.  The facility operates on three shifts with a minimum of three operators per shift.  The chlorine storage area and the evaporator/chlorinator room are monitored with chlorine detectors.\n\nThe wastewater treatment plant's offsite consequence analysis includes consideration of two release scenarios involving chlorine.  These scenarios are identified as \"worst-case\" and \"alternative\".  EPA states that for the worst-case scenario \"the owner or operator shall assume that the maximum quantity in the largest vessel is released as a gas over 10 minutes\".   The worst-case scenario is to result from an uns"

      "SummaryText": "pecified failure.  EPA defines the alternative scenario as one that is \"more likely to occur that the worst-case scenario\".\n\nThe purpose  of the release scenarios is to determine the distance to \"toxic endpoint\", which is defined by the American Industrial Hygiene Association as the \"maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects or symptoms which could impair an individual's ability to take protective action\".  Additionally, the residential population within a circle, which is made using the distance to toxic endpoint as its radius, has to be defined as an estimate of the population potentially affected.  For the purpose of determining worst-case and alternative release scenarios distance to toxic endpoint, the wastewater treatment plant utilized EPA's RMP*Comp software.   \n\nThe worst-case release scenario at the Water Pollution Control Treatment Plant involves a failure of a one-ton cylinder.  The distance to toxic endpoint was determined to be 1.3 miles and an estimate of the residential population potentially affected of 14,460 was obtained.  \n\nThe wastewater treatment plant used, as an alternative release scenario, a leak during hook up of a ton cylinder.  The leak came from the 3/8\" whip which carries the liquid chlorine from the ton cylinder to a one inch gas rated steel pipe.  As described in EPA's CEPPO's Risk Management Program Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants, a flashing liquid release was assumed as the treatment plant pulls liquid chlorine from the cylinder.  The distance to toxic endpoint for the alternative scenario was determined to be 0.3 miles and an estimate of the residential population potentially affected of 1,300 was obtained.\n\nThe general City of Newport Utilities Department's accidental release prevention program is based on training of the operators, implementation of preventive m"

Procedures have been developed for the effective and timely notification of response personnel and the community and for the safe evacuation of employees.\n\nA hazard review conducted on June 11, 1999 identified a number of recommended actions which when implemented will improve the safe handling and storage of chlorine at the Water Pollution Control Treatment Plant.  The wastewater treatment plant will evaluate the recommendation and implement all feasible  recommendations in a timely manner."
