As stated on the company's website, \"Castle & Cooke Cold Storage is committed to being a leader in the public refrigerated warehouse industry and in our sphere of business. We promise to provide innovative, professional services of a quality that meets or exceeds the expectations of our customers, our suppliers, and our community in general. We promise to maintain our facilities to the highest standards possible.  We will offer superior service and capabilities at a reasonable and competitive price as we stay abreast of the latest technologies available in our industry and in the general business arena. Our continuing objective is to exceed the performance of other comparable companies, in part by allowing our team members at all levels to continually improve the quality and value of our service.\"\n\n\n\nCastle & Cooke Cold Storage senior management is not only committed to offer superior service, but to also maintain a safety and environmental program to promote a safe environment for all its employees and the surrounding communities.  Castle & Cooke Cold Storage's safety and environmental policies are administered by the Safety Director. Inspections of the facility are conducted by the facility Operations Manager and Chief Engineer to ensure compliance and oversee the entire safety and environmental programs. These programs include forklift safety, hazard communications, lockout/tagout, Hazardous Materials Emergency Business Plan, employee safety manuals, manufacturers' documentation, Emergency Action Plan, as well as the Risk Management Plan.\n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\n\n\nThe facility is located at 3001 Sierra Pine Avenue in Vernon, California, and is situated approximately 1 mile south of Interstate 5 and lies on the intersection of Sierra Pine Ave. and Bandini Blvd. The immediate area surro"

      "SummaryText": "unding the facility is primarily commercial and residential. \n\n\n\nThe primary business of the Castle & Cooke Cold Storage facility is to provide refrigerated warehousing and storage for various food products.  In order to conduct operations, the facility maintains a refrigeration system containing approximately 17,650 pounds of anhydrous ammonia, a regulated substance.  The refrigeration system, consisting of piping, valves, and equipment, cycles ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, and then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration for cold, freezer, and dock storage.  Typical operating conditions range from 1.2 psig on the low pressure side of the system to 151 psig on the high side of the system.  Table 1 lists the ammonia equipment at the facility while Figure 1 shows the location of the facility and Figure 2 shows the facility plot plan.\n\n\n\nAACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nIn order to operate the ammonia refrigeration system, the facility complies with the following risk management regulations:\n\n\n\n?    EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP);\n\n?    OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM); and\n\n?    California Accidental Release Prevention Program (CalARP).  \n\n\n\nAdministrative Measures:\n\nThe facility operates in accordance with the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) guidelines and standards including the following:\n\n\n\n?    IIAR Bulletin 107, \"Suggested Safety and Operating Procedures When Making Ammonia Refrigeration Tie ins\"\n\n?    IIAR Bulletin 109, \"Minimum Safety Criteria for a Safe Ammonia Refrigeration System\" \n\n?    IIAR Bulletin 110, \"Startup, Inspection, and Maintenance of Ammonia Refrigeration Systems\"\n\n?

For example, the Castle & Cooke Cold Storage facility operates in accordance with the Process Safety Management (PSM), Risk Management Program (RMP), and California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program.  It is important to note that the refrigeration system has been designed with several safety features to prevent the accidental release of ammonia.  For example, the compressors are equipped with safety mechanisms that will cause the units to shut down if operating conditions exceed designated safety limits.  Also, level indicators, alarms, and switches are installed in key points within the system to monitor the supply of liquid ammonia and to ensure that a vessel is not overfilled.\n\n            \n\nEngineering Measures:\n\nOther safety features of the ammonia refrigeration system include: emergency shutdown switches that kill power to the engine room equipment (located outside each Engine Room door), an emergency pressure control system to relieve pressure from a high pressure suction line to a lower pressure suction line, relief valves on all pressure vessels, continuous ventilation (controlled by a thermostat), and emergency ventilation in the Engine Room to prevent explosions. The facility has also installed ammonia sensors at strategic locations throughout the facility.\n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nThe PHA Revalidation Team found that there have been no significant releases of ammonia at the facility in the last five years (January 2007 - January 2012) that exceeded the Federal Reportable Quantity of 100 pounds or the state requirement mandating immediate reporting of any release or threatened release of a hazardous material.  In addition, there have been no injuries resulting from an ammonia release, nor any releases or \"near misses\" that warranted an internal incident investigation.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe facility has an Emergency Action Plan (plan)"

The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year. This Plan was reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM/RMP/CalARP regulations.  \n\n\n\nCastle & Cooke Cold Storage personnel circulate throughout the plant, taking note of unusual conditions in any portion of the system.  In the event that an ammonia leak is discovered, the person nearest to the leak will alert any personnel in the immediate area who are unaware of the danger, and the Operations Manager.  The Operations Manager will contact the Chief Engineer, Castle & Cooke Safety Director, and Senior Vice President of Engineering to evaluate and ascertain the significance of the leak.  If the ammonia leak is considered minor and/or minimal, the repair will be conducted by the Castle & Cooke refrigeration mechanical staff.  An outside refrigeration contractor may be contracted to further assist in the potential repairs to the equipment pertaining to the ammonia system.  For major ammonia leaks, emergency agencies will also be notified as necessary as outlined in the Emergency Action Plan.  Action is promptly taken to mitigate the leak so normal operations can resume.\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nA Process Hazard Analysis Study was performed on February 1, 2007 at the Castle & Cooke Cold Storage facility, and was revalidated on January 17, 2012.
