Accidental release prevention and emergency response polocies.\nThe Ottumwa Water & Hydro handles chlorine that is considered to be a hazardous material by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Our polocies adhere to all applicable Federal and State rules and regulations.\n\nThe Ottumwa Water & Hydro operates a water treatment plant that serves a community with a population of 25,000 people. For non-incidental releases of chlorine, the Waterworks will rely on community emergency responders. The emergency response plan includes procedures for notification of local fire authority and S.E. Iowa Response Group (HAZMAT). The plan also includes notification of any potentially affected neighbors.\n\n2. The stationary source and regulated substances handled.\nThe primary purpose of the Ottumwa Water & Hydro treatment facility is to clean and disinfect water to be used by the City of Ottumwa and rural neighbors for potable purposes. Chlorine is shipped by truck to the plant in 2,000 - pound cylinders (one ton). The chlorine cylinders are off loaded into the chlorine room adjoining to the rest of the plant building. The regulated substance handled at this facility is chlorine. The maximum amount of chlorine that can be stored at this plant is 20,000 pounds.\n\n3. The Ottumwa Water and Hydro works in a safe manner at all times\n\n4. The general accidental release prevention program and the specific prevention steps.\nThe Ottumwa Water & Hydro has worked to comply with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with state codes and regulations. This facility was designed and constructed between 1963-1964 and contains separate chlorine storage and feed rooms. The ventalation system in the chlorine storage room maintains both rooms under negative pressure preventing released chlorine from migrating directly to other internal portions of the room. When activated the detector sounds and alarm in the laboratory. In the event of alarm or some other emergency th"

The emergency Response Program\nThe facilities emergency response program has been developed to respond to emergency conditions. The Ottumwa Fire Department will be called (dial 911) in the event outside emergency assistance is warranted. This program has been discussed with the Ottumwa Fire Department and the South East Iowa Response Group (HAZMAT) team. A representative of the Ottumwa Fire Department and The S.E. Iowa Response Group (HAZMAT) team have visited this plant.\n\n7. Planned Changes to improve Safety.\nSafety and health is constantly changing. The Ottumwa Water & Hydro is striving to make safety and health a dynamic, progressive endeavor. This facility currently utilizes a chlorine detector in the chlorine feed room. The detector sets off an audible alarm in the laboratory room. The facility is manned 24 hours per day: consequently, someone is always around to initiate emergency response procedures should the alarm sound."
