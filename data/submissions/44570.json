We use a combination of resources including personnel training, consideration of safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of the different refinery processes.  We have accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public as well as protection of the environment.  This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including:\r\n\r\n1] A description of our facility and use of substances regulated by EPA's RMP regulation\r\n2]  A summary of results from our assessment of the potential offsite consequences from accidental chemical releases\r\n3] An overview of our accidental release prevention programs\r\n4] A five-year accident history for accidental releases of chemicals regulated by EPA's RMP rule\r\n5] An overview of our emergency response program\r\n6] An overview of planned improvements at the facility to help prevent accidental chemical releases from occurring and adversely affecting our employees, the public, and the environment\r\n7] The certifications that EPA's RMP rule requires us to provide\r\n8] The detailed information (called data elements) about our risk management program\r\n \r\n \r\n FACILITY DESCRIPTION, STATIONARY SOURCE, AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\r\n \r\n Shell Chemical Yabucoa Inc. Refinery produces and distributes petroleum fuels and distillate products from  Crude Oil feedstocks.

The Refinery  has an Environmental Quality Board CAA Permit #PFE-TV-2911-0397-0025.\r\n \r\n The Refinery uses the following flammable chemical that has been identified as regulated under the EPA's RMP rule with the potential to cause offsite consequences in the event of an accidental release:\r\n \r\n Propane - Used for fuel purposes in the Hydrogen Process Units.  It is also used as fuel in the Utilities Unit especially during start up and shutdown operations.  We have two propane storage bullets, one located at the MEK Unit Area, which contains 121,000 Lbs. (full capacity) and the other propane storage bullet located at the Utilities Area, which contains 142,000 Lbs. (full capacity).\r\n \r\n No regulated toxic material is handled or stored in quantities above the threshold limit values established for reporting by the regulation.\r\n \r\n \r\n HAZARD ASSESSMENT PROGRAM\r\n \r\n The hazard assessment program of EPA's RMP rule requires that we provide information about the worst-case release scenario(s) and alternative release scenario(s) for our facility.   The EPA's Offsite Consequence Analysis (OCA) guideline was used for the calculation of the Worst Case Scenario (WCS) results. It is important to understand that this scenario is based on the regulatory guidelines and it is calculated using the EPA rules.  The worst-case scenario associated with a release of a flammable substance in Program 3 processes at the Refinery, a vapor cloud explosion (VCE), follows:\r\n \r\n \r\n Worst-case Release Scenario - Regulated Flammable Chemicals\r\n \r\n A catastrophic rupture of the second largest propane vessel of the refinery occurs releasing the total content (121,000 Lbs.) of the flammable substance.  This release forms a Vapor Cloud Explosion (VCE) involving the full inventory of the vessel. This event would have off-site consequences. T"

We have mitigation measures such as: tank level control, sewer systems within the tank dike area, fire suppression systems at the intermediate tank area that can be used to reduced the amount of vapors from the area. \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n Alternative Release Scenario - Regulated Flammable Chemicals\r\n \r\n A catastrophic rupture of the largest propane vessel (V-004-09) of the Refinery occurs releasing the total content (142,000 lbs.) of the flammable substance.\r\nThis release forms a vapor cloud explosion (VCE) involving the whole vessel inventory. This event could have off site consequences but not as extensive as described in the worst case scenario due to the location of this vessel within the Refinery.\r\nWhen the Offsite Consequence Analysis (OCA) was done for this vessel, the distance results were within the extent of the second largest vessel (V-003-01).\r\nThis event would have off site consequences.

This is done by defining the organization and controls, and the guidelines and procedures to be used by all personnel to protect the employees and the facilities.  The program is intended to eliminate or mitigate the consequences of a release of toxic or hazardous chemicals.  The refinery will continue to design, maintain, and operate its facilities, equipment and resources in a cost-effective manner, which recognizes that compliance with safety and environmental regulations is paramount.   We are prepared to respond promptly and professionally should an incident occur.\r\n \r\n Management of Change\r\n \r\n Shell Chemical Yabucoa Inc. Refinery has a comprehensive system to manage changes to processes.  This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemical technology (including process-operating conditions), procedures and other facility changes be properly reviewed and aut"

Changes are reviewed to ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.  Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures are updated to incorporate these changes.\r\n \r\n Pre-Startup Safety Review\r\n \r\n For any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information a Pre-Start Up Safety Review is conducted.  The purpose of the pre-start up safety review is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and the equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all support systems are operationally ready.  A Pre-Startup Safety Review involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\r\n \r\n Compliance Audits\r\n \r\n Corporate compliance audits are conducted at least every three years.  This ensures that the Process Safety Program is being maintained as required.  This is accomplished by conducting a formal evaluation and certification.  The Refinery Process Safety Manager follows up on the programs on a regular basis to verify compliance of the elements of the PSM program.\r\n \r\n \r\n Incident Investigation\r\n \r\n The purpose of an Incident Reporting and Investigation procedure is to establish a consistent and effective system of internal reporting.   It is also the means for investigation and follow up of all undesired events that resulted, or could have resulted, in physical harm to people, loss of production, or harm to the environment so that the potential for the recurrence of such events is minimized.

Refinery develops implements and maintains an effective system of safe work permit procedures, which shall include the requirements set forth in the different types of work in the refinery.  The Hot Work permit is a written authorization to proceed with maintenance or construction activities after the review of the status and conditions of the equipment or area. The hazards of the equipment or area, and the procedures and or equipment, including personal protective equipment required to performed the work safely, are evaluated.\r\n \r\n Contractors\r\n \r\nShell Chemical Yabucoa Inc. Refinery maintains a contractor safety program which includes initial contractor orientation, safety audits, safety reports, incident investigation and program compliance.  The refinery employs contractors to supplement its work force during normal periods or periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Contractor safety procedures are coordinated and implemented by the Refinery Contractor Representative.  Evaluation of the Contractors safety record and training program is used in selecting the Contracting Company.  The safety regulations require Contractors to train their employees in the safe work practices and safety rules of the refinery.  Contractors are also required to report any safety hazards that the contract work may cause for the facility or any hazards found by the contract employees.  \r\n \r\n \r\n SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\n \r\n As part of our prevention efforts, we have implemented the following chemical-risk reduction and safety measures as specific prevention step"
