      "SummaryText": "Plant Description\n\nWater District No. 1 of Johnson County operates a water treatment plant, which draws water from both the Missouri and Kansas Rivers.  The Hansen Water Treatment Plant uses 3 co-located chlorination process areas, as follows: Facility No. 1, which is a 60 million gallon per day lime-softening plant has 1 process area; and Facility No. 2, which is a 120 million gallon per day, lime-softening plant contains two chlorination process areas.  Each process area may have a maximum of of 30,000 lbs of chlorine during peak demand. \n\n\n\nThis Risk Management Plan (RMP) covers the Section 112r regulated substance stored and used at the Hansen Water Treatment Plant, which will be referred to herein as the Plant.   \n\n\n\nThe Plant is located at 7601 Holliday Drive, Kansas City, Kansas. \n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Assessment\n\nA process hazard assessment was performed on the chlorine systems beginning with the unloading of the container and ending with each chemical in solution.  In the assessment, general questions regarding the storage and use areas, as well as protocols associated with the management of the chlorine systems, were answered.  A copy of that checklist is maintained onsite.  Following the checklist, each valve, line, and piece of equipment in each system was assessed from the cylinder or tank to point of chemical injection.  Compliance with code requirements, potential failures, maintenance and inspection concerns, and standard operating procedures were reviewed for each point in the system.  \n\n\n\nPrevention System\n\nThe Plant has an operation, maintenance and inspection system designed to review each element of the chlorine systems routinely.  There are Operation and Maintenance manuals for each major piece of equipment, and personnel receive training before being allowed to work on the systems.\n\n\n\nAs each cylinder is changed, the valves and flexible whip connection of the chlorine system are tested for leaks.  There are standard operating procedures (SOPs) for"

      "SummaryText": " startup, shutdown, normal operation, and emergency operation of chlorine process equipment.  Personnel are trained on safety concerns and general operation procedures as well as emergency procedures.  The chlorine system is equipped with chlorine detectors and alarms that indicate leaks.  The chlorine alarms indicate by sending a signal back to SCADA and triggering visual and audible alarms.  Chlorine tank storage rooms are protected by a scrubbing system.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Plan\n\nAny response requiring entry in a dangerous atmosphere requiring Level A personal protection or use of a chlorine repair kit is to be managed by Haz-Mat Response Inc., an emergency response company located in the Kansas City area.  A copy of the relevant sections of Water District No. 1AA?s Emergency Operations Plan is included.   \n\n\n\nAccident History\n\nThe Plant has had no RMP reportable accidents in the past five years.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nIn order to ensure that the Hansen Water Plant is consistently making safety our highest priority, we have completely overhauled our RMP Program. Increased communication and transparency regarding RMP documents with employees will ensure that we maintain a positive and active safety culture. We are in the process of increasing our frequency and completeness of process safety information, operations and maintenance documentation. This will allow us a more complete perspective on the effectiveness of our RMP Program as well as to provide a clear history for investigation in the event that an incident occurs. \n\n"
