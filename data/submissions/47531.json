To the north of the plant, directly adjacent to the fence line, is Catawba Creek, a tributary of the Catawba River.  The Catawba River feeds Lake Wylie, a major recreational usage lake.  Municipalities downstream of Lake Wylie, on the Catawba River, utilize the river as their major drinking water supply.  All stormwater leaving the plant site flows directly into Catawba Creek.\n\nAccess to the facility is via a two-lane street, lined with homes, and several blocks from a major throroughfare.\n\nThe Chemtura Corporation Gastonia facility manufactures Castable Urethane Prepolymers utilizing Toluene Di-isocyanate as a reactant, in combination with high molecular weight polyethers and polyesters.\n\nChemtura Corporation has a Responsible Care (t/m) Policy that has been adopted by the Gastonia facility.  This policy contains the key elements of our on-going safety and environmental programs.  Numerous written Standard Practices and Standard Operating Procedures are in place, and their implementation is documented.\n\nChemtura Corporation\nResponsible Care (t/m) Policy\n\nChemtura Corporation considers the safety and health of the public, its employees, contractors and customers and the protection of the environment for current and future generations to be our key priorities.

      "SummaryText": "es\n\nThe Gastonia plant has several programs and policies to deal directly with accidental release and \nemergency response.  Additionally, an Environmental Management Manual has been prepared as part\nof their ISO 14000 Registration.  Included in that manual are several policies, which also address release prevention and emergency response.\n\nRelease Prevention\n\nThe storage and handling of TDI is covered in several significant environmental aspects (Gastonia \nWSP #41).  Preventive maintenance, daily inspection documentation, and internal reporting requirements\nare covered in WSP #23, and SOP #30.\n\nEmergency Response\n\nEmergency response to a release of TDI is also covered in three main procedures:\n\nWSP #33 - Spill Prevention, Control and Countermeasures Plan, which includes TDI along with all other \nhazardous materials stored on site including fuel oil.\n\nSOP #25 - Emergency Procedure for Hazardous Release, which includes training, hazardous awareness, necessary PPE, and annual drills.\n\nWSP #28 - Emergency and Disaster Plan, which covers fires, natural disasters, civil disturbances, and\nbomb threats.\n\n\nWorst Case Release Scenario\n\nThe worst case release scenario modeled by Chemtura Corporation involves a release from our toluene di-isocyanate (TDI) storage tank equivalent to a 2-inch valve breaking.  The valve in this scenario would spill approximately 122,400 pounds of TDI into the secondary containment dike surrounding this tank.  The presence of this dike serves to limit the surface area of the spill, which extends the amount of time necessary for this material to completely evaporate.\n\nThe RMP submit Program Limits will not accept the actual modeling data.  \nActual modeling data is as follows\nTotal Quantity Released (Toxic Liquid Pool and Evaporation with Dike)  - 122,400 pounds\nEvaporation Rate - 0.02 pounds per minute\nRelease Duration - 6,120,000 minutes\n\nAs demonstrated by the above data, it would take many days for this material to completely evaporate due to the"

Chemtura Corporation has emergency response and cleanup plans in place, and would clean up a release of TDI as quickly as possible to minimize impact to the environment and neighboring community.\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nChemtura Corporation has not had a release of TDI with an off-site impact during the past five years.\n\nPlanned Safety Related Changes\n\nChemtura Corporation operates the Gastonia Plant with Safety as a high priority.  There are no safety related improvements identified for implementation by Chemtura at this time."
