No property damage or off-site impacts resulted from the incident. \n\nA release  of 35 pounds of hydrocyanic acid from a valve resulted in one on-site injury.  The release escaped off-site; however, no off-site impact resulted due to the small quantity and dissipation to harmless concentrations prior to off-site discharge.
