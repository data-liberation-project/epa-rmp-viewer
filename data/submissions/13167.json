This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n\n2.\tThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities encompass CONCENTRATE MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS PEPSICO PR.  We have one regulated flammable mixture present at our facility.  This flammable mixture is composing of Ethanol and Acetaldehyde.  The Flammable mixture is used for manufacturing of concentrate.\n\n\n3.\tThe Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used the EPA's OCA Guidance Reference Tables or Equations.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 flammable substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from CONCENTRATE MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS PEPSICO PR.  In this scenario 15000 lb. of flammable Mixture: Acetaldehyde is released.  The release quantity has been limited to 50% of the maximum capacity of the source by a system of administrative controls.  It is assumed that the entire quantity is released as a vapor, which finds an ignition source, with 10 percent of the released quantity participating in a vapor cloud explosion.  Under worst case weather conditions, the calculated distance of 0.16 m"

These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nTraining\nCONCENTRATE MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS PEPSICO PR has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Refresher training is provided at least once per year and more frequently as needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nCONCENTRATE MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS PEPSICO PR carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nManagement of Change\nWritten procedures are in place at CONCENTRATE MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS PEPSICO PR to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures.  The most recent review/revision of maintenance procedures was performed on 01/04/1999.  Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification.\n\nPre-startup Reviews\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new proc"

The release is assumed to result in a Vapor Cloud Explosion.  The scenario involves the release of 200.88 lb. of Flammable Mixture: Acetaldehyde in  minutes.  Passive mitigation controls such as sprinkler system and Drainage are taken into account to calculate the scenario.  The release is also controlled by active mitigation measures that include fire & smoke detector.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the flammable endpoint of 1 psi overpressure is 0.03 miles.\n\n4.\tThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-58 Standard, 1967 Edition.    The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nCONCENTRATE MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS PEPSICO PR maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses is What If/Checklist (combined).  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regularly period at which it is necessary.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.  The most recent PHA/update was performed on 02/11/1998.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFo"

Due to our stringent release prevention policies, there has been no accidental release during this period.\n\n6.\tEmergency Response Plan\nCONCENTRATE MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS PEPSICO PR carries a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials.  The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas.\n\nTo ensure proper functioning, our emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced.  In addition, the plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within our processes that would require a modified emergency response.\n\n7.\tPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\nCONCENTRATE MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS PEPSICO PR will continue to emphasize and enhance existing safety programs by continuing our monthly safety meeting for all employees.  Additionally, supervisory and technical personnel will attend selected outside safety seminars to learn about and implement any changes in OSHA and EPA regulations.  These changes are expected to be implemented by December 1999."
