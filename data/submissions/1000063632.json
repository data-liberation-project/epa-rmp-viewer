Executive Summary\n\n\n\nThis program is intended to meet the spirit and intent of the following regulations:\n\n- California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program - Title 19 CCR, Chapter 4.5\n\n- Federal EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) - Title 40 CFR ?68\n\n- California Process Safety Management (PSM) Program, Title 8 CCR ?5189\n\n- Federal Process Safety Management (PSM) Program, Title 29 CFR ?1910.119\n\n\n\nHereafter this program will be referred to as the RMP-PSM program.\n\n\n\nThis program is intended to be a \"living document\". As such, the information, procedures, policies, and documentation that make up \n\nthis program must be made easily accessible and updated as necessary. To accomplish this, Delicato Vineyards Manteca has elected to use PSMWriter, software developed and distributed by Resource Compliance, Inc. This software will assist us with updating, maintaining, scheduling, and tracking RMP-PSM related activities. \n\n\n\n1.1 Delicato Vineyards Manteca, Risk and Process Safety Management Program\n\n\n\nThis is to inform all interested persons, including employees, that Delicato Vineyards Manteca (DVM) has updated their unified RMP-PSM Program.

The program enables our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of hazardous chemicals. Overall, the program is designed to prevent accidental fatalities, injuries, illnesses, and physical property damage.\n\n\n\nOur company has many policies and procedures in place to promote overall plant, worker and public safety. We have: \n\n1. Prepared a unified program based on the PSM regulation to meet CalARP and RMP obligations as well\n\n2. Organized the program so that it meshes closely with general business practices\n\n3. Utilized PSMWriter software to ensure that all necessary employees have access to relevant information (SOPs, PHAs, audits, etc.)\n\n\n\nThe RMP-PSM program sets forth rules, procedures, and practices that will help our employees and neighbors protect themselves.\n\n\n\n1.2 Process Descriptions\n\n\n\nDelicato Family Vineyards Manteca - operates a processing facility for wine in Manteca, CA.

From there, low pressure liquid is pumped to each of the wine tanks, where it passes through a solenoid valve, hand expansion valve and into the jacket of the wine tank.

The high pressure discharge from the compressors is sent to a water cooled evaporative condenser where the high pressure gas ammonia is liquefied and returned to the high pressure receiver. In addition, high pressure liquid is pipe to the heat exchangers where it passes through an expansion valve and into the heat exchangers as a low temperature and low pressure liquid.

As such, each refrigeration system at Delicato Family Vineyards Manteca is treated as a single process.\n\n\n\n1.3 General Accident Release & Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\n1.3.1 General \n\n\n\nWe inform our employees engaged in process operations of the dangers of an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia in annual safety meetings. During these meeting we also discuss preventative measures, such as evacuation, in order to be prepared for a release.\n\n\n\nDelicato Vineyards Manteca has also conducted an off-site consequence analysis of worst-case and alternative release scenarios for the ammonia refrigeration processes. These are for the purposes of informing the public in the event of an accidental release. The results of the analyses are reported in PSMWriter and hard copy binders. \n\n\n\n1.3.2 Anhydrous Ammonia\n\n\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration process at the Delicato Vineyards Manteca facility is an"

It is extremely important that this process is maintained and operated in a safe and efficient manner. Management is committed to making sure that employees are made aware of the potential danger of an ammonia leak.\n\n\n\nOur refrigeration personnel monitor the ammonia refrigeration process and keep an active log book of all procedures and transactions that pertain to ammonia. In addition, the process is checked frequently by one of the outside refrigeration contractors that we use. These contractors also assist in performing the annual mechanical integrity inspection of our ammonia equipment. \n\n \n\n1.4 Five Year Accident History\n\n\n\n1.4.1 Anhydrous Ammonia Accidental Releases\n\n\n\nDuring the last five years, there has not been an ammonia accident which caused injuries, or other known offsite/onsite deaths, property damage, environmental damage, sheltering in place or evacuations.\n\n\n\n1.5 Emergency Action and Response Plan\n\nDelicato Vineyards Manteca's emergency action and response program has been developed to satisfy the following requirements:\n\n- Cal/OSHA's Emergency Action Plan - Title 8 CCR ?3220\n\n- U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) Emergency Action Plans - Title 29 CFR ?1910.38\n\n- Cal/OSHA's Process Safety Management [Emergency Response Program Requirements] - Title 8 CCR ?5189(n)\n\n- U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) Process Safety Management [Emergency Planning and Response Requirements]- Title 29 CFR ?1910.119(n)\n\n- California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program [Emergency Response Program Requirements] - Title 19 CCR, Division 2, Chapter 4.5 ?2765.1-2765.2\n\n- USEPA Risk Management Program [Emergency Response Program Requirements] - Title 40 CFR ?68.95\n\n- California Hazardous Materials Business Plan (HMBP) [Emergency Response Plans and Procedures] - Title 19 CC"

However, since Delicato Manteca does not provide Hazmat Technician Training and has not developed a full Offensive Hazmat Technician Team, these employees are subject to the policies and procedures of the responding emergency response agency if a Hazmat Team is required. It is assumed that the policies and procedures of the responding agency would be consistent with the requirements of HAZWOPER regulations.\n\n\n\n1.6 Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nDelicato Vineyards Manteca has implemented many policies and procedures to promote overall plant, worker and public safety. Nevertheless, Delicato Vineyards Manteca continually strives to improve in all areas, including safety.\n\n\n\nBy utilizing PSMWriter software, all necessary employees have access to every aspect of the RMP-PSM program. This has improved Delicato Vineyards Manteca's ability to communicate hazardous situations to employees and contractors. In addition, PSMWriter tracks all RMP-PSM related events so that Delicato Vineyards Manteca's management team can ensure that the RMP-PSM program is being implemented.\n\n\n\nDelicato Vineyards Manteca has implemented all aspects of the RMP-PSM program.
