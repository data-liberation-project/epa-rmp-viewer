If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with local emergency response personnel to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to the local surroundings.\n\nFACILITY INFORMATION\n*Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for sale to growers.\n*The maxium quantity of stored anhydrous ammonia would be 132,000 pounds.\n\nWORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO\nThe worst case release of anhydrous ammonia would be the release from the largest vessel identified  as holding 79,000 pounds of  anhydrous ammonia liquified under pressure by design standards. By using RMP Comp it was determined that a release of this would meet the endpoint of 4.2 miles. The impact would be on residents of about 55 people.\n\nALTERNATIVE RELEASE CASE SCENARIO\nThe alternative case release of anhydrous ammonia was to demonstrate a ruptured anhydrous transfer hose while off loading. The case would show a release of 11908 pounds of ammonia over a 2 minute period with an effect of a reading of 2.5  miles to the toxic endpoint. Estimated receptors would be 30 people. \n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT\nIt was found that there has been no accidents or reportable off-premisee release at this facility. The emergency  response program is on file with the Local Emergency Planning Coordinator. Safety improvement is an ongoing process at the Radium Coop. Evaluations of anhydrous ammonia are periodically performed to assess the safety of our equipment."
