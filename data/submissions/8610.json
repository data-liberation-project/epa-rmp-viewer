      "SummaryText": "HUNTSMAN CONROE - EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n \n1.  Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies.  Huntsman Conroe is committed to providing a safe, healthy and environmentally conscious work place for its employees and neighbors.  This is exemplified by the Conroe Site having earned the Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA) Star award for excellence in safety performance.  The Huntsman Conroe site maintains a working PSM program, which implements a series of steps to prevent potential hazards associated with the process and assures a well-trained work force.   The PSM program further implements its policies with onsite procedures and manuals.  Huntsman Conroe participates with community agencies to develop emergency response plans and participates in cooperative training with these agencies.  Since its certification in September 1992, the Conroe Site has been an active participant in the International Standards Organization (ISO) 9002 quality management program.\n \n2.  Regulated Substances Huntsman's Conroe site is located about five miles east of Conroe, Texas.  The site is 476 acres, of which 100 acres have been developed.  The Conroe Site takes raw materials and uses batch or continuous operations to produce useful chemicals which other companies then process into cosmetics, epoxy coatings and other consumer products.  Huntsman's Conroe Site has 9 regulated substances at the facility.\t\nThe three flammable substances are:\n7 Dimethylamine (DMA) - Used in hair products, gasoline additives, as antistatic agents, fabric softeners and dyes.\n7 Hydrogen - Used to produce fuel additives and epoxy curing agents.\n7 Monomethylamine (MMA) - Used in gas treating of refinery and natural gas streams and as a textile softener.\nThe six toxic substances are:\n7 Acrylonitrile - Used in making floor waxes, water treating chemicals and agricultural chemicals.\n7 Ammonia - Used to make printing dyes and as additives for fuels and lube oils.\t\n7 Ethylene Diamine (EDA"

Offsite Consequence Analysis  \nThe RMP Rule requires that offsite consequence analysis (OCA) be performed to estimate the potential for an accidental release of a regulated substance to affect the public or the environment.  This OCA includes the development of worst and alternative release scenarios for the release of toxic and flammable substances.  The OCA allows for the consideration of administrative controls in estimating potential scenario impacts.  \n\nWorst Case Release Scenarios\nThese worst case scenarios are based on EPA required assumptions, are highly unlikely, and have never occurred at this facility.\n\nThe worst case scenario associated with the release of flammable substances is a vapor cloud explosion (VCE), involving the full inventory of the largest storage tank containing DMA.  The analysis assumes that the maximum possible inventory of 510,000 pounds is released, completely vaporizes and ignites, resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  The VCE would reach offsite and may affect nearby public receptors.\n\nThe worst case scenario associated with toxic substances is the failure of an ethylene oxide railcar, resulting in the release of 180,000 pounds of ethylene oxide over a 10-minute period.  This worst case scenario has the potential to affect offsite receptors.\n\nAlternative Case Release Scenarios  \nThe alternative case scenario for flammable substances is the failure of a sight glass on a knock out pot at the hydrogen compressor, resulting in the release of 3,700 pounds of hydrogen.  This alternative case scenario has the potential to affect offsite receptors. Fire monitors were considered active mitigation.\n\nThe alterna"

This alternative case scenario has the potential to affect offsite receptors.  Active mitigation considered for this scenario is emergency shutdown systems and fire monitors.\n\nThe alternative case scenario for ammonia is a gasket leak resulting in the release of 430 pounds of ammonia over a 6-minute period.  This alternative case scenario has the potential to affect offsite receptors.  Active mitigation considered for this scenario includes emergency shutdown systems and fire monitors. \n\nThe alternative case scenario for ethylenediamine is a hose rupture on the EDA isotainer resulting in the release of 190 pounds of EDA over a 1-minute period.  This alternative case scenario has the potential to affect offsite receptors.  Emergency shutdown systems and fire monitors were active mitigation considered for this scenario. \n\nThe alternative case scenario for ethylene oxide is a gasket failure on the feed line to the reactor, resulting in the release of 17,000 pounds of ethylene oxide over a 5-minute period.  This alternative case scenario has the potential to affect offsite receptors.  Active mitigation for this scenario includes emergency shutdown systems, gas detectors, interlocks and fire monitors.\n\nThe alternative case scenario for formaldehyde is a gasket failure on the formaldehyde tank that results in the release of 10 pounds of formaldehyde over a 6-minute period.  This alternative case scenario has the potential to affect offsite receptors.  Fire monitors were considered as active mitigation for this scenario.\n\nThe alternative case scenario for propylene oxide is a flange failure on the feed line to the reactors, resulting in 16,000 pounds of PO released over a 5-minute period.
