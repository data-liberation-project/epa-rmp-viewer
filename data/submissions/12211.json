      "SummaryText": "Specialty Chemical Manufacturing, Inc.is a chemical compounding and blending company in the area of detergents and cleaning compounds. 70% Hydrofluoric acid is a raw material we use to manufacture aluminum coil cleaners. This is the only regulated material at this facility. Our accidental release program is based on the elements required by the EPA risk management program. The emergency response program also follows the standard guidelines.Other data relating to prevention and emergengy response are included in this plan.The worst case scenario is based on the loss of a 55-gallon drum of material into the recieving area adjacent to the city street; the details of this assessment are included in this plan. The alternative release scenario is based on the failure of a transfer pump and/or the associated piping, resulting in the loss of 0-15 pounds of 70% hydrofluoric acid in the production area of the plant during a batch manufacture process. The safety handling plan and the emergency procedures used in the manufacturing program are designed to minimize toxic releases. The details of the plan are included in this RMP. Specialty Chemical Manufacturing, Inc. has experienced no toxic release incidents to date. Specialty Chemical Manufacturing and Diversitech, Inc., our parent company are committed to maintaining a safe workplace, and minimizing any pollution sources. Our safety, environmental, and risk management are effective, and we have ongoing PHA and safety training programs to keep abreast of new developments, equipment and ideas."
