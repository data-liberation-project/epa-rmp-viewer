The Facility Policy:\n\nThe owners, management, and employees of Hyman Farm Service, LLC are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, and other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2.    Facility Information:\n\nA?    The primary activity at the facility is the storage of fertilizers for sale to farmers.\nA?    Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for the direct application of fertilizers for crop production nutrients.\nA?       The maximum quantity stored would be 656,625 pounds in our 5 30,000 gallon storage tanks,  1,400,800 pounds in our 10 32,000 gallon storage tanks,  288,915 pounds in our 3 22,000 gallon storage tanks, and 315,180 pounds in our 4 18,000 gallon storage tanks.  The total maximum quantity stored would be 2,661,520 pounds.  Due to the rounding requirements of the RMP Submit Program the 2,661,520 pounds is rounded to 2,700,000 pounds.\n\n3.    The worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario:\n\na.    The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tanks (or tank car) released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 140,080 pounds, which represents the volume of our largest storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards.  Due to the rounding requirements of the RMP Submit Program the 140,080 pounds is rounded to 140,000 pounds.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 2.5 miles.\nb.    The alternative release scenario based on the five-year accident history (or the most likely potential incident) is a release from a break in a transfer hose.  T"

The accidental release prevention program:\n\nThe facility has referred to the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, Kk-611.1\", published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc., and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\".\n\n5.    The Five-year Accident History:\n\na.    There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that:\n\nA?    Have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor\nA?    To our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n\n\n6.

Planned Changes to Improve Safety:\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
