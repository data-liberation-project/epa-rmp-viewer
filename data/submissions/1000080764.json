      "SummaryText": "Grain Craft Ogden treats flours with chlorine gas to enhance performance in the production of certain baked products such as cakes, cookies and tortillas.  Subsequently, equipment and operational techniques have evolved that ensure the process is carried out with very little risk to employees and the public.  The mechanical systems in place are \"State of the art\" for our industry.  Systems are in place which include training of operators, continuous electronic montitoring devices, and routine inspection by our operators. We have relied on expert third party inspection and maintenance for many years.  We have implemented OSHA PSM standards at the facility as well.  The process draws chlorine gas from ton cylinders by generating a vacuum.  In the event of a failure in any of the application equipment the vacuum is lost and chlorine gas flow stops.  Electrical interlocking of application equipment ensures that unless all processes function properly, gas is not allowed to leave the manifold.  In addition, electronic sensors, located in areas adjacent to the point of application and the storage room will sound an alarm and shut the system down should chlorine be detected in the atmosphere.\n\n   Grain Craft has an emergency action plan in place in the event of a Chlorine release.  Our position regarding response is to defer to our LEPC, as they are the appropriate personnel to respond to a catastrophic release.  It is our policy to respond by calling 911.  The 911 dispach will notify the fire department, which includes the HAZMAT team.  The fire departments' HAZMAT Team Leader will act as the site coordinator.  The fire department will coordinate with other public agencies and conduct public notification and evacuation if necessary.  The HAZMAT team is familiar with our ton containers and ancillary mitigation devices.  Grain Craft will notify CHLOREP and EPA National Response Center initially, then follow up when the exact amount of the release is known.  \n\n     Grain Craf"
