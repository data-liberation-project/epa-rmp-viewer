Plant in Lorain serves the sewer customers on the west side of Lorain and a portion of Amherst Township. The population served is about 15,000.  The treated water is discharged into Lake Erie after being disinfected with chlorine.  The plant has been in service since 1988.\n\nAPPLICABILITY\n\nThe P.Q.M. Plant has liquid chlorine in average inventory from 1000 to 5000 pounds.  This chlorine is contained in one-ton cylinders.  The maximum storage used would hold 8000 pounds.  Additionally, there are public receptors in the offsite impact area.  Therefore, the plant is subject to program 3 requirements of 40CFR68.  \n\nWORST-CASE SCENARIO\n\nThe worst incident would be the rupture of a one-ton cylinder of chlorine and a release of the full contents.  This event is very unlikely and has never happened in Lorain.  The cylinders are contained indoors, which would contain much of the discharge.\n\nA rupture would create a vulnerability zone of 0.9 miles with a discharge rate of 110 pounds per minute.  \n\nIn this zone there would be some homes, apartments, a marina complex, and   a hospital. Most of the gas would localize in the low area east of the plant and in the low area of the marinas. \n\nThe gas would have no affect on the utilities in the area.  Plant life would be affected, but no damage would be permanent to them or the waterways.\n\nRoads abutting the plant and the railroad across the street may need to be closed temporarily.  There would be no damage to these or any other permanent structures.\n\nThe Lorain Fire Department would be called in to notify the public and evacuate them.  The system would be shut down by plant personnel as soon as the leak is detected to minimize the quantity released.   The Lorain County Local Emergency Planning Committee also has the Risk And Vulnerability Survey and would be called in to help.\n\nThe cylinders are stored in a closed room and are"

      "SummaryText": " inspected many times a day by the shift operators.  Any leak would be quickly picked up by our leak detectors.  The scenario would be unlikely.\n\nALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\nThe most likely scenario for an alternative release is the rupture of a line, valve, or pressure diaphragm.  Each case would lead to the release of 600 pounds of chlorine maximum.  This quantity would not leave the site since the distance would be a maximum of 0.2 miles.  The distance would probably be much less since all the equipment is enclosed in a room.  \n\nThe operator on duty would be alerted by a leak detector and would put on a SCBA unit and turn off the chlorine at the cylinder.  This response would be sooner than the projected release time and minimize any chlorine in the atmosphere.  Then, he would call a supervisor and the needed maintenance personnel would come in to correct the equipment failure.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere has been no release of chlorine in the past five years at the P.Q.M. Plant.\n\nSAFETY AND PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe P.Q.M. Plant has chlorine leak detectors located in the cylinder storage room and the feeder rooms.  These detectors have both visual and audio alarms.  Also they are linked to the main computer and send an alarm and print out a record of the alarm.  These units are tested monthly and inspected several times during the day.  These devices would minimize the amount of chlorine that would leak.\n\nThe material safety data sheet is located in the MSDS station in the maintenance garage and available to all the operators.\n\nHAZARD REVIEW AND OPERATING PROCEDURES\n\nWe are dedicated to plant safety for both the benefit of the public and the employees.  We update the emergency contingency plan at least once a year.  This plan contains a section to instruct the operators on how to handle different chlorine situations. The operators, also, have a manual provided for standard procedures that was prepared by the design engineer, C-T Consultants.\n\nTRAINING\n\nEa"

Additionally, the employees are given drills and training in:\n    1.  use of air packs\n    2.  use of chlorine \"B\" kit\n    3.  chlorine safety workshops\n    4.  CPR and First aid classes\n    5.  books videos on chlorine safety\n\n\n\n\nMAINTENANCE\n\nThe equipment is inspected several times a day visually.  The flex lines are replaced once a year.  If ever a leak would occur, the parts would be replaced with new parts from the manufacturer and the old parts would be discarded.\n\nThe maintenance program is followed either by the WEF MOP 11 or the manufactures recommendations.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nA leak event at the P.Q.M. Plant is very unlikely.  We practice good safety and maintenance practices.  All the employees are well trained and respect the possible danger of the chlorine.  In the event of any leak, they are trained to respond quickly and minimize the quantity that may escape.\n\nSafety is a well-coordinated effort between management and the employees and has proven to work.  This is why there have never been any chlorine leak events at the plant since it's opening.  We plan to continue this good record.\n\n 1/04/01  \n"
