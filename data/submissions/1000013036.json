Introduction\n\nAkzo Nobel Surface Chemistry is committed to operating in a manner that is safe for our employees, contractors, the public and the environment.  As part of this commitment, Akzo Nobel Surface Chemistry has established a system to help assure the safe operation of chemical processes at this facility.  One part of this system is a risk management program (RMP) that is required by the USEPA's Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions in Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations Part 68. One of the requirements of the regulations is to submit a Risk Management Plan (RM Plan), which describes the risk management programs at the facility for review by the USEPA and the public.\n\n2. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nAkzo Nobel Surface Chemistry is committed to the safety of its employees, contractors, the public and the environment through the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances. In the event of a significant accidental release, our personnel will respond to control and contain the releases.  In most foreseeable circumstances, releases could be controlled by shutting down operations and/or by applying generous quantities of water to absorb and dilute the release since all of our regulated chemicals are water soluble. If necessary, Akzo Nobel Surface Chemistry will evacuate onsite personnel and contact the local emergency planning committee (LEPC), fire department, and police to help handle the emergency and to help warn the public.  Akzo Nobel Surface Chemistry Houston Plant also has an automated system in place to contact potentially affected members of community by telephone to provide rapid communication of an potential chemcial hazard.\n\n3.

Sulfur dioxide is used as a raw material to make products used in oil and gas production.\n\nThe following is a list of the regulated chemicals handled in each process:\n\n\nProcess            Regulated Substances    \n\n Oxylation        Ethylene Oxide         \n            Propylene Oxide        \n\nNeutralization        Isopropyl Amine        \n            Aqueous Ammonia    \n\nSulfur dioxide         Sulfur Dioxide        \nStorage\n\n\n4.    General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at Akzo Nobel Surface Chemistry Houston Plant:\n\n4.1    Employee participation\n\nAkzo Nobel Surface Chemistry encourages and insists upon employee participation in process safety management.  Knowledgeable operators write or review operating procedures, and are included in process hazard analyses.  Employees attend safety meetings monthly. Meetings begin with a safety topic to increase safety awareness and employee involvement. Several operators have been pulled off of regular duties for extended periods to review and comment on new designs and to help train themselves and others on major process changes before implementation. \n\n4.2    Process Safety Information\n\nThe Plant maintains extensive information on its chemical hazards, processes, procedures and equipment, which is used by employees as needed to help them do their jobs safely. \n\n4.3    Process Hazard Analysis\n\nNew and existing processes are examined using formalized methods of hazard analysis.  These methods are designed to help knowledgeable employees recognize process hazards. Recommended actions are tracked until resolution.\n\n4.4    Operating Procedures\n\nThe Houston Plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of operation for "

The safety topics are posted on a safety calendar, which is available to employees. Initial training is provided to new employees.  Experienced operators train new employees on the proper operating procedures until they believe from direct observation that the new employee is ready to run the process. Written tests are also used to verify that employees understand the training and operating manuals. Refresher training is conducted periodically. \n\n4.6    Contractors\n\nThe Houston Plant uses contractors to supplement its work force during periods of increased construction or maintenance activities.  Contractor's safety performance is reviewed before hiring the contractors.  Contractors are given safety training prior to being allowed to work in the plant to help assure that our safety procedures are followed. A permit system is in place, which requires contractors to obtain written approval in the form of a work permit from knowledgeable Plant personnel before work by a contractor commences on a regulated process.  Contractors are informed of the process hazards before written approval to commence work is given. The Houston AkzoNobel plant is in process of enhancing its contractor safety training program by requiring contractor to be trained by the Houston Area Safety Council.\n\n4.7    Pre-startup safety review (PSSR)\n\nThe facility conducts a PSSR before new or modified processes are operated to make sure that the new or modified facilities and the associated procedures are safe to use for operation. \n\n4.8    Mechanical Integrity\n\nThe facility has an ongoing system to maintain the process equipment in good working order as needed for safe operation.

Equipment containing regulated toxic or regulated flammable substances are given the highest priority in the mechanical integrity system.\n\n4.9    Safe Work Practices\n\nThe facility has permit systems in place to make sure that hazardous activities such as hot work, entering vessels and confined spaces, and opening pipelines are performed safely by requiring that knowledgeable persons from operations and maintenance provide written permission before such work can be performed. \n\n4.10    Management of Change\n\nThe facility has procedures in place to manage changes to procedures and equipment safely.  Operations and engineering management personnel assure that changes are not authorized until it is safe to do so and the necessary safety requirements are met.\n\n4.11    Incident Investigation\n\nThe facility requires the reporting and investigation of incidents that result in or could reasonably have resulted in a fire, explosion, or toxic release. Any urgent recommendations resulting from the incident investigation are addressed promptly and other recommendations are tracked until they are resolved.  A file is maintained to record the incident history for review and for consideration in the next process hazard analysis.\n\n4.12    Audits\n\nAudits are conducted every 3 years and reports are written to which the facility must respond.  The status of recommendations is tracked until resolution.\n\n5.    Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe hazards of the processes operated at the facility are managed safely with the help of the programs previously described.

Leak sensors provide alarms if leaks are detected and deluge systems are provided for tank, unloading and reactor areas to absorb leaks.  Dikes are provided for the storage tanks.  All of the vessels are protected with self-closing relief valves and all of the vessels are maintained under an inert atmosphere.\n\nThe ethylene oxide and propylene oxide suppliers have well developed product stewardship programs and periodically visit the site to provide assistance in the safe handling of oxides and special training materials are provided.\n\n\n5.2    Isopropylamine and Ammonia\n\nThe isopropylamine and aqueous ammonia are stored at ambient temperatures under  nitrogen blankets.  Any spilled material would be contained on the plant site and flow to and be diluted in a wastewater basin. A firewater monitor nozzle is located nearby for use in fighting fires or diluting leaks to reduce the chance of a fire or to greatly lessen the impact of a toxic release.  A scrubber is provided to absorb vapors from normal venting or emergency relief.\n\n5.3    Sulfur dioxide storage\n\nThe sulfur dioxide is stored in thick walled steel containers to resist breakage from mishandling.  Each container holds about 200 gallons, which is less than the threshold quantity of sulfur dioxide. The cylinder storage area is protected from traffic by a wall and steel barriers. The cylinders are not stored near other tanks or containers. The plant has repair kits to help stop leaks and leakage could be absorbed with firewater. \n\n6.

Facility Improvements\n\nEquipment for the storage and reaction of ethylene oxide (EO) and propylene oxide (PO) was put into service on November 29, 1999. The new storage tanks are located away from employees and the public and the new designs incorporate Akzo Nobel Surface Chemistry's latest safety technology for process control, emergency shutdown systems, leak detection, emergency response, deluge systems, emergency cooling vents, vent scrubbing systems, and spill containment to contain both spilled material and emergency water.  The risk management plan was updated within 6 months of the startup of this new equipment. \n\nTwo major risk reduction projects were completed in 2004 to address recommendations from process hazard analyses. First, new pipelines were put into service September 24, 2004 to supply EO and PO to existing reactor systems from the new EO and PO storage tanks.  As a result of being able to supply EO and PO from these new pipelines, storage requirements for EO and PO have been reduced from 12 tanks to 2 tanks, thereby reducing risk to our employees and the community.  Second, control systems were upgraded for the existing EO and PO reaction facilities.  The Risk Management Plan is was updated within 6 months of EO and PO being first introduced into the new pipelines.\n\n\n\n"
