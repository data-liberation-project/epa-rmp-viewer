The safety topics are posted on a safety calendar, which is available to employees. Initial training is provided to new employees.  Experienced operators train new employees on the proper operating procedures until they believe from direct observation that the new employee is ready to run the process. Written tests are also used to verify that employees understand the training and operating manuals. Refresher training is conducted periodically. \n\n4.6\tContractors\n\nThe Houston Plant uses contractors to supplement its work force during periods of increased construction or maintenance activities.  Contractor's safety performance is reviewed before hiring the contractors.  Contractors are given safety training prior to being allowed to work in the plant to help assure that our safety procedures are followed. A permit system is in place, which requires contractors to obtain written approval in the form of a work permit from knowledgeable Plant personnel before work by a contractor commences on a regulated process.  Contractors are informed of the process hazards before written approval to commence work is given. The Houston AkzoNobel plant is in process of enhancing its contractor safety training program by requiring contractor to be trained by the Houston Area Safety Council.\n\n4.7\tPre-startup safety review (PSSR)\n\nThe facility conducts a PSSR before new or modified processes are operated to make sure that the new or modified facilities and the associated procedures are safe to use for operation. \n\n4.8\tMechanical Integrity\n\nThe facility has an ongoing system to maintain the process equipment in good working order as needed for safe operation.

Operations and engineering management personnel assure that changes are not authorized until it is safe to do so and the necessary safety requirements are met.\n\n4.11\tIncident Investigation\n\nThe facility requires the reporting and investigation of incidents that result in or could reasonably have resulted in a fire, explosion, or toxic release. Any urgent recommendations resulting from the incident investigation are addressed promptly and other recommendations are tracked until they are resolved.  A file is maintained to record the incident history for review and for consideration in the next process hazard analysis.\n\n4.12\tAudits\n\nAudits are conducted every 3 years and reports are written to which the facility must respond.

Any spilled material would be contained on the plant site and flow to and be diluted in a wastewater basin. A firewater monitor nozzle is located nearby for use in fighting fires or diluting leaks to reduce the chance of a fire or to greatly lessen the impact of a toxic release.  A scrubber is provided to absorb vapors from normal venting or emergency relief.\n\n5.3\tSulfur dioxide storage\n\nThe sulfur dioxide is stored in thick walled steel containers to resist breakage from mishandling.  Each container holds about 200 gallons, which is less than the threshold quantity of sulfur dioxide. The cylinder storage area is protected from traffic by a wall and steel barriers.

The new storage tanks are located away from employees and the public and the new designs incorporate Akzo Nobel Surface Chemistry's latest safety technology for process control, emergency shutdown systems, leak detection, emergency response, deluge systems, emergency cooling vents, vent scrubbing systems, and spill containment to contain both spilled material and emergency water.  The risk management plan was updated within 6 months of the startup of this new equipment. \n\nTwo major risk reduction projects were completed in 2004 to address recommendations from process hazard analyses. First, new pipelines were put into service September 24, 2004 to supply EO and PO to existing reactor systems from the new EO and PO storage tanks.  As a result of being able to supply EO and PO from these new pipelines, storage requirements for EO and PO have been reduced from 12 tanks to 2 tanks, thereby reducing risk to our employees and the community.  Second, control systems were upgraded for the existing EO and PO reaction facilities.  The Risk Management Plan is was updated within 6 months of EO and PO being first introduced into the new pipelines."

As part of this commitment, Akzo Nobel Surface Chemistry has established a system to help assure the safe operation of chemical processes at this facility.  One part of this system is a risk management program (RMP) that is required by the USEPA's Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions in Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations Part 68. One of the requirements of the regulations is to submit a Risk Management Plan (RM Plan), which describes the risk management programs at the facility for review by the USEPA and the public.\n\n2. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nAkzo Nobel Surface Chemistry is committed to the safety of its employees, contractors, the public and the environment through the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances. In the event of a significant accidental release, our personnel will respond to control and contain the releases.  In most foreseeable circumstances, releases could be controlled by shutting down operations and/or by applying generous quantities of water to absorb and dilute the release since all of our regulated chemicals are water soluble. If necessary, Akzo Nobel Surface Chemistry will evacuate onsite personnel and contact the local emergency planning committee (LEPC), fire department, and police to help handle the emergency and to help warn the public.  Akzo Nobel Surface Chemistry Houston Plant also has an automated system in place to contact potentially affected members of community by telephone to provide rapid communication of an potential chemcial hazard.\n\n3.
