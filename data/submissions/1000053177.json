      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\n\n\n\nThe Ammonia Refrigeration System at North Country Dairy, LLC is a closed loop refrigeration system containing 17,563 lbs. of anhydrous ammonia, with 1,000 tons of refrigeration capacity via 8 compressors and 4 evaporative condensers.  The system utilizes two suction levels (23 and 28 psi) for all processing uses, and 40-45 psi for the HVAC load with one common discharge pressure of 185 psi.  The HVAC load can be handles by two dedicated compressors (C6 and C7) or during lighter demand via a pressure regulated bypass connection.  The system load consists of 28 air cooling units, 18 jacketed silos, 2 shell and tube glycol chillers, one ice builder and one air dryer.\n\n\n\n\n\nA.  Description of the Accident Release Prevention Program and Emergency Policies\n\nNCD takes many precautions to prevent or minimize accidental releases of ammonia from the refrigeration system.  These precautions include safety controls (alarms and automatic shutdown devices) which are designed to identify and prevent potentially unsafe conditions such as pressure increases that could cause a system failure.  NCD has also implemented a preventive maintenance program which is designed to maintain the ongoing integrity of the systems, a training program designed to ensure that the systems are operated by qualified associates, and emergency procedures designed to enable trained associates to respond quickly to system upsets.  The PSM/RMP Coordinator is responsible for the management of these ammonia safety programs.\n\n\n\n\n\nB.  The Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe Stationary Source is NCD's facility and Ammonia is the only substance covered by the Risk Management Plan Regulations at this facility.\n\n\n\n\n\nC.  Description of the Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe facility has a PSM/RMP Program that complies with both OSHA's Process Safety Management Standard and EPA's Risk Management Program and also serves as the Accidental Release Prevention Program.

Five-Year Accident History\n\nThere has been one ammonia-related incident at the facility over the past five years that resulted in offsite consequences as outlined in the Accident History Section of the RMP Submittal.\n\n\n\n\n\nE.  Description of the Emergency Response Program\n\nAn Emergency Action Plan (EAP) has been implemented at the facility.  The EAP contains procedures describing how the facility will react to ammonia spills or releases and other potential emergencies, including both shelter-in-place and evacuation procedures.  The program has been coordinated with local response agencies. \n\n\n\n\n\nF.  Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nWe have identified potential changes to improve the safety of our ammonia refrigeration system by conducting both Compliance Audit and a PHA Revalidation which generated recommendations to improve the safety of the system.  All recommendations are documented through meeting notes and/or action lists associated with the PSM/RMP Program.\n\n\n\n"
