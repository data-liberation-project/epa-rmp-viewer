Appropriate responses to release of Ammonia (anhydrous) are documented in the Risk Management Program (RMP) document. Safety, environmental protection, and risk management programs will be fully implemented by JBS Prepared Foods personnel and contractors and are coordinated with\ncommunity emergency responders for emergency planning and response efforts.\n\n(b) Stationary Source and Regulated Substance Handled \nJBS provides employment for approximately 214 workers at 3210 21st Avenue, Council Bluffs, Iowa 51501.  This facility is a meat processing plant owned by JBS USA, LLC, which has headquarters at 1770 Promontory Cir., Greeley, CO 80634. After reviewing the facility operations and the RMP regulations, it was determined that the entire facility is considered one process. JBS receives raw meat (i.e., pork, turkey, and beef). The meat is processed by washing, grinding, mixing with spices, and cooking. The cooked meat is smoked, sliced, and packaged (sandwich meat) for retail sale. From the time the meat products are received and throughout the processes conducted, the facility maintains a cool temperature utilizing a refrigeration process that uses Ammonia (anhydrous). Based on the facility processes and applicable regulations, it was determined that the facility is subject to Program 3 of the RMP regulation.\n\n(c) General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nProcess Safety Information: JBS completed a compilation of written process safety information to be used in conducting the process hazard analysis (PHA). The last PHA was conducted on April 1 and 2, 2024, using the process safety information gathered in order to identify and unde"

The PHA was conducted using the methodology specified in 40 CFR 68.67, and was performed by a team with expertise in engineering and process operations, including at least one employee who has expertise in the Ammonia refrigeration process, and at least one member knowledgeable in the specific PHA methodology used. A system has been established to promptly address the team's findings and recommendations; assure that the recommendations are resolved in a timely manner and that the resolution is documented; document what actions are to be completed; complete actions as soon as possible; develop a written schedule of when these actions are to be completed; and communicate the actions to operating, maintenance and other employees whose work assignments are in the process and who may be affected by the recommendations or actions.\n\nOperating Procedures: JBS developed and implemented written operating procedures to provide clear instructions for safely conducting activities at each operation where Ammonia (anhydrous) is utilized. These written operating procedures are consistent with the process safety information and address steps for each operating phase, operating limitations, safety and health considerations, and safety systems and their functions. These operating procedures are readily accessible to employees who work in or maintain the Ammonia refrigeration process.

These safe work practices apply to employees and contractor employees.\n\nTraining: JBS provides training for each employee associated with the Ammonia refrigeration process. This training includes an overview of the process and operating procedures as outlined by 40 CFR 68.71. Refresher training is provided at least every three (3) years and more often if necessary. JBS documents and maintains records of the employee, the date of training, and the means used to verify that the employee understood the training.\n\nMechanical Integrity: JBS has the following written documents and programs to maintain the on-going integrity of the equipment used in the Ammonia refrigeration process (i.e., storage tanks, piping systems, etc); additionally, inspections, testing, equipment deficiencies, and quality assurance are addressed:\n\nMechanical Integrity Study of Process Equipment\nPreventative Maintenance Program: Each person who has responsibilities to perform maintenance on the ammonia process components receives training at least every three (3) years and more often if necessary.\n\nManagement of Change: JBS established and implemented written procedures to manage changes to process chemicals, technology, equipment, and procedures; and, changes to JBS that affect the Ammonia refrigeration process.
