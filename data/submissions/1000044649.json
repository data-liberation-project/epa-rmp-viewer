      "SummaryText": "THATCHER COMPANY OF NEW YORK began operations in Williamson New York in 1990.  Initially, the company started out with only a handful of employees.  Operations have expanded over the years and currently the company employs about 25 people.  Most of the employees live in the immediate area.\n\n\n\nThe facility itself is an old fruit processing plant that was formerly owned by Seneca Foods.  The facility building has ample room for continued growth with over 140,000 square feet under roof.  \n\n\n\nTHATCHER COMPANY OF NEW YORK is a diversified growing chemical business which provides its employees with many opportunities to advance.  The company has four major business areas: (1) chemical manufacturing, (2) chemical distribution, (3) chemical compounding, and (4) chemical repackaging.  Our products include a variety of chemical specialties such as construction industry additives, water treatment chemicals, food & dairy industry cleaners and sanitizers, and photo chemicals.  We also blend, compound, and repackage for our customers.  Our products are sold throughout the USA, South America, and Canada.\n\n\n\nThe facility currently uses sulfur dioxide in the manufacturing process for some of its photo chemicals and water treatment chemicals. Because of the toxicity of sulfur dioxide, the EPA and OSHA have promulgated addition regulations in an effort to avoid accidental releases from occurring that would have an adverse effect on the general population and environment.   These regulations involve a detailed analysis of the process, equipment, training, and procedures used for handling and storage of these materials.  The analysis involves technical people and members of management as well as the operators that actually work with the materials.  Thatcher Company of New York has invested a large amount of resources in order to comply with these regulations.  \n\n\n\nAs a result of the process hazard analysis (PHA) for the chemical mentioned above, several redundant safety systems were ins"

The safety systems include a meter that are capable of detecting an excess of sulfur dioxide when it is present in the scrubber system, a meter that measure the pH of the scrubber solution, a meter that measures the flow of the scrubber solution, and a meter that measures line pressure in the sulfur dioxide liquid transfer piping.  These meters are connected to valves that are located on the supply side of the process and will automatically shut down the supply if certain limits are exceeded.  The valves can also be activated manually at seven different locations throughout the plant and office.  \n\n\n\nIn addition, there are pressure sensors and temperature sensors that have been installed at different locations in the process vessels to detect conditions that would be outside of the normal operating range.  These sensors are also tied into the valves located at the supply source.  \n\n\n\nThere is also constant visual monitoring of the sulfur dioxide supply source whenever it is used in the manufacturing process. Additional security measures have also been implemented with regards to sulfur dioxide that satisfy the Department of Homeland Security's Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards (CFATS).  \n\n\n\nMany standard operating procedures (SOP's) have been written that cover every aspect of the handling and storage of sulfur dioxide.  These SOP's include topics such as training, hooking up and unloading of the chemicals, manufacturing practices, equipment operation and maintenance, analytical and QC procedures, and specific safety requirements.  \n\n\n\nIn addition to the many SOP's, there are many hours of classroom and on-the-job training that are given to all operators that work with these processes.  All employees receive orientation classroom training that covers the basic safety information and procedures needed to work around hazardous chemicals.

These operators also receive first aid and CPR certification by the American Red Cross.   \n\n\n\nThe company is committed to providing a safe environment in which its employee's work and its neighbors live.  It maintains a proactive and positive relationship with the town officials and LEPC.  A representative from the company regularly attends the LEPC meetings and joint training sessions.  A copy of the company's emergency response plan (ERP) is maintained on file at the LEPC as well as the local fire department.  \n\n\n\nThe company has an excellent safety record handling sulfur dioxide.  There have been no reportable releases of this chemical in over 19 years.  In an effort to insure that this continues, the company regularly reviews and updates both SOP's and the training given to its employees.   "
