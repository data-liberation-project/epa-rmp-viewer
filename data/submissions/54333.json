The facility utilizes chlorine in one-ton capacity cylinders with a maximum of three cylinders stored at the facility. \n\nThe EPA Risk Management Program Rule requires that covered facilities report the number of accidental releases during the past five years. The Tahlequah Pumping and Water Treatment facility has experienced zero (0) chlorine releases during the past five years. \n\nThe Tahlequah Pumping and Water Treatment facility is attended at all times with trained operators, including personnel who are recognized as Certified Water Works Operators by the Oklahoma State Department of Health. To help ensure the safety of chlorine operations, the facility maintains the following information and programs: chlorine safety information, hazard reviews, operating procedures, maintenance procedures, training, and compliance audits. \n\nThe Tahlequah Pumping and Water Treatment facility is committed to continually improving the safety of its operations. For example, the facility utilizes a chlorine vacuum transfer system, a chlorine leak detector system,  and other safeguards. The facility has recently added a windsock to assist employees and emergency responders in determining wind direction. \n\nThe facility maintains an emergency action plan that includes instructions for immediately requesting assistance from the City of Tahlequah Fire Department in the event of an emergency release of chlorine and for making appropriate notifications to public agencies. Information has been provided to the Cherokee County LEPC for coordinating the facility's plans with community emergency response plans. The facility will con"
