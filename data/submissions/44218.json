Raw milk is received and made into a variety of cheese products.\n\nThe foods stored here require that they be kept cool until placed in refrigerated trucks for delivery to retail and wholesale outlets.  The facility refrigerate that is the focus of this program is ammonia.  \n\nHilmar Cheese Company operates one ammonia system which contains approximately 12,700 pounds. This ammount puts the facility in a program level 3 in the Risk Management and Process Safety Programs (known as CalARP in California regulations. \n\nPrevention: the ammonia processes have ammonia alarms, high and low pressure safety switches and reliefs on all pressure vessels and equipment.  Hilmar has a comprehensive line break procedure and has additional safety valves on all oil draining locations (self-closing valves).\n\nEmergency Response:  Hilmar Cheese Company maintains an emergency response team that all members have been trained to the technician level as described in 29CFR 1910.120q.  Hilmar Cheese Company also has several employees that are qualified to take charge of any emergency response occurring at this facility.\nTraining:  Hilmar Cheese Company employees working on or around the ammonia system are trained in:\n\n?    MOC procedures.  Mananagement of Change procedures protect the ammonia system from unauthorized repair or changes to the system without the appropriate supervisory approval.\n?    SOP procedures.  Standard Operating Procedures protect the mechanic or operator from injury with detailed instructions on making repairs(Line Breaks) safely.  These procedures are placed in the hands of any employee who has not performed the activity before with supervisory approval or direction.  These procedures apply to any contractors on site also.\n?    Emergency evacuation procedures in the event of an accidental release of ammonia.  These procedures are given to visitors(to the engine room and around the ammonia system) and contractors as well.\n?    Hot Work Permits protects the facility from fires or other accidents involving welding on the system outside the shop area.\n?    Confined Space procedures protect employees and contractor employees from injury when working in confined spaces.\n?    Lock-Out Tag-Out procedures protect mechanics and operators from accidental return of power to equipment being worked on.\n?    Incident Investigation of all ammonia releases of any amount and near misses to allow Hilmar Cheese Company to review procedures in place and discuss any changes that may improve work place safety.  These procedures also protect the community in the vicinty of the facility.\n\nThe principles upon which this program is based are: (1 Investigation and inspections to assure that the Hilmar Cheese Company facility in Hilmar was and continues to be designed by professionals in the refrigeration industry and (2 the facility is operating within that design.",
