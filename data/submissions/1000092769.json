Distribution Center operations include storage and distribution of perishable foods and grocery supplies.  Dillons has been in operation at this site for over 45 years providing quality grocery products to Dillons stores around the region.\r\n\r\nA.   Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n\r\nDillons Distribution Center recognizes management's responsibility in protecting its employees, the public, the environment, equipment, and property.  The safety and health of all personnel are very important.  The control of accidents has been and will continue to be a basic responsibility of all personnel in the Dillon Distribution Center.\r\n\r\nTo accomplish the company's goal in preventing accidents, the facility has established a Plant Safety Program.  The objectives of the Plant Safety Program are to: maximize safety performance, eliminate human suffering resulting from injuries and accidents and reduce losses associated with damage of property.\r\n\r\nOne of the activities associated with the Plant Safety Program has been the development and implementation of accidental release prevention and emergency response programs which are designed to comply with OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals, 29 CFR 1910.119), and EPA's Risk Management Program (RM program) regulation (Risk Management Programs for Chemical Accidental Release Prevention, 40 CFR Part 68). \r\n\r\nThe purpose of the accidental release prevention and emergency response programs is to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences of significant releases of toxic substances as well as fires, explosi"

Any recommendations are resolved to improve the safety of the facility. \r\n\r\n\t \tCompliance Audits: There are procedures to conduct regular audits of the RM prevention program to ensure that the program is in place and working properly.  Any recommendations from audits are resolved to improve the RM program. \r\n\r\nE.

Description of the Emergency Response Program\r\n\r\nAn emergency response program has been implemented at the Dillons Distribution Center facility.  This program, the DILLONS FOODS EMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN, contains procedures describing how the facility will respond to ammonia releases and other emergencies, including evacuation procedures and off site response procedures.  The program has been coordinated with the Hutchinson Fire Department and the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  The Fire Department tours the facility at least annually.\r\n\r\nThe facility has a trained HAZMAT Team which conducts annual exercises and training as required by the OSHA HAZWOPER Standards.\r\n\r\nThe emergency response program consists of the following elements:\r\n\r\n\t \tOrganization Plan and Responsibilities\r\n\t \tCommunications Procedures\r\n\t \tDetailed Action Plans\r\n\t \tFirst Aid Procedures\r\n\t \tEmergency Medical Treatment Procedures\r\n\t \tEvacuation Plans\r\n\t \tDescription of Outside Assistance Available\r\n\t \tSite Re-Entry Procedures\r\n\t \tTraining Programs and Drills\r\n\t\tOff Site Response Measures\r\n\r\nThe general public will be warned of response measures nec"

Overall, these programs help prevent accidental fatalities, injuries , illnesses, environmental impacts and physical property damage.\r\n\r\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response programs help prevent accidents because they focus on the rules, procedures, and practices that govern individual processes, activities, or pieces of equipment.  These rules are detailed and improved as necessary.  They are also communicated to and accepted by all employees at the facility.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the Plant Safety Program, Dillons Distribution Center follows these corporate safety guidelines. \r\n\r\n \tEmployee Handbook Plant Safety Rules\r\n \tKroger Contractor Safety Rules\r\n \tKroger Safety Inspection and Abatement Plans\r\n \tSafety Process Improvement Teams\r\n \t\r\n\r\n\r\nB.   Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\r\n\r\nDillons Distribution Center is part of Kroger Dedicated Logistics Inc.  The facility is a warehouse of over 350,000 sq. ft. that stores perishable and frozen food products for distribution to retail outlets.  The facility operates an ammonia refrigeration system to provide cooling and freezing capabilities.  The amount of anhydrous ammonia (CAS #7662-41-7) contained in the system is in excess of 10,000 pounds. Since an ammonia release from the system could pose a risk of offsite public and/or environmental impact and the system is regulated under the OSHA PSM standard (29 CFR 1910.119), the system is subject to the Program 3 requirements of the EPA's RMP program.\r\n\r\n\r\nC.   Summary of Worst-Case and Alternative Release Scenarios\r\n\r\nThe worst-case release scenario at the Dillons Distribution Center facility involves the release of ammonia over a 10 minute period due to the failure of the control pressure receiver (CPR-1).  This quantity represents the maximum quantity of ammonia in the receiver at any time.\r\nThe worst-case release scenario is unlikely for the following reasons:\r\n\r\n\t \tThe worst-case weather"

The program also ensures that all employees have complete access to the program.\r\n\r\n\t \tProcess Safety Information: Written information has been collected which enables the employees to identify and understand the potential hazards in the system. The written information includes the ammonia MSDS and a description of the design of the ammonia refrigeration system.\r\n\r\n\t \tProcess Hazard Analysis: Formal studies using the What-If/Checklist  Technique have been conducted to examine the system and identify potential hazards. Any recommendations are resolved to improve facility safety. \r\n\r\n\t \tOperating Procedures:  Written, detailed procedures have been developed which describe the steps which should be followed to safely operate the ammonia refrigeration system.\r\n\r\n\t \tTraining: A training program has been developed which ensures that employees are trained on all aspects of the system and on the duties which they should perform to ensure the safe operation of the ammonia refrigeration system.\r\n\r\n\t \tContractors: All contractors are screened and evaluated before they perform work on or near the ammonia refrigeration system.  The contractors are also periodically evaluated to ensure that they perform work by following safe work practices.\r\n\r\n\t \tPre-Startup Safety Review: A pre-startup safety review is required  for all new ammonia projects to verify that all safety programs are in place, training has been performed, and construction has been completed according to design standards before the project is put into use. They are also performed when there is a change in the process safety information\r\n\r\n\t \tMechanical Integrity:  This program ensures that the ammonia refrigeration systems are built and maintained using preventive maintenance procedures to minimize unexpected breakdowns or failures.\r\n\r\n\t \tHot Work Permit: These procedures ensure that a signed permit is obtained p"
