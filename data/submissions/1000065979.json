Our belief in environmental stewardship is revealed in our policies and\n\ndemonstrated through our actions. Our commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive\n\naccidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating\n\nprocedures, maintenance and employee training associated with the processes in our facility. It is\n\nour policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated\n\nsubstances.Although such releases may not be foreseeable, our plans are fully coordinated with the\n\nhighly trained emergency response personnel at the local Fire Department to control and mitigate\n\nthe effects of any release should they occur.\n\n\n\nThe facility has combined all regulatory requirements for both covered processes into one PSM/RMP program. PHA's and Compliance Audits are conducted for both processes as a single facility to simplify the process.\n\n\n\nThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nOur facility's primary activities revolve around large-scale public storage of food products. Anhydrous\n\nammonia is the major regulated substance present at our facility. The entire ammonia inventory is\n\nused as a refrigerant to support our process.\n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nOur facility has taken all of the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention\n\nrequirements set out under 40 CFR Part 68 by the EPA. In addition, our facility is subject to the\n\nOSHA, PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119. Our facility is also subject to EPCRA, Section 302\n\nnotification requirements.

The methodology used to carry out these analyses is the\n\nchecklist methodology. The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in\n\nengineering and process operations and will be re-validated at a regular interval of five years or\n\nsooner if required by the regulation. Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a\n\ntimely manner.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\n\n\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Lineage Logistics \n\nmaintains written operating procedures. These procedures address various modes of\n\noperation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency\n\nshutdown,emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround. The information\n\nis regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved with the processes.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\n\n\nLineage Logistics has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that\n\nemployees who are operating processes are completely competent in the operating procedures\n\nassociated with these processes. Refresher training is provided at least every three years and more\n\nfrequently as needed.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\n\n\nLineage Logistics carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process\n\nequipment to ensure proper operations.
