Dothan plant is an ammoniated fertilizer production facility that unloads anhydrous ammonia from tanker trucks and railcars into storage tanks. The ammonia is then used in the production of fertilizers. The facility has been in operation manufacturing fertilizers since the early 1900's and has been owned by Tri-State Plant Food, Inc. since 1985. Anhydrous ammonia is the only regulated substance stored at this facility.\n\nTri-State Plant Food, Inc. Dothan plant has an excellent safety record with no deaths or serious injuries to plant personnel or contractors due to the RMP covered process.\n\nThe facility safety record is a direct result of much emphasis on safety in the plant on the part of management and employees.\n\nB.    Accidental Release Prevention Policies and Program:\n\nThe facility is in compliance with OSHA Standards. Information for drawings, operations procedures and other pertinent documents are on file at the plant office. The Dothan, AL EHS staff furnishes technical assistance and performs safety and environmental audits and training on a regular basis.\n\nThe ammonia tanks and associated equipment are covered by a mechanical integrity inspection and testing schedule and is constantly monitored.\n\nTri-State Plant Food, Inc. management personnel are actively involved in promoting safety and environmental awareness in the community through participation with the Houston County Emergency Service (LEPC) and in coordination with the Fire Department.\n\nTri-State Plant Food, Inc. believes safety and concerns for the environment must be second nature to all employees and contractor personnel.\n\n\n\nC. Emergency Response Policies and Program:\n\nTri-State Plant Food, Inc. Dothan granulation facility employees are trained to be familiar with the Emergency Response policies and procedures through safety reviews and other plant safety meetings. The Eme"

      "SummaryText": "rgency Response Plan is reviewed on an annual basis as part of the employee safety meetings to ensure refresher training. Safety policies and procedures are also reviewed on an annual basis or more often if required. These policies and procedures are also revised to stay in compliance with changing government regulations.\n\nThe Emergency Response Plan is followed in the event of an emergency. Included in this plan is the testing of the emergency system on a regular basis.\n\nLocal Houston County Emergency Service (LEPC) and the Dothan Fire Department personnel are furnished a copy of the Emergency Response Plan and invited to tour the facility on a regular basis.\n\nThe facility Emergency Response Plan covers such things as accidental releases of plant chemicals, natural disasters, and emergency response practices and procedures. The plan is reviewed each year with  employees and reviewed with the local fire department and Houston County Emergency Service (LEPC).\n\n\nD. Worst Case Scenario:\n\nThe facility has three anhydrous ammonia storage tanks on site, one 12,000 gallon tank, which is not filled over 80% of capacity and two 18,000 gallon tanks which are not filled over 55% of capacity. The tanks are placarded with this reminder. The 12,000 gallon tank has two safety relief valves and the two 18,000 tanks have four safety relief valves each. \n\nThe EPA requires a very conservative worst case scenario to be a catastrophic rupture of the largest tank with a complete loss of product over 10 minutes.\n\nTri-State Plant Food, Inc. Dothan used the results of the TFI Degadis Model, which is recognized, accepted and approved by EPA, to examine the effects of the release of anhydrous ammonia due to a catastrophic rupture of the largest tank.\n\nWritten operating procedures and inventory reduction prevent more than 9,900 gallons from being present in the 18,000 gallon tank. \n\nBecause of past operating experience visual inspections performed on the tanks and operations training Tri-State"

      "SummaryText": " Plant Food, Inc. believes the chances for a catastrophic rupture is extremely unlikely.\n\n\nE. Alternative-case Scenario\n\nThe ammonia tanks are filled via tanker trucks or railcars. The most likely release scenario would be a rupture of a transfer hose. Railcars are unloaded on a frequency of approximately one per week during the period January to June and two per month during the period July to December. Trucks are unloaded infrequently. The conditions chosen for the alternative scenario are those which would create a maximum amount of anhydrous ammonia lost to the environment.\n\nF. Five Year Accident History:\n\nTri-State Plant Food, Inc. Dothan, has an excellent safety record with no deaths or serious injuries to any of its personnel or contractors as a result of the RMP covered process. In addition, there have been no accidents resulting in releases of ammonia with off site consequences.  Extensive programs and procedures are in place to maintain that record.\n\nG. Planned Changes to Improve Safety:\n\nThe Tri State Plant Food, Inc. continuously looks for ways to enhance the safety of the plant. Monthly safety inspections are conducted which result in corrective actions; Process Safety Management audits are conducted every three years along with annual Tri State Plant Food, Inc. reviews conducted by the environmental health and safety department. \n\nReplacement of all piping and an ultra sound inspection of the anhydrous ammonia tanks is scheduled on a regular basis and will be accomplished in the next 60 days. A water deluge system to neutralize approximately 50% of a fugitive release will be installed within the next 60 days. \n\nH. Summary:\n\nThe employees of Tri State Plant Food, Inc. are extremely proud of its safety record and the vast improvements in both safety and environment efforts made over the last 14 years. We believe that with the programs and policies in place, and the continued efforts of 100% of our personnel, we will be able to maintain our safety record "
