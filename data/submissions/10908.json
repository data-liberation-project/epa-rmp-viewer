The incident occurred in 1997 when a gas containing hydrogen backpressured into a process solution storage tank during the Hydrogen Unit shutdown procedure.  The hydrogen ignited in the nearly empty tank, ripping its floor seam and releasing the solution.  A contractor employee was injured while trying to run from the scene.   The vapor release did not leave the process area.  As a result of the incident investigation, the shutdown procedure was improved and the piping and replacement tank were modified to prevent similar incidents.\n\nThe first line of emergency response in the Refinery is the process operators.  They have been trained in emergency operation and shutdown procedures.  Most of the operators have also had firefighting training at the refinery fire fighting training facility or Delaware Fire School.  The Refinery has trained emergency response teams for firefighting, medical emergency, rescue, hazardous material (Hazmat) incident, and oil spill response.  The Refinery Fire Department has a high ladder truck, ambulance, rescue truck, foam truck, water cannon, and several pumpers.\nThe emergency contact person for the refinery at any time is the Night Superintendent.  If there is a significant fire or release, the Refinery notifies the New Castle County 911 center and potentially affected neighboring industrial facilities by telephone or radio.  The 911 center can call additional fire departments, emergency units, and Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  The Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control (DNREC) hotline is notified.  The Incident Commander and DNREC are responsible for notifying and protecting the community.  Community notification may be by a 3 to 5 minute siren blast, emergency vehicle loud speakers, door to door notification, or loca"
