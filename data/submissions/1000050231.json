      "SummaryText": "ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\n\n\nIt is the policy of all Americold facilities to conduct all operations in a safe manner.  This policy extends to all employees and contractors at the facility.  Americold implements this policy towards chemical and general safety through on-going employee participation, training, written operating procedures, maintenance, inspections, safety committee meetings, and safety reviews/evaluations.  These programs are in effect at the facility to prevent the accidental release of ammonia.  In the event of an ammonia accident, the facility has an Emergency Action Plan to notify the appropriate authorities and safely evacuate the facility. The facility is coordinated with the local fire department, who will be the facility's emergency responder.\n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\n\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system is installed at the Americold - Tacoma facility located at 1301 26th Avenue E. in Tacoma, Washington. The main business of Americold Tacoma is cold storage. \n\n\n\nThe regulated material present at the facility is anhydrous ammonia. The facility uses approximately 22,415 pounds of ammonia as a refrigerant within a closed system.  The system, consisting of piping, valves, and equipment, cycles ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration for cold storage, freezer storage, and dock areas. The majority of the system is located in the engine room including vessels and compressors.  The condensers are mounted on the roof, and the evaporators are located in their respective cold storage areas.\n\n\n\nENGINE ROOM DETAILS\n\n\n\nThe refrigeration cycle begins with the transfer of condenser drain liquid ammonia from the Condenser to the Thermosyphon Receiver.  The thermosyphon maintains a level of priority liquid feed for compressor oil cooling and drains the exc"

Pumps drive high temperature recirculated liquid from LPR-3 to the +35A?F Dock Evaporators (AU03 through AU10) and the +35A?F Cooler Evaporators (AU01 & AU02) from which a liquid/vapor mix returns to the LPR-3 vessel as high temperature recirculated suction.  High stage suction is drawn off the top of the vessel by the High Temperature Compressors CP-1 and CP-2.  Ammonia vapor from LPR-3 is also used as economizer suction by the Intermediate Temperature Compressors (CP-3 and CP-4), Swing Compressor (CP-5), and the Low Temperature Compressor (CP-6).\n\n\n\nThe +20?F Low Pressure Receiver also feeds subcooled liquid ammonia to the -20?F Low Pressure Receiver (LPR-2).  Pumps drive low temperature recirculated liquid from LPR-2 to the -10?F Freezer Evaporators (AU13 through AU18), from which a liquid/vapor mix returns to LPR-2 as intermediate temperature recirculated suction. The Intermediate Temperature Compressors (CP-3 and CP-4) draw low stage suction from the top of LPR-2.  \n\n\n\nThe -20?F Low Pressure Recirculator also feeds low temperature recirculated liquid to the -35? Low Pressure Recirculator (LPR-1).   Pumps drive low temperature recirculated liquid from LPR-1 to the -20?F Ice Cream Freezer Evaporators (AU11 & AU12), from which a liquid/vapor mix returns to  LPR-1 as low temperature recirculated suction.  The Low Temperature Compressor CP-6 draws low stage suction from the top of LPR-1.  \n\n\n\nCompressor CP-5 is a swing compressor and is tied in to the high stage, low stage, and economizer suction lines; it can operate at low or high pressure conditions depending on system need.  During normal operation, CP-5 is run off of the -20?F suction line.\n\n\n\nThe high temperature and pressure discharge from all of the compressors is piped to a common high stage discharge line that feeds to the Condenser.

At the Condenser, water (pumps) and air (fans) are used to condense the high stage discharge back to liquid ammonia, from which point the condenser drain feeds into the Thermosyphon Receiver and the cycle begins again.\n\n \n\nThe system is also equipped with an Automatic Purger.  The Auto Purger removes non-condensables (i.e., air and water) from the system.  Four purge points are located at the Condenser.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nThe Americold - Tacoma ammonia refrigeration system has many safety features.  Much of the safety of the system is inherent in the policies and procedures that govern the operation of the system.  For example, the facility operates in accordance with OSHA's Process Safety Management regulation.  \n\n\n\nThe facility including the ammonia system was designed and constructed was constructed in accordance with the 2006 International Building, Fire, Mechanical, and Plumbing Codes and the 2002 National Electric Code which specifically outlines requirements for the safe operation of the ammonia refrigeration system.  These safety features include ammonia sensors in the engine room as well as sensors at each evaporator, and automatic shutdown systems.  In addition, the majority of the ammonia equipment is maintained inside the engine room.  All pressure vessels are equipped with pressure relief valves that are piped to a common header, equipped with an ammonia sensor, and vent to the ammonia dilution tank.\n\n\n\nThe facility operates in accordance with many of the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) guidelines. \n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nThere have been no RPM reportable releases of ammonia at this facility over the last five years\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe Americold Tacoma fa"

      "SummaryText": "cility has an emergency action plan in effect.  The Emergency Action Plan (Plan) is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of the PSM/RMP document.  This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n\n\n  1.  To save lives.\n\n  2.  To minimize and avoid injuries.\n\n  3.  To protect the environment.\n\n  4.  To minimize property damage.\n\n\n\nThe operator of the facility maintains a safety committee whose members are the designated emergency coordinators for the facility.  The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility. This Plan was reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations.\n\n\n\nIn case of an ammonia emergency, the Americold Tacoma facility plans to evacuate all employees in the facility and alert the local emergency responders (fire department).  The Chief Engineer/Facility Service Manager has coordinated emergency response efforts with the local fire department.  Operators at the facility are trained to respond to releases of ammonia; however a full team cannot be provided. Operators will respond to an ammonia release only as an assistant to the responding agency.\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nThe Process Hazards Analysis (performed on June 2-4, 2015), including a What if/checklist study and a Facility Inspection, provided mitigation measures to improve safety at the Americold - Tacoma facility located at 1301 26th Avenue E in Tacoma, Washington. The Americold - Tacoma safety committee is planning to complete several items over the next year, as a continual effort to provide a safe work environment for their employees.  These changes include the following items:\n\n\n\n1. Continue to train all employees in the facility safety plan/programs.\n\n\n\n2. Continue to have employee involvement in safety plan development.\n\n\n\n3"
