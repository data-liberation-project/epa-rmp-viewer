Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nToyota Boshoku Mississippi, LLC (TBMS) is committed to protecting facility personnel, the public, and the environment from any workplace and accidental release hazards.  An appropriate response to releases of Toluene Diisocyanate (TDI) is in the written Risk Management Program.  Safety, environmental, and risk management programs are fully implemented and coordinated with community emergency responders for emergency planning and response. \n\n\n\nB. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe TBMS facility produces urethane molded foam seats for the automotive industry located in Mantachie, Mississippi. \n\n\n\nUrethane molded foam is a product made of combining chemicals that undergo a chemical reaction as they are injected into a mold cavity. One of the chemical mixtures contains approximately 65% Toluene 2, 4-Diisocyanate (TDI) and approximately 15% Toluene 2, 6-Diisocyanate (TDI). The TDI is stored in one (1) 8,000-gallon TDI Bulk Storage Tank. The 8,000-gallons of TDI equates to 65,344 pounds of TDI. The TDI Bulk Storage Tank is located within the ISO Building. \n\n\n\nThe EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) is part of the Clean Air Act and applies to a process storing a specified chemical above a threshold quantity. The chemicals and threshold quantities are specified in Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 68. One such chemical is Toluene Diisocyanate (TDI) with a threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds which is used as an ingredient in the manufacturing process. The facility will reach or exceed the threshold quantity operations in April 2013.\n\nAfter reviewing the facility operations and the RMP regulations, it was determined that the entire facility is considered one process.  Based on the facility processes and applicable regulations, it was determined that the facility is subject to Program 2 of the RMP regulations.\n\n\n\nB.  Accidental Release Prevention and S"

An appropriate response to releases of TDI is in the written Risk Management Program. Safety, environmental, and risk management programs are fully implemented and coordinated with community emergency responders for emergency planning and response. TBMS's specific prevention steps include:\n\n1. Hazard reviews to identify, evaluate and control potential TDI process hazards,\n\n2. Develop, review and update operating and maintenance procedures for the TDI process,\n\n3. Provide the appropriate training for TDI process operators, maintenance personnel, and   \n\n   emergency response personnel.\n\n4. Conduct timely investigations of all incidents involving the TDI process.\n\n5. Conduct RMP Compliance audits as per RMP regulations.\n\n    \n\n\n\nC. Hazard Assessment:\n\nThe RMP requires TBMS to evaluate the maximum potentially affected area for accidents involving TDI for a worst case release scenario and an alternative scenario.\n\nThe worst case release is highly improbable since it involves the combination of a certain set of conditions for a large release of the chemical without any employee intervention.  Because the assumptions required for the worst-case analysis are very conservative, the results likely will be very conservative. The endpoints specified for regulated toxic substances are intended to be protective of the general public. The distance to the endpoint estimated under worst-case conditions should not be considered an area in which the public would likely be in danger; instead, it is intended to provide an estimate of the maximum possible area that might be affected in the unlikely event of catastrophic accident. EPA intends the estimated distances to provide a basis for discussion among the regulated community, emergency responders, and the public, rather than a basis for any specific actions.\n\n\n\nA release from "

      "SummaryText": "the one (1) 8,000 gallon storage tank has been identified as the worst-case release and was considered in the hazard assessment. The TDI component of the chemical mixture in the 8,000 gallon storage tank equates to approximately 65,344 lbs of TDI. The tank is located within the ISO building and is surrounded by secondary containment which would fully contain a spill from the tank, thereby reducing the evaporation rate of the spill.\n\n\n\nThe impact distance from the worst-case scenario has been estimated using EPA's RMPcomp Model. The impact distance from the RMPcomp Model results in an impact distance of 0.4 miles. The impact distance extends beyond the facility property. There are no people living within the potentially affected area.\n\n\n\nThe alternative scenario is an event more likely to occur than the worst-case scenario and is a more realistic accident scenario.  TBMS has determined that the appropriate alternative scenario for the facility is a process piping release from the process line carrying TDI from the Transfer Pump to the TDI Day Tank. The leak would release approximately 1,080 lbs of TDI. The RMPcomp Method estimates a distance to the endpoint of 0.1 mile for the alternative release scenario. The impact distance extends beyond the facility property line. There are no people living within the potentially affected area.\n\n\n\nD. General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nProcess Safety Information: TBMS will complete a compilation of written safety information to be used in conducting the Hazard Review. The Hazard Review will be conducted using the process safety information gathered in order to identify and understand the hazards posed by the TDI System. \n\nHazard Review: TBMS will update and revalidate the Hazard Review as necessary and at least every five (5) years. The Hazard Review was conducted using  the \"What IF\" methodology, which is one of the methodologies specified in 40 CFR 68.67, and was performed by a "

These written operating procedures will be consistent with the process safety information for each operating phase, operating limitations, safety and health considerations, safety systems and their functions. The operating procedures will be readily accessible to employees who work in or maintain the TDI system. These operating procedures will be reviewed as often as necessary to assure that they reflect current operating practice. TBMS will develop and implement safe work practices to provide for the control of hazards during operations such as lockout/tagout; opening process equipment or piping; and control entrance into the TDI storage area.\n\n\n\nTraining: TBMS will provide training for each employee associated with the TDI system. This training will include an overview of the process and operating procedures as outlined in 40 CFR 68.67.  Refresher training is provided every three (3) years or more often as necessary. TBMS documents and maintains records of employee training, and the means used to verify that the employee understood the training.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity: TBMS will develop a written preventive maintenance program to maintain the on-going integrity of the equipment used in the TDI process (i.e., storage tanks, pumps, piping sy"
