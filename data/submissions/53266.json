The elements of the plan are intended to prevent and minimize the accidental releases of extremely hazardous substances (chlorine and sulfur dioxide) used on site.  The CFI facility emergency response program involves the preparation of response plans that are tailored to the facility and the emergency response services available in the community.  CFI's emergency response program is in compliance with the EPA and OSHA Emergency Response Program requirements and is modeled after the One Plan.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE FACILITY AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nCFI repackages chlorine into 150-pound cylinders and one ton containers.  Chlorine is also utilized by CFI to manufacturer 10.5%-15% (by weight) sodium hypochlorite.  The facility includes a sidetrack for unloading 90-ton chlorine railcars. A chlorine production building is used for packaging the cylinders and ton containers and for sodium hypochlorite production.  All instrument controls for the chlorine railcar unloading, cylinder and ton container packaging and sodium hypochlorite production are located in the chlorine packaging building.  In addition to chlorine, sulfur dioxide is stored onsite in 150-pound cylinders and one ton containers.  The facility is staffed during all hours of operations.\n\nBased upon the program criteria as set forth in the Risk Management Rule, including EPA's definition of a covered process, the chlorine and sulfur dioxide processes at this facility are subject to Program 3 planning.\n\nWORST-CASE AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nAn offsite consequence analysis was conducted that included consideration of two chlorine and one sulfur dioxide release scenarios, identified as wo"

      "SummaryText": "rst-case release and/or alternative scenario.  The worst-case scenario is defined by EPA, which states that the owner shall assume that the maximum quantity in the largest vessel is released as a gas over 10 minutes, due to an unspecified failure.  Because the probability of such a release occurring is very remote, an alternative scenario, defined as more likely to occur than the worst-case release scenario, was also analyzed.\n\nAtmospheric dispersion modeling was performed to determine the distance traveled by the chlorine and sulfur dioxide releases before its concentration decreases to the toxic endpoint selected by EPA.  The American Industrial Hygiene Association defines toxic endpoint as the maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects or symptoms which could impair an individual's ability to take protective action.  \n\nThe worst-case release scenario at CFI's Tampa facility involves the failure of a 90-ton railcar of chlorine. Although CFI utilizes numerous administrative controls and active mitigation systems to minimize the consequences of such a release, no credit was taken for any mitigating factors in calculating the extent of the release.  This is in accordance to the EPA Risk Management Program worst-case scenario requirements (40 CFR \u00a768.25).   \n\nThe alternative release scenario for chlorine involves the rupture of the flexible connections connected to the chlorine railcar and  for sulfur dioxide involves the failure of a storage vessel (one ton container). \n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe CFI accidental release prevention program is based on the following key elements:\n\u00b7 Compliance with OSHA's Process Safety Management rule (29CFR \u00a71910.119) and EPA's Risk Management Plan (40 CFR \u00a768),\n\u00b7 Implementation of the National Association of Chem"

The operators wear escape respirators and eye protection during connection/disconnection of the chlorine supply and movement of the cylinders and one-ton containers of chlorine and sulfur dioxide.  Employees are trained on the hazards and toxic properties of chlorine and sulfur dioxide, presence of the gas detectors, emergency shutdown system, siren, equipment design and specifications and proper and safe handling procedures.\n\nAUDITS\n\nThis facility has undergone an internal RMP and PSM audit in May 2006.  No external RMP audit has been conducted since January 2005.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nAn accidental release of chlorine qualifying as an RMP incident occurred on October 3, 2003.  Equipment failure do to manufacturer defects and human error were the root causes of the incident.  Additional process equipment controls were installed as a result of the incident to prevent occurance in the future.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe facility has an emergency response plan, which has been reviewed and updated in June 2006.
