The Emergency Action Plan (Plan) is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of the PSM/RMP document which is maintained at the facility.  This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n  1.)  To save lives.\n  2.)  To minimize and avoid injuries.\n  3.)  To protect the environment.\n  4.)  To minimize property damage.\n\nC&S Wholesale Grocers, Inc. maintains a safety committee whose members are the designated emergency coordinators for the facility.  The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan will be reviewed and updated annually  to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations, as well as to incorporate facility changes.\n\nC&S Wholesale Grocers, Inc. has coordinated emergency response efforts with the local fire department. In the case of an ammonia-related emergency, it is the policy of C&S Wholesale Grocers, Inc. to evacuate the employees and to allow the fire department to the emergency (potentially with the assistance of trained facility personnel).\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nThe C&S Wholesale Grocers, Inc. - Chester facility serves as a refrigerated warehouse and storage facility. The facility is located at 1 Elizabeth Lane in Chester, New York about 0.75 miles west of Highway 6 and 0.5 miles south of Highway 94. The immediate area is primarily undeveloped with some light commercial areas.  The ammonia system was constructed in accordance with all applicable federal, state, and local regulations and to IIAR guidelines.\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system uses approximately 35,200 pounds of ammonia for various dock operations and cold storage areas. There was a facility expansi"

There was an additional facility expansion in 2010 which added 35 evaporators to a new warehouse area, 2 high stage compressors, and a new Recirculator vessel with pump package within the engine room, and 3 new evaporative condensers on the roof. The majority of the system is located in the engine room including vessels, compressors, and associated piping.  The condensers are mounted on the engine room roof, and all of the evaporators are located in their respective cold storage rooms/areas.\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe C&S Wholesale Grocers, Inc. - Chester ammonia refrigeration system has many safety features.  Much of the safety of the system is inherent in the policies and procedures that govern the operation of the system.  For example, the C&S Wholesale Grocers, Inc. - Chester facility operates in accordance with OSHA's Process Safety Management regulation.\n\nThe C&S Wholesale Grocers, Inc. - Chester facility was designed and constructed in accordance with the Uniform Mechanical Code which specifically outlines requirements for the safe operation of the ammonia refrigeration system.  These safety features include ammonia sensors in the engine room and automatic shut down systems that prevent equipment damage and ammonia releases.  In addition, the majority of the ammonia inventory is maintained inside the engine room and just outside of the engine room (condensers).  All pressure vessels and compressors are equipped with pressure relief valves that automatically engage in case of a high pressure situation and vent through a common header to the atmosphere. \n\nIn addition to the Uniform Mechanical Code, the facility operates in accordance with the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) guidelines.  In particular, the IIAR Bulletin 110, \"Startup, Inspection, and Maintenance of Ammonia Refrigeration Systems.\"\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCI"

      "SummaryText": "DENT HISTORY\n\nThere have been no significant releases at the since the facility started operations  (May 2005 - May 2010) of ammonia that exceeded the Federal Reportable Quantity of 100 pounds.  In addition, there have been no injuries resulting from an ammonia release, nor any releases or near misses that warranted an internal incident investigation.\n\n\nEMERGENCY ACTION PLAN\n\nC&S Wholesale Grocers, Inc. has an emergency action plan in effect at the facility.  The Emergency Action Plan (Plan) is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of this PSM/RMP document.  Emergency response activities are coordinated with the City of Chester Fire Department and the local fire houses.  In case of a major ammonia emergency, the facility will first call 9-1-1 to alert the local Police and Fire Departments.  Other responders will be called as needed.  If a release exceeds the federal reporting quantity of 100 pounds for ammonia, the National Response Center will be called.\n\nC&S Wholesale Grocers Inc. maintains a safety committee whose members are the designated emergency coordinators for the facility.  The plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  The plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year.  This plan will be reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations, as well as to incorporate facility changes due to renovation of the facility.\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThe Process Hazard Analysis provided mitigation measures to improve safety at the C&S Wholesale Grocers, Inc.
