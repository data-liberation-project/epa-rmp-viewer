The same properties that make TDI valuable also make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in the handling so as to prevent unnecessary human exposure.  We are dedicated to conducting our operations in compliance with environmental laws and in a safe and responsible manner.  We do not want to put at risk the environment, employees, or the public.  We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of the employees and the public as well as protection of the environment.  We will continue to commit resources and to take appropriate steps to comply with environmental laws.  We may adopt additional standards and procedures beyond those required by law if the company deems them advisable.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and State rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the manner in which TDI is handled combined with the safety devices inherent in the design of this facility combined with the safe-handling procedures that we use and the training of our personnel.\n\n2.0\tStationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nThe primary purpose of this facility is to manufacture, store, and ship Rebond Carpet pad.  The regulated substance handled at this facility is TDI.  The maximum amount of TDI that can be stored at this facility is 171,196 pounds.  See appendix for MSDS on TDI.  Our accident release prevention programs and our contingency planning efforts help us effectively manage the hazards that are posed our employees, the public, and the environment by u"

The TDI manufacturer ships and delivers the product using 3rd party equipment and drivers.  We take a systematic, proactive approach to prevent accidental releases of hazardous chemicals.  Our management systems address each of the key features of successful prevention programs including but not limited to:\n\n\u00b7\tOperating Procedures\n\u00b7\tTraining\n\u00b7\tCompliance Audits\n\u00b7\tIncident Investigation\n\u00b7\tEmployee Participation\n\u00b7\tInspections\nAs part of our prevention efforts, we have implemented the following chemical-specific prevention steps:\n\n\u00b7\tInventory control of TDI\n\u00b7\tTwo-way communication during off-loading\n\u00b7\tNever leave off-loading area during the unloading process\n\u00b7\tHigh level alarms with transducers to read level of tanks\n\u00b7\tWork Instructions\n\u00b7\tReview of equipment, including tanks, valves, piping, and locking out of tanks\n\nThese individual elements of our prevention program work together to prevent accidental chemical releases.  The company and the employees are committed to the standard that the management systems set for the way we do business and we have specific accountabilities and controls to ensure that we are meeting our own high standards for accident prevention.\n\n4.0\tFive-Year Accident History\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of TDI in the past five years; therefore the company does not have an accident to report.\n\n5.0\tEmergency Response Program\n\nThe company maintains a Plant Emergency Organization (PEO) and emergency response plan.  The emergency response program is based upon Leggett & Platt corporate policies, and procedures as outline in LEGGETT & PLATT PERSONNEL & PROPERTY CONSERVATION MANUAL.  Our program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the env"

Company employees will act to provide incidental response to mitigate a TDI release.  If the event is beyond the scope of an accidental response, employees will evacuate and call the Fort Worth, Texas Fire Department.  The Fort Worth, Texas Fire Department will initiate the community emergency plan for a TDI release.\n\n6.0\tPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThe company is looking into the addition of carbon drum scrubbers.  The company is continually looking for ways to improve safety.\n\n7.0\tCertifications\n\nBased on the criteria in 40 CFR 68.10, our Risk Management Program is written to comply with Program Level 2.  The distance to the specified endpoint for the worst-case accidental release scenario may impact the small residential population surrounding the facility.\n\nWithin the past five years, the process has had no accidental releases that caused off-site impacts provided in the RMP rule [40 CFR 68.10(b)(1)].  We have taken voluntary measures to improve our operations to minimize potential releases of covered materials in order to protect both our employees and the public.  In the event of fire, explosion, or a release of a regulated substance from the process, entry within the distance to the specified endpoint may pose a danger to public emergency responders.  Therefore public emergency responders should not enter this area except as arranged with the emergency contact indicated in the RMPlan.
