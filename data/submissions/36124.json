The Facility Policy\n\nThe owners, management, and employees of Midland-Impact, LLP, are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, LEPC, or other agencies, to control any release and to minimize the impact of the release to people, property and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information\n\nThe primary activity at Forest Agronomy is the storage and blending of fertilizers for custom application and sale to farmers.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application for crop production nutrients. \n\nThe maximum quantity stored would be 580,000 pounds in our 26,000-gallon and 12,000 gallon storage tanks plus the contents of of a rail tank car (160,000 lbs.)and 56 - 1000 gallon nurse tanks. The maximum quantity handled would be the unloading of  a rail tank car holding 160,000 pounds. Anhydrous ammonia is distributed to farmers in the 1000 gallon nurse trailers.\n\n3. The accident release prevention program\nForest Agronomy has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc., the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\" and the Office of Indiana State Chemist \"Indiana Ammonia Law\". \n\n4. The Five-year Accident History \n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that:- to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, shelter in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n5.
