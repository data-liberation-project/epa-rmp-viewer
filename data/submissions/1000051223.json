The Facility Policy\n\n\n\nMFA Incorporated and the employees of the MFA West Liquid Plant in Centralia are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the Boone County Local Emergency Planning Committee, and other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n\n\n2. Facility Information\n\n\n\nThe primary activity at the facility is the receiving, storage and distribution of liquid and dry bulk fertilizers, and anhydrous ammonia for direct application as crop nutrients.\n\n\n\n3. The Accidental Release Prevention Program.\n\n\n\nThe facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1, 1999\", published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc., the Missouri Anhydrous Ammonia Law, and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\". The facility is currently evaluating the newest codes and Process Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals and will plan upgrades as required.\n\n\n\n4. The Five-year Accident History\n\n\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that:  have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n\n\n5.
