Our management system addresses each of the key features of a successful prevention program, as described below.\r\n\r\nPROCESS SAFETY INFORMATION\r\n\r\nThe Harcros Chemicals Dalton plant maintains a variety of technical documents that describe the chemicals and processes at our facility.  The documents are kept up to date and are available to all employees.  They address important process parameters such as operating limits for equipment, design basis and configuration of equipment, and physical properties and hazards of the chemicals used.\r\n\r\nChemical information is contained in Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS's).  Important process parameters are also documented and maintained.

Employees new to a process are provided basic training including (1) overview of process, (2) properties of substances used and their associated hazards, and (3) a detailed review of the operating procedures.  Once they have demonstrated their understanding of the process, they are paired with an experienced operator to learn specific job functions and tasks.  After they demonstrate their competence in performing these tasks, they are allowed to work independently.\r\n\r\nRefresher training intervals are decided, in part, by our employees but are performed at least every three years.  All training is documented.\r\n\r\nMECHANICAL INTEGRITY\r\n\r\nThe Harcros Chemicals Dalton plant maintains the mechanical integrity of our equipment to prevent equipment failures that could endanger employees, the public, or the environment.  Our inspection and testing program helps identify damage or deterioration before equipment fails.  When a problem is found, maintenance personnel correct the problem and try to identify the root causes to help prevent future problems.  Our quality assurance system ensures that new or replacement equipment meets the strict design standards for our facility.  The mechanical integrity system includes (1) inspection and testing procedures, (2) replacement equipment specifications, (3) procedures for safe work practices, (4) maintenance personnel training, and (5) required documentation.\r\n\r\nMANAGEMENT OF CHANGE\r\n\r\nW"
