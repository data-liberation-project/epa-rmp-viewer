The District has reviewed its obligations under EPA's Risk Management Program Rule (RMP Rule, Section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act). In response to these requirements, the District notes that there are two obligations incumbent on the operations at its facility:\r\n\r\n1.112 (r)(1)\r\nPurpose and General Duty Clause -The basis of the general duty clause is that an owner/ operator that stores and/or uses hazardous chemicals in any quantity has a fundamental obligation to ensure a safe operation, and to have plans in place in the event of an accident to appropriately manage the situation.\r\n2. \r\nRisk Management Plan -The District operates a water treatment facility that stores and uses chlorine in excess of thresholds specified in the RMP Rule. The purpose of the chlorine water treatment process at the water treatment plant is to treat and disinfect municipal drinking water. \r\n\r\nChlorine is stored in one ton cylinder and there are typically five cylinders stored at the water treatment plant at one time. For Risk Management Planning purposes, the District has considered a very conservative (i.e., worst case) impact of a sudden release of the entire contents of one cylinder within a ten-minute period. Conservative assumptions about possible weather conditions and a predictive model indicate a potential radius of impact of the chlorine would extend to 1.3 miles. A consideration of this radius has been incorporated into our notification and emergency response planning. The District also considered the impact of a more likely release, based on our operational history and most likely hazard analysis. This analysis suggest that the largest release of chlorine that could realistically be experienced by the"
