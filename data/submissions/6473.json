      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary - Program 2\n\nBackground\nChemTreat, Inc.\u0012s plant in Ashland, Virginia  is a small blending facility of industrial water treatment chemicals for use in boilers, cooling systems, and wastewater systems.  The only regulated substance under the Risk Management Plan rule used by the facility is cyclohexylamine.  The inventory for this chemical never exceeds 57,800 pounds.      \n\nChemTreat\u0012s mission regarding chemical safety is to manage our people and systems to protect the health and safety of employees, the community and the environment.  ChemTreat has developed and implemented an environmental, health and safety management program which consists of written safe work procedures, training, and periodic audits to ensure compliance.\n\nWorst-Case Scenario\nThe worst-case scenario projects a complete failure of the cyclohexylamine storage tank and the subsequent vaporization of 57,800 pounds of released chemical.  According to the EPA\u0012s RMP-Comp (dispersion modeling software), the off-site impact for this scenario is 0.2 mile (or ~1,000 feet) radius from the storage tank.  The possibility of this ever occurring is extremely remote as ChemTreat has implemented several layers of protection.  The cyclohexylamine storage tank is of the latest design meeting all applicable technical specifications and having been installed in the past two years.  Furthermore, the facility has put in place such passive mitigation systems as a concrete dike around the tank which limits the potential exposed surface of any pool of cyclohexylamine, thus, reducing the release radius from 1.4 miles to 0.2 mile.  In the event of a release, a drain pump in the contained area will directly route the chemical to a fully contained storage tank.  Other preventive measures include administrative controls such as daily tank inspections and a preventive maintenance program which is explained in further detail below under the Maintenance section.\n\nAlternative Scenario\nThe alternative scenario con"

      "SummaryText": "sists of a transfer hose failure during the process of unloading cyclohexylamine from a delivery tank truck to the storage tank.  The release is two minutes in duration and results in a release of 1,500 pounds, with an off-site impact of 0.1 mile (or ~500 feet).  Again, ChemTreat has put in place several layers of protection to ensure this scenario does not occur.  Passive mitigation systems, such as berms surrounding the unloading pad and a sump pump on the pad, are used to contain the chemical released and safely pump it directly to a fully contained storage tank.  Administrative controls have also been enacted.  For example, standard operating procedures require that an operator be in attendance at all times during the unloading process.  Thus, if a hose failure does occur, operator intervention and isolation of the chemical will significantly reduce the potential for off-site impact.\n\nPrevention Program\nChemTreat, Inc. takes a systematic approach to preventing accidental releases of hazardous chemicals.  Our management systems address each of the key features of an accidental release prevention program including safety information, hazard review, operating procedures, training, maintenance, compliance audits, and incident investigation.\n\nThese individual elements of our accidental release prevention program work together to prevent accidental chemical releases.  ChemTreat, Inc. and our employees integrate these management systems into the way we do business and establish specific accountability for accident prevention into our process.\n\nSafety Information\nIn accordance with Section 68.48 of the RMP rule, we systematically control the development, updating, and retention of documentation associated with our process chemicals, process technology, and process equipment.  This information is essential for supporting all of the other elements of our risk management program.  We also use this information directly to ensure that our equipment is suitable for its intend"

Chemical process information includes toxicity information, permissible exposure limits or threshold limit values, physical data, reactivity data, corrosivity data, thermal and chemical stability data and the hazardous effects of inadvertent mixing or different materials that could foreseeably occur.  This information may be found in the Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) which comply with OSHA\u0012s Hazard Communication Standard 29 CFR 1910.1200.\n\nAdditionally, we maintain the following required process technology information:  manufacturing work orders (mixing instructions); process chemistry; maximum intended inventory; safe upper and lower limits for parameters such as temperature, pressure, flow, or composition; piping and instrument diagrams (P&IDs); electrical classification; design codes and standards employed; and equipment specifications\n\nHazard Review\nIn accordance with Section 68.50 of the RMP rule, we use hazard reviews to systematically identify, evaluate, and control process hazards.  The most important products of our reviews are recommendations for reducing the most significant risks of accidental chemical releases.  We ensure that all recommendations from our reviews are resolved appropriately, and we ensure that information from our reviews (including recommendation resolutions) is communicated to all potentially affected employees.\n\nWe conduct systematic hazard reviews of the regulated process at our facility at least every five years (or more often if necessary because of process changes).  Hazard review reports are generated which document the required regulatory items and are maintained at the facility.

This walk through was conducted by several key plant employees with the assistance of an outside consultant who is very experienced in conducting hazardous operability studies (HAZOPs).  A HAZOP approach was used in the creation of the hazard review document.\n\nOur hazard review team is composed of personnel with engineering and process operating experience, including at least one person who has knowledge and experience in the process to be evaluated and a team leader trained in the application of the HAZOP technique used for the hazard review.\n\nOperating Procedures\nIn accordance with Section 68.52 of the RMP rule, we use operating procedures to define how process-related job tasks assigned to our personnel should be performed to avoid incidents.  We use these procedures to (1) train our employees/contractors before they performs tasks in the field, (2) serve as a reference guides for personnel performing tasks, and (3) specify what to do if a process upset or operating emergency occurs.  The facility maintains documentation which show operator and mechanic certifications for those who are responsible for the cyclohexylamine system.\n\nStandard Operating Procedures have been developed and revised to reflect the findings of the hazard reviews.  These procedures contain the required steps to run the process for all modes of operations. These Operating Procedures shall be updated at least annually or whenever a change in the operation of the system occurs.
