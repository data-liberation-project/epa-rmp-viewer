      "SummaryText": "The Salado Creek Storage Facility is owned and operated by the San Antonio Water System (SAWS). SAWS is a public utility owned by the City of San Antonio, was created in May 1992, and is responsible for treating drinking water and wastewater.\n\n\n\nThe Salado Creek Storage Facility is a major chemical storage area for the Water Production Department of the San Antonio Water System.  Gaseous chlorine is stored in one-ton containers and 150-pound cylinders prior to delivery to various production sites to be used to disinfect potable water prior to distribution. Chlorine is a toxic gas and is regulated by EPA under the risk management program (RMP).  \n\n\n\nThis facility is normally unmanned except when accepting deliveries from the vendor or transfering tanks to other Production facilities.  A enclosed self-contained chlorine gas adsorption system is installed at the Salado Creek facility and would prevent a release to the outside environment during normal operations.  For planning purposes and for compliance with the risk management program of EPA, a worst-case release resulting from the failure of a one ton-container, prior to placing inside the enclosed scrubber facility, was assumed.   \n\n\n\nEmployees using the facility use standard operating procedures related to chlorine safety.  However, they will not attempt to enter the site to respond to a chlorine emergency.  Emergency response will be provided by the San Antonio Fire Department for this facility.\n\n\n\n\n\n"
