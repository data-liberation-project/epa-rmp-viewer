The City is committed to their employees in the safe handling of chlorine. We are also committed to reducing the threat to nearby members of the community. All employees are trained in the area of safety when handling chlorine. Our emergency response program will be coordinated with the Port Arthur Fire and Police Departments. Our emergency plan also includes procedures for notifying any affected neighborhoods.\r\n2. The stationary service and regulated substances handled.\r\nThe primary purpose of the facility is to treat and disinfect the wastewater effluent. Chlorine is the only toxic chemical over the threshold limit used at this facility. It is received in ton/150lb. containers and is used for disinfection. The facility has equipment in use for the safe handling and storage of the ton containers. The total inventory of ton chlorine stored at this facility is 24,000 lbs., along with ten or less 150 lbs. cylinders for two sattelite plants that the city maintains.\r\n3. The worst case release scenario and the alternative release scenario, including administrative controls and mitigation measures to the limit, the distances for each reported scenario.\r\nWorst case scenario - Rupture of a ton cylinder would release 2000 lbs. of chlorine. It is assumed that the entire contents are released as vapor, which is heavier than air. The distance to the endpoint is 0087 mg/l. All liquid leaks will be handled as a worst case scenario.\r\nAlternative Release Scenario - A 1-inch valve connection on the ton cylinder, breaks and releases chlorine gas. It is estimated that 2000 lbs. of chlorine would be released in a 30 minute time period. Plant personnel will handle the majority of gas leaks as to minimize the release.\r\n4. The general accidental release prevention program and the specific prevention steps.\r\nAccidental"
