Also, as the operator of a facility at which substances may be used that in uncontrolled situations could cause harm to the public and damage to the environment, we will strive for environmental excellence with a commitment to continual improvement, pollution prevention and compliance with legislative requirements.  The Risk Management Program (RMP) is one of these programs.\n     Each employee in areas where the RMP is applicable will be knowledgeable of the related policies and procedures and the supervisors or a designated person is required to insure that they understand them.  Employees and supervisors are required to comply with our policies and are subject to corrective action in those cases determined to indicate willful violation.\n    A written plan of action regarding the implementation of employee participation in the program has been developed as a part of our Release Prevention Program as specified by 29 CFR 1910.119.  A compilation of safety information to enable International Diverse Foods and the employees involved in the ammonia operations to operate safety has been accumulated.  This process safety information includes information pertaining to the toxicological and physical hazards of the chemical listed.

This facility is a food processing plant (non meat).\nSite Description:\n    The facility is located in south side of Nashville, Tennessee at 189 Spence Lane. \nOperation Description\n    The site process involves the preparation of food products.  No animal processing takes place at the facility.  Industrial lift trucks move the materials.\n    From the time of receipt and throughout the storage period, the materials are maintained at a cool temperature by anhydrous ammonia refrigeration processes.\n    The air cooling process involves the distribution of liquid ammonia through piping (coils) across which air is blown with fans to cool the air.  \n3.4  Technology of the Process\n    Refrigeration is the control of heat.  According to American Heritage Dictionary heat is defined as:\n\"The energy associated with the motion of atoms or molecules in\nsolids, which can be transmitted through solid and fluid media\nby conduction, through fluid media by convection and through empty\nspace by radiation.\"\n    Heat is energy.  The amount of energy or heat available is determined by the amount of motion or excitement of the atoms or molecules.  The more excited the molecules, the more energy or heat available.\n    This energy or heat can be moved or transferred.  This transfer occurs when there is a difference of temperature.  Heat flows from a source of grater energy (higher temperature) to a source of lower energy (lower temperature).  The greater the temperature difference, the more rapid the heat flow.\n    There are three types of heat transfer mechanisms:\nConduction\nConvection\nRadiation\n    The use of liquid ammonia as a refrigerant is the transferring of heat by conduction and convection.  In conduction heat is transferred by the molecules in a medium coming in contact with each other.  The warm molecules collide with colder molecules giving them some of the energy (heat).  The flow will occur i"

      "SummaryText": "f there is a difference of temperature from one side of the medium to the other.  Metals are very good at transferring heat by conduction.\n    By blowing air or moving a liquid such as water or glycol over a material such as metal that has been cooled heat is transferred by convection.  The heat load in a freezer is moved via convection to the coils where conduction takes place in transferring the heat to the refrigerant.  The refrigeration process does not produce cold.  It simply moves the heat from an area where it is not wanted to a place it can be discharged.\n    The refrigeration systems at International Diverse Foods are accomplished by two methods using Anhydrous Ammonia.  These include:\nAir Cooling\nWater Chilling\nGlycol Cooling\nTank Jacke (ammonia & glycol)\nShell & Tube\n\n    Liquid ammonia has the ability to absorb very large amounts of heat as it vaporizes.  This ability is the basis for mechanical refrigeration systems.  These mechanical systems utilize both pressure and temperature in the refrigeration cycle.  There are five major components in a mechanical refrigeration system.  These include, 1) Receiver, 2) Metering device/expansion valves, 3) Evaporator, 4) Compressor, and 5) Condenser.\n    The Receiver collects the condensed vapors and stores the excess refrigerant charge that is not circulating through the system.  The receiver is located between the condenser and the expansion valve.  It is also used to store refrigerant when it is necessary to service the system.\n    The liquid ammonia is routed to a metering device (expansion valves).  This device regulates the amount of refrigerant going into the evaporator.\n    As the ammonia flows through the device, there is a pressure drop.  The amount of pressure drop determines the temperature of the refrigerant going to the evaporator.  The refrigerant leaves the metering device in both a liquid and a vapor phase.\n    The two phase refrigerant then enters the evaporator.  The evaporator removes heat from the area or substanc"

The ammonia then leaves the evaporator and travels to the compressor.\n    The compressor takes the vapor through the suction line and increases the pressure such that when the heat is removed in the condenser, the vapors change form and become liquid.  Work is required to compress these vapors.  This work is converted into energy and stored in the compressed vapors.  This increase in energy results in an increase in temperature.\n    The compressed vapors then go to a condenser.  The condenser removes a lot of the heat contained in the compressed vapors.  When enough heat is removed, the vapor changes form and become liquid.  This condenser liquid then flows to the receiver.\n    International Diverse Foods receives Anhydrous Ammonia by wheeled vehicle.  The receiver has a maximum of 13,000 pounds, which is filled to 85% capacity.  The Anhydrous Ammonia is in a liquid form at receipt.  Contract personnel complete the connection to the tank.\n    Worst-case release scenario and alternative release scenario\n    As a part of the International Diverse Foods proactive program concerning the hazards of ammonia to its' workers and the surrounding public, its staff has conducted a thorough hazard assessment.\n    For the hazard assessment and the RMP, populations potentially affected are defined as those within a circle that has as its center the point of release and its radius the distance to the toxic or flammable endpoint.  Owners or operators may use Census data to define this population.  The presence of schools, hospitals, other institutions, public arenas, recreational areas, and large commercial and industrial developments that can be identified on street maps within this circle must be noted.

The following information was determined using the Automated Resource for Chemical Hazard Incident Evaluation (ARCHIE) model, based on the stability class F, 4.5 mph wind speed, and a level of 200 ppm for Anhydrous Ammonia.  This resulted in a release rate of 11,000 lbs/min, and an end point of 7.09 miles from the spill point at 90 degrees F.  \n    The alternate case scenario for Anhydrous Ammonia was decided as the loss of Anhydrous Ammonia resulting from a release through a 1-inch line break. .
