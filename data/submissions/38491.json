In turn, each employee not only shares a degree of responsibility for his or her safety and the safety of fellow employee, but also contributes to a safe working environment by using personal protective equipment, following established safety procedure, and reporting unsafe conditions.\nThe continuing effort by all of us at Field Packing Company will contribute substantially to preserving the good health of our employees and to improving our company on a continuing basis.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\n2. Field Packing Company ammonia refrigeration system is currently around 8 years old.  During the implementation process, only the most modern and safe equipment and processes were utilized. There are a total of eight employees plus an ammonia supervisor that monitor the system (24) hours a day- seven days per week.  All ammonia operators have been trained in the safe operating procedures of ammonia systems both in the classroom and on the job.  Continuing education includes review of both our Process Hazard Analysis and our Operating Procedures.   Our ammonia operators perform daily and weekly refrigeration inspections in accordance with our Preventative Maintenance (PM) program. These inspections contain checks and balances to maintain the safe operation of he refrigeration system. Facility tours are conducted in order to obtain the information required to maintain a safe well operating system.  Field Packing Company has written standard operating procedures (OSHA PSM PROGRAM) in a place for employee guidance and training. \n\nAbout our Facility\n3. Field Packing Company distributes quality meat products in all or part of the states of Kentucky, Tennessee, West Virginia, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Missouri, and Mississippi.  The Field Brand has wide recognition and acceptanc"

Field products include sliced luncheon meats, beef and corned beef products and boneless hams. Anhydrous ammonia is utilized in our refrigeration system\n\nEmergency Response Information\n4. Emergency Response Information: As a part of the PSM Program, the facility maintains an Emergency Response Plan that was prepared in order to improve responsiveness to an emergency incident, and to increase the reliability of actions taken during an incident. The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies as well as the public.                                                                                                          \nIn the event of an emergency involving the ammonia system, it is the policy of the facility to request assistance as necessary by calling 911, which will notify the Owensboro Fire Department. In addition, the Daviess County Emergency Service has included Field Packing in its local emergency response planning.  \nAmmonia operators have been 24 hr HAZWOPER trained and our plan is to have a complete HAZMAT team by 9/2004.\n\n5-Year Accident History\n5. Field Packing has had two accidental releases of ammonia in the last 5 years.  The largest occurred in March of 2002.  The estimated release amount was between 100-500 lbs.  The leak required a plant evacuation but there were no off-site consequences.  The second release occurred in June of 2002.
