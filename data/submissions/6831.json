In 1997, Lloyd's Register Quality Assurance reviewed OIMS and evaluated it against the international standard for Environmental Management Systems (ISO 14001) to determine if OIMS meets the requirements of ISO 14001.  After an extensive review which included a number of facility audits, they concluded that the \"environmental components of OIMS are consistent with the intent and meet the requirements of the ISO 14001 Environmental Management Systems Standard.\"  They went on to say, \"We further believe Exxon to be among the industry leaders in the extent to which environmental management considerations have been integrated into its ongoing business processes.\"\n\nThe Exxon Mont Belvieu Plastics Plant (MBPP) has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety and protecting the environment.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our objective is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control, contain and mitigate the release.\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe Exxon Mont Belvieu Plastics Plant, located in Mont Belvieu, Texas, U.S.A., operates a Low Density and a High Density polyethylene train. These two trains operate separately but share utilities and raw materials. MBPP has several regulated flammables, such as ethylene, butene-1, and isopentane. MBPP does not have any RMP regulated toxics on site. MBPP has two covered processes within the Low Density tra"

The HDPE Polyethylene train does not meet the minimum inventories for RMP covered flammables and is not part of this submission.\n\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT RESULTS\n\nThe hazard assessments were done using the EPA supplied \"look up tables\" which have been incorporated into the computer program supplied by NOAA. This program is called RMPComp.  This program uses all the parameters required by the RMP rule for both worst case (WCS) and alternate case (ACS) scenarios.\n\n\nOne of two WCS associated with a release of a flammable substance in Program 3 processes at MBPP is a vapor cloud explosion (VCE) involving the full inventory of the largest storage vessel containing butene-1.  The full inventory is assumed to release, completely vaporize and ignite.\n\nThe second WCS assumes the entire contents of the ethylene pipeline releases and ignites resulting in a VCE.  Although we have numerous controls to prevent such releases and manage their consequences, should one occur, no credit for passive mitigation measures were taken into account in evaluating these WCS. These WCS both have an off-site impact.                                                                                          \n\nOne of 2 ARSs' for flammable substances at MBPP is a failure of a pipe on a butene-1 vessel followed by a VCE.  This ARS has off-site impacts. \n\nThe other ARS for flammable substances at MBPP is a release of ethylene from a cut on an ethylene line followed by a VCE. This ARS also has an off-site impact. \n\n\nEXTERNAL EVENTS ANALYSIS (Texas Gulf Coast)\n\nMBPP is subject to external events, which may cause the release of hazardous materials.  MBPP is designed and operated in such a way as to minimize the probability and the impact of such events.  External events considered in the design and operation of the plant include, but are not limited to: security; temperature extremes; hurricanes; tornadoes; winds; precipitation & flooding; utility disruption; and year 2000 comp"

MBPP utilizes an Emergency Preparedness Plan with the latest weather tracking services to identify potential weather threats and take action to secure the plant days in advance of approaching storms.\n\n\nExxon has had a program in place for the past 18 months to identify and resolve Y2K related problems.  This work is scheduled to be completed well before December 31, 1999 and we do not expect to have any significant Y2K related problems. \n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM STEPS\n\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at MBPP.  EPA's Program 3 prevention requirements were implemented because processes at MBPP meet Program 3 criteria and are also subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard.  In addition, Exxon Corporation has implemented Operations Integrity Management Systems (OIMS) at each of its operations worldwide that includes the aspects of EPA's prevention program and this summary describes OIMS.  Further, as already mentioned, OIMS has been attested as equivalent to ISO 14001 as a valid management system to oversee the implementation of the risk management activities.\n\n\nAdditional details are included in the Data Element section of this RMP plan.  Due to the ongoing nature of our safety programs, the dates associated with the various activities in our accident prevention program are constantly changing.  We selected June 10, 1999 as the cutoff date for this information.  Consequently, any of the reviews/updates conducted after that date are not reflected in the Data Element information.\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nMBPP encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention.

Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at MBPP and addresses each accident prevention program element.  In addition, MBPP has a number of initiatives under way addressing process safety and employee safety issues.  These initiatives include forming teams to promote both process and personal safety.  The teams typically have members from various areas of the plant, including operations, maintenance, engineering, and plant management.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nMBPP keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  Specific groups within MBPP are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.  A table summarizing the reference documents and their location is readily available as part of the OIMS documentation to help employees locate any necessary process safety information.\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs).  This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.

Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nMBPP primarily uses the Knowledge Based Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) study that is an adaptation by Exxon Research and Engineering and Exxon Chemical Americas of widely used industry methodologies to perform these evaluations.  HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating experience and engineering expertise on the process to be evaluated.  This PHA team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to local management for resolution.

These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years for the life of the process. The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained. The team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\n\nOperating Procedures and Safe Work Practices\n\nMBPP maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) startup, (2) shutdown, (3), normal and (4) emergency operations.  These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a consistent basis for training of new operators. The procedures are kept current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.

New employees receive basic training in plant operations if they are not already familiar with such operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with an experienced operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After employees demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  In addition, all operations technicians periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years.  All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\nContractors\n\nMBPP uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, MBPP has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform MBPP personnel of any hazards they find during their work.

In addition, MBPP evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor.  MBPP personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\nPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\n\nMBPP conducts a PSSR and or uses a Safety Close-out Checklist for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information that is controlled by management of change (MOC).  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure safety features, procedures, personnel, and the equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready.  The PSSR review team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness.  A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves as a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nMBPP has well-established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition.
