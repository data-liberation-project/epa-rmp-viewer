The Railroad Commission of Texas and Houston Fire Department have approved the installation of the system.  If an emergency were to occur, it is the facility's policy to notify the Houston Fire Department by calling 911, which may trigger involvement by Harris County Emergency Management as necessary.  \n\nU.S. Energy has an outstanding safety record, and to date, has not had an accident involving butane that has resulted in death, injury, property/environmental damage, evacuations or sheltering in place.\n\nIn the event of an accidental release of butane at the U.S. Energy Houston North Terminal butane system, Terminal Emergency Response Personnel have been trained to immediately activate an emergency shutdown device (ESD) at one of eighteen locations depending on location of the release and is the policy of the terminal to initially contact the Houston Fire Department and request their assistance (via 911).
