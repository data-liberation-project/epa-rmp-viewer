The corporate core values championed by our President, embraced by our Senior Leadership Team, encouraged by our Managers/Supervisors and pledged to our associates are: a) Caring Relationships, b) Entrepreneurial Spirit, c) Strategic Foresight, and d) High Performance. These four core values support our Safety and Health philosophy and management efforts. Interpersonal communications, problem solving, planning and safety achievement have a direct relationship with the core values when applied to safety training, hazard assessment/investigation, post-accident/incident recovery and generating solutions to potential risk exposures. U.S. Venture integrates Safety expectations as a part of Manager/Supervisors' responsibilities in order to create a meaningful daily presence during all work activity. All departments at the corporate level including Risk Management, Legal, Human Resources, Finance and Operations reinforce strategic safety planning and solid operation level decision-making that will reduce risk exposures.\n\n\n\nOur continuous improvement process, inclusive of historic analytics, risk assessments, and corrective/preventive actions, focuses on three primary objectives:\n\n1. Safety of clients, servicers, and community,\n\n2. Up time performance and user experience and,\n\n3. Site cost drivers and reductions through root cause analysis and long term corrective/preventive actions.\n\n\n\nWhile uptime and site costs goals are easily quantifiable, Safety is paramount to U.S. Venture as this establishes our credibility and reputation with employees, communities, and the industry.\n\n\n\nThe U.S. Oil Houston North Terminal is located on seven acres in an industrial area in Houston, TX.

In addition, the terminal stores butane (regulated substance) supplied by truck transports in two 30,000 gallon pressure vessels that is then transferred via piping and associated equipment on site and blended into gasoline.  The maximum quantity of butane that is stored onsite would be 270,000 pounds, thus subjecting the facility to RMP requirements.\n\n\n\nThe U.S. Oil Houston North Terminal regulated butane process complies with National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) 58 for Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) Storage and Handling, and it is the facility's policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws/codes including Texas Administrative Code for LPG Installations, OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) rule, and DOT's Hazardous Materials regulations.  The Railroad Commission of Texas and Houston Fire Department have approved the installation of the system.  If an emergency were to occur, it is the facility's policy to notify the Houston Fire Department by calling 911, which may trigger involvement by Harris County Emergency Management as necessary.  \n\n\n\nU.S. Oil has an outstanding safety record, and to date, has not had an accident involving butane that has resulted in death, injury, property/environmental damage, evacuations or sheltering in place.\n\n\n\nIn the event of an accidental release of butane at the U.S. Oil Houston North Terminal butane system, Terminal Emergency Response Personnel have been trained to immediately activate an emergency shutdown device (ESD) at one of eighteen locations depending on location of the release and is the policy of the terminal to initially contact the Houston Fire Department and request their assistance (via 911).

If there is no answer at the terminal to confirm whether help is needed, the security and alarm company will contact the terminal's on-call number.  The security and alarm company will continue calling terminal associates until they are able to speak with somebody in person to communicate the situation.\n\n\n\nOur planned changes to improve safety include the installation of an additional emergency shutdown located outside of the butane tank system fenced area."
