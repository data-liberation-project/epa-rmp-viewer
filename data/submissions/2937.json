(Odom's) Madison, Tennessee facility packages raw pork products and produces gravy products for distribution to private and commercial industries. Anhydrous ammonia is handled at Odom's for the refrigeration system process.  Anhydrous ammonia is listed as a regulated toxic substance under 40 C.F.R. Part 68, and Odom's handles quantities that exceed the EPA threshold quantity for applicability of the RMP rule.  The maximum ammonia inventory at Odom's is eleven thousand seven hundred fifty-seven pounds (11,757).   Ammonia is utilized at Odom's as a refrigerant to cool the building and freezers. \n\nOdom's commitment to providing a safe, healthy work environment for employees as well as providing a safe, healthy environment for the surrounding community is supported by Odom's Process Safety Management Program which includes operating procedures, mechanical integrity, inspection and testing of equipment to ensure releases are eliminated or minimized to an amount that will not affect employees \nor the surrounding community.\n\nThe emergency response program includes provisions for evacuation of employees at the facility and notification of local emergency agencies .  The LEPC will provide notification to any potentially affected surrounding communities in the event of a release of anhydrous ammonia.  Odom's adheres to all applicable Federal, State and local safety and environmental regulations for the prevention of releases of this chemical.\n\nWORST-CASE SCENARIO:\n\nA worst-case scenario analysis was conducted for the anhydrous ammonia refrigeration process at Odom's utilizing requirements contained in EPA guidelines.  EPA has defined a worst-case release as, \"a release of the largest quantity of a regulated substance from a vesse"

Administrative controls that limit the quantity of a substance in a vessel or pipe can be considered when determining the worst-case scenario.  The possible causes of the release or the probability that such a release might occur is not considered in the worst-case scenario analysis; the release is simply assumed to take place.  \n\nFor toxic gases, such as ammonia, the total quantity in a vessel is assumed to be released over a period of ten (10) minutes.  This applies whether the release takes place outside or inside a building.  Only passive mitigation systems may be taken into account for the worst-case consequence analysis.\n\nThe toxic endpoint for ammonia is 0.14 mg/L.  This airborne concentration has been published by the American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA) and is the maximum airborne concentration below which is believed that nearly all individuals can be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects or symptoms which could impair an individual's ability to take protective action.\n\nMeteorological conditions for the worst-case scenario are defined by EPA Guidance as atmospheric stability class F (stable atmosphere), wind speed of 1.5 meters per second (3.4 miles per hour), and ambient air temperature of 25 degrees C. Topography for the worst-case scenario is either rural or urban.\n\nWORST-CASE SCENARIO FOR ANHYDROUS AMMONIA - TOXIC SUBSTANCE\n\nThe analysis conducted by Odom's identified the worst-case ammonia  release as the rupture of the high pressure receiver, which is located inside the building.  The high pressure receiver has a total capacity of five thousand six hundred and forty-two pounds (5,642).  The ammonia is stored as a liquid under pressure, therefore a release would be in the form of a gas.  The quantity of ammonia cont"

The total quantity (5,642 pounds) in the tank would be released into engine room which then vents to the atmosphere.  Utilizing DEGADIS air \nmodeling software (utilized for dense gases), the calculated distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L with urban surroundings, a wind speed of 1.5 meters/second, stability class F with ambient air temperature results in a distance of 0.4 miles.  \n\nALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO:\n\nEPA requires that an alternative scenario be analyzed for each regulated toxic chemical present above the threshold quantities. The release scenario must include consideration of the following:\n\n1. Transfer hose releases due to splits or sudden uncoupling;\n2. Process piping releases from failures at flanges, joints, welds, valves and  \n   valve seals, and drains or bleeds;\n3. Process vessel or pump releases due to cracks, seal failure, drain bleed, or\n   plug failure;\n4. Vessel overfilling and spill, or overpressurization and venting through \n   relief valves or rupture disks; and\n5. Shipping container mishandling and breakage or puncturing leading to a spill.\n\nAlternative release scenarios, as required by EPA guidance, should be those that lead to concentrations above the toxic endpoint beyond the facilities fence line, unless no such scenario exists.  In identifying alternative scenarios, active mitigation systems are allowed to be considered, such as interlocks, \nshutdown systems, pressure relief devices, flares, emergency isolation systems, and fire water and deluge systems, as well as passive mitigation systems.\n\nMeteorological conditions for the alternative release scenario are defined by EPA Guidance as atmospheric stability class D, wind speed of 3.0 meters per second, and ambient air temperature of 25 degrees C and 50 percent humidity.  Topography for the alternative release scenario is either rural or urban.\n\nALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO FOR ANHYDROUS AMMONIA - "

      "SummaryText": "TOXIC SUBSTANCE\n\nThe alternative release scenario identified and reported in the Risk Management Plan for the ammonia refrigeration process is a release from a failure of a flange on the discharge side of the pump (spiral accumulator pump). This alternative scenario is a scenario that Odom's considers possible at this site.\nIt was chosen because a release of this type is the alternative scenario identified that would most likely occur and the scenario that would lead to the greatest distance to the toxic endpoint.  A failure in the flange would most likely result from corrosion and deterioration of the piping material, not from external impact (the flanges at this location are not in traffic areas); therefore a complete shear of the piping is not considered a likely event.  Instead a hole (created from corrosion and deterioration) with a diameter one \nquarter of inch (cross-sectional area = .05 in2) is used to calculate the release.  The pump capacity is normally operating at 28 gallons per minute (159.36 lb./min) and the operational pipe pressure is approximately 60 psi.  \n\nThis release occurs outside with no passive mitigation present.  The estimated release duration was determined to be approximately 1 hour.  The topography is urban surroundings.  A wind speed of 3 meters/second, a stability class D and an air temperature of 77 degrees F are assumed for alternative release scenarios utilizing the RMP* Comp software analysis program.\n\nUsing these parameters it was determined (using EPA Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance tables) that with an ammonia release from a leak at a flange over a period of one hour, the estimated distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L is 0.1 miles or 528 feet.\n\nAlthough this scenario could occur, preventative maintenance, scheduled inspections of the equipment in the ammonia refrigeration process and continuous monitoring by Odom's ammonia system operator's help to identify and reduce the risk of this scenario from occurring.  \n\nACC"

The Process Safety Management Plan is a comprehensive program with fourteen elements, including process hazard analysis, employee training, operating procedures, mechanical integrity, pre-safety startup, contractor safety, emergency planning and \nresponse, compliance auditing, and employee participation.  The Process Safety Management Program ensures that the processes and the equipment in the processes are designed, constructed, and maintained according to industry codes and standards and that the processes are operating according to good engineering practices.  The mechanical integrity element of the program includes scheduled \ninspections and tests of equipment and of monitoring devices in the process to detect any deficiencies or defects in equipment.  Preventative maintenance and replacement policies of parts and equipment ensures that deficiencies are addressed and corrected before they could potentially contribute to a \nrelease incident.
