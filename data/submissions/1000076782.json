These include:                                            * An extensive preventive maintenance program, following manufacturer's recommendations as well as recognized industry practices, to ensure the overall safety of our process equipment;                                                             * Daily documented inspections of the refrigeration system;                              * Safety interlocks on all major process equipment that automatically activate, based on pre-determined temperature and pressure settings;                           * Ammonia leak detectors tied into an alarm system that allows us to safely monitor refrigerated areas;                                                                                  * Training regarding the properties and hazards associated with ammonia for all Stop & Shop employees as part of the Hazard Communication Program, with additional training provided for all employees who work with the refrigeration system;                                                                                                                 * Daily dialogue between Operations and Maintenance employees regarding the operating status of the refrigeration system; and                                         * Maintain an open dialogue with the Freetown Fire Department and the LEPC.                                                                                                                  To provide the most effective means of process control, Stop & Shop installed a programmable controller to monitor and reliably control all operating conditions within the refrigeration system.  In the event of a system pressure increase, the programmable controller automatically activates additional condensers and air handling units.  Operators can activate an emergency shutdown of all system components through one of two mechanisms.  The shutdown can either be achieved through the main controller, or the emergency stop button located on the exterior of the engine room.",

This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, we are coordinated with the Freetown Fire Department which provides emergency response expertise. If necessary, additional emergency response assistance would also be provided by the District 1 DFS HAZMAT Response Team. \n\n\n\nThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nOur facility's primary activities revolve around food storage and distribution.   Anhydrous ammonia is the only regulated substance present at our facility.  All of the ammonia inventory is attributed to its use as a refrigerant.\n\n\n\nThe Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release\n\nWorst case and alternate release scenarios were developed using the methodology given in the EPA \"RMP*COMP\" as well as the EPA \"Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration\".  The details of the chosen scenarios are located within the Risk Management Program that is located on site.\n\n\n\nThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR Part 68 of the EPA.  In addition, our facility is subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119.  Our facility is also subject to EPCRA Section 302 notification requirements.
