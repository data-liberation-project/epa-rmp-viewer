It is handled and stored as a non-refrigerated liquid.  Effects of acute exposure to high concentrations of vinyl acetate monomer include irritation of the respiratory tract experienced as nasal discomfort and discharge, with chest pain, coughing, headache, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, and drowsiness.  Liquid or vapor may cause irritation of the eyes experienced as stinging, excess blinking and tear production, with excess redness in the conjunctiva.  At high doses vinyl acetate can be fatal by inhalation, ingestion, skin contact and other routes.  The RMP threshold quantity listed in 40 CFR 68.130 for vinyl acetate monomer is 15,000 lb.  Para-Chem uses vinyl acetate as a raw material in an emulsion polymerization reaction and stores a maximum of 38,300 gallons in its monomer tank farm. For modeling purposes, the tank size was rounded to 38,500 gallons (299,898 pounds) in order to make conservative estimates.\nPara-Chem has not had an accident or incident involving a reportable quantity of this material in the last five years.\n\nAmmonia is classified by the USEPA as a toxic.  It is handled and stored as a non-refrigerated liquid.  Effects of acute exposure to high concentrations of ammonia include eye, mucous membrane and systemic irritation by inhalation.  At high doses ammonia can be fatal by inhalation, ingestion, and possibly other routes.  The threshold quantity listed in 40 CFR 68.130 for ammonia is 20,000 lb.  Para-Chem uses aqueous solutions of ammonia in many of its processes but does not store this material in quantities greater than the threshold amount.  The threshold quantity calculation for ammonia is based on an example published in the Federal Register:\n8,000 gallons * 8.34 lb/gal (H2O) * 0.9 (sp. gr. A"

Although many of these materials are hazardous in nature, the relative risk when compared to the listed chemicals is much less.  \nThe only accident or incident involving a reportable amount of any of these materials in the last five years was a 700 gallon release of Styrene monomer on April 10, 1997.  All of this material was contained on site except for material lost to vaporization, with no injuries or significant property damage resulting from the release.\n\nThe worst case scenario is a hypothetical release of the largest quantity of any of the hazardous materials listed under the RMP rule as determined by USEPA.  EPA mandates that companies presume a release of the entire quantity of the substance in a ten-minute period.  Only passive mitigation efforts, such as controls in place that do not require action by an employee to initiate, are allowed to be considered.  Examples of passive mitigation include dikes, berms, enclosures, sumps, and drains that contain or channel a chemical release to a safe location to minimize vaporization.\nFor both Acrylonitrile and Vinyl Acetate Monomer, the worst case event is a complete loss of material from a 38,300-gallon storage tank and subsequent vaporization.  The toxic endpoint for acrylonitrile based on Area Locations of Hazardous Atmospheres (ALOHA.) modeling is 0.6 miles.

Para-Chem produces acrylic polymers through water-based emulsion polymerization reactions.  This process utilizes a number of chemicals as raw materials, three of which are listed as toxics under 40 CFR 68.130.  Two of these chemicals, acrylonitrile and vinyl acetate monomer, are present in quantities above the threshold limits set forth for the RMP program.  Furthermore, the process in which these chemicals are used is listed under SIC code 2821, making Para-Chem subject to level 3 program requirements.\nThe RMP requirements can be divided into two main components: 1) development and implementation of a full risk management program, and 2) documentation and submission of a risk management plan that summarizes key information about the program.  The full risk management program includes a hazard assessment, a management system, a prevention program, and an emergency response program.  The risk management plan is designed to present a summary of the risk management program, and the plan will be made available for review by government agencies and the public.  Para-Chem must submit risk management information to EPA by June 21, 1999.  \n\nAcrylonitrile is classified by the USEPA as a toxic.  It is handled and stored as a non-refrigerated liquid.

The results of these audits are then used to ensure that Para-Chem operates in a safe and compliant manner.\n\nSafety is of utmost concern in any facility that handles hazardous chemicals.  At Para-Chem it begins on day one with our new employee training.  New employees are taught the basics of hazardous materials safety, hazard communication and fire and emergency evacuation procedures as well as specific job related tasks.  Key activities such as loading and unloading of tank trucks and railcars are given documented procedures to minimize the risk of accidents.  Several of these have been documented in Section 4.  Additionally, a copy of the basic safety rules that all employees must abide by is available for review at the site.\n\nAlthough the Simpsonville location employs over 150 people, it is sometimes necessary to bring in outside contractors for specific tasks.  Any contractor that is performing work in the manufacturing facility is given a safety briefing that includes:\n7 Emergency Evacuation Plan\n7 Location of Fire Extinguishers, Fire Exits, and Eye Wash/Shower Stations\n7 Location of MSDS\n7 Location of Safety Manuals\n7 Specific Hazards Workers May be Exposed To\n7 Use of PPE\n7 Requirements of Hot-Work Permits\n7 Use and Storage of any Flammable Liquids\n7 Location of any Underground Utility Lines\n7 Manner of Conduct\n7 Other related information \n\nIt is evident from this review that the manufacture of specialty chemicals poses some risk to the public due to the nature of the raw materials used.  Para-Chem has taken every effort to minimize these risks by implementing programs and procedures which reduce the possibility of incidents involving the storage and handling of these chemicals."
