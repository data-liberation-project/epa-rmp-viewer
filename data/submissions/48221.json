A safety committee has been established that is responsible for the implementation of the safety program and an Emergency Response Plan.  This includes safe operation of the ammonia refrigeration system.  Delimex has prepared risk and safety programs to ensure safe handling of the ammonia in the refrigeration system.  Prior to starting operations in 1997, Delimex conducted the following technical studies to identify potential hazards and the appropriate mitigation measures: Process Hazard Analysis, a Hazard Assessment, and a Seismic Assessment.  In addition, Delimex prepared a Risk Management Prevention Program (RMPP) prior to startup of the ammonia refrigeration system.\n\nSince Delimex completed the expansion that added an additional 10,400 lbs of anhydrous ammonia to the existing ammonia system, they have updated the technical studies and management programs to help minimize the potential for an ammonia incident.\n\nB.  Stationary Source and Regulated Substance\n\nThe Delimex facility is located at 7878 Airway Road in San Diego, California.  The facility started operations at this location in April 1997.  At that time, ammonia was used as a refrigerant.  The total of ammonia at the initial startup was 6,570 lbs.  The facility has undergone an expansion adding 10,400 lbs of anhydrous ammonia as mentioned in the previous section of this document.\n\nThe Delimex ammonia refrigeration system is a closed system that cycles the refrigerant, or ammonia, from liquid to gas and back again.  The system, consisting of piping, valves, and process equipment, cycles ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration for product and process equipment.\n\nChanges in pressure are directl"

      "SummaryText": "y related to changes in temperature: lowering the ammonia pressure lowers its temperature.  Low pressure (cold) liquid ammonia provides refrigeration by removing ambient heat.  Removal of ambient heat causes the liquid ammonia (contained within the system)to vaporize.  Heat is later removed from the ammonia as it is condensed back in to a liquid.  Typical operating conditions range from approximately 0 psig on the low pressure of each system to 150 psig on the high side.\n\nAmmonia is the regulated substance at this facility.  The maximum intended inventory of ammonia at the facility is 16,920 lbs.\n\nC.  Hazard Assessment Summary\n\nPlease refer to onsite documentation for details of Hazard Assessment.\n\nD.  Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nAdministrative Measures\n\nDelimex has prepared management programs for compliance with the Process Safety Management (PSM) and Risk Management Program (RMP) regulations.  These management programs include, but are not limited to, operating procedures, mechanical integrity, incident investigation, management of change, contractor safety, and emergency response.  In addition, Delimex has conducted studies to identify potential hazards associated with the ammonia refrigeration system and set up a structure to ensure that recommendations from these studies are addressed.\n\nDelimex personnel circulate throughout the plant, taking note of unusual conditions in any portion of the system 24 hours per day.  If a leak is detected or observed by any Delimex employee, it is immediately reported to the on shift refrigeration engineer.  Action is promptly taken to mitigate the leak so normal operations can resume.\n\nEngineering Measures\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system has several monitoring and sensing devices.  These devices will activate alarms when conditions vary beyond designated limits.  The alarms are indicated on local instrumentation panels, and remote alarms at the facility.  Some alarms will be "

The ammonia refrigeration system at the facility is controlled and monitored using the following: \n\n?Process indicators and alarms\n?Inspections\n?Preventative Maintenance\n?Personnel training\n?Safety Meetings\n?Incident Investigations\n?Ammonia Gas Sensors\n\nE.  Five Year Accident History\n\nThe facility started operations in April, 1997.  Since that time, there have been no release or ?near-misses? associated with the ammonia refrigeration system.\n\nF.  Emergency Response\n\nDelimex has an Emergency Evacuation Plan that includes requirements, for postings, reporting emergencies, evacuation procedures / routes (including re-entry and accountability), communications, rescue duties, etc.  In addition, the refrigeration personnel are current on all HAZWOPER training including 40 hour HAZWOPER Operations Level training.  An emergency response shutdown procedure for the ammonia refrigeration system will be incorporated in to the Emergency Evacuation Plan.\n\nG.  Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nEmergency Response Team(s) will be formally trained for catastrophic releases.  This program will include emergency response team drills, training, and have completed Respiratory Protection training. This is expected to be completed by May 2006.\n\nEmergency Response drills and/or meetings to review emergency response issues and use of the Ammonia Emergency Refrigerant Control System with the local fire department will also take place in May 2006.\n \nAll other items identified in this section for the previous submission have been addressed or completed. (Please refer to 1999 RMP Submission documentation)."
