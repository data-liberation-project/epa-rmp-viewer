      "SummaryText": "Patterson Laboratories is a small company operating a single covered chemical, chlorine.  The company has had a long history of safe processing of chlorine.  Due to its small size and long history of safety, the company does not have a full blown Emergency Response Plan, but utilizes the smaller Emergency Action Plan which consists of handling small minor leaks in-house, and calling for emergency assistance from the local police and fire departments in the event of a larger leak. The only major source of chlorine at the facility is the railcar.  As railcars are built, inspected, and maintained to withstand derailments, the likelihood of any release from the railcar itself is minimal.  Railcars are only connected to internal piping during work hours, at which time all unloading is monitored.  Piping is inspected on a daily basis as part of the railcar connecting, and any signs of wear prompt an immediate change of all piping from railcar to processor.  In addition, all piping is replaced at regularly scheduled intevals so as to minimize the need to replace due to wear on piping.  All repairs are conducted using a replacement in kind so that the integrety of the system is maintained.  In addition, to maintain the integrety of the processing equipment, all work on the actual processor is conducted by trained contractors supplied by the manufacturer of the original equipment.  In the event of leaks, the facility maintains the proper sealing equipment for the railcar, as well as self contained breathing apparatus so that trained individuals can seal off the railcar."
