In addition, all existing processes are periodically re-evaluated to help ensure that the controls in place to manage hazards are sustained over time.  \r\n\r\nThe James River Plant primarily uses the hazard and operability What-if Technique to perform these evaluations.  What-if analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorou"

      "SummaryText": "General Accidental Release Prevention Program   \r\n                      \r\n Even though the James River Plant is considered a Program 1 facility, the following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the James River Plant.   Although the process at the plant is not subject to the OSHA's PSM standard, the plant has chosen to follow an internal PSM program.    The following describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\r\n\r\nEmployee Participation\r\n\r\nThe James River Plant requires employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team.  Employees have access to all information created as part of the James River Plant's accident prevention program. One way that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program is our Environmental, Health and Safety (EHS) Core Team.   In addition, the James River Plant has a number of initiatives under way that address process safety and employee safety issues. These initiatives include forming teams to promote both process and personal safety. The teams have members from all areas of the plant, including operations, maintenance, engineering, and plant management.\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\n\r\nThe James River Plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information. Specific departments within the plant are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.  \r\n\r\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency"

      "SummaryText": "roviding the following PSM information in this executive summary, since these practices are already in place at the facility.\r\n\r\nOff-Site Consequence Analysis Results\r\n\r\nWorst-Case Releases\r\n\r\nFlammable Substances\r\nThe James River Plant does not store any flammable substances  in the threshold quantities listed in the regulation; therefore, it does not have a worst-case scenario for flammable substances.\r\n\r\nToxic Substances\r\n\r\nEndpoints for toxic substances are based on the ERPG-2.  Toxic endpoints are listed in Appendix A to 40 CFR Part 68 (Table of Toxic Endpoints). Oleum is the only regulated toxic substance at the James River Plant. \r\n\r\nFor the 20% oleum storage vessel, passive mitigation exists and was considered in calculating air emissions.  The product from the oleum storage tank will be kept in a containment area which will contain the entire contents of the tank.  Administrative controls are also in place which allow for filling to 90% of the tank capacity.  High level alarms are also in place to ensure this control.  In addition, an automatic overflow into another vessel further ensures that the tank capacity will not be exceeded. \r\nThe distance to the toxic endpoint resulting from the instantaneous release of the entire contents of the oleum tank remains on-site and does not affect any public receptors.  The distance to the toxic endpoint was calculated based on the U.S. EPA lookup tables contained in the Offsite Consequence Analysis (OCA) Guidance Document.\r\n\r\nAlternative Releases\r\n\r\nAlternative release scenarios are those that are more likely to occur than the worst-case release scenario.  Alternative release scenarios for toxic substances should be those that lead to concentrations above the endpoint beyond the facility's fence- line.  Since the James River Plant is in Program 1 of the ARP, no alternative release scenarios are provided."

      "SummaryText": "Accidental Release Prevention and Response Policies\r\n\r\nVeolia's James River Plant has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of substances. However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\r\n\r\n\r\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\r\n\r\nThe James River Plant manufactures and processes specialty chemicals in Chesterfield County, Virginia.  Raw material, intermediate and process storage tanks are in use at the site.\r\n\r\nThe James River Plant was evaluated to determine if any regulated flammable or toxic substances exceeded the threshold quantity established by the U.S. EPA.  Based on process knowledge, Veolia identified the regulated substances and quantities kept on site. The facility uses oleum, which is the only regulated substances in the process.\r\n\r\nBased on worst-case analyses, the distances to endpoints [i.e. Emergency Response Planning Guideline Level 2 (ERPG-2) developed for each substance by the American Industrial Hygiene Association] do not exceed the distances to public receptors (i.e., off-site residences, institutions, industrial and commercial office buildings, parks, or recreational areas inhabited or occupied by the public).  In addition, the James River facility has had no accidents with off-site impact over the last five years and has coordinated with the local emergency responders.  Therefore, the sulfuric acid process is classified as Program 1 under the Accidental Release Prevention (ARP) Program.\r\nThe James River Plant is not subject to Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM). It is classified under a listed SIC Code 2819, and is p"
