Non - bulk raw material receipts (drum /carton commodities) are generally received via common carrier. Facilities for receiving and storage of the more volatile process materials are located outdoors in areas as remote as practical from the main plant processes. These installations are typically protected and provided with a means of secondary containment (e.g. dikes) in order to minimize hazards resulting from spillage. The physical transfer of raw materials from transport container to storage and on to the various processing units is accomplished by means of pumps and/or inert gas pressure.\n\n\n\nBR and SSBR, reaction products of butadiene and butadiene / styrene respectively, are manufactured in a continuous polymerization process utilizing either toluene or cyclohexane/ methylcyclohexane solvent as a diluent. Organometallic catalysts are added to initiate the reaction and carry it to the desired level of conversion. The resulting polymer solution is then pumped through a series of flash distillation units to recover the unreacted butadiene and a significant portion of the solvent, leaving a more viscous solution.\n\n\n\nThe majority of the remaining solvent is then separated (stripped) from the polymer using a steam distillation process. This occurs by bringing the polymerized rubber into contact with hot water and steam. Stripped vapors arising from this operation are condensed and recovered for reuse. The remaining crumb water slurry is then dewatered, dried, baled, packaged and warehoused.\n\n\n\nPBAN, a reaction product of butadiene/acrylonitrile/acrylic acid, is a batch process.

Finished product is then transferred to hold tanks pending laboratory analysis and on to storage.\n\n\n\nIn our processes, we use the following chemicals that EPA has identified as having the potential to cause significant off site consequences in the event of a substantial accidental release:\n\n\n\nToxics\n\n\n\nAcrylonitrile. We maintain an on site inventory that is greater than the RMP threshold quantity of 20,000 pounds. This chemical is one of the reactants used in the manufacturing of PBAN polymer.\n\n\n\nAmmonia. We maintain an on site inventory that is greater than the RMP threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds. Ammonia is used solely as a refrigerant in various parts of our manufacturing process.\n\n\n\nTitanium Tetrachloride. We maintain an on site inventory that is greater than the RMP threshold quantity of 2,500 pounds. This material is used as a catalyst in the manufacture of BR and SSBR rubber. It is delivered and stored in 1,150 Ib DOT shipping containers until it is introduced into our processes.\n\n\n\nFlammables:\n\n\n\n 1,3-Butadiene. We maintain an on site inventory that is greater than the RMP threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds. This chemical is the primary raw material used in the manufacturing of our products.\n\n\n\n Hydrogen. We maintain an on site inventory that is less than the RMP threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds.\n\n\n\nOur accidental release prevention programs and our contingency planning efforts allow us to effectively manage the hazards that are posed to our employees, the public, and the environment by our use of these chemicals.\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nWe take a systematic, proactive approach to preventing accidental releases of hazard"

The following is a brief summary of accidental chemical releases involving materials covered under EPA's RMP rule during the past five years:\n\n\n\nWe have had no off site releases of any covered chemicals in the past five years. \n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM \n\n\n\nWe maintain an integrated contingency plan, which consolidates all of the various federal, state, and local regulatory requirements for emergency response planning. Our program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations. Furthermore, we coordinate our plan with the community emergency response plan.\n\n\n\nIn October 2013 ASRC hosted a successful emergency response drill on the site.  There were 280 - 300 outside responders for a mock disaster exercise.  Seventeen different fire departments, specialty HAZMAT teams, Metropolitan Sewer District, Jewish Hospital, Sts Mary & Elizabeth Hospitals, FBI, Department of Homeland Security, State of KY, and EPA participated in the drill.\n\n\n\nTrain to the Commonwealth of Kentucky Standard for Industrial Firefighter.  Currently ~50 employees have met the certification.\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nThe following is a list of improvements that we are planning to implement at the facility to help prevent and/or better respond to acidental chemical releases:\n\n\n\n* Maintain chemical response training for emergency response personnel\n\n* Maintain ISO 14000 program certification\n\n* Implement process hazard analysis recommendations\n\n* Implement mechanical integrity recommendations\n\n* Maintain communication efforts in the event of accidental releases through the use of the CODE RED system.\n\n* Improved training for operators\n\n* Investment in fire protection systems and automat"
