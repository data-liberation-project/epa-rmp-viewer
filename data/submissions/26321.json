Firmchem Chemical Manufacturing Center is\n\nlocated on an approximately 18 acre industrial site in a\n\nsecluded area of Port Newark. The location is bounded to the\n\nEast  by Newark Bay, on the South by marshlands and the  New\n\nJersey  Turnpike, to the West by an over the road  trucking\n\ncompany terminal, and to the North by a CONRAIL railhead and\n\nnew car storage facilities.\n\n\n\nThe Firmchem Chemical Manufacturing Center produces a\n\nvariety of specialty chemicals for the Flavor & Fragrance\n\nindustry. A number of our products are manufactured through\n\nchemical processes regulated under the OSHA Process Safety\n\nManagement rule (OSHA 1910.119). One of these processes is\n\nalso regulated under the EPA Risk Management Program. The\n\nfacility  must  also comply with other federal,  state,  and\n\nlocal  safety  and  environmental regulations, as well  as\n\ninternal  company  standards. We conduct business with the\n\nhighest priority on the safety and health of our employees,\n\ncustomers, and the general public, as well as on the\n\nprotection of the environment.\n\n\n\nThe site is regulated under the USEPA RMP rules for use of\n\none flammable liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) material\n\nIsobutylene (2-Methylpropene or [-Propane, 2-methyl-] CAS\n\n#115-11-7).  Isobutylene is used in one process known as\n\n\"DDD\".  The isobutylene is used as a reactant in the DDD\n\nmanufacturing process. The isobutylene is purchased from\n\nExxonMobil and received and stored on-site in an industrial\n\nstandard LPG trailer designed and operated to comply with\n\nall US Department of Transportation (DOT) safety regulations\n\nand specifications.  The material is onsite for about 12\n\nweeks or about 23% of the year.\n\n\n\nThe storage tank is located in an isolated area of the plant\n\nand in plant structures including a 500,000-gallon firewater\n\ntank, and three process buildings 55 feet high provide a\n\nsubstantial buffer between the storage area and the plant\n\nfenceline on three sid"

Catastrophic failure of the tank due to physical impact\n\nor impingement by fire are the two primary worse-case loss\n\nscenarios. All chemical processing facilities in the area of\n\nthe isobutylene tank are protected by automatic sprinkler or\n\ndeluge systems, and a high pressure water cannon is in the\n\nimmediate vicinity of the isobutylene tank holding area. The\n\ntank is protected by controlling traffic in the area and by\n\nuse of concrete jersey barriers, which are ringed around the\n\ntank.   The   Newark Fire Department is a paid force\n\nspecializing in industrial facilities. The typical response\n\ntime for fires in the area is about 5 to 10 minutes.\n\n\n\nThe facility's process safety management program is\n\norganized in a manner consistent with the OSHA PSM rule. The\n\naccident prevention program requirements of RMP closely\n\nfollow the programs in place to comply with PSM. These\n\nprograms help to ensure  the  safe operation and maintenance\n\nof our  chemical processes,  and  prevent  and mitigate\n\npotential  accidents involving  regulated  and  other\n\nhazardous  chemicals.  Key features of the Firmchem accident\n\nprevention program are described below.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety information of all types is gathered and\n\nretained in designated locations. Examples include MSDS's,\n\nin-house reactivity and stability data, chemical\n\ncompatibility matrices, process chemistry and hazards,\n\nP&IDs, electrical classification, equipment drawings and\n\nspecifications, and interlock descriptions. This information\n\nis available for process hazard analyses and the development\n\nof other process safety elements.\n\n\n\nProcess hazard analyses (PHA's) are conducted on both PSM\n\nregulated and non-regulated processes, with the level of\n\ndetail commensurate with the hazards. PHA's utilize both\n\nHAZOP and What-if techniques. Multidisciplinary PHA teams\n\nare assembled, including a trained team leader, engin"

These procedures are carefully developed from\n\npertinent process safety information. Where possible,\n\nsophisticated computer programming is applied to run the\n\noperations, which improves process reliability, quality, and\n\nsafety. This allows production personnel to focus on\n\ntroubleshooting and other high level tasks.\n\n\n\nPersonnel operating chemical processes have been trained in\n\ntheir job tasks and responsibilities by working side-by-side\n\nwith more experienced operators, use of outside training\n\nmaterials, and consultation with supervisory personnel.\n\nSupervision evaluates the performance of employees to\n\ndetermine when they are prepared to operate independently.\n\nSafe work practices, such as equipment release,\n\nlockout/tagout, confined space entry, have been developed.\n\nThese are occasionally reviewed and updated as needed.\n\n\n\nA fully qualified maintenance staff performs repairs and\n\ninspections on equipment and instrumentation used in\n\nregulated chemical processes, using manufacturers' or\n\ninternal procedures.
