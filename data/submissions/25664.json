This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including:\n\n *  A description of our facility and use of substances regulated by EPA's RMP regulation\n *  A summary of results from our assessment of the potential offsite consequences from accidental chemical releases\n *  An overview of our accidental release prevention programs\n *  A five-year accident history for accidental releases of chemicals regulated by EPA's RMP rule\n *  An overview of our emergency response program\n *  An overview of planned improvements at the facility to help prevent accidental chemical releases from occurring and adversely affecting our employees, the public, and the environment\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nOur facility  takes propane off Williams Pipeline (Mapco) and stores it in twelve(12) 48,500 gallon aboveground pressurized storage bullets and one(1) 28,560,000 gallon underground storage cavern. Ethyl mercaptan, an odorant, is also stored at the terminal and is injected into the propane stream to odorize the propane prior to truck or rail loading.  The facility is completely automated and is available for around the clock propane truck loading by trained, qualified drivers.  Rail car loading is only performed by Dome employees or contractor personnel.  The facility is equipped with access code and  hand scan devices so only qualified drivers can gain access to the terminal and loading operations.  Our facility also receives a pro"
