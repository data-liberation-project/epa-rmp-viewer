      "SummaryText": "The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Managment Program (RMP) was developed under the authority of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990.  The facility covered in the Risk Managment Program (RMP) includes the City of Longview Wastewater Treatment Plant.  The Wastewater treatment plant has a process that contains more than the threshold quantity of a regulated substance.  The process included in the RMP is the disinfection process using chlorine.  Currently the plant uses one ton chlorine cylinders (2000 lbs.).  The chlorine system includes four cylinders mounted for use, with two cylinders on-line (4000 lbs.) and two cylinders ready for service on stand-by (4000 lbs.) when the other two become empty.  The facility handles other chemicals and processes, however these regulated substances do not exceed the current threshold limits.\n\nA worst-case release scenario and an alternative release scenario was developed for chlorine at the plant.  The EPA's RMP Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants Reference Tables or Equations were used for the worst-case and alternative release scenarios for chlorine.  Mitigation measures were not considered and the worst-case consists of release of the greatest amount held in a single vessel over a ten minute period of time.  The scenario produced a distance to end-point of release of 1.3 miles.  The alternative release scenario for the chlorine cylinders consists of a leak in the vessel.  The result is a distance to endpoint of release of 0.10 miles.  The worst-case and alternative release scenarios will be updated at least every five years or if a change in chemical storage occurs.\n\nThe prevention program for the wastewater treatment plant consists of safety information, hazard review, operating procedures, training, maintenance, compliance audits and incident investigations.    The safety information, hazard review, and standard operating procedures have been completed for chlorine.  The training, maintenance, compliance audit"

      "SummaryText": "s and incident investigations are complete for the wastewater treatment plant.  Forms are included in the prevention program to document and verify all information and procedures for the chlorine process.\n\nThe five-year accident history for the Wastewater Treatment Plant does not include any accidents involving any regulated substance.\n\nThe emergency response program includes the response program for incidental leaks as handled by plant employees and the program for major spills and/or releases as covered in the City of Longview's Emergency Response Program.  The incidental releases include leaks encountered when installing the cylinders for use, dismantling chlorine cylinders, and any minor release found upon inspection or testing of the equipment.  Proper handling equipment is maintained at the plant for use in the incidental release situations.  Major releases or problems encountered with the smaller releases will be handled by outside assistance.  The plant will contact the City of Longview Fire Department for assistance with chemical releases.  The local Hazmat team will then be contacted by the fire department if necessary.  The First Call emergency contact system is also available for facilities in Gregg County.  The fire department will initiate contact with the First Call Program for emergency notification assistance.  Emergency notification forms are maintained with the RMP."
