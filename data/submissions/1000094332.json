Oleum is a chemical raw material used in the manufacturing and processing of many products at CDR.  Oleum is received only by tank truck and stored in two storage tanks.  At CDR, oleum is used in the production of white oils by contacting lube oil feedstocks with oleum.  The acid contact process produces a non-reactive food-grade white oil approved for human consumption.  CDR's white oils form the basic ingredient in such consumer products as baby oil, cosmetics and pharmaceuticals.\r\n\r\nSulfur dioxide, a toxic gas, is also present in the plant, but at quantities well below the threshold quantity of 5,000 pounds.  The operational processes containing sulfur dioxide were evaluated and determined to have no potential impact to the community in the event of a release.\r\n\r\n\r\nFLAMMABLE SUBSTANCES\r\n\r\nThe plant has no Risk Management Program (RMP) regulated flammable materials above the threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds.

For specific process areas, the plant has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g. temperature, level, pressure and composition) and this information is an intricate part of our process operating procedures.  The plant ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g. automated shutdown systems).\r\n\r\n\r\nPROCESS HAZARD ANALYSIS (PHA)\r\n\r\nCDR has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate safeguards or controls are in place to manage these hazards.  The plant utilizes the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis and the What-If/Checklist technique to perform these evaluations.  HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  The What-If technique is also utilized for less complicated or hazardous processes.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  The team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures and makes recommendations for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\r\n\r\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to local management for resolution.

These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and whenever significant changes in the process so warrant.  These reviews continue at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.  Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\r\n\r\n\r\nOPERATING PROCEDURES\r\n\r\nCDR maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process.  These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provides a basis for consistent training of new operators.  These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.  In addition, the plant maintains process parameter documents that provide guidance on how to respond to upper or lower limit exceedances for specific process or equipment parameters.

      "SummaryText": "this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate (e.g. through testing, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years.  All training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTRACTORS\r\n\r\nCDR uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their designated work areas, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, (6) notify plant management of any work related incidents, and (7) inform plant personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.  This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work.  In addition, we evaluate contractor safety programs and performance during the selection process of a contractor.  Plant personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.  \r\n\r\n\r\nPRE-STARTUP SAFETY REVIEWS (PSSR)\r\n\r\nCDR conducts a PSSR for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure tha"

      "SummaryText": "Calumet Dickinson Refining (CDR) owns and operates the Dickinson Plant. The Dickinson Plant has a history of commitment to public and employee safety. Our commitment is demonstrated in the resources invested in accident prevention such as safety and operations training of our personnel, incident investigations, and standards for design, installation, operation and maintenance of our processes. Our policy at CDR is to implement reliable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL DESCRIPTION\r\n\r\nThe plant is located at Park Avenue and Nichols Street in Dickinson, Texas.  The plant covers an area of approximately 28 acres, which consists of the north and south property bisected by Park Avenue and the east Dickinson Bayou property.  The main plant is located on the north property (10 acres) and consists of all the process units and related tankage.  Located on the south property (10 acres) are a modern packaging and distribution facility and a wastewater treatment facility.  The distribution center encompasses drum filling and storage, tank truck loading operations, white oil blending and finished white oil bulk storage.  The east Dickinson Bayou property (8 acres) was purchased in 1989 and is presently undeveloped.\r\n\r\nThe facility has five distinct operating areas: the white oil unit, the yellow oil unit, the sodium bisulfite unit, crude sulfonate processing and spent salt processing.  CDR also has a crude oil terminal that receives crude via tank truck and offloads through a LACT unit into designated crude oil storage tanks.  The crude is then loaded into rail cars and shipped directly to southwest Louisiana for processing.  The average daily throughput for all finished products is approximately 50,000 gallons per day.  The plant's feedstock is received by rail and tank truck.  Finished products are shipped to customers in bulk an"

      "SummaryText": "cident or a similar incident.  The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to plant management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings or recommendations are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings. \r\n\r\nIn addition, investigation reports are shared with other Calumet facilities to assist in the prevention of similar incidents at those facilities.  Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years so that the reports can be reviewed during future PHAs and PHA revalidations.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMPLIANCE AUDITS\r\n\r\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, the facility periodically conducts an audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented and remain current.  Compliance audits are conducted at least every three years.  \r\n\r\nThese audits are performed by Calumet corporate or business unit and/or outside auditors.  The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to senior management and plant management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are retained.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\n\r\nThe processes at the plant have hazards that must be managed to ensure safe operation.  The accident prevention program summarized previously is applied to the Oleum Process (Program 3) EPA RMP-covered process at the plant.  Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by (1) equipment failures and (2) human errors."
