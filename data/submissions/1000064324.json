Safety performance constitutes a major factor in the overall evaluation of contractor performance and Shell performs periodic evaluations of contractor compliance with Shell and regulatory requirements.\r\nPre-Startup Safety Reviews (PSSR) - The facility conducts a PSSR for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in process safety information.  In addition, all major projects, major turnarounds, and minor turnarounds require a PSSR to be performed prior to completing mechanical work and prior to introducing highly hazardous chemicals to a process.  The purpose of the PSSR is to confirm that (1) construction and equipment are in accordance with design specifications, (2) safety, operating, maintenance, and emergency procedures are in place and are adequate, and (3) training of each employee involved in operating the process has been completed.  This review provides an additional check to make sure that all supporting systems are operationally ready.  The PSSR review team creates an Expected State of Readiness Document, which is used to verify all aspects of the organization's readiness.\r\nMechanical Integrity - The facility has well-established practices and procedures to maintain the integrity of pressure vessels and storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps, and emergency shutdown systems.  The basic aspects of the mechanical integrity program include (1) training for process maintenance activities, (2) inspection and testing of process equipment, (3) correction of identified equipment deficiencies as appropriate, and (4) quality assurance in construction, installation and spare parts.\r\nMaintenance personnel are knowledgeable of the safety and health hazards of the work areas, applicable maintenance procedures, emergency response plans, and applicable safe work practices to help ensure they can perform their job in a safe manner.

This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented.  Changes are reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.  Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures, are updated to incorporate these changes.  In addition, operating and maintenance personnel whose job tasks will be affected by a change in the process are provided with any necessary training on the change.\r\n Incident Investigation - The facility promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, significant toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss or personal injury.  The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent recurrence, and forwards these results to management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings.

The HSEGT Process Safety Committee is responsible for overseeing and periodically developing and conducting these audits in conjunction with the tri-annual PSM prevention program audits required by OSHA on the same frequency.  The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until they are complete.

This coordination includes periodic meetings of the committee with local emergency response officials, local government officials, and industry representatives.  The facility has around-the-clock communication capabilities with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., local fire department).  There is also a community siren warning system for public notification of a significant event.  These systems provide a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.  In addition to periodic LEPC meetings, the facility conducts periodic emergency drills that involve the LEPC and emergency response organizations.\r\n  \r\n1.6 PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\n\r\nThe facility strives to improve the safety of plant processes through periodic safety reviews, the Incident Investigation Program, proactive safety campaigns, and a safety meeting system for soliciting feedback from employees.

The facility is committed to operating in a manner that is safe for the facility's workers, the public, and the environment.  As part of this commitment, Shell Chemical Company has established systems to ensure safe operation of the facility.  One part of this system is the Risk Management Program (RMP) that complies with the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) regulation 40 CFR Part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule).  One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit a Risk Management Plan (RMPlan) describing the risk management program at Shell Chemical Company.  This document is intended to satisfy the RMPlan requirements and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program at the facility in Geismar, Louisiana.  \r\nThe Executive Summary includes an overview of the following elements:\r\n-\tAccidental release prevention and emergency response policies;\r\n-\tFacility and regulated substances;\r\n-\tAccidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps;\r\n-\tFive-year accident history;\r\n-\tEmergency response program; and \r\n-\tPlanned changes to improve safety\r\n\r\n1.1 ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE\r\n\r\nThe facility implements reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous substances.

Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  They ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options being implemented in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are complete and are communicated to operations, maintenance and other employees whose work assignments are in the process and may be affected by the findings.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\r\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the facility periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every five years and will be conducted at the specified frequency until the process ceases to operate.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.

To be qualified to perform a particular job, the Technician must complete initial training, including refresher training for that job at least every three years.  Operating employees receive classroom and on the job training.  The training includes an emphasis on specific safety and health hazards, emergency operations including shutdown, and safe work practices applicable to the job.
