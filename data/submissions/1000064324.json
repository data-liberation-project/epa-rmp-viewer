Because the processes at the Shell Chemical Company Geismar Plant that are regulated by the EPA RMP rule are also subject to the Process Safety Management (PSM) standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\nProcess Safety Information - The facility keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the process.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  Specific departments and individuals in the plant are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in the Safety Data Sheets (SDSs).\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA) - The facility has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each covered process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nThe Geismar facility primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) technique to perform these evaluations.  This technique may be supplemented using the \"What If\", \"Checklist\" or \"What If/Checklist\" techniques.  The analyses are conducted using a tea"

The PHA team also includes one member who is knowledgeable in the specific PHA methodology being used.  The team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to facility management for resolution.  Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  They ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options being implemented in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are complete and are communicated to operations, maintenance and other employees whose work assignments are in the process and may be affected by the findings.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the facility periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every five years and will be conducted at the specified frequency until the process ceases to operate.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.  Again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\n\nOperating Procedures - The facility maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operation such as (1) initial startup of a new process, (2) startup following a turnaround, (3) startup after an emergency shutdown, (4) normal operations, (5) temporary operations, (6) emergency operations, (7) normal shutdown, "

These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  Procedures are periodically reviewed and certified annually as current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the Management of Change (MOC) process.\n\nTraining - To complement the written procedures for process operations, the facility has implemented a training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  To be qualified to perform a particular job, the Technician must complete initial training, including refresher training for that job at least every three years.  Operating employees receive classroom and on the job training.  The training includes an emphasis on specific safety and health hazards, emergency operations including shutdown, and safe work practices applicable to the job.  Operators must complete written and oral tests, as well as field demonstration and observation of skills as part of the qualification training.  Initial and refresher training records for each employee involved in operating a covered process are maintained in the Shell Training and Recordkeeping System, which is maintained by the Training Section of the Human Resources Department.  The records include the employee's name, date of training, copies of tests and other means used to verify that the employee .  Contract employees are not involved in operating covered processes.  \n\nContractors - The facility uses contractors regularly to supplement the facility's workforce during periods of high activity.

In addition, all major projects, major turnarounds, and minor turnarounds require a PSSR to be performed prior to completing mechanical work and prior to introducing highly hazardous chemicals to a process.  The purpose of the PSSR is to confirm that (1) construction and equipment are in accordance with design specifications, (2) safety, operating, maintenance, and emergency procedures are in place and are adequate, and (3) training of each employee involved in operating the process has been completed.  This review provides an additional check to make sure that all supporting systems are operationally ready.  The PSSR review team creates an Expected State of Readiness Document, which is used to verify all aspects of the organization's readiness.\n\nMechanical Integrity - The facility has well-established practices and procedures to maintain the integrity of pressure vessels and storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps, and emergency shutdown systems.  The basic aspects of the mechanical integrity program include (1) training for process maintenance activities, (2) inspection and testing of process equipment, (3) correction of identified equipment deficiencies as appropriate, and (4) quality assurance in construction, installation and spare parts.\n\nMaintenance personnel are knowledgeable of the safety and health hazards of the work areas, applicable maintenance procedures, emergency response plans, and applicable safe work practices to help ensure they can perform their job in a safe manner.

      "SummaryText": "rogram is functioning properly, the facility conducts an audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are in place.  Compliance audits are conducted at least every three years.  Both unit-level workers and management personnel participate in the audits, including at least one person who is knowledgeable in the process.  The HSEGT Process Safety Committee is responsible for overseeing and periodically developing and conducting these audits in conjunction with the tri-annual PSM prevention program audits required by OSHA on the same frequency.  The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are maintained.  \n\nChemical-Specific Prevention Steps - The processes at the facility have hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation.  The prevention program summarized previously is applied to all Program 3 EPA RMP covered processes at the plant.  Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by (1) equipment failure and (2) human errors. \n\nIn addition to the accident prevention program activities, the facility has safety features on many units to help (1) contain/control a release, (2) quickly detect a release, and (3) reduce the consequences of (mitigate) a release.  The following types of safety features are used in various processes.\n\nRelease detection\n\n-    Stationary ethylene oxide monitors with alarms\n\n-    Process alarms\n\n-    Personal exposure monitors\n\nRelease Containment/Control\n\n-    Process relief valves that discharge a flare to capture and incinerate episodic releases\n\n-    Scrubbers to neutralize/minimize chemical releases\n\n-    Valves to permit isolation of the process (manual or automated)\n\n-    Automated shutdown sy"

This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented.  Changes are reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.  Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures, are updated to incorporate these changes.  In addition, operating and maintenance personnel whose job tasks will be affected by a change in the process are provided with any necessary training on the change.\n\n Incident Investigation - The facility promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, significant toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss or personal injury.  The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent recurrence, and forwards these results to management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings.  Incident investigation reports are retained for at least five years so that the reports can be reviewed during future PHAs and PHA revalidations.\n\nCompliance Audits - To help ensure that the accident prevention p"

This history provides a useful record of accidental release prevention over the past five years.  No releases of regulated substances have occurred from Shell Chemical Company Geismar Plant within the last five years that have resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage.\n\n\n\n1.5 EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\n\n\n\nThe facility maintains a written Emergency Response Plan (ERP), which is in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment.  The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including incident command, proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post-incident cleanup and decontamination requirements.  In addition, the facility has procedures that ad"

Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties.  The emergency response program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to the plant processes or other plant facilities.  The ERP changes are administered through the MOC process, which includes informing and/or training affected personnel in the changes.\n\nThe overall ERP for the Shell Chemical Company Geismar Plant is coordinated with the Ascension Parish Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  This coordination includes periodic meetings of the committee with local emergency response officials, local government officials, and industry representatives.  The facility has around-the-clock communication capabilities with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., local fire department).  There is also a community siren warning system for public notification of a significant event.  These systems provide a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.  In addition to periodic LEPC meetings, the facility conducts periodic emergency drills that involve the LEPC and emergency response organizations.\n\n  \n\n1.6 PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nThe facility strives to improve the safety of plant processes through periodic safety reviews, the Incident Investigation Program, proactive safety campaigns, and a safety meeting system for soliciting feedback from employees.  Shell resolves all findings from PHAs, some of which result in modifications to the process to improve safety.\n\n"
