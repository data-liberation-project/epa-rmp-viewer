      "SummaryText": "Wellman CO2 LLC owns and operates the Wellman COFlex Plant.  The Wellman COFlex Plant is under construction with a start date of June 2014 and will receive flash gas from area producers. After cooling and dehydration, the flash gas will be sent to a fractionation column to drop liquids from the gas stream (NGLs). The NGL product will be sent to an amine scrubber, stabilizer and then stored in two bullet tanks. The pressurized bullet tanks hold a maximum volume of 30,000 gallons each with an operating pressure of ~200 psi. \n\n\n\nA total rupture of the 30,000 gallon NGL tank resulting in a vapor cloud explosion would pose the worse-case scenario for the Wellman COFlex Plant. The 30,000 gallon tank has been evaluated for total tank rupture using the RMP*Comp offsite consequence analysis resulting in a distance to endpoint of 0.4 miles. As per EPA's Marplot program, no public receptors are within a 0.4 mile radius of the NGL tanks. The worst-case scenario would not affect anyone within the endpoint of the off-site consequence analysis. Therefore, this RMP has been evaluated for a Program 1 level RMP under 40 CFR 68. The Wellman COFlex Plant is located in a remote area and is normally occupied by Wellman CO2 LLC personnel.\n\n\n\nSince the facility is a newly constructed facility, beginning in June 2014, there is no accident history to report. Should an emergency involving the Wellman COFlex Plant occur, it is Wellman CO2 LLC's policy to notify the Brownfield Fire Department (or first available department through the 911 dispatch system) and request that they respond to the emergency. This policy has been discussed with the local fire chief in Brownfield, TX.\n\n\n\n"
