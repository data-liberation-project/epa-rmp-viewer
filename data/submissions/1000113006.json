The property is bounded on the north by the Burlington Northern/Santa Fe Railway, on the west by Harrison Street, on the south by Sullivan Street, and on the east by the acreage of private landowners.  This land is in two sections bisected by the Texas Department of Transportation ditch which eventually empties into the Pease River that is located ~2 miles north and east of the plant site.  The North 35 acres contain all plant processes, storage and wastewater treatment facilities.  Runoff water and/or a possible spill is channeled to a nominal 500,000 gallon concrete basin to catch the first flush of possibly contaminated rain water or emergency use water (ie., deluge, fire hydrant/sprinkler, etc.)\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICY:\n\nThe Vernon Plant complies with the corporate Process Safety Management (PSM) Program, which meets or exceeds the minimum requirements of OSHA's Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals standard (29 CFR 1910.119), as well as the EPA's Risk Management Program for Chemical Accident Prevention (40 CFR 68). \n\nThe Vernon Plant conducts periodic audits of its PSM & RMP programs to evaluate compliance with the regulatory standards, and develops action plans to ensure prompt correction of any deficiencies noted during these audits.\n\nThe corporate and site PSM Programs addresses the following 14 elements:\n\n     1.\tManagement Review & Commitment\n     2.\tEmployee Participation \n     3.\tProcess Safety Information for Chemicals, Technology & Equipment\n     4.\tProcess Hazard Analysis\n     5.\tOperating Procedures\n     6.\tTraining Program\n     7.\tContractor Safety Management\n     8.\tPre-startup Safety Reviews\n     9.\tMechanical Integrity / Maintenance Management Program\n    10."

Propylene Oxide, the only substance on the plant site that is regulated by PSM & RMP, is stored in two 30,000 gallon above-ground storage tanks. Propylene Oxide is delivered by railcar.\nIn addition to propylene oxide, the Vernon Plant also uses other non-regulated chemicals in its processes, to manufacture a variety of products, both derivatized and non-derivatized, that are sold to a number of different industries which include, but are not limited to, the following;  oil field chemicals, agriculture, mining, cosmetics, and healthcare industries.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND PROPYLENE OXIDE SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS:\n\nManagement at the Vernon Plant is confident that by utilizing the 14 elements of the corporate and site PSM program that process incidents can be prevented.  In addition, all plant employees have received training on all 14 elements, and their participation is required in every aspect of the site's PSM Program.\n\nThe Operator Training program at the Vernon Plant is very extensive, ongoing and includes the following:\n\n      > 40 hours of Entry Level Operator Training\n      > Operator Job/Skills Performance Demonstration and Testing\n      > Propylene Oxide Testing/Certification\n      > D.O.T. Hazardous Material Awareness Training\n      > Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response Training \n\nThe Vernon Plant also has an extensive Preventive Maintenance program which includes systematic testing and maintenance of process safety controls and devices.  The propylene oxide handling and storage operations are equipped with the following process safety controls and devices:\n\n      > Pressure Relief Valves"

The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including incident command system of response management, adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas and critique of the response. The site has established Emergency Response & Support teams consisting of plant personnel trained and prepared to respond to emergency situations.\n To ensure proper functioning, our emergency response equipment is periodically inspected, and tested and serviced as needed. Site-wide emergency preparedness drills are conducted periodically and response critiqued for improvement opportunities. In addition, the plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes in our processes that would require a modified emergency response.\nThe Vernon site is part of the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) whose representatives meet quarterly to discuss issues pertinent to Emergency Response, Changes in Regulations, and committee matters. The Vernon Fire Department is the designated responder for all site releases & spills of Propylene Oxide.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO CONTINUE IMPROVEMENT TO SAFETY:\n\nThe corporate PSM program requires development of annual HSE Plans for site management revie"
