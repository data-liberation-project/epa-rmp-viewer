Facility accidental release and emergency response policy.\n\nThe management and employees of Lincoln Land FS, Inc. are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. The stationary source and the regulated substances handled.\n\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient.  Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel and authorized contractors.\n\nThe maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia that can be stored would be 140,000 pounds.\n\n3. The worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank  released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 370,600 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank and nurse tanks as limited by design standards. \n \nThe distance to the endpoint of .14 mg/L for the worst-case scenario is 2.7miles.\n\nThe alternative release scenario based on the most likely potential incident is a release from a break in a transfer hose.\n  \nThe distance to the endpoint of .14 mg/L for the alternative scenario is .3 miles.  This release has the possibility of extending beyond the facility boundary.\n\n4. The accidental release prevention program.\n\nThis facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations.  This facility has implemented the provisions of Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1, published by The American National"

Five year accident history.  \nOn July 14, 2002 a accidental release occurred. This cause of this release was vandalism / teft. Vandals released 4,000 Lb's of Anhydrous Ammionia Gas from a nures tank, which drifted ofsite onto adjoining farm ground causing crop damage to field corn. Their were no injuiries or deaths,  on site or offsite. \n\n6. The emergency response program.       \nIn the event of an emergency involving anhydrous ammonia, it is our policy to notify the Pleasant Plains Fire Department and the Sangamon County LEPC and request that they respond to the emergency. Our emergency action plans have been coordinated withboth the fire dpeatment and the LEPC.\n7. Planned changes to improve safety. \nRemove all nurse tanks during offseason to help prevent vandalism.\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions."
