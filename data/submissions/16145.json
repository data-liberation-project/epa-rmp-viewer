THIS INCLUDES A SAFETY PROGRAM AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN. THIS IS TO INSURE THAT OUR EMPLOYEES ARE WELL INFORMED AND EDUCATED ABOUT PLANT SAFETY AND ACCIDENTAL RELEASES.\n\nTHE PRIMARY ACTIVITY AT THE SURFACE WATER TREATMENT PLANT IS TO PROVIDE SAFE DRINKING WATER TO THE COMMUNITY. THIS IS ACCOMPLISHED WITH THE DISINFECTION PROCESS UTILIZING CHLORINE GAS. THERE ARE THIRTY 150 LB. CYLINDERS LOCATED IN A ROOM TOTALING 4500 LBS. AT ANY GIVEN TIME ONLY SIX CYLINDERS ARE ACTIVE, TOTALING 900 LBS OF CHLORINE.\n\nWORST CASE SCENARIO WOULD BE A RELEASE FROM THE SIX ACTIVE CYLINDERS DUE TO A CHLORINATOR OR MANIFOLD FAILURE. THIS IS UNLIKELY BECAUSE THE CHORINE SYSTEM IS INSPECTED DAILY, AND ANY INDICATION OF A POSSIBLE RELEASE WOULD BE IMMEDIATELY  REMEDIED.IN THE EVENT OF A RELEASE, THE OPERATOR ON DUTY WOULD NOTIFY THE CROSBY FIRE DEPARTMENT, THE HARRIS COUNTY SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT, AND THE EMERGENCY CONTACT SPECIFIED IN THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN. RESIDENTS, SCHOOLS, ETC. WOULD BE NOTIFIED AND EVACUATED IF NEEDED. THEY WOULD BE ALLOWED TO RETURN WHEN THE ALL CLEAR SIGNAL IS GIVEN.\n\nTHERE HAS NOT BEEN A CHLORINE GAS RELEASE AT THE SURFACE WATER PLANT WITHIN THE LAST FIVE YEARS.\n\nPERSONNEL ATTEND PERIODIC SAFETY MEETINGS, SAFETY SCHOOLS, CHLORINE SCHOOLS, AND PARTICIPATE IN DRILLS IN ORDER TO FACILITATE EMERGENCY RESPONSE AND MINIMIZE THE DURATION OF AN ACCIDENTAL RELEASE."
