      "SummaryText": " Executive Summary\nAgrium U.S. Inc., Hartsville Rainbow Operations, SC\nA.    Introduction\nThe Agrium U.S. Inc. A? Hartsville Rainbow Operations is an ammoniated fertilizer production facility that either unloads 44.8% nitrogen solution (25% aqua ammonia) railcars into storage tanks or uses it directly from the railcar.  The nitrogen solution is then used in the production of granular ammoniated fertilizers.  The facility has been in operation since the 1920A?s and started as a pulverized fertilizer plant.  The original plant, built by Hartsville Fertilizer Company, was purchased by International Agricultural Corporation (IAC) in 1931.  In 1944 a fire destroyed the plant.  The plant was rebuilt and started production in 1946. In the same year the IAC Company name was changed to International Minerals and Chemical Corporation (IMC Corp.).  In 1965 the granulation unit was built and put into production.  On July 1, 1987, the facility was deeded to IMC Fertilizer, Inc., which became IMC AgriBusiness on March 7, 1996. IMC Agribusiness was purchased by Royster-Clark Inc. on April 1, 1999. In October 2006 Royster-Clark was purchased by Agrium Inc. \n\nThe plant site consists of 38 acres of land.  The plant currently employs 50 people and maintains three shifts, which work five days per week, depending on production demands. \n\nAgrium U.S. Inc. A? Hartsville Rainbow Operations has an excellent safety record with no deaths or serious injuries to plant personnel or contractors due to the RMP covered process.\nThe facility safety record is a direct result of much emphasis on safety in the plant on the part of management and employees. \nB.    Accidental Release Prevention Policies and Program:\nThe facility is in full compliance of the RMP standard.  Information for P&ID drawings, operations procedures, Management of Change (MOC) documents, and other pertinent documents are on file at the plant office.   The Agrium U.S. Inc. - EHS Coordinator furnishes technical assistance, performs safet"

A? Hartsville Rainbow Operations management personnel are actively involved in promoting safety and environmental awareness in the community through participation with the LEPC and coordination with the Fire Department.\n\nAgrium U.S. Inc. A? Hartsville Rainbow Operations believes safety and concerns for the environment must be second nature to all employees and contractors.\n\nC.    Emergency Response Policies and Program:\nAgrium U.S. Inc. A? Hartsville Rainbow Operations employees are trained to be familiar with the Emergency Response policies and procedures through safety reviews and other plant safety meetings. The Emergency Action Plan is reviewed on an annual basis as part of the employee safety meetings to ensure refresher training.  Safety policies and procedures are also reviewed on an annual basis or more often if required.  These policies and procedures are also revised to stay in compliance with changing government regulations\n\nThe Emergency Action Plan is followed in the event of an emergency.  Included in this plan is the testing of the emergency system each month.\n\nLocal LEPC and the Hartsville Fire Department personnel are furnished a copy of the Emergency Action Plan and invited to tour the facility and participate in response drills on a regular basis.\n\nThe facility Emergency Action Plan covers such things as accidental releases of plant chemicals, natural disasters, and emergency response practices and procedures.  The plan is reviewed annually with all employees as well as with the local fire department. \n\nThe Agrium U.S. Inc. A?

Worst Case Scenario:\nThe facility has two 30,000 gallon 448 ammonia solution storage tanks on site. The tanks are within a containment area capable of containing 110% of the largest storage tank. \n\nThe EPA requires a very conservative worst case scenario to be a catastrophic rupture of that tank with a complete loss of product over 10 minutes. \n\nIt should be noted that the EPA describes the worst-case scenario as:\n\nA?Because the assumptions required for the worst-case analysis are very conservative, the results likely will be very conservative. These endpoints are concentrations below which it is believed nearly all individuals could be exposed for one half hour to one hour without any serious health effects.  In addition, the worst case analysis is carried out using very conservative assumptions about weather and release conditions.  The distance to the endpoint estimated under worst-case conditions should not be considered a zone in which the public would likely be in danger; instead, it is intended to provide an estimate of the maximum possible area that might be affected in the unlikely event of catastrophic conditions.  Distances greater than 10 kilometers [16 miles] are particularly uncertain. EPA intends the estimated distances to provide a basis for a discussionA?rather than a basis for specific actions.A? \n\n\nAgrium U.S. Inc. A? Hartsville Rainbow Operations used the results of the TFI Degadis Model, which is recognized, accepted, and approved by EPA.\n\nBecause of past operating experience, visual inspections performed on the tanks and operations training, Agrium U.S. Inc. A? Hartsville Rainbow Operations believes the chances for a catastrophic rupture is extremely unlikely.\nF.    Alternative-case Scenario 44.8% nitrogen solution:\nThe 44.8% nitrogen solution tanks are filled via railcars.   The most likely release scenario would be a rupture of a transfer hos"

The conditions chosen for the alternative scenario are those which would create a maximum amount of 44.8% nitrogen solution lost to the environment.\nG.    Five Year Accident History:\nAgrium U.S. Inc. A? Hartsville Rainbow Operations has an excellent safety record with no deaths or serious injuries to any of its personnel or contractors as a result of the RMP covered process. In addition, there have been no accidents resulting in releases of ammonia with off site consequences. Extensive programs and procedures are in place to maintain that record.\nH.    Planned Changes to Improve Safety:\nThe Hartsville plant continuously looks for ways to enhance the safety of the plant.  Plant personnel inspect the plant bi-monthly and an annual Agrium U.S. Inc. A? Hartsville Rainbow Operations review is conducted by the Agrium Wholesale Environmental, Health and Safety Department.\nI.    Summary:\nThe employees of Agrium U.S. Inc. A? Hartsville Rainbow Operations are extremely proud of its safety record.  We believe that with the programs and policies in place, and the continued efforts of 100% of our personnel, we will be able to maintain our safety record and a safe plant environment for all concerned in the years ahead. \n\n"
