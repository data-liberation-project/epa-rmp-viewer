      "SummaryText": "Repauno Products, L.L.C., is a chemical production facility located in Gibbstown, New Jersey.  As part of its production processes, Repauno stores and uses three regulated substances in excess of threshold quantities.  Repauno complies with the New Jersey Toxic Catastrophe Prevention Act (TCPA) Rule (N.J.A.C. 7:31), OSHA's process safety management (PSM) regulation (29 CFR 1910.119), and EPA Risk Management Program Rule (40 CFR 68).\n \nUnder the Risk Management Program, processes subject to OSHA PSM must comply with Program 3 requirements.  Program 3 requirements include a Hazard Assessment Analysis, a Program 3 Prevention Program and an Emergency Response Program.  Repauno has four Program 3 processes that involve regulated substances.  Two processes include nitrosylsulfuric acid (NSA) and sodium nitrite (SN) production.  Both end products are packaged for resale to other manufacturing companies.  The other two processes involve the storage of anhydrous ammonia.\n\nThe NSA process involves regulated quantities of sulfur dioxide and oleum.  NSA is produced by bubbling sulfur dioxide in a reactor containing nitric acid (below the threshold) and 20% oleum. The product is used for dyes, chemical intermediates, or drugs.\n\nThe sodium nitrite process involves regulated substance quantities of ammonia.  Ammonia is burned over platinum gauze at approximately 7800C to form nitric oxide.  The nitric oxide reacts with a caustic/water solution to produce a sodium nitrite solution.  Sodium nitrite is used for numerous chemical processes, printing and dye products, rubber chemicals, metal coating, agricultural products and food additives or corrosion inhibitors. \n\nThe first element of a risk management plan (RMP), Hazard Assessment, (Subpart B of 40 CFR 68) consists of an offsite consequence analysis and a five-year accident history.  The offsite consequence analysis consists of a worst case release scenario--a simulated accidental and catastrophic release of a substance that would "

Following EPA guidance, RMP*Comp was used to estimate a toxic endpoint distance of thirteen (13) miles.  This distance would affect portions of Gloucester, Salem, and Chester counties in New Jersey; northern Delaware; and portions of Philadelphia, Delaware County, and Montgomery County in Pennsylvania.  The estimated population within the 13 mile radius is 1,619,647 based on U.S. Census Bureau information contained in LANDVIEW III mapping software.  Public receptors included schools, residences, prisons, recreation areas, hospitals, and commercial/office/industrial areas.  Environmental receptors included a wildlife refuge and a state park.\n\nAs required by the Risk Management Program rule, Repauno developed a separate alternative release scenario (ARS) for each regulated toxic substance at the facility (e.g., sulfur dioxide, oleum, and anhydrous ammonia).  The selected ARS for sulfur dioxide involved a transfer hose failure.  It was estimated that this accident would result in the release of 560 pounds over a 10 minute period.  Using RMP*Comp, the calculated distance to the toxic endpoint was 0.2 mile, affecting no public or environmental receptors.  The selected ARS for oleum involved a flange failure on the discharge side of the transfer pump.  It was estimated that this accident would result in the release of 3,220 pounds over a 10 minute period.  Using RMP*Comp, the calculated distance to the toxic endpoint was 1.0 mile, affecting residences and commercial/office/industrial areas.  The estimated population within the 1.0 mile radius is 792, based on U.S. Census Bureau"

Using RMP*Comp, the calculated distance to the toxic endpoint was 0.2 mile, affecting no public or environmental receptors. \n\nThe other aspect of the Hazard Assessment is a five-year accident history. Repauno Products, LLC has had no reportable accidents in the past five years.\n\nAnother element of a RMP is the Program 3 Prevention Program, (Subpart D of 40 CFR 68) which includes process safety equipment, process hazard analysis, operating procedures, training, mechanical integrity, management of change, pre-startup review, compliance audits, incident investigation, employee participation, hot work permits, and contractors.\n\nProcess safety information is the first component of the prevention program.  It includes data on each process and every chemical and piece of equipment in that process.  Process manuals, maintained in the main office and throughout the plant, provide a description of each process including a block flow diagram, information on process chemistry, maximum inventory of the EPA regulated chemical, and safe upper and lower operating limits.  MSDS (material safety data sheet) are available and accessible by all employees, for every chemical on site.  MSDS sheets provide information such as toxicity, permissible exposure limits, physical data, reactivity, corrosivity, thermal and chemical stability and the hazardous effects of inadvertently mixing the substance with other materials.  Each piece of equipment is documented through piping and instrumentation drawings (P&IDs) showing electrical classification, relief system design, design codes and standards employed, and safety systems.  These drawings are maintained in the drawing room, which is accessible to all personn"

Failure mode and effects analysis and fault tree techniques were used to determine and evaluate the hazards of the processes.  A team consisting of an outside consulting company and key Repauno personnel completed the PHA.  It is updated every five (5) years and previous PHA's are stored for the life of the process.   \n\nTraining is another component of the prevention program.  All Repauno employees have up-to-date training on all processes, procedures and associated hazards.  Documentation of training is maintained in individual personnel files.\n\nMechanical integrity is another component of the prevention program.  Mechanical integrity is ensured and documented through Repauno's maintenance manual and computer system.  The maintenance manual provides the written procedures for the on-site expertise to handle routine maintenance, inspections, tests and emergency repairs and the computer system tracks all work that is performed along with reminding personnel when to conduct such inspections or tests.\n\nOperating procedures are another component of the prevention program.  Procedures for startup and shutdown for both normal and emergency operations are found in the SN Solution and NSA Manuals, Sections Two, Three and Six.  Consequences of deviation for normal process operation and precautions are found in the SN Solution and NSA Manuals, Section Three.  The lockout/tagout system and confined space entry procedures used at Repauno's are explained in their Safety-How Manual, Section Five.\n\nManagement of change (MOC) and pre-startup procedures are components of the prevention program.  MOC procedures for making major changes in the process are documented so that consistent procedures are followed.

At Repauno, compliance audits are conducted annually by a TCPA inspector.  Findings of the inspection are documented in a report, corrective actions are taken and all documentation is retained on file for future reference.  \n\nEmployee participation is another component of the prevention program.  The written plan of action regarding the implementation of the employee participation is described in PSM, Section One.  Repauno involves its employees in the on-going development of PHA's.  All employees are allowed access to this information as well as other information required under the RMP rule.\n\nHot work permits are another component of the prevention program.  A sample of a hot work permit (flame permit) and procedures for issuing such a permit are found in the Repauno Safety How Manual, Section Eight.     \n\nIncident investigation is another component of the prevention program.  Repauno investigates each incident, which resulted in, or could reasonably have resulted in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  The procedure to conduct an incident investigation is found in the Repauno's Safety-How Manual, section 1J.\n\nOutside contracting is the last component of the prevention program.
