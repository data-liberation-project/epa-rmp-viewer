We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public as well as protection of the environment.  This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including:\n\n\n\n- A description of our facility and use of substances regulated by EPA's RMP regulation\n\n- An overview of our accidental release prevention programs\n\n- A five-year accident history for accidental releases of chemicals regulated by EPA's RMP rule\n\n- An overview of our emergency response program\n\n- An overview of planned improvements at the facility to help prevent accidental chemical releases from occurring and adversely affecting our employees, the public, and the environment\n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n\n\nOur facility produces mainly commodity organic chemicals using a variety of chemicals and processing operations.  The major products manufacured at the facility are acetic acid, vinyl acetate, ethylene oxide, ethylene glycol, methanol, and carbon monoxide.  In our processes, we use the following chemicals that EPA has identified as having the potential to cause significant offsite consequences in the event of a substantial accidental release:\n\n\n\nToxics\n\n\n\n-Ethylene oxide, produced at a rate of 700 million lb/yr, is used for the local production of ethylene glycol, with the remainder being sold in the merchant market.  The material is stored on site in pressurized and refrigerated spheres.\n\n-Vinyl Acetate, produced at a rate of 1250 million lbs/yr, is sold entirely in the merchant market where it is used in paints and adhesives.  The material is stored on site in inerted atmospheric tanks.\n\n-Ammonia is used onsite"

Ammonia is received via tank truck deliveries and is stored onsite in a storage tank with a capacity of approximately 61,000 lbs of ammonia when liquid full. \n\n\n\nFlammables\n\n\n\n-Acetaldehyde is a byproduct in the production of vinyl acetate.  It is recovered and shipped to another company location to be used as a raw material.  About 800,000 lbs are stored on site as a liquid in a pressurized sphere.\n\n-Propylene is used in a refrigeration system which cools part of the carbon monoxide production process. Propylene is received from Propylene pipeline supply and stored in three liquid vessels. The system contains a maximum of 18,000 lbs of propylene, if liquid full. The propylene is then used in a closed refrigeration system.\n\n-Methane and Synthesis Gas (Flammable Mixture) are a feedstock and intermediate, respectively, of the Methanol production unit. Methane is received from Natural Gas pipeline supply, and Synthesis Gas is created in the Methanol Reformer. Neither Methane nor Synthesis Gas are stored onsite, however both flammable chemicals exceed the RMP threshold quantity based on the capacity of the process unit's vessels, towers, and associated piping that would contain one of these chemicals.\n\n\n\nOur accidental release prevention programs and our contingency planning efforts help us effectively manage the hazards that are posed to our employees, the public, and the environment by our use of these chemicals.\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nOur facility complies with the OSHA Process Safety Management Rule, and has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  We take a systematic, proactive approach to preventing accidental releases of hazardous chemicals.  Our management systems address each of the key features of successful prevention programs includ"
