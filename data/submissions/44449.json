      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary for Cordova Energy Company Risk Management Plan\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nCordova Energy Company is strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  The commitment is demonstrated by an accidental release program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with processes at the facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent potential releases of regulated substances.\n\nThe Facility and Regulated Processes\nCordova Energy Company's primary activity is the generation of electric energy by combustion of natural gas.  Part of that activity involves the use of a system that provides aqueous ammonia for selective catalytic reduction (SCR) in the heat recovery steam generators.  The aqueous ammonia storage and forwarding system (the process) consists of a storage tank, two forwarding pumps, associated piping, valves, and instrumentation.  Atomized ammonia is sprayed on to the SCR section.  The flue gas entrains the ammonia and as the mixture passes through the SCR, it undergoes a reaction that reduces nitrogen oxides to meet environmental regulatory requirements.\n\nThe maximum inventory of aqueous ammonia in the process is 50,000 gallons (370,000 pounds).  In the storage tank, ammonia is concentrated at 29% in water.\n\nWe determined that there are no public receptors within the worst-case or alternative release scenarios and there is no history of releases of regulated substances.  Therefore, this process qualifies for Program Level 1.  The off site consesquence analysis performed as part of this re-submittal was completed using EPA's RMP*Comp(TM) software.  \n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nThe facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR Part 68 for Program Level 1 processes."

      "SummaryText": "The facility was designed and constructed in accordance with appropriate engineering and nationally recognized design standards.  The following sections describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nIn accordance with 40 CFR 68.48, Cordova Energy Company maintains detailed records of safety information that describes chemical hazards, operating parameters, and equipment designs associated with the regulated process.  Records include\n* material safety data sheets, \n* maximum intended inventory of equipment in which aqueous ammonia is stored, \n* safe upper and lower temperatures, pressures, flows and compositions,\n* equipment specifications, and\n* codes and standards used to design, build, and operate the process.\nThe process has been designed in compliance with recognized and generally accepted good engineering practices.   Safety information will be periodically reviewed to ensure that it is accurate.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nIn accordance with 40 CFR 68.50, Cordova Energy Company has conducted a review of the hazards associated with aqueous ammonia, so that controls can be implemented, as necessary.  The methodology used includes checklists and a planned 5-year review by qualified engineering personnel.  The review identifies\n* any hazards associated with the process and ammonia,\n* opportunities for equipment malfunctions or human errors that could result in an accidental release,\n* safeguards used or needed to control the hazards or prevent equipment malfunction or human error, and\n* steps used or needed to detect or monitor releases.\n\nAn initial hazard review was performed prior to process startup.  An additional hazard review was completed as part of this re-submittal.  The results of each review have been documented to ensure that any problems identified are resolved in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purpose of safely conducting activities within the process, Cordova Energy Company maintai"

These procedures address various modes of operation such as startup, normal operations, emergency shutdown, inspections and emergency operations.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the process.\n\nTraining\nIn accordance with 40 CFR 68.54, Cordova Energy Company has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating the process are competent in the operating procedures associated with the process.  The training program provides for refresher training at least every three years and more frequently, as needed.\n\nMaintenance\nIn accordance with 40 CFR 68.56, Cordova Energy Company carries out documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operation.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes ammonia forwarding pumps, storage tank, dilution air fans, heaters, ammonia detectors, associated piping and instrumentation.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner. \n\nManagement of Change\nWritten procedures are in place to manage changes in process chemicals, technology and procedures.  Reviews of maintenance procedures are performed routinely and documented in the operating record.  Process operators, maintenance personnel and other employees whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification.\n\nPre-Startup Reviews\nPre-startup safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice. These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suit"
