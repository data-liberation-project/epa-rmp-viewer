This includes the West Water Treatment Plant located at 300 South 49th Street and the\nEast Water Treatment Plant located at 111 South 1st Street.\n\n1.  Accidential Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policy - Water Staff is trained on safe\nchlorine operating and handling procedures.  Staff also performs monthly preventive maintenance and\nchecks on the chlorination, chlorine scrubber, and leak detection systems.  The Emergency Response Plan\nincludes procedures for notification of the Norfolk Fire Division, which activates the Local Emergency \nOperations Plan (LEOP) and notifies any potential neighbors.  Norfolk Fire Division is a member of the\nElkhorn Valley LEPC.\n\n2.  Regulated Substances - The East Water Treatment Plant uses chlorine as a disinfectant.  We have \none (1) one ton chlorine cylinder on at all times.  We could have another one (1) one ton cylinders on hand\nat any given time for a total of two (2) one ton cylinders on site.\n\n3.  A) Worst Case Scenario - A possible broken cylinder valve on a one ton chlorine cylinder will release\nchlorine gas.  Chlorine gas can travel a distance of 1.3 miles  If this type of leakage would occur, we\nwould activate the Emergency Response Team to protect the residents in the affected area.  Next step, \nwe would notify Chem Trec Response Team.\n\n    B) Alternative Release Scenario - A leaking lead gasket that seals an attached line onto the regulator\ncould possibly release a chlorine vapor cloud ata rate of 15 lbs. Per minute.  This cloud could travel a \ndistance of 0.10 miles.  The chlorine cylinders are stored inside a concrete building and are monitored \nby a chlorine gas detection system.  When the detection system detects 1.5 ppm of chlorine gas, the \nemergency chlorine scrubber system will become active.  If this type of scenario would occur trained\nstaff and emergency scrubber can migrate the off site con"

      "SummaryText": "sequences.\n\n4.  Five Year Accident History - We have not had any accidential releases in the last five years using\none ton chlorine cylinders.\n\n5.  Emergency Response Program - Our Emergency Response Program is to utilize an on-site chlorine\nscrubber which is activated when chlorine gas is detected.  The scrubber has the ability to consume\na one ton chlorine cylinder within 25 minutes.  Water Treatment Staff is also trained and ready to \nrespond to a chlorine leak.  In the event of a leak the Water Treatment Staff would activate the \nEmergency Plan, which includes procedures for notification of the Norfolk Fire Division.  Norfolk Fire\nDivision would activate the Local Emergency Operations Plan (LEOP) and notifies any affected \nneighbors.  Norfok Fire Division is also a member of the Elkhorn Valley LEPC, which assists with Chem\nTrec, and other agencies that initiates response from a HAZMAT Team.\n\n6.  Planned Changes To Improve Safety - We will keep up with the latest technology for safe chlorine\nuse ans update procedures as needed."
