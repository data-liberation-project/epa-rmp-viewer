This Risk Management Plan Executive Summary summarizes the efforts that this company has undertaken to establish a Risk Management Program in conjunction with the Process Safety Management program. \r\n\r\nAnhydrous ammonia is the only chemical used at the AES Hawaii, LLC facility that is above the RMP threshold amount. The onsite maximum storage quantity of the liquid anhydrous ammonia tank at the AES Hawaii, LLC plant is 109,000 pounds, which is above the 10,000 pound RMP applicability threshold. The AES Hawaii, LLC plant does not use any other chemicals or flammable materials in excess of threshold quantities covered by RMP requirements. A management system is in place at the facility to oversee implementation of the facility's Risk Management Program. This management system is considered one of the most important elements of this facility's Risk Management Program, as its goal is to ensure that lines of authority and responsibility are clearly defined, helping to ensure that all elements of the Risk Management Program are implemented. At the AES Hawaii, LLC Facility, the person who has the overall responsibility for the Risk Management Program is the environmental coordinator. The Process Safety Management program is managed by the Operations Team Leader.\r\n\r\nThe facility also participates in emergency response activities with the Campbell Local Emergency Action Network (CLEAN). CLEAN has developed an Emergency Management Plan that provides supplemental guidance and information to emergency response personnel, local residents, and business based on the\r\nspecific operations in and around Campbell Industrial Park"

      "SummaryText": "(CIP). The plan addresses emergency planning, public health and safety.\r\n\r\nThe AES Hawaii, LLC facility generates steam and electricity at 91-086 Kaomi Loop, Hawaii 96707. The Plant is located near Barber's Point, within the area known as Campbell Industrial Park, which is on the Island of Oahu about 30 miles west of Honolulu. Electricity generated by the facility is supplied to Hawaiian Electric Company, and steam is sold to the nearby Chevron USA oil refinery. The plant has two Circulating Fluid Bed (CFB) coal-fired boilers and one steam turbine. The CFB boilers use a clean coal technology that minimizes emissions of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides. The boilers use limestone that reacts with the sulfur in the coal to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions. The nitrogen oxides emissions are reduced by two factors: the relatively low boiler operating temperatures and the addition of anhydrous ammonia to the boiler flue gas that reacts with the nitrogen oxides to produce harmless nitrogen gas and water vapor.\r\n\r\nAmmonia safety considerations have been incorporated into the construction of the ammonia system. The ammonia tank is secured to the ground and has cathodic protection. The tank has relief valves at the top of the tank. Thus, overpressurization of the tank would primarily involve the venting of gas in the upper part of the tank. The vapor lines from the tank to the boiler area are buried to reduce potential releases from this piping. Loading and unloading valves, the tank and tanker truck are equipped with automatic shut-off valves in the event that flow through the valves exceeds design criteria. Therefore, in the event of a loading hose failure, the flow of ammonia would be automatically terminated. The facility also has a monitor located in the ammonia system process area that detects leaks and triggers an alarm.\r\n\r\nThis facility maintains a Prevention Program (in accordance with the Process Safety Management 29 CFR 1910) at the facility that minimizes the possib"

The prevention program incorporates a mechanical integrity program, regularly scheduled maintenance, daily visual operational checks of equipment, and employee training in proper operating procedures and emergency response.\r\n\r\nAES Hawaii, LLC has designed a Mechanical Integrity Program for ammonia in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.119(j). The purpose is to verify that critical process equipment is designed, installed, maintained properly, and operates correctly. In accordance with this program, the ammonia processes and equipment must be constructed, installed, and maintained in order to minimize the risk of releases of the highly hazardous chemicals. The mechanical integrity program at AES Hawaii, LLC includes identifying and categorizing equipment. Inspecting and testing of instrumentation and documenting maintenance procedures; training of maintenance personnel; establishing criteria for acceptable test results; documenting test and inspection results; and documenting manufacturer information for equipment and instrumentation.\r\n\r\nThe facility performs a system integrity check every five years for the ammonia storage tank and all associated hoses/lines. The most recent vessel inspection was completed in 2014. In addition, all emergency relief and excess flow valves, storage tank isolation valves, flexible connections, and hoses are scheduled for replacement in 2019. The equipment is maintained in accordance with manufacturer specifications, and applicable ANSI, and ASME engineering codes. A computer database generates work orders to identify when such maintenance needs to be implemented. Once, each 6-hour period, operators visually observe the equipment for signs of potential malfunction. Alarms and interlocks are checked on a monthly basis.\r\n\r\nAll new employees, regardless of position, are given a safety walk of all areas of AES Hawaii, LLC.

The HAZOP was performed by a team of technical experts in the system's process, engineering, design, operations maintenance, and safety. The ammonia system was divided into sections or segments and assigned a node number. Each node was evaluated for deviations using guide words such as no flow, high pressure, etc. The cause and consequence of a guide word applied to a node were evaluated to determine and identify deviations and/or hazards that can result"

      "SummaryText": "from application of a guide word to the node. Each identified consequence was assigned a relative risk rank based on the severity of the consequence and anticipated frequency. The team then discussed corrective actions which were recorded and implemented or are in the process of being implemented.\r\n\r\nAES Hawaii, LLC performs on-site Ammonia Release Scenario Drills at least once per year.  Response team members, who are qualified to respond to Anhydrous Ammonia releases, walk through a potential uncontrolled release scenario to determine potential gaps in emergency preparedness.  These gaps are then incorporated into future emergency preparedness training sessions.\r\n\r\nAES has implemented these various analyses and training programs to prevent and prepare for an emergency release. To date, this facility's Five-Year History (and entire history of the plant) includes only one accidental release from the ammonia system which resulted in an injury to an employee.  The release was quickly isolated and can be attributed to the inexperience of an operator trainee.  There have been no other accidental releases which resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage onsite, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in-place, property damage, or environmental damage.\r\n\r\nAES Hawaii, LLC is continually developing recommendations as a result of equipment inspections, safety audits, PHA Studies, incident investigations, safety meetings, review of industry experience, technology improvements, and employee suggestions. Once formulated, recommendations are reviewed, and corresponding action items are developed to implement each recommendation.  Communication of these action items or planned activities informs the public of measurable improvements for safety that are being incorporated at the AES Hawaii, LLC plant.\r\n\r\nAES Hawaii, LLC is also continuously improving safety through planned changes such as keeping AES PSM/RMP Plan current, completing 5-year PHA"
