As part of this commitment, the company has established a system to help ensure safe operation of the hazardous chemical processes at this facility. One component of this system is a Risk Management Program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at the facility and addresses compliance with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Regulation 40 CFR 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule). One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit a Risk Management Plan (RMPlan) describing the Risk Management Program at the Wauna Mill. This document is intended to satisfy the RMPlan requirements of the RMP Rule and to provide the public with a description of the Risk Management Program at the facility.\n\nThe Risk Management Program at the facility consists of three elements:\n\n1.\tA hazard assessment to help understand (a) the potential off site consequences of hypothetical accidental releases and (b) accidents that may have occurred during the last five years associated with the use of the substances regulated by the RMP rule - see topic 1.2\n\t\n2.\tA prevention program to help maintain and safely operate the processes containing more than the threshold quantity of the regulated substances (covered processes) -see topic 1.4\n\t\n3.\tAn emergency response program to help respond to accidental releases of the regulated substances from the covered processes - see topic 1.6\n\nInformation further describing these elements is provided in this RMPlan summary.\n\nAlthough the Risk Management Program at the facility helps provide assurance that the facility is maintained and operated in a safe manner, it is only one component of the safety program at The Wauna Mill.

This site was originally developed in 1909 for a lumber mill operation. The Wauna mill began its current business of producing pulp and paper in 1965.  The pulp and paper mill was originally built and operated by Crown Zellerbach Corporation.  In 1986, James River acquired Crown Zellerbach.  In 1997 the ownership of the facility changed to Fort James Operating Company when James River merged with Fort Howard.  The Wauna Mill is owned and operated by Georgia-Pacific Consumer Products LP as in November 2000, Georgia Pacific Corporation acquired all stock shares of Fort James, and in December 2005 Koch industries acquired all stock shares of Georgia-Pacific Corporation. \n\nThe Wauna mill is a fully integrated pulp and paper mill that uses the following general processes: The Mill produces a variety of paper products.  These products include towel and tissue products for retail stores and the commercial market, uncoated printing papers. The Wauna mill employs about 1,000 people from the local area. \n\nSawdust, wood chips, and purchased pulp are transported to the mill by barge or by truck. Sawdust and wood chips are stored in piles prior to processing.\n\nWauna uses the kraft process to convert wood into pulp.  The kraft process uses a sodium hydroxide and sodium sulfide solution under heat and pressure to dissolve the lignin component of wood. The dissolved lignin and spent pulping chemicals are separated from unbleached pulp by washers and sent to"

      "SummaryText": "chemical recovery. After washing, unbleached pulp goes through a multi-stage bleach plant. The bleaching process uses sodium hydroxide, oxygen, chlorine dioxide, and hydrogen peroxide to remove residual lignin from the pulp and whiten it to commercial brightness levels. The chlorine dioxide solution is produced on-site from sodium chlorate, sulfuric acid, methanol, and water.\n\nThere are five papermachines at the Wauna mill.  They all produce towel and tissue grades. \n\nBleached pulps derived from different wood species, as well as purchased pulp and secondary fiber recycled from waste paper are blended to produce a mixture tailor-made for each paper grade.  The rolls of paper from the towel and tissue papermachines are converted on-site into napkins, towels, bathroom tissue, or facial tissue.\n\nWastewaters from the mill are collected and pumped to an air activated biological treatment facility. The facility includes a primary clarifier, a stabilization basin, an aeration pond, and two secondary clarifiers. Primary and secondary sludges are dewatered together and burned, along with other wood wastes, in a state-of-the-art fluid bed boiler. The mill operates an on-site landfill for solid waste disposal. The treated wastewater is discharged into the Columbia River.\n\nMost processes operate 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, and 52 weeks a year.   Portions of the production equipment are shut down periodically for maintenance or cleaning.  The entire facility is generally shut down only once per year for maintenance.\n\n1.2.2\tSubstances and Processes Regulated Under RMP\n\nThe Wauna mill stores two chemicals above the threshold limits of 40 CFR 68.130.
