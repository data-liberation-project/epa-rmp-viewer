      "SummaryText": "Orange County Utilities (OCU) owns and operates the South Water Reclamation Facility (WRF), located at 4760 Sandlake Road in Orlando, Florida.\n\nLike the majority of municipal wastewater treatment plants in the United States, gaseous chlorine is used at the South WRF as a disinfectant to destroy pathogenic organisms in the treated water.  The popularity of chlorine as a wastewater disinfectant is mainly due to its effectiveness and ability to provide a low but measurable residual in the treated effluent.  \n\nOrange County's commitment at the South WRF is to store, handle and use these chemicals in a manner that achieves the needed benefits of disinfection while minimizing both onsite and offsite risks.  This is accomplished by designing a safe process, maintaining the process in optimum working condition, operating safely through documented procedures and extensive training, and providing an emergency response capability to minimize the consequences of a chlorine release, should a process accident ever occur. \n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nIt is Orange County's policy to adhere to all applicable Federal, State of Florida and local rules and regulations.  This specifically includes compliance with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) rules for chlorine and sulfur dioxide accidental release prevention and emergency response.\n\nThe primary measures for accidental chemical release prevention are contained in the document Process Safety Management/Risk Management Program for the South Water Reclamation Facility.  This process safety management (PSM) document was prepared in conformance with the OSHA and EPA risk management rules, as well as industry-specific guidelines and best management practices relevant to release prevention. South WRF's Section Manager has the responsibility for ensuring that this program is implemented in the workplace as written.\n\nThe South WRF emergency r"

      "SummaryText": "esponse plan relies on a team of offsite mutual-aid groups such as fire and rescue services.  The emergency response plans at South WRF are based on the Incident Command system, where onsite responders work in coordination with local hazardous materials response teams to implement the South WRF and regional response plans. \n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nChlorine is received by the facility by truck and is stored in one-ton chlorine cylinders fabricated to Department of Transportation (DOT) specifications.  Upon arrival at the site, all cylinders are thoroughly inspected and if there is any doubt about the integrity of the cylinder, it is promptly refused.  Once accepted, the chlorine cylinders are stored inside an enclosed building equipped with a chlorine detector that immediately notifies the operators of a release should a leak occur.  \n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Specific Prevention Steps\n\nOCU's PSM document contains 13 essential release prevention elements.  Some of the key accidental release prevention elements of the PSM program are as follows:  \n\n* Process hazard analysis: This analysis was performed for each step in the processes, to identify potential process failure scenarios and the appropriate prevention or response measures.  The process hazard analysis was reviewed for accuracy and revalidated in 2009.\n\n* Operating procedures review: The review was conducted to ensure that operators are given clear, written instructions for safely operating the chemical processes.\n\n* Training programs: Training is given to each employee assigned to the processes with continuing operator training thereafter, with an emphasis on safe chemical handling and emergency response. Training includes hazard awareness training on how to recognize a leak and initiate the Incident Command system.\n\n* Contractors:   OCU ensures through its contract provisions that contractors supplying or working with chemicals are held to a standard of "

      "SummaryText": "safety performance that complies with OCU's safety goals and objectives, and also meets relevant agency requirements.  For example, OCU personnel make visits to the supplier's site to ensure that rules and guidelines concerning chlorine and cylinder integrity are being followed.\n\n* Mechanical integrity: The integrity and reliability of the process is maintained by implementing preventive maintenance and routine inspection and testing procedures.\n\n* Management of Change: The management of change procedures provide a systematic approach to evaluate and control the safety and health aspects of any significant change to the process chemicals, technology, equipment and operating procedures.\n\n* Incident Investigation: OCU investigates within 48 hours any accidents or \"near misses\" that could have resulted in a chlorine release, in order to develop measures to prevent a recurrence.\n\nThe above elements are only part of OCU's aggressive safety program.  In addition to the 13 PSM elements, OCU has established related OSHA safety programs such as hot work and confined space.  These OSHA safety programs apply to both OCU and contractor employees. \n\nFive-year Accident History\n\nThere have no reportable accidents involving chlorine in the past five years.  \n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nThe emergency response plan covers all aspects of emergency response including escape procedures and routes, procedures for post-evacuation employee accounting, notification procedures, rescue and medical duties, and response procedures for spills or leaks.  If a major chemical leak were to occur, the emergency plan requires immediate notification of the regional hazardous materials response teams for assistance, including orderly evacuation or sheltering-in-place of the surrounding community.\n\nPlanned Improvements\n\nThe facility has recently undergone plant changes as part of its Phase IV expansion."
