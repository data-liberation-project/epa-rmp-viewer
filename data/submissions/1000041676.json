The most prominent of these include reducing exhaust emissions, improving fuel economy, prolonging oil-drain intervals, and extending equipment life.  The Facility has one regulated flammable substance (2-methylpropene, commonly referred to as isobutylene) and two regulated toxic substances (chlorine and carbon disulfide).  \r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention and Response Policies (68.155(a))\r\n\r\nThe Facility has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety.  The Facility invests in accident prevention, including, but not limited to, the Facility's training of its personnel and the Facility's commitment and consideration of safety in every phase of its operations- from the design to the installation, operation, and maintenance of its processes. The Facility has a Spill Prevention, Containment, and Countermeasure (SPCC) policy which addresses prevention of foreseeable releases of regulated substances as well as the circumstances that if an accidental release occurs, how its personnel will respond to, control and contain that release.    \r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps (68.155(c)) \r\n\r\n(A)\tChemical Specific Prevention Steps:\r\n\r\n(i)\tToxic Substance Scenarios:\r\n\r\nThe worst-case scenario for toxic release is a catastrophic failure of a 90-ton chlorine railcar, resulting in a release of 179,000 lbs. of chlorine gas over a 10-minute period.  Although we have numerous controls to prevent such releases and to manage their consequences, no credit for administrative controls or passive mitigation measures is taken into accou"

Because the plant is located in a populated area, the toxic cloud formed by such an event would reach off-site public receptors. \r\n\r\nAn alternative scenario for chlorine is a failure of the 2-in. diameter liquid charge line between the railcar and the vaporizer.  If this scenario were to occur, automatic sensors would detect chlorine and shut off flow from the railcar immediately, releasing only the contents of the line (approximately 38 lbs. of chlorine) to the atmosphere.  The toxic cloud formed by such an event would reach public receptors immediately adjacent to the facility boundary. \r\n\r\nAn alternative scenario for carbon disulfide is a failure of a 2-in. diameter liquid charge line from a storage tank to a reactor.  If this scenario were to occur, our operators would shut off the flow from the tank within a few minutes.   With the assumption that it requires approximately 1 hour to stop the spill, the results from our analysis should be larger than would actually be the case if this event were to occur.  The toxic cloud formed by such an event would reach nearby public receptors.\r\n\r\n(ii)\tFlammable Substance Scenarios:\r\n\r\nThe worst-case scenario for flammable release is a vapor cloud explosion involving a full railcar inventory of isobutylene.  The maximum railcar inventory of 160,000 lbs. is assumed to be released to the atmosphere, to completely vaporize, and to ignite, resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  Although we have numerous controls to prevent such releases and to manage their consequences, no credit for passive mitigation measures was taken into account in evaluating this scenario. The overpressure generated by the explosion would reach nearby off-site public receptors.  \r\n\r\nAn alternative scenario for isobutylene is a rupture of an unloading hose from a railcar containing isobutylene.  If this scenario were to occur, our operators would shut off the flow from the railcar within a few minutes.  For this scenario, ho"

The excessive thermal radiation generated by the pool fire would reach public receptors immediately adjacent to the facility boundary.\r\n\r\n(B)\tGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program Steps\r\n\r\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at the Facility.  Because processes at the plant that are regulated by the EPA risk management program (RMP) rule are also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) rule, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements that are part of the RMP prevention program and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\r\n\r\n(1)\tEmployee Participation\r\n\r\nThe Facility encourages employees to participate in all facets of PSM and accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team.  Employees have access to all information created as part of the facility accident prevention program.\r\n\r\n(2)\tProcess Safety Information\r\n\r\nThe Facility maintains a number of technical documents used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  Specific departments within the facility are responsible for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.\r\n\r\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in safety data sh"

This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  The Facility has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) in the operating procedures for each process, and ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g. automated shutdown systems).  \r\n\r\nThe Facility also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, etc. This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\r\n\r\n(3)\tProcess Hazard Analysis\r\n\r\nThe Facility has a comprehensive program to ensure that hazards associated with the each covered process are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\r\n\r\nThe Facility periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis (PHA) results at least once every 5 years until a process is no longer operating. Between formal PHA reviews, the Facility conducts \"Potential Problem Analyses\" (PPAs) when changes to the process warrant such an evaluation. This mechanism also ensures that the process controls and/or process hazards do not deviate significantly from the original design safety features.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.  \r\n\r\n(4)\tOperating Procedures\r\n\r\nT"

These written procedures are used for both reference and training materials.  These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.  \r\n\r\nIn addition, the operating procedures at the Facility provide guidance on how to respond in the event of an exceedence for process or equipment specific parameters.  This information is readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\r\n\r\n(5)\tEmployee Training\r\n\r\nThe Facility has implemented a comprehensive training program for any employees involved in operating a process.  After successfully completing initial training in the operations of the facility, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate adequate knowledge to perform the duties in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently. \r\n \r\nAll operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years.  Each employee's training is documented, including the verification that the employee understood the training.\r\n\r\n(6)\tContractors\r\n\r\nThe Facility uses contractors to supplement its work force.

The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and the equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready.  A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\r\n\r\n(8)\tSafety Reviews of Mechanical Integrity and Equipment\r\n\r\nThe Facility has well-established practices and procedures to maintain major process equipment and emergency response systems in a safe operating condition.  The basic aspects of this program include: (1) conducting training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting identified deficiencies, and (5) applying quality assurance measures.

The Facility incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs.\r\n\r\n(9)\tSafe Work Practices\r\n\r\nThe Facility has long-standing safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety, including (1) personnel entry control, (2) a lockout/tagout  and energy isolation procedure, (3) a procedure to safely remove hazardous materials before process piping or equipment is opened, (4) a permit and procedure to control spark-producing activities (i.e., hot work), and (5) a permit and procedure to ensure safe entry into a confined space. \r\n\r\n(10)\t Management of Change\r\n\r\nThe Facility has a comprehensive system to manage changes to processes.  This system requires that changes to the process that are not considered \"replacement in kind\" are reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage hazards and (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.  Affected process information and operating and maintenance procedures are updated accordingly, and training is provided, as needed.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the Facility has recently incorporated a formal review system for organizational and personnel changes.

The Facility conducts periodic emergency response exercises as well as monthly refresher training.   \r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety (68.155(f))\r\n\r\nAfton Chemical Corporation resolves all findings from PHAs, some of which may result in modifications to the process.\r\n\r\nThe following changes are planned:\r\n-  A project is under design and review to separate the thiadiazole process (carbon disulfide utilizing process) off-gas stream from the Unit 280 scrubber/flare system and route it through an alternate, dedicated system.  Specific design details are still pending.\r\n-  Facility building upgrades are under engineering review based on recommendations from a plant-wide facility siting review.  These upgrades are intended to improve the safety of occupied buildings in the event of a process fire or explosion event within the facility or surrounding industrial community.\r\n- The plant is in the process of implementing a \"critical safety function\" management program intended to ensure that interlocks, procedures, and other process controls that are designed to prevent or mitigate process hazards do not significantly deviate from design intent.  This program will incorporate periodic review and maintenance of the covered process controls and procedures, deemed \"critical\" for ensuring safe operation of the process.\r\n- As part of a larger corporate initiative, the Afton facility is implementing a people-based safety program designed to engage employees throughout the organization into safety efforts within the facility, and to create a positive safety culture.  \r\n\r\nIn the last 5 years Afton has reinstated a safety observation program, been reauthorized as members of OSHA's VPP program at STAR level, and upgraded fixed gas monitoring for chlorine and flammable gases in two of our covered processes.   Significant upgrades were performed on the plant fixed fire suppression equipment to improve effectiveness and reliability"
