The only substance inside the refrigeration system is ammonia. \r\n\r\nThe process causes the ammonia to boil into a gas and then cool into a liquid and then repeats the process. The refrigeration system lowers the liquid pressure to lower the boiling point and then evaporates the ammonia within the system using room air as the heat source. It then compresses the ammonia into a high pressure/temperature and cools the gas until it condenses. The condensed liquid is pumped to a low pressure part of the system where the pressure is lowered and the cycle starts all over. The ammonia changes state from a liquid to a gas and back to a liquid. It does not chemically change; it is not consumed and does not wear out. It continuously circulates throughout the system.\r\n\r\nThe process is the standard refrigeration cycle.

The refrigerated areas are cooled by an anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system.  Anhydrous ammonia, a substance regulated by EPA, is one of the most economical refrigerants available.  However, the properties of ammonia makes it necessary to observe certain safety precautions while operating the refrigeration system to prevent employee exposure, and to reduce the threat of exposure to nearby members of the community.\r\n\r\n\tThe HRSC Milk Plant chose to follow the EPA's Chemical Accident Prevention Rule, Program Level 3, to prevent a release of ammonia from the refrigeration system.  The Milk Plant ammonia refrigeration system of the Houston Retail Support Center (HRSC) of H.E. Butt Grocery Company (HEB) has a maximum intended inventory of 23,000 pounds in the  refrigeration systems.\r\n\r\n\tThe HRSC Milk Plant complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule, and applicable state codes and regulations to prevent a catastrophic release of ammonia.  The ammonia refrigeration system has been constructed according to the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration guidelines (IIAR).  The operators of the systems are required to complete a training and certification program to operate the ammonia refrigeration system.\r\n\r\n\tThe Accidental Release Prevention Program does not guarantee against an accidental release.  An offsite consequence analysis was completed using a computer model to simulate a release of the ammonia from the refrigeration system.  The worst case scenario considered the loss of 6,500  pounds of anhydrous ammonia in the refrigeration system over a 10 minute period.

There are residents and other public receptors (recreational areas and industrial/commercial buildings) located in the potentially affected area.  No administrative controls or mitigation measures were used to limit the chemical release distances for either scenario.\r\n\r\n\tThe HRSC Milk Plant has an established Emergency Action Plan to respond to emergencies.  The plan was developed in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.38 Emergency Action Plan.  The plan requires employees to exit the facility during a fire or ammonia release to a safe area.  The emergency agencies will be notified of the emergency.  The emergency agencies will notify any potentially affected neighbors.

Ammonia leak detection is installed in this area that sounds alarms and starts emergency ventilation. The emergency ventilation is automatically controlled and discharges the engine room air through the roof which creates a lower level of concentration in the engine room for responders. It also starts air dispersion at lower concentration levels and disperses the ammonia with greater air turbulence.\r\n\r\nSUMMARY OF HAZARD ASSESSMENT\r\nThis hazard assessment was conducted to meet the RMP Off-site Consequence Analysis requirements for the ammonia refrigeration system.

      "SummaryText": "parameters for the following release scenarios are based on the \"Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration\" as described in Chapter 4: Off-site Consequence Analysis.  The worst-case release scenario (OCA-1) used in this assessment identifies the low temperature recirculator (V-3) as the vessel with the potential to hold the largest quantity of ammonia. This is based on the system \r\ndesign that uses this vessel as a pump-down holding receiver. The worst-case release scenario is based on over-filling this vessel causing the released quantity to be 6,000 pounds with no piping volume included. The distance to toxic end point of 0.9 miles.\r\n\r\nThe alternative release scenario evaluated in this hazard assessment is the direct release of ammonia vapor from the largest pressure relief valve with a duration of 15 minutes. The quantity of the release is based on the rated capacity of the pressure relief valve (150 lbs/min) with a release duration of fifteen (15) minutes and travel distance of 0.1 mile.\r\n\r\nACCIDENT PREVENTION PROGRAM\r\nThis facility follows the OSHA Process Safety Management Program.

The location of the ammonia vessels is inside the engine room. Although there are doors and windows, the overall enclosure acts as a dike creating liquid pooling and limiting the liquid run-off. Ammonia leak detection is installed in this area that sounds alarms and starts emergency ventilation. The emergency ventilation is automatically controlled and discharges the engine room air through the roof which creates a lower level of concentration in the engine room for responders. It\r\nalso starts air dispersion at lower concentration levels and disperses the ammonia with greater air turbulence.\r\n\r\nSUMMARY OF HAZARD ASSESSMENT\r\nThis hazard assessment was conducted to meet the RMP Off-site Consequence Analysis requirements for the ammonia refrigeration system.

The condenser has connections with the compressor discharge line, thermosyphon pilot-receiver, and the condenser drain lines go to the high-pressure receiver.\r\nThis system incorporates an automatic gas purger for removing non-condensable gases from the ammonia system. The presence of non-condensable gases in the condenser penalizes the system performance through the artificial elevation of condensing pressure. The non-condensable gases add their partial pressures to the ammonia partial pressure against which the compressors must pump. The system has several purge point connections, typically at each of the condenser liquid outlet pipes. \r\nThe compressor discharge hot gas is used to defrost the evaporators. During the defrost cycle, the hot gas refrigerant gives up heat and condenses. With the fans shut down, the ability of the coil to transfer that heat to the air is severely limited. Thus, the heat from the hot gas is absorbed by metal in the coil. As the metal absorbs heat, its temperature rises. Once the surface temperature is high enough, any ice and/or frost on the coil surface will melt and drain off. Defrosting the evaporators occurs automatically on a time sequence by individual sequence timers.\r\nIn this facility, the evaporators are fed from liquid pumps.

The focus of the Management Program is on tracking, reporting, and documenting the operation and maintenance of the ammonia refrigeration system. Management is fully committed to the Risk Management Program and sees it as a vital and integrated part of general operations.  Management does provide the support and the resources to implement these procedures on an ongoing basis.\r\n\r\n2.2.\tAUDITS AND REVIEWS\r\nThe company's policy is to take federal regulations seriously, knowing that these regulations can protect life and property.  The Facilities Manager will review RMP compliance on an on-going basis.\r\nThe Facilities Manager conducts compliance audits every three years for the entire program. Annual updates will also be performed for elements of the RMP.\r\n\r\n3.0\tHAZARD ASSESSMENT\r\nAnhydrous ammonia is the toxic substance for which this hazard assessment is done. The LOC for ammonia is 200 ppm.  The urban OCA establishes Areas of Concern with a radius of 1.5 miles for the Worst-case Scenario and a radius of 0.1 miles for the Alternate Release Scenario. The affected populations are estimated at 23,745 people for the Worst-case Scenario and 0 people for the Alternate Release Scenario. There are no environmental receptors within the Areas of Concern that could possibly be affected.\r\n\r\n3.1.\tMITIGATION MEASURES\r\nAmmonia leak detection is installed in this area that soun"

The emergency ventilation is automatically controlled and discharges the engine room air and creates a lower level of concentration in the engine room for responders. It also starts air dispersion at lower concentration levels and disperses the ammonia with greater air turbulence.\r\n\r\n3.2  \tRELEASE SCENARIOS\t\t\t\t\t\r\n3.2.1.\tWorst Case Scenario\r\nThe worst-case release scenario used in this assessment identifies the +15'F Re-circulator as the pump-down vessel with the potential to hold the largest quantity of ammonia. This scenario looks at a full system ammonia release occurring from this vessel during a pump-down procedure when this vessel may contain all 28,700 pounds of ammonia held in this system. \r\nDuring normal operation, the inventory of ammonia is continuously circulated throughout the refrigeration system and this vessel would hold about 8,000 pounds of ammonia. The design of this vessel allows it to be used as a pump-down ammonia holding vessel during infrequent installation or maintenance procedures. The maximum intended holding capacity is eighty percent of total volume. It is only during this pump-down procedure when the greatest volume of liquid ammonia is present. \r\nThe size of this vessel is ninety-six inches in diameter with an overall length of twenty feet - zero inches (96\" X 20'-0\"). It has a total volume calculated to be 919.9 cubic feet with a potential 100% capacity of 37,405 pounds of liquid ammonia at a saturated condition of +15&#61616;F. \r\nThe maximum intended inventory of this system is 28,700 pounds of ammonia. The duration of the release used for calculations is ten minutes for a release rate of 2,870 pounds of ammonia per minute. RMP*Comp was used to determine the distance to the toxic endpoint.\r\n\r\n3.2.2.\tAlternate Release Scenario\r\nThe alternative release scenario is the direct release of ammonia vapor from a pressure relief valve. This scenario was chosen as the most probable source of an ammoni"

      "SummaryText": "a release that would have the potential of offsite consequences based on the number of relief valves and on the high summer operating pressures. The size of the release is based on the rated capacity of the pressure relief valve (90.5 lbs./min.) having a worst-case release-duration of ten minutes. RMP*Comp was used to determine the distance to the toxic endpoint. \r\nThis scenario is used for RMP Submit since it is the most probable occurrence although the duration is expected to be significantly shorter due to the refrigerating effect on reducing pressures. Some of the other alternate release scenarios considered included transfer hoses splitting or uncoupling, piping failures from flanges, joints, welds, valves, and valve seals, leaking drains or vents, vessel or pump releases due to cracks, seal failures or drain, bleed or plug failures, and shipping container mishandling and breakage leading to a spill.\r\n\r\n4.0  \tACCIDENT PREVENTION PROGRAM\r\nThis facility follows the EPA's 40CFR68 Risk Management Plan and OSHA's 29CFR1910.119 Process Safety Management Program.  The documentation requirements of these two programs have been consolidated in the documenting and record filing process. \r\n\r\nThe Accident Prevention Program documents and records are kept as identified in each element of the program. \r\n\r\nThe following identifies the practices and procedures for:\r\n \r\n\tProcess Safety Information\r\n\tProcess Hazard Analysis\r\n\tOperating Procedures\r\n\tTraining\r\n\tMechanical Integrity\r\n\tManagement of Change\r\n\tPre-Startup Review\r\n\tCompliance Audits\r\n\tIncident Investigations\r\n\tEmployee Participation\r\n\tHot Works\r\n        Contractors\r\n\r\n5.0\tEMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN\r\nThe Emergency Response Plan meets the following criteria: \r\n\r\n\u00bf\t29 CFR 1910.38 Employee Emergency Plan and Fire Protection Plan \r\n\u00bf\t29 CFR 1910.119 Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals\r\n\u00bf\t29 CFR 1910.120 (g) Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response \r\n\u00bf\t40 CFR Part 68 Risk Management Program with spe"
