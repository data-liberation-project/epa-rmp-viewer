If Steven Sanchez is not available Raul Cantu will perform the role of emergency coordinator, here after called the E.C.\n\nVisitors\nvisitors at the facility, unless they're only in the office area, must be logged in and out on the Visitors Log.  This includes any salespeople, inspectors, guided tours, any non-routine visitors who may be inside the facility, and therfore may need assistance in an emergency.  Their presence must be known before assistance can be rendered.  The Visitors Log provides that information.\n\nPractice & Drills\nEach year the EC will select an appropriate time (preferably just before the busiest season) to create a simulated emergency, exercise this Plan, and assure its workability.  If any shortcoming is found in either the Plan or its execution, the necessary amendments will be made at that time.  Any changes must be noted according to the instructions below, under the heading \"Amending the Plan.\"\n\nThe EC will invite the local fire department Hidalgo County Emergency Coordinator and sheriff, and other potential support elements in the area to participate in this rehearsal.  There is no chance of being too well trained or coordinated.  Invite a representative of all outside participants to read and initial the Plan.\n\nDeclaring an Emergency\nThe first person to arrive at the scene must react calmly and appropriately to the nature of the situation. If there are lives in danger and the situation is worsening, the lives in your hands are first priority.  If a life can be saved without sacrificing your own and you have the resources, do it.  If you don't think you can save the life with your own resources, get out and get help as quickly as possible.\n\nIn the case of a chemical spill/release the EC will call the National Response Center at 1-800-424-8802 and the EPA at 1-312-353-2000.  A judgement call must then be made: if the situation is servere, call the Emergency Response Team/Fire De"
