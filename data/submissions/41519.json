The Emergency Action Plan (Plan) is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of the PSM/RMP document, which is maintained at the facility and updated as necessary.  This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n  1.)  To save lives.\n  2.)  To minimize and avoid injuries.\n  3.)  To protect the environment.\n  4.)  To minimize property damage.\n\nThe Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, chlorine health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year.  This Plan was reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations, as well as to incorporate facility changes.\n\nPWP has coordinated emergency response efforts with the local fire department, Pasadena Fire Department.  In the case of a chlorine-related emergency, it is the policy of PWP to evacuate the employees and to allow the fire department to respond to the emergency (potentially with the assistance of trained facility personnel).  PWP also plans to contract a private company to be available for chlorine emergency response situations.\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nThe City of Pasadena Water & Power Department City Yards facility is located at 311 W. Mountain Street, California  91103.  The facility is located just east of the Interstate 210 freeway at Mountain Street.  The area surrounding the facility is primarily light commercial and residential.  The City Yards serves primarily as a storage location for the Pasadena Water & Power Department.  Other departments located at the facility include General Services, Public Works, and Solid Waste.  The facility is surrounded by a chain link fence with primary acces"

Visitors are required to sign in with the guard prior to gaining entry.\n\nChlorine is stored as a liquefied compressed gas in typical 150 pound cylinders at the City Yards.  A maximum of fifty (50) 150-pound cylinders may be stored at the facility at any one time for a total of 7,500 pounds. \n\nThese cylinders are stored on a raised, covered concrete island in a metal three-sided corral which allows for the cylinders to be chained in place.  The corral is divided into used and full cylinder areas.  Vendor deliveries are made to the full cylinder area and these cylinders are transported by PWP operators as needed to remote chlorination stations.  Used (empty) chlorine cylinders from these facilities are then returned to the used section of the corral and are picked up by the chlorine cylinder vendor during deliveries.  All cylinders are stored with a secure threaded cap in place over the cylinder valve.\n\nChlorine is only stored at the City Yards facility.  There is no chlorine process piping or equipment at the facility.\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe storage of chlorine cylinders at the PWP City Yards is governed by many safety features.  Much of the safety of the process is inherent in the policies and procedures that govern the operation of the process.  For example, the PWP City Yards operates in accordance with OSHA's Process Safety Management regulation and the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program.  The chlorine cylinders are checked by operators on a daily basis.  Cylinders with any notable defect are immediately returned to the vendor.\n\nThe stored chlorine cylinders would not be affected by a power outage in any way.  There is not a history of failure of chlorine cylinders.  Every chlorine cylinder has a fusible plug that will melt at high temperatures to protect the vessel?s integrity.  To ensure chlorine is not released due to a fusible"

This includes common practices recommended by the Chlorine Institute.\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nIn the previous five years (since December 1999), there have been no chlorine accidents at the facility.  No injuries have occurred related to the storage of chlorine cylinders.\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nPWP has an emergency action plan in effect.  In case of chlorine leak, employees at the City Yards facility are to evacuate the immediate area and contact the Water Operations department.  If needed, an evacuation will be called for using the building?s PA system.  If an evacuation is called, employees are to proceed to the upper parking lot, which is at a higher elevation than the chlorine storage area.  Managers will observe the wind direction to ensure that the primary assembly area is a safe place to meet.\n\nThe Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, chlorine health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan was reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations, as well as to incorporate facility changes due to personnel turnover.\n\nPWP has coordinated emergency response efforts with the local fire department, Pasadena Fire Department.  In the case of a chlorine-related emergency, it is the policy of PWP to evacuate the employees via the Public Address system and to allow the fire department to respond to the emergency (potentially with the assistance of trained facility personnel).\n\nThe facility is also part of a city-wide emergency protocol called the Emergency Operations Center, or EOC.

A Compliance Audit has been completed regarding the implementation of the RMP and PSM programs and a PHA Revalidation was completed in November 2004 that generated recommendations to improve safety at the facility.  These include improving hazard communication practices, enhancing water operations training procedures, and further developing emergency action policies.\n\nPWP is proceeding with the few remaining mitigation measures associated with these studies."
