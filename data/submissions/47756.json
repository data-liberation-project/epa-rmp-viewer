As a result of this divesture, ownership and operational control of several manufacturing units (acetate esters, butanol, propanol, utilities, SFA and POX) was transferred from Celanese to OXEA.  Celanese will remain the owner and operator of two units (Vinyl Acetate and Shipping Services) at the Bay City Plant.  As a result, Celanese and OXEA will be co-located facilities and have established contractual terms and conditions to ensure all critical safety and emergency response functions are maintained within the Bay City Complex (Complex).\n\nThe attached provides an update for the Celanese \u00bf Bay City Plant Executive Summary and RMP.   \n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE  POLICIES\n\nCelanese is committed to operating and maintaining all processes within the Complex in a safe and responsible manner.  A combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs is used to help ensure employee and public safety as well as protection of the environment.  This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that have been designed and implemented, including:\n\n\u00ad\tA description of our facility and use of substances regulated by EPA's RMP regulation\n\u00ad\tAn overview of accidental release prevention programs\n\u00ad\tA five-year accident history for accidental releases of chemicals regulated by EPA's RMP rule\n\u00ad\tAn overview of the emergency response program\n\u00ad\tAn overview of planned improvements at the facility to help prevent accidental chemical releases from occurring and adversely affecting employees, the public, and the environment \n\nTHE STATIONARY SOURCE AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe Complex is situated in a rural area of Matagorda County several miles away from any residences.

The following chemicals used in the process have been identified by the EPA as having the potential to cause significant off-site consequences in the event of a substantial accidental release:\n \nToxics:\n\nVinyl acetate monomer is a major product.  It is produced in the Vinyl Acetate manufacturing process unit and is used largely in the manufacturing of adhesives and paints.  These materials are subsequently used for safety glass for automobiles, in floorings and rigid PVC pipe.  Approximately, 4,000,000 pounds are stored on-site in  nitrogen inerted atmospheric storage tanks. \n \nFlammables:\n\nAcetaldehyde is an impurity in the production of vinyl acetate.  It is separated and sold in the merchant market.  Approximately 400,000 pounds of acetaldehyde is stored on-site as a liquid in pressurized spheres.  The standard operating procedure limits the inventory in the spheres to less than or equal to 50%. \n\nThe accidental release prevention programs and contingency planning efforts help effectively manage the hazards that are posed to employees, the public, and the environment through the use of these chemicals.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND THE CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe following chemical-specific steps are taken to prevent accidental releases:\n\nPrevention Steps for Vinyl acetate Include:\n\n\u00bf\tUse of nitrogen blanketing in storage tanks to avoid flammability\n\u00bf\tUse  polymerization inhibit in order to limit polymerization within the system\n\u00bf\tBulk storage is located away from processing areas in tank farm areas with secondary containment sufficient to handle spills.\n\u00bf\tRemote activated firewater monitors and emergency response equipment is readily available\n\nPrevention Steps for Acetaldehyde Include:\n\n\u00bf\tUse  deluge water spray around the acetaldehyde spheres for fire protection\n\u00bf\tSphes have remote isolation capabilities.\n\nThese individual element"

Celanese and its employees are committed to the standard that these management systems set, and have specific accountabilities and controls to ensure that the requirements of the law and our own internal standards for accident prevention are met.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nRecords are kept for all significant accidental chemical releases that occur.  During the past five years, there has not been a release involving materials covered under EPA's RMP rule that resulted in deaths, injuries, significant property damage on-site,  off-site injuries, evacuations, shelter-in-place, property damage or environmental damage.   \n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN\nThe Celanese and OXEA Emergency Plan (Plan) provides procedures and guidelines for an orderly and safe response to emergency situations. The Plan includes responses for protection of employees, the environment, community and equipment resulting from hazardous releases of chemicals, including vinyl acetate and acetaldehyde.  Essential planning and training needed to insure protection of workers, the public and the environment during emergency situations are fundamental to the Plan.  The Plan includes instructions for notifying the Local Emergency Planning Commission (LEPC) immediately when appropriate.  There are also emergency drills conducted by the site along with community first responders, sheriff's department and hospital.\n\nA Community Alert Network (CAN) computer phone system is in place which will notify residents about a release that could impact them, provide vital information on the event, and explain precautionary measures the residences should take. \n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nA PHA revalidation is scheduled to occur in 2007 that will provide a thorough evaluation of the Vinyl Acetate manufacturing process unit and may generate recommendations for improvement.
