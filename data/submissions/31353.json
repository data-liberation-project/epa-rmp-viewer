The DuPont Co. - Corpus Christi Plant adheres to Corporate policies, which could be summarized as follows:\n                            - All Safety and Environmental Incidents Are Preventable\n                            - The Goal Is Zero - Zero Incidents, Period\n                            - All Employees and Contractors Are Responsible For Their Safety\nThe Corporate policies are embodied in the numerous site safety and engineering procedures and guidelines.  At the DuPont Co. - Corpus Christi Plant, the policies are implemented through the Process Safety and Risk Management Procedures Manual and the Emergency Response Procedures Manual.  These manuals are available to all site employees electronically and with annual computer based training.\nFACILITY DESCRIPTION\nThe DuPont Co. - Corpus Christi Plant consists of approximately 980 acres, located in a rural setting along Highway 361 between the cities of Ingleside and Gregory.  About 266 acres of the property is industrialized while the remaining 714 acres is used for agricultural purposes.  The industrialized area consists of a single manufacturing complex that produces ozone friendly hydrofluorocarbon refrigerant, HFC-134a,  and aerosol propellant, HFC-152a.  In the production of these products, the following RMP regulated substances are used as raw materials or intermediates or products.\n                              - Hydrogen Chloride, anhydrous               - Hydrogen Fluoride, anhydrous\n                              - Difluoroethane (HFC-152a)\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PR"

The accident prevention programs in place are in compliance wih the OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) rule and the EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP) rule.  For our efforts in safety excellence, the DuPont Co. - Corpus Christi Plant is recognized by the OSHA Voluntary Protection Program as a \"STAR Work Site\" since 1984.\n* Our accident prevention and safety programs can be summarized into these elements.  \"Designing for Safety\" includes a documented process technology system covering the hazards of materials, equipment design basis, and process design basis.  It includes an strategically located extensive accident prevention and mitigation system.  It includes the requirement to choose materials of construction to provide mechanical integrity.  It incorporates extensive safety instrumentation such as alarms, interlocks, and gas detectors.  Transportation vehicles are designed for safe handling.  \"Maintaining Our Plant\" includes identifying all process safety critical equipment and perfoming routine inspections to ensure proper operation and mechanical integrity.  High housekeeping standards contribute to safe operation practices.  Equipment specifications meet or exceed acceptable engineering standards.  A work order and permit system is used to control maintenance on the systems.  Maintenance personnel are trained, qualified, and experienced in preventative and predictive maintenance.  \"Operating Safely\" includes the requirement for operators and mechanics to follow approved procedures.  The process is continually monitored by computer control systems and operators.  Railcar transfers are under continuous surveillance by trained personnel.  And, even the subtlest changes are properly designed and completely documented.  \"Auditing Our Operations\" inlcudes the requirement for routine area safety audits.

These individual elements of our prevention program work together to prevent accidental chemical releases.  Our company and our employees are committed to the standard that these management systems set for the way we do business, and we have specific accountabilities and controls to ensure that we are meeting our own high standards of accident prevention.\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nWe keep records for all accidental chemical releases that occur at our facility.  It is our philosophy and practice that all accidental releases, regardless of size and significance, are tracked to identify and correct the key cause of the event.  The DuPont Co. - Corpus Chrisit Plant has an excellent safety record and accidental release prevention history.   There has been one accidental release of a RMP regulated substances in the past 5 years.  The accidental release caused several employees of a neighboring industrial facility to shelter-in-place.  There have been no recordable injuries related to RMP chemicals during this past 5 year submission period.\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\nOur program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting the workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.  The program can be summarized as follows:  In order that plant personnel are prepared, an emergency response plan is in place and updated regularly and all employees are trained for their role in the emergency response plan.  Since site operates on a 24 hour basis, the operations personnel comprise the on-site emergency response team.  The emergency response team is led by the shift team leader who acts as the incident commander and emergency response contact.  There are four shift team leaders and any one of them is available at any given time to direct emergency response.  The plant participates in emergency drills, both on-site an"

We coordinate our plan with the San Patricio County emergency response plan.  If a major release occurs, the emergency alarm is sounded and the site's emergency control center is activated.  The site incident commander and emergency response team responds.  Community emergency responders are notified as appropriate and mutual aid agreements are exercised when necessary.  Incident investigations and corrective actions are identified and implemented.\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\nThe following is a list of improvements that we are planning to implement at the facility to help prevent and/or better respond to accidental chemical releases:\n* Enhance the site's process hazard analysis procedure to include guidance for conducting risk reduction analyses which will facilitate consistent risk reduction decisions among PHA teams.\n* Expand the site's incident communication practice to include other incidents. Those events or situations that can lead to an incident or \"near miss\" so key learnings are broadly shared and recurring events are eliminated.\n* Improve community emergency planning and preparedness by actively supporting and leading the increased involvement and education of responders from neighboring counties and municipalities in the local emergency planning committee.\n* Enhance the list of leading safety indicators for on-going analysis to improve the process safety management program.\n* Implement the natural work team concept in the operating areas and seek opportunities for improved safety.\n* Continued focus on \"The Goal is Zero\" for injuries and incidents.\n* Continued reinforcement of \"Operational Discipline\" for all site employees, including contractors."
