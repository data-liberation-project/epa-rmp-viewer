These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters, specific chemicals inventories and equipment design basis/configuration information.  Chemical specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/ exposure treatment considerations is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDS).\r\n\r\nEnterprise also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure ratings, temperature ratings and electrical rating of equipment.  \r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\r\n\r\nEnterprise primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) and Checklist method analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  The analyses are conducted using a team of Enterprise staff which has operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes recommendations for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\r\n\r\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to local and corporate management for resolution.  Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.  \r\n\r\nAs part of Enterprise Process Hazard Analysis program, the plant will periodically update and revalidate the hazard analysis results.  \r\n\r\nOperating Procedures\r\n\r\nThe Morgan's Point Complex maintains written procedures"

These procedures provide guidance for experienced operators and also provide the basis for training new operators.  Operating procedures include applicable safety precautions that must be taken in the operation of the facility.  The procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.  The review and certification process involves both operators and technical staff.\r\n\r\nTraining\r\n\r\nIn addition to training on operating procedures, the Morgan's Point Complex has a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating the process.

Operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on any changes as part of the change management process.\r\n\r\nIncident Investigation\r\n\r\nThe Morgan's Point Complex promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury.  The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendation(s) to prevent a reoccurrence and forwards these results to the business management team for resolution.\r\n\r\nCompliance Audits\r\n\r\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, Enterprise periodically conducts an audit of the program to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented.  Compliance audits are conducted at least every three years.  Both hourly and staff personnel participate as audit team members.  The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to operations or facility management for resolution.  The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are retained.\r\n\r\nChemical Specific Prevention Steps\r\n\r\nThe processes at the Morgan's Point Complex have hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation.  The following is a description of existing safety features applicable to prevention of accidental releases of regulated substances in the facility.\r\n\r\nUniversal Prevention Activities\r\n\r\nThe accident prevention program summarized previously is applied to all RMP covered processes at the Morgan's Point Complex.  Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human errors.\r\n\r\nSpecialized Safety Fe"

      "SummaryText": "s Point Complex is coordinated with the Harris County - LaPorte Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  This coordination includes periodic meetings of the committee, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials and industry representatives.  The Morgan's Point Complex has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., fire department).  This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.  In addition to periodic LEPC meetings, the Morgan's Point Complex conducts periodic emergency drills that involve the LEPC and emergency response organizations, and also provides periodic refresher training to local emergency responders regarding the hazards of regulated substances in the plant.  The facility is also a member of the Channel Industries Mutual Aid (CIMA) cooperative industry emergency response organization to provide for a potentially large number of emergency responders, if needed.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\r\n\r\nThe Morgan's Point Complex resolves all findings from PHAs, some of which result in modifications to the process.  Other recommendations for possible changes to improve safety come from periodic accident prevention program audits, incident investigations, or employee suggestions and recommendations.  The following changes are planned for implementation at the Morgan's Point Complex.  \r\n\r\n* Enterprise is currently in the process of reviewing and revising the entire safety management / accident prevention program to ensure that the program can be fully administered across the diverse nature of the facilities owned or operated by the company.  ."
