      "SummaryText": "Sturtevant Regional Distribution Center\n\n\n\nA Risk Management Plan has been implemented at the Sturtevant facility for the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous materials. The facility is located at 2600 Enterprise Drive, Sturtevant, Racine County, Wisconsin. The facility is a storage and distribution warehouse that houses consumer products, packaged in aerosol cans, manufactured by SC Johnson & Son (SC Johnson). SC Johnson is a privately held, family-managed company, with worldwide headquarters located in Racine, Wisconsin. \n\n                                                                                                                                                                          \n\nLiquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) propellant used in aerosol products contains several components that are classified as flammable materials under EPA's RMP regulations. Specifically, the propellants consist of propane, butane and isobutane blends. In addition, isopentane, contained in aerosol shave gel product formulas, is also present in quantities above the RMP reporting threshold. The maximum projected quantities (cases) of aerosol products stored in the warehouse and product propellant and isopentane weights were used to estimate maximum quantities of RMP-regulated chemicals in the warehouse storage process. \n\n\n\nThe worst case scenario performed, based on EPA's Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance, indicates that the distance to the 1 psi overpressure endpoint will not extend beyond the warehouse property. No offsite receptors are impacted. There have also been no prior accidents at the facility resulting in any offsite environmental impacts.\n\n\n\nEmergency response activities at the facility are coordinated with the South Shore Fire Department.\n\n\n\nThe maximum number of pallets storing flammable mixture-containing products is consistent with that which had historically been reported, which was based on the best information available at the time it was prepared.

      "SummaryText": "historic information was reviewed and conservatively refined as follows:\n\n\n\n1. The number of pallets of aerosol products remained the same at 12,600 pallets; however, the relative distribution for use with Level 1 vs. Level 2/3 aerosols was refined, as discussed below.\n\n2. The number of cases per pallet was increased from 110 to 205 cases per pallet, as a worst-case; however, the actual number of cases per pallet generally varies by product depending on packaging & transportations requirements.\n\n3. The number of cans per case (i.e., 12 cans/case) remained the same.\n\n4. The worst-case amount of propellant per can was increased from 0.33 lb/can to 0.73 lb/can for Level 1 aerosols (as Raid Max Flying Insect Killer) and 0.74 lb/can for Level 2/3 aerosols (as Raid Max Concentrated Deep Reach Fogger).\n\n5. The worst-case release has been increased from one can to a full-case of 12-cans.\n\n6. For continuity with the original reporting approach, the flammable mixture mass reported in Sec. 1.17.c (22,818,369 lbs) is the total of the reportable flammable chemicals, while the total mass of the entire mixture is calculated at 26,379,008 lbs.\n\n\n\nThe fourth item is expected to result in a more refined approximation of the worst-case amount of flammable mixture in individual containers for use in calculating the worst case release scenario, given it is realistic to expect that when the above-noted Raid products are present onsite, there will be at least one case that may contribute to release.  For continuity, this refinement was then conservatively extrapolated to estimate the maximum aggregate amount of flammable mixture that may be present onsite for the purpose of assessing applicability relative to whether the 10,000 lb TQ is exceeded.  To this end, we estimated that 5,330 pallets of Level 1 aerosols would all be as Raid Max Flying Insect Killer, and that 7,270 pallets of Level 2/3 aerosols would all be as Raid Max Concentrated Deep Reach Fogger.  While such is expected to prov"

      "SummaryText": "ide a conservative worst-case aggregate amount for applicability assessment purposes, such is not reasonable to expect in practice because at any given time, there will be more than one type of Level 1 aerosol product, and more than one type of Level 2/3 aerosol product onsite - each with varying amounts of flammable mixtures (expected to be less than or equal to that which is noted under Item 4, above).  The \n\nrelative mix of products at any given time depends on numerous variables (e.g., market demand, distribution needs).  Regardless of the actual mix of products, the TQ is expected to be triggered - whether using the historic estimate or the conservatively refined 2021 estimate.  In practice, the estimate maintained prior to the 2021 submittal may provide a more realistic approximation of a maximum aggregate amount of flammable mixture that may reasonably be expected at any given time the variability in the relative amounts of products and the flammable mixture content thereof.\n\n\n\nIn so far as isopentane-containing Shave Gel products are considered, based on the best information available as of September 2021, the following refinements were made:\n\n\n\n1. The maximum number of pallets of such Level 1 aerosol products is refined to be 810 pallets, as a potential subset of the total pallets of Level 1 products discussed above.\n\n2. The maximum number of cases per pallet remains at 180 cases per pallet.\n\n3. The number of cans per case (i.e., 12 cans/case) remained the same.\n\n4. The maximum isopentane per can has been refined to 5.524 grams/can. \n\n\n\nAs a result of these refinements, the calculated maximum amount of isopentane onsite is more accurately expected to be approximately 21,309 lbs; rather than the historically estimated 33,000 lbs.
