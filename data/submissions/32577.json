The principles are as follows:\n\n-Conserve energy and natural resources through their wise use and reuse.\n-Strive to eliminate pollution at its source.\n-Focus on the recycle or sale of every scrap of non-hazardous waste.\n-Minimize the generation of hazardous waste.\n-Dispose of remaining waste safely and responsibly.\n-Enhance the land and air through careful land planning and the planting of trees and other flora.\n-Design, operate and inspect our faciities to protect the health and safety of associates and the public.\n-Make health, safety and the environment a priority in developing new products and processes.\n-Recognize and respond on a timely basis to associates and community concerns regarding our products and operations.\n-Participate with government and regulatory agencies in the development of responsible environmental laws and regulations.\n-Anticipate prudently and comply with all applicable environmental laws and regulations.\n-Periodically audit and assess compliance with these policies and submit our findings to the Board of Directors.\n\nThe Kohler Company - Searcy, Arkansas facility manufactures stainless steel sinks.  These sinks are annealed in a nitrogen and hydrogen atmosphere.  Anhydrous ammonia is stored in one (1) 10,000-gallon storage tank.  The anhydrous ammonia is piped from the storage tank to dissociators to generate nitrogen and hydrogen for use in the annealing oven.  \n\nThe worst case scenario is the accidental release of all ammonia stored in the storage tank.  This scenario is highly unlikely.  While still unlikely, a more plausible alternative scenario would be a brief two-minute release of ammonia from the safety relief valve on the storage tank.  Both the worst case and the alternative release scenarios have off site consequences.\n\nThe storage tank was"

      "SummaryText": "installed in 1967.  There are 3 dissociators at the facility, 2 natural gas dissociators installed in 1999 and 2004, and 1 electric dissociator installed in 1993.  Inherent to the design of the storage tank and dissociators are safety valves, pressure and temperature controls, and other devices that minimize the possibility of a release.  The ammonia storage tank is equipped with safety relief valves to prevent excessive pressures in the tank.  This reduces the potential for atmospheric failure of the tank.  The ammonia tank, piping and dissociators are regulary inspected and maintained.  Since ammonia has a very strong odor, all leaks would be detected even if the released volume were very small.\n\nThere has not been any anhydrous ammonia accidents in the past 5 years at this facility.\n\nThe emergecy response for this plant has been coordinated with local emergency response professionals (White County Local Emergency Planning Commission, and the City of Searcy Fire Department).  In addition, affected employees are trained on the safe working practices for anhydrous ammonia, and all facility personnel are trained on evacuation procedures in the event of an emergency.  All changes to improve safety have been implemented."
