To assist with ongoing compliance, a \"Chemical Accident Prevention Compliance Manual\" has been prepared.  An Operations and Maintenance Manual prepared by Domingue-Szabo & Associates will be kept on site.  Concerning the emergency response policy at the facility, the owner has made the decision that employees will not respond to accidental releases of regulated substances and will instead evacuate.  This facility is a waste water treatment plant.  Treatment includes chlorination of the wastewater with chlorine and dechlorination via the addition of sulfur dioxide.  The process basically involves continuous mixing of chlorine with the wastewater whereby the final mixture contains less than 1 % chlorine by weight.  This mixture is then routed to a contact chamber and sulfur dioxide is added whereby the final mixture is less than 1 % by weight of sulfur dioxide.  The treated wastewater is then released.  The storage cylinder and mixing equipment are subject to the RMP requirements since it contains threshold quantities of regulated substances.  \n\n\n\nThis facility has two applicable worst case release scenarios.  Scenario # 1 involves the release of all substance contained in the single largest chlorine cylinder when full.  Scenario # 2 involves the release of all substance contained in the single largest sulfur dioxide cylinder when full. Scenario #1 yields a distance to the endpoint of 3.0 miles and scenario #2 yields a distance to the endpoint which is 3.1 miles.  Section 3.1 of this RMP shows the calculations used for each scenario.\n\n\n\nThis facility has two alternative release scenarios.  Scenario # 1 involves a puncture of the largest diameter chlorine cylinder when full.  Scenario # 2 involves a puncture of the largest diameter sulfur dioxide cylinder when full.  Both scenarios yield"

Section 3.2 of this RMP shows the calculations used for each scenario.\n\n\n\nThe worst-case release scenarios use the maximum capacity of the single largest vessel without administrative controls or mitigation measures to limit the volume or reduce the distance to the endpoint. Since this facility is a Program 2, a documented prevention program is required.  This program is discussed in a \"Chemical Accident Prevention Compliance Manual\" along with a Operations and Maintenance Manual prepared for the facility.  The prevention program does discuss chlorine which is the specific chemical contained in an amount above the threshold quantity.As documented in Section 4.0 of this RMP, the facility has not experienced a release as defined in the regulation within the past five years.  Since this facility is a Program 2, a written emergency response program is required.  This program is contained in Section 5.0 of the \"Chemical Accident Prevention Compliance Manual\" prepared for the facility.  Further, emergency response procedures have been developed and are contained at the front of this RMP and these procedures will be implemented in the event of an accidental release or the threat of such a release.  Basically, the instructions are to evacuate the facility and then notify the proper authorities. At present time, there are no planned changes to improve safety."
