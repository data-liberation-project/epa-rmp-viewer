Both have regulations addressing chlorine gas in quantities greater than 1500 pounds.\r\n\r\nThe City of Fort Dodge is an operator of a stationary source subject to the Risk Management Program Rule. For this reason, we are submitting this Risk Management Program to include all information required in 68.115 through 68.185 for all covered processes. As determined by 68.115, the presence of chlorine is above the threshold level for a regulated substance.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThe primary activity at the John W. Pray Water Treatment Plant is to treat and distribute drinking water to the residences and businesses in Fort Dodge, Iowa.  It is imperative that a disinfection process be administered to maintain quality drinking water. This is accomplished through the use of chlorine gas. \r\n\r\nSource Identification:  John W. Pray Water Treatment Plant\r\n\t\t\t       600 Phinney Park Drive\r\n\t\t\t       Fort Dodge, Iowa  50501\r\n\r\nLatitude:        42.507970\r\nLongitude:   -94.203915\r\n\r\nOwner/Operator:\tCity of Fort Dodge\r\n\t\t\t819 1st Avenue South\r\n\t\t\tFort Dodge, Iowa  50501\r\n\r\nPerson Responsible:\tJohn Horrell\r\nWater Plant Superintendent\r\n515/576-6101\r\n515/573-7353  24 hr. phone number\r\n\r\nEmergency Contact: \r\n\r\nName:  John Horrell\r\nTitle:     Water Plant Superintendent\r\nPhone:  515/573-7353\r\n24 Hour Phone:  515/573-7353\r\n\r\nChemical Name: \tHazardous Chemical: Chlorine\r\n\t\tCAS Number: 7782-50-5\r\n\t\tMaximum inventory: 9,000 lbs \r\n\t\tNAICS Code: 22131\r\n\r\nProgram Level:       3      \r\n\r\nEPA Identifier: 100000133134\r\n\r\nNumber of Full-time employees:         7         \r\n\r\nCovered By:      OSHA PSM  ( X )     EPCRA Section 302  ( X )"

Pray Water Treatment Plant must be reviewed and updated at least once by 2008.  If changes occur in the processes, quantities stored or handled change significantly, or any other aspect of the chlorine equipment or processes change that increase or decrease the worst-case scenario toxic endpoint, a revised analysis must be done and included in this Risk Management Plan.\r\n\r\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY \r\n\r\nThere have been no accidental releases of chlorine at the John W. Pray Water Treatment Plant that resulted in death, injuries, or property damage either on-site or off-site, nor any releases that required evacuation during the last 5 years (1999 - 2003).\r\n\r\nShould a release occur in the future, the following information must be recorded in this plan:\r\n\r\n* Date, time and approximate duration of release\r\n* Chemical(s) released\r\n* Estimated quantity released in pounds\r\n* Type of release event and its source\r\n* Weather conditions\r\n* Onsite impacts\r\n* Known offsite impacts\r\n* Initiating event and contributing factors\r\n* Whether offsite responders were notified\r\n* Operational or process changes that resulted from investigation of the release\r\n\r\n\r\nPREVENTION PROGRAM & EMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN\r\n\r\nMeeting the requirements of the OSHA regulation PSM, will satisfy the prevention provisions of this EPA Risk Management Plan.  EPA has prepared the RMP rules to avoid duplication of effort by owners and operators.  However, the owner must be able to demonstrate a management system that is in place to ensure continued fulfillment of prevention requirements.\r\n\r\n\r\nSee the John W. Pray Water Treatment Plant PROCESS SAFETY MANAGEMENT PROGRAM for in-depth review of the items outlined below:\r\n* Maintenance\r\n* Process Safety Information\r\n* Process Hazard Analysis (PHA)\r\n* Standard Operating Procedures (SOP's)\r\n* Training\r\n* Managem"
