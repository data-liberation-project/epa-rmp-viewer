Facility Policy.\n    The owners, management and employees of Trotter Fertilizer are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur,  the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, Greeley County LEPC , and/or other authorities, to mitigate and minimize the impacts of the release to the people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information.\n     The primary activity at the facility is the storage of fertilizers for sale to farmers. Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a nutrient for crop production. The maximum quantity stored would be 250,000 pounds in a storage tank and nurse tanks.\n\n3. Worst-Case Scenario and Alternate Release Scenario\n     a.      Worst-cas scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released as gas over a period of 10 minutes. The maximum quantity released would be 133000 pounds which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards and administrative controls.The distance to the end point (point of dispersion to 200 parts per million, or ppm) is 4.4 miles.\n     b. The alternate release scenario: a 1-inch transfer hose is used as an alternate release scenario followed by release of ammonia for 2 minutes before an automatic excess flow shut-down valve/valves intervenes or remote manual shut-off is closed and stops the flow of ammonia. The maximum quantity released would be 2,900 pounds. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200ppm) is .30 mile.\n\n4. Accidental Release Prevention Program\n     The facility is in compliance with the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by The American National Standards Insitute, Inc. (ANSI), and the stand"

Five-Year Accident History.\n     There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that have caused any deaths, injuries or significant property damage at the facility;nor, to our knowledge , has THERE BEEN ANY ACCIDENTAL RELEASES resulting in off-site deaths, injuries, evacuation, property damage, or environmental damage. \n\n6. Emergency Action Plan.\n     The facility has:\n      a. A written action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard 29 Cfr 1910.38;\n      b. Provided state and local authorities with the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).\n\n7. Planned Changes to Improve Safety.\n     Safety improvemet is an on-going process at the facility. Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the conditions of the facility. There are no additional specific safety recommendations regarding storage or use of anhydrous ammonia for implemtation at the time."
