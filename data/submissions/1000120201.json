      "SummaryText": "minimum of an engineer with knowledge of the process, an experienced operator, and a facilitator with knowledge of the PHA methodology. The team evaluates the process and reviews the potential hazards of different scenarios. Any hazard with unacceptable residual risk is given a recommendation to reduce the risk down to an acceptable level. These recommendations are assigned a primary person responsible and a due date for required completion. \n\n1.4.3  Operating Procedures\nARC engineers, operators, and supervisors work together to develop and maintain operating procedures to define how tasks related to process operations should be safely performed. The operating procedures (1) are used to train employees, and (2) serve as the foundation for appropriate actions to take during both normal operations and process upsets. Mill employees develop and maintain operating procedures that cover all phases of operations, including initial startup, normal operations, normal shutdown, emergency shutdown, startup following a turnaround or emergency shutdown, and temporary operations.\n\n1.4.4  Training\nARC trains workers to safely and effectively perform their assigned tasks. The employee training program includes both initial and refresher training that covers (1) a general overview of the process, (2) the properties and hazards of the substances in the process, and (3) a detailed review of the process operating procedures and safe work practices. Demonstrations and employee observations are used to verify that an employee understands the training material before the employee can resume work in the process.\n\n1.4.5  Mechanical Integrity\nARC maintains the mechanical integrity of process equipment to help prevent equipment failures that could endanger workers, the public, or the environment.

      "SummaryText": "1.  Executive Summary\nAlabama River Cellulose LLC (ARC) is committed to operating in a manner that is safe for its employees, the public, and the environment. As part of this commitment, ARC has established a system to help ensure the safe operation of the processes at its facility. One component of this system is a risk management program (RMP) that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) regulation 40 CFR Part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule). One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit a risk management plan (RMPlan) describing the risk management program at ARC. This document is intended to satisfy the RMPlan requirement of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program implemented by ARC. \n\nARC's risk management program consists of three elements:\n1. A hazard assessment to help understand (a) the potential offsite consequences of hypothetical accidental releases and (b) accidents that have occurred during the last five years associated with the use of substances regulated by the RMP rule (regulated substances) - see topics 1.3 and 1.5\n2. A prevention program to help maintain and safely operate the processes containing more than a threshold quantity of a regulated substance (covered processes) - see topic 1.4\n3. An emergency response program to help respond to accidental releases of regulated substances from covered processes - see topic 1.7\nInformation further describing these elements is provided in this RMPlan.\n\nAlthough the risk management program at ARC helps provide assurance that the facility is maintained and operated in a safe manner, it is only one component of the safety program at the mill. In fact, ARC has implemented a comprehensive safety program and established many levels of safeguards against release of a hazardous substance and injuries and damage from a release of a hazardous substance.\n\nARC utilize"

When a hazardous substance is used at the mill, the equipment is carefully designed, built, and operated to reduce the likelihood of an accidental release. Industry and government standards are closely adhered to in the design, construction, and operation of the equipment. \n\nARC limits damage from a release, if such a release occurs. ARC trains workers to respond to an accidental release, reducing the consequences of a release if it occurs. In the event of an accidental release, the mill's Emergency Response Team (ERT) will work with local emergency responders to help ensure that injuries and environmental damage will be minimized.\n\nThe safety program at the mill consists of a number of elements, only some of which are required by the RMP rule. This RMPlan is primarily intended to describe those parts of the safety program at ARC that are required by the RMP rule.\n\n1.1  Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nARC is committed to the safety of employees and the public, and to the preservation of the environment, through the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances. The mill implements reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous substances. These controls include training programs for personnel; programs to help ensure safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of processes in the mill; and programs to evaluate the hazards at ARC.\n\nIn the event of an accidental release, ARC controls and contains the release in a manner that will be safe for employees and will help prevent injury to the public or the environment. The mill provides response training to its employees, designates an emergency response coordinator to oversee response activities, and coordinates response efforts with the local fire department.

In order to effectively implement these policies, ARC established a management system headed by the Manager of Environmental and Compliance to oversee RMP-related activities.\n\n1.2  Facility Information and Regulated Substances\nARC operates two bleached kraft pulp mills that employ approximately 506 full-time workers. The two mills produce bleached kraft market pulp for sale to customers. As part of this manufacturing process, ARC handles chlorine dioxide in sufficient quantities to be covered by the RMP rule.\n\n1.3  Offsite Consequence Analysis\nARC performed an offsite consequence analysis to estimate the potential for an accidental release of a regulated substance to affect the public or the environment. The offsite consequence analysis consists of evaluating both worst-case release scenarios and alternative release scenarios. The alternative release scenario was selected to help the Monroe County Emergency Management Agency improve the community emergency response plan. An alternative release scenario represents a release that (1) might occur at a facility like ARC and (2) would result in the greatest potential offsite consequences if the release occurred. \n\n1.4  Accidental Release Prevention Program\nSince its inception in 1978, ARC has used a prevention program to help prevent accidental releases of hazardous substances. Beginning in 1992, the mill formalized this prevention program for the kraft pulp bleaching process to comply with the 14 elements of the OSHA process safety management (PSM) prevention programs for chlorine dioxide. In 1996, the EPA's RMP rule established similar requirements for Program 3 processes. The following sections briefly describe the elements of ARC's Program 3 prevention program that address the EPA's RMP rule accident prevention program requirements.\n\n1.4.1  Process Safety Information\nARC maintains a variety of technical documents that are used to help ensure safe operation of the mill processes.

ARC ensures that this process safety information is available to all mill employees, the Monroe County Emergency Management Agency, and local emergency responders.\n\nSafety data sheets (SDSs) document the physical properties of hazardous substances handled at ARC, including regulated substances in RMP-covered processes. The SDS for chlorine dioxide is available to mill operators and local emergency responders for ready reference. \n\nThe engineering design documents include the operating parameters and the design basis and configuration of the equipment in each covered process. The available information includes:\n- Operating parameters\n- Block flow or simplified process flow diagrams\n- Process chemistry\n- Maximum intended inventories\n- Safe upper and lower limits for parameters such as temperature, pressure, or flow\n- Consequences of deviation from established operating limits\n- Standard Operating Procedures\n- Design basis and configuration of equipment\n- Piping and instrument diagrams, including materials of construction\n- Electrical classification\n- Safety systems\n- Applicable design codes and standards\n- Design basis for relief and ventilation systems\nWhen important information was not available from the design documents, it was developed through special projects. Many of the operating parameters are included in the operating procedures to help with the safe operation of the process. These documents are used (1) to train employees and contractors, (2) to perform process hazard analyses, and (3) to help maintain the equipment.\n\n1.4.2  Process Hazard Analysis\nARC performs process hazard analyses (PHA) on process safety management covered processes, such as chlorine dioxide, at least every 5 years in accordance with OSHA 1910.119.

The program reviews the safety record of all contractors to help ensure that ARC hires only those contractors who can safely perform the desired job tasks. For required operating areas, the mill trains all contractors in the hazards of the process on which they will work, mill safe work practices, and mill emergency response procedures. The mill periodically reviews contractors' training documents and work performance to help ensure that safe work practices are followed.\n\n1.5  Chemical-specific Prevention Steps\nIn addition to the required prevention program elements, ARC has implemented safety features specific to the hazardous substances used by the facility. Sensors and alarms are provided in areas containing chlorine dioxide. Vent gases from vessels where chlorine dioxide is applied to pulp have been routed to scrubbers for emissions control.\n\n1.6  Five-Year Accident History\nThe Alabama River Cellulose (ARC) five-year accident history includes two releases of chlorine dioxide solution that occurred on December 8, 2022 and January 27, 2024. Each event resulted in employee or contractor injury but did not result in any property damage onsite, deaths, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.  \n\n1.7  Emergency Response Program\nARC has established a written emergency response program to help safely respond to accidental releases of hazardous substances.
