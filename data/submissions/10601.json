The Sewaren facility adheres to all applicable federal, state, and local laws.  We utilize a review processes to achieve safety excellence and a leadership position in safety and environmental stewardship.  In addition, safe work practices and a safe workplace are the responsibility  of every person in the plant.  \n\nWe use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public as well as protection of the environment.  If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to notify the Woodbridge Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency.  \n\nA description of your facility and the regulated substances handled:  The Sewaren  Butane Unloading facility transfers butane to the gasoline blend tanks.  The butane is pumped directly from the rail car or tank truck to the gasoline blend tank.  At the blend tank, the butane is mixed with a circulating stream of gasoline to provide complete mixing before entering the tank.\n\nTwo rail car unloading racks with several unloading spots at each rack are available for unloading butane.  Also available is one tank truck unloading spot, which shares a transfer pump with one rack at one time.\n\nOffsite Consequences:  Our worst-case scenario is failure of one 30,000-gallon railcar when filled to the greatest amount allowed resulting in a vapor cloud explosion reaching offsite endpoints and nearby public receptors. \n\nOur alternative-case scenario is failure of a 4\" hose resulting in a release of  3200 lbs of butane in 1 minute resulting in a vapor cloud fire.  The excess flow valve and emergency shutdown systems will mitigate the release.   The alternative-case scenario would not affect any"

The butane loading system is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with state laws.\n\nFive - year accident history:  We have never had an accident involving our butane that caused deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place.\n\nThe emergency response program:  In the event of an emergency involving our butane loading system, it is our policy to notify the Woodbridge Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency.  We have discussed this policy with the fire department; members of the fire department have inspected our butane loading system.  \n\nThe Sewaren Terminal Emergency Response Program uses contingency plans to coordinate all emergency responses.  The contingency plans are designed to provide guidelines for company employees for responding to emergencies and incidents at the terminal.  \n\nThe contingency plans are used to respond to various emergencies and are intended to fulfill federal and company requirements under OPA '90 Plan, SPCC Plan, FIRE Plan, HAZWOPER Plan Hazardous Waste Contingency Plan and The Company Emergency Plan which covers general emergencies, disasters threats of violence, bomb threats and demonstrations.  \n\nWhile our contingency plans cover a wide variety of emergencies, their main purpose is to define appropriate response measures to a substantial threat of discharge or discharge of oil onto land or into navigable waters of the United States.   Annual training and drills are a part of these contingency plans and are used to exercise and critique the plans. \n\nPlanned changes to improve safety:  The Sewaren Terminal holds monthly safety meetings.  Review and discussion of near misses and potential threats have been added to the meeti"
