This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program in place that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, we are completely coordinated with the Santa Paula, California Region 1 LEPC which provides highly trained emergency response personnel to control and mitigate the effects of the release.\r\n\r\n2. Regulated Substances Handled \r\nThere is one (1) regulated substance present at our facility.  This substance is acrolein [2-Propenal].  The regulated substance at our facility is stored and distributed to our customers.  Acrolein [2-Propenal] is stored in a pressurized vessel to minimize emissions during storage.  There is no material handling of acrolein except moving of containers.\r\n3. General Accidental Release Prevention Program & Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR Part 68.  In additional to 40 CFR 68, the Baker Petrolite - Santa Paula facility is subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119 and EPCRA Section 302 notification requirements.\r\n\r\nThe following sections briefly describe the elements of our release prevention program that are in place at our facility.\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\nSanta Paula UC maintains a detailed record of written safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with acrolein.\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis\r\nSanta Paula UC conducts comprehensive"

The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with knowledge in engineering and process operations.\r\n\r\nOperating Procedures\r\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Santa Paula UC maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as transportation, storage and emergency operations.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved with the processes.\r\n\r\nTraining\r\nSanta Paula UC has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees that are operating processes are completely competent in the operating procedures associated with this process.  New employees receive basic training in operations followed by on-the-job supervision until they are deemed competent to work independently.  Refresher training is provided at least every three (3) years and more frequently as needed.\r\n\r\nMechanical Integrity\r\nSanta Paula UC carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper functions.  Equipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure vessels, relief and vent systems, and any piping.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe timely manner.\r\n\r\nManagement of Change\r\nWritten procedures are in place at Santa Paula UC to manage changes in technology, equipment and procedures.
