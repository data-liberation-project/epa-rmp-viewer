The largest vessel of 70% solution of Hydrofluoric Acid is a 55 gallon drum.  Stainless steel plate is received as either direct to gauge or cogg plate.  The cogg plate is cut on a hydraulic shear into lengths ranging from 50"

      "SummaryText": "to 200 inches, depending on the ordered finished plate size.  rolled finished sizes range from 3/16 to 4 inches thick up to 120 inches wide and up to 420 inches long.  The cut cogg plate is then heated in natural gas fired furnaces and rolled to finish gauge.  The rolling process can require up to three heatings of the cogg plate at intermediate gauges before reaching finished gauge.  After rolling, the plates are annealed to improve the internal structure of the plate.  The plates then move to the finishing department.  The plates are shotblasted to remove the scale, oxidized steel that forms on the surface during annealling.  The plates are then flattened and cut to their final length and width.  The next process for the plates is pickling followed by final inspection and placement in the warehouse for shipment to customers.  Avesta Sheffield Plate Inc.  has 70% solution of Hydrofluoric Acid in 55 gallon drums.  This acid is used in the pickling operation.  Plates will  come in contact with the acid to assist in removing scale oxidation from the steel surface.  The acid bath concentration is approximatly 3% Hydrofluoric acid and 12% Nitric Acid.  The acid concentrations in the baths would not fall under the regulated substance under RMP.  There are two (2) pickling operations, therfore , there are two (2) containment areas where hydrofluoric acid (70%) drums are stored.   Approximately 10 in the 120 containment area and 18 in the batch pickle area.  Avesta Sheffield Plate, Inc. has identified a worst case scenario of the largest vessel of the hydrofluoric acid (70%) one (1) drum rupturing (500 lbs).  These drums are stored in a containment area and inside a building, therefore, offsite impact is very minimal.  When pumping the Hydrofluoric Acid (70%) into the pickling baths a drum pump is used to transfer the material.  The alternative scenario for Avesta Sheffield Plate Inc.  would be for the hose to become separated from the pump and allowing Hydrofluoric Acid"
