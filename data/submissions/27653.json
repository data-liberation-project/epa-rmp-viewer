Call in professional services and wait for them to arrive.\n\nThe highest-ranking supervisor present has final authority to determine all action until arrival of a higher qualified supervisor or professional services.\n\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY FOR FARMWAY CO-OP, INC., COURTLAND, KS\n\nThe information issued by the board and management of Farmway Co-op, Inc, a cooperative located in north central Kansas with home offices located at 204 E. Court, Beloit, KS 67420-0568.  This summary is pertaining to the RMP Clean Air Act Section 112 (r) plan under section 68.155 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR).\n\nThe board, management and employees of the facility are committed to prevent accidental release of anhydrous ammonia or propane.  If any release should occur, the facility employees will take immediate action and call 911 dispatch reporting the release to mitigate any release and minimize impact of the release on people or the environment.\n\nThe facility preformed a hazard assessment and developed plans to submit according to the requirements of the Clean Air Act Section 112(r).  According to this assessment the facility falls into the Program 2 category. The facility shall store anhydrous ammonia in 18,000 gallon-approved tanks.  There are 15 nurse tanks with total storage of  60,000 pounds storage.  This facility has 124,000 pounds of ammonia in storag"

      "SummaryText": "e. The total product stored shall not exceed 85% capacity at 60 degrees Fahrenheit for a maximum of the largest vessel of 64,000 pounds of product.  Ammonia is an agricultural product sold to customers of Farmway Co-op as a source of nitrogen for plants.\n\nAll measures shall be taken to implement passive mitigation of operational equipment making sure that automatic procedures are in place to prevent a release of product from valves and lines.  All equipment will be checked and tested according to manufacturer specifications and at least annually and documented as to the testing and results.\n\nEmergency response measures shall be in place in case of any release of materials.  Employees are instructed to abide by all policies and procedures as pointed our in the Employee Risk Management Manual.  Training of such procedures will be annually and with any new employee at the job involving anhydrous ammonia or propane. \n\nThe worst-case release of anhydrous ammonia would be the release from the largest vessel identified as 18,000 gallon tank holding 72,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia liquefied under pressure by design standards. The impact would be on residents including schools, industrial businesses and other environmental receptors.\n\nThe alternative release of anhydrous ammonia would be to overfill the tank and due to pressure rise the pop off valve would relieve gas.  The amount would be less than 100 lbs. per minute with duration less than 10 minutes. \n\nIn the hazard assessment it was found that there has been no accidents or releases at this facility.  Therefore, no report is in this plan for the 5 year history.\n\nThe emergency response program is on file with the county emergency preparedness division.  The Farmway Co-op plan is included in the Employee Risk Management Manual chapter three.  This manual is to be collected and taken to the head count area after a release or emergency.  The assessment of the incident is to be done and if warranted call 911.  The highest"

Safety training is offered to new employees upon introduction to the job.  Annual training is provided through in-house training or employees are to attend outside association offered training.\n\nThe emergency response and release program was updated in 2002 and in accordance with OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.38.  The training of employees is initiated upon employment in the area of ammonia and propane and annual review training is completed with knowledge testing documenting learned processes. The emergency plan is reviewed annually and provided the state and local authorities with a visit at the facilities annually by emergency response trained departments.
