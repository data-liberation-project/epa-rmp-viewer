If any accidental release should occur, the faciliity is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people  and the enviroment.\n\n2.Facility Information\n\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers.\n\nAnhydruos ammonia is recieved, stored, and distributed for direct  soil application. Anhydrous ammonium is used to supply nutrients for crop production.\n\nThe  maximum quantity of ammonia stored would be 130,000 pounds in our 30,000 gallon storage tank. The maximum quantity handled  at any one time would be the unloading  of a tank truck holding 40,000 pounds.\n\n3. Worst case and alternative release scenario\n\na. The worst case scenario for Anhydrous ammonia would be the release of the entire contents of a storage tank released as a gas over ten minutes. The maximum quantity released would be 130,000 pounds which represents the volume of the storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion is 200 ppm) is 1.12 miles.\n\nb. The alternative release scenario for anhydrous ammonia based on the hazard review is a 2 minute release from a break in the 3 inch pipe . The  distance to the endpoint  is .78 miles.\n\n4. Accidental release prevention program.\n\nThis facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling af Anhydrous Ammonia, k-61.1\", published by the American National Standards Institute Inc. and the Standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety  and Health Administration (OSHA"

There has been no accidental releases of  anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that: have caused any deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place , property damage or enviromental damage.\n\n6. Emergency Response Program\n\nThe facility has:\na. A written emergency action plan, in accodance with osha standard, 29 CFR 1910.38\n\nb. Provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).\n\nc. Coordinated with local emergency responders.\n\n7. Planned changes to improve safety\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility. Periodic evaluations are prformed to assess the  maintenance of safe conditions. There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
