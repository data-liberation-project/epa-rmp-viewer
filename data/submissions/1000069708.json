At our facility, anhydrous ammonia (cas #7664-41-7) is used as a refrigerant during processing and to maintain the desired air temperatures of our freezers and cooler rooms. Designed as a closed-loop, two-stage compression system, liquid ammonia is either pumped or circulated by pressure to the cooling evaporators. A mix of ammonia liquid and vapor returns to suction vessels where the liquid is separated from the vapor. Ammonia vapor is pulled from the suction vessels, compressed, and sent to rooftop condensers where it is cooled and condensed to a liquid to be used again by the evaporators. The maximum high-side system operating pressure is 175 psig but the highest pressure that the system normally operates at ranges between 125 to 150 psig. The maximum quantity of ammonia on-site is 15,000 lbs.\n\n\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and the specific prevention steps.\n\n\n\nMany safety features have been incorporated into the design and installation of the ammonia refrigeration system to protect the system and its components from a catastrophic failure and release of ammonia and to minimize the impact should an incident occur. Notable safety design features include:\n\n\n\n1.    System operation and monitoring by programmable logic controllers (PLC). The PLCs control the operation of the ammonia refrigeration system including loading and unloading compressors to handle the load demands of the system, sequencing condenser fans and water pumps to maintain a safe high-side operating pressure and controlling the cooling and defrost cycles of area evaporators to maintain room temperatures. The PLCs also monitor the operating parameters of the system such as pressures, temperatures, and liquid levels and will either initiate an alarm or shut down the system (depending on the type of alarm) when any of the"

The emergency ventilation system is automatically turned on by ammonia detectors installed inside the engine room or they can be manually started using switches located outside of the engine room.\n\n\n\n4.

In addition, the facility has established initial and refresher training requirements for ammonia refrigeration operators and mechanics as well as awareness training for all facility employees.\n\n\n\nThe emergency response program.\n\n\n\nAll facility employees are trained on the hazards of ammonia and how to recognize and report accidental releases.

Facility personnel will evaluate and respond to all ammonia releases that are within their training, capability and resources.

Upgrades were also made to the ammonia refrigeration control system with a Logix Controls Clarity Software Program and redundant control station in case the primary control station computer or monitor fail. New Logix system also allows for remote accessibility and automatic communications and notifications by the system to members of the motive power staff and management team by e-mail, text message or phone call.
