      "SummaryText": "The accident release prevention and emergency response policies at our facility is that the Whittemore facility comply with requirements for anhydrous ammonia storage and it is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state and local laws.  If an emergency were to occur, signs are posted that refer to Tom Winkel who is by West Bend Elevator.  Tom will then decide what steps need to be taken in the event of an emergency.  This facility is a wholesale business providing products for the production of grain and livestock enterprises.  Our worst case scenario is failure of one of our anhydrous ammonia storage tanks when filled to the greatest amount allowed.  This would result in a vapor cloud explosion.  According to EPA look-up tables, the distance to the endpoint is 4.4 miles.  There are an estimated 511 people within this radius.  Residences, schools, recreation areas and major commerical, office or industrial areas.  Whittemore complies with EPA's accident prevention rules and applicable state and local codes and regulations.  The anhydrous ammonia plant is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with regulations and state laws.  We have never had an accident involving NH3 that caused death, injuries, proeprty or environmental damage, evacuations, or shelterings in the past 5 years.  In the event of an emergency involving the NH3 system, it is our policy to notify the Whittemore Fire Dept and request that they respond to the emergency.  We have discussed this policy with Jim Kelly the Kossuth County Disaster Coordinator and  Whittemore Fire Dept.   We have had the Whittemore Fire Dept has inspected our NH3 facility.  We at this time have no plans to improve or change or plans.  We review the plans annually or sooner if necessary."
