The LOC for ammonia is 200 ppm.  The OCA establishes Areas of Concern with a radius of 2.3 miles for the Worst-case Scenario and a radius of 0.1 miles for the Alternate Release Scenario. The affected populations are estimated at 38,020 people for the Worst-case Scenario and 11 people for the Alternate Release Scenario. There are environmental receptors within the Areas of Concern that could possibly be affected. \n\nRELEASE SCENARIOS\t\t\t\t\t\n3.7.1.\tWorst Case Scenario\nThe worst-case release scenario (OCA-1) used in this assessment identifies the medium-temperature re-circulator (V-2) as the pump-down vessel with the potential to hold a large quantity of ammonia at higher pressures than the other vessels. This scenario looks at a release occurring from this vessel during a pump-down procedure when this vessel may be nearly full of liquid ammonia. During normal operation, the inventory of ammonia is continuously circulated throughout the refrigeration system. Normal vessel inventories are usually between ten and thirty percent of individual vessel capacity. \nThe design of this vessel allows it to be used as a pump-down ammonia holding vessel during infrequent installation or maintenance procedures. The maximum intended holding capacity is eighty percent of total volume. It is only during this pump-down procedure when the greatest volume of ammonia is present, providing the opportunity for the worst-case scenario. The worst-case release scenario is based on a rupture that occurs on the vessel side of the isolation valve for the 4\u0094 HPL line that feeds the medium-temperature recirculator causing the released qu"

      "SummaryText": "onfiguration. High-pressure ammonia vapor flows from the high-temperature compressors to the evaporative condenser where heat is removed, condensing the vapor to a high-pressure liquid. High-pressure liquid from the condenser is drained to the thermosyphon pilot-receiver and the high-pressure receiver. Saturated condensing temperature is 85\u00b0F (150 PSIG) at a corresponding 79\u00b0F WB. The condenser has connections with the compressor discharge line and the condenser drain lines go to the high-pressure receiver.\nPURGER\nThis system incorporates an automatic gas purger for removing non-condensable gases from the ammonia system. The presence of non-condensable gases in the condenser penalizes the system performance through the artificial elevation of condensing pressure. The non-condensable gases add their partial pressures to the ammonia partial pressure against which the compressors must pump. The system has several purge point connections, typically at each of the condenser liquid outlet pipes. \nHOT GAS DEFROST\nThe compressor discharge hot gas is used to defrost the evaporators. During the defrost cycle, the hot gas refrigerant gives up heat and condenses. With the fans shut down, the ability of the coil to transfer that heat to the air is severely limited. Thus, the heat from the hot gas is absorbed by metal in the coil. As the metal absorbs heat, its temperature rises. Once the surface temperature is high enough, any ice and/or frost on the coil surface will melt and drain off. Defrosting the evaporators occurs automatically on a time sequence by individual sequence timers.\nEVAPORATORS \nIn this facility, the evaporators are fed from liquid pumps. The feed rate is approximately 3:1. This system will circulate three times the amount of the refrigerant needed by the evaporator for the rated capacity. The +20\u00b0F high-temperature system includes the glycol chiller, production area, storage coolers, and dock areas.\nAMMONIA PIPING AND VALVES\nThe ammonia piping and valves in th"

The thermosyphon oil coolers on the screw compressors are fed from this vessel and return a liquid/gas mix back through the thermosyphon return piping. Most of the liquid ammonia from the condenser drains through this receiver to the high-pressure receiver.\nHIGH-PRESSURE RECEIVER\nThe high-pressure receiver is a vertical vessel. The volume of vessel at maximum allowable liquid level (80% of total vessel volume) is 575.0 cu-ft. It operates at a saturated liquid temperature of +85\u00b0F. The high-pressure receiver stores the ammonia liquid coming from the condenser. All liquid from the condenser flows through this vessel. High-pressure liquid is fed from these vessels to the rest of the system. Liquid ammonia is stored in the top of this vessel for thermosyphon oil cooling. The thermosyphon oil coolers on the screw compressors are fed from this vessel and return a liquid/gas mix back through the thermosyphon return piping. All liquid ammonia from the condenser drains to this receiver.\nMEDIUM TEMPERATURE RECIRCULATOR \nThis recirculator is a horizontal pressure vessel. The volume of this vessel at maximum allowable liquid level (80% of total vessel volume) is 1749.0 cubic feet. It operates at a saturated liquid temperature of +20\u00b0F. The high-temp liquid is pumped from this vessel to the production and storage air units where 30% of the liquid mass is evaporated. The liquid-vapor mixture is returned to this vessel where the liquid is separated from the vapor. The compressors take the ammonia vapor from this vessel and compress it to approximately 150 psig. This vessel has connection with the compressors (dry suction) and with the high-temp pumped liquid and the wet suction piping from the evaporators and chillers.\n\nCONDENSERS\nThe evaporative condensers use axial fans in a draw-through c"

      "SummaryText": "PROCESS & PROCESS CHEMISTRY\nThere are only two substances purposefully circulating in the system, ammonia (NH3) and an appropriate ammonia rated refrigeration compressor oil, all enclosed within ammonia compatible materials.  This refrigeration process is a closed system which prevents contact with other chemicals.  Refrigeration compressor oil is compatible and causes no chemical reaction with ammonia or system materials.\nRefrigeration systems have no chemical reactions in the process cycle. The operation of a refrigeration system requires controlling the ammonia (NH3) refrigerant temperature and pressure at key points in the system. The ideal cycle considers heat transfer in the condenser and evaporator without pressure losses. The refrigerant leaves the evaporator as a low pressure, low temperature, and saturated vapor then enters the compressor, where the refrigerant is compressed to a high pressure, high temperature vapor and is sent to the condenser. The refrigerant leaves the condenser as a high pressure, medium temperature, saturated liquid, where the refrigerant enters an expansion valve and expands as it leaves. At this point, the refrigerant is at a low pressure, low temperature liquid entering the evaporator. Inside the evaporator, the refrigerant is evaporated at a constant pressure. Heat transfer to the evaporator and from the condenser occurs without a limited temperature difference between the refrigerant emitting the heat and the refrigerant that absorbs the heat. However, this is not true during the de-superheating process in the condenser.\n\nCAPACITY\nThis food distribution facility operates a single temperature one-stage, anhydrous ammonia (R-717) refrigeration system with engine room compressor capacities of approximately 2600 TR at (+10-20?F) suction.\n\nSYSTEM CLASSIFICATION\nThis refrigeration system is a liquid recirculation system and is designed to operate at an over-feed ratio of approximately 3:1 for all evaporators.
