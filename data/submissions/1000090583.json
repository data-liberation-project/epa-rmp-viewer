The facility is located on approximately 8 acres within a 1,400-acre industrial park owned and managed by Performance Materials NA, Inc. a wholly owned subsidiary of The Dow Chemical Company (\"Dow\").   The industrial park includes other entities engaged in chemical manufacturing, including Dow, INVISTA, and DuPont.  HTT purchased the waste management facility May 2020.  \n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nAccidental release prevention and emergency response policies are comprised of three generally over-lapping safety programs.  The safety program for the HTT facility is comprised of facility-specific policies and procedures designed to ensure safe operation of the incinerator and waste storage areas.  The safety policies and procedures of the industrial park manager, Dow, are designed to ensure effective emergency response capabilities are maintained.  Finally, the corporate-based safety policies and procedures maintained by HTT provide guidance and structure upon which the HTT facility safety program is based.  \n\n\n\nRegulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nThe incinerator is designed and authorized to manage a wide array of chemical substances, including many of those regulated by 40 CFR 68.  Historically, the quantities of these substances handled are small because the substances generally comprise only a small portion of any given waste material.  The only regulated-substance present in quantities exceeding the threshold planning quantity (TPQ) is vinyl acetate, based upon year 2019 waste storage records.  Vinyl acetate is a common monomer used by both Dow and DuPont for the manufacturing of certain polymeric resins.  \n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention \n\n\n\nThe H"

      "SummaryText": "TT accidental release program is principally comprised of two components: waste characterization and waste storage area monitoring.  Each waste stream is well-characterized by HTT laboratory personnel prior to receipt.  This ensures waste stream properties and chemical-specific hazards are identified and can be managed properly.  Waste characterization includes sampling and analysis of each waste stream in accordance with the Waste Analysis Plan.   Once compatible waste streams are placed into storage, on-going monitoring is conducted.  Storage tank areas are monitored continuously by Control Room Technicians with the assistance of DCS outputs and alarms for tank temperatures, pressures, and levels.  Containerized wastes are stored in well-designed areas subject to regular inspections.    \n\n\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\n\n\nThe facility has not experienced an accidental release pursuant to the reporting requirements of 40 CFR 68.42, Five-Year Accident History.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\n\n\nDow provides site-wide emergency response services to all tenants within the industrial park.  These emergency response services include a fully-staffed emergency response team (ERT), on-site emergency response capabilities, and equipment to address fire, medical emergencies, and accidental releases.  The Dow ERT incident command structure coordinates with the Orange County Fire Department and associated Local Emergency Planning Commission.    \n\n\n\nEach party at the facility, including HTT, provides personnel to serve on the Dow ERT.  The emergency response capabilities located within the HTT facility include various alarm systems and emergency management capabilities, including but not limited to:\n\n\n\n?    automatic fire alarms, \n\n?    manually-activated emergency alarms, \n\n?    automatic fire-suppression system, \n\n?    pre-positioned fire monitors, and\n\n?    emergency response PPE including both SCBA and escape breathing air.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changed to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nThere are no planned changes "
