Although these scenarios are highly unlikely in the event of a release, it provides the local responding agencies with a maximum possible impact in the event of an accidental release. In considering these releases, the most pessimistic meteorological conditions were used. No passive or active mitigation measures were taken into account when considering these release scenarios.\r\n\r\n3.2\tAlternative Release Scenarios\r\n\r\nAlternative scenarios were developed to assess what potential impact may occur in the event of a release that is more likely to occur than the worst-case scenarios for each of the regulated chemicals. Several possible release scenarios were considered, and the scenarios with the greatest offsite impact were chosen. In considering the alternative release scenario, the default meteorological conditions for alternative scenarios were used in RMP*Comp. These scenarios represent a more realistic release, and have a downwind distance and impact considerably smaller than the worst-case scenario. No passive or active mitigation measures were taken into account when considering these release scenarios.\r\n\r\n4\tGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Programs and Prevention Steps\r\n\r\nAs part of the implementation of the RMP and PSM, elements of the prevention programs have been developed to manage process safety issues associated with the Facility. Each of the program elements has been developed according to OSHA and EPA regulations in order to ensure safe operating practices and conditions at the SMWE Facility.\r\nElements of Prevention Program 3 include the following:\r\n\u00bf\tProcess Safety Information - information regarding the hazards of anhydrous ammonia, process description, and equipment properties\r\n\u00bf\tProcess Hazard Analysis - a detailed review of the process, and recommendations to improve the safety of the systems at the Facility\r\n\u00bf\tOperating Procedures - procedures designed to comply with regulations and provide safe p"

Personnel are encouraged to continually identify methods and procedures to reduce the use of and risks associated with hazardous chemicals. This process includes protecting the community, environment, and Facility personnel by implementing technology and procedures designed to reduce the impact of any potential release of toxic chemicals. This commitment to safety is documented in the policy and compliance manuals for the Facility, which is available to all employees.\r\n\r\nAs part of SMWE's commitment to safe and environmentally friendly operations, monthly meetings are conducted as well as other more specific operational meetings concerning safety that would include all affected employees. Input and comments from plant personnel are also key aspects of SMWE's safety practices. By giving personnel the ability to make suggestions regarding safety and operational practices, the Facility can operate efficiently and safely. Another key element in SMWE's safety practices consists of the regular performance of internal and third party environmental and safety audits.\r\n\r\n2\tRegulated Substance\r\n\r\nSMWE utilizes anhydrous ammonia within the refrigeration systems at the site. The Facility uses approximately 13,200 pounds in a single closed loop.\r\n\r\n3\tOff-site Release Scenarios\r\n\r\nSMWE has conducted an OCA based on the EPA document titled RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidelines, and used the EPA's RMP*Comp Version 2.01 to estimate the distance traveled to a toxic endpoint defined by the EPA regulation. This data were then used to estimate the potential impact caused by a release from each of the regulated substances.\r\n\r\n3.1\tWorst-Case Release Scenarios\r\n\r\nAs required by regulations, scenarios were considered where the entire capacity of the largest vessel for each regulated chemi"
