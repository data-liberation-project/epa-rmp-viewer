      "SummaryText": "Pueblo Water \nWhitlock Water Treatment Plant (Facility ID: 1000 0007 5651)\nExecutive Summary\n\nRelease Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:\nThe Board of Water Works of Pueblo, Colorado (Pueblo Water) is a large drinking water system producing and distributing water for the City of Pueblo, CO.  Pueblo Water takes an active approach in maintaining and improving the safe operation of its covered chemical feed systems located at the Whitlock Water Treatment Plant (WTP). Pueblo Water's Circle of Safety Committee continually presents information to all employees emphasizing safety awareness. Monthly crew meetings and operational training and testing programs for the covered systems have helped Pueblo Water maintain an excellent safety record at the WTP with no injury-causing accidents or chemical releases involving chlorine or anhydrous ammonia within the last five years. \n\nFacility and Regulated Substances:\nThe WTP is located at 1920 West 11th Street, on the west side of the city of Pueblo near the Arkansas River, and uses chlorine and anhydrous ammonia in three covered processes to provide disinfection for the public water supply.  The WTP has one chlorination process that stores chlorine gas in one ton containers and supplies chlorine to two treatment trains (TTA and TTB).  A maximum inventory of 28 cylinders of chlorine (56,000 pounds) may be stored at the WTP.  Two anhydrous ammonia systems work in conjunction with the chlorine system.  The anhydrous ammonia system for treatment train A (TTA) includes storage of anhydrous ammonia in four 2,000 gallon storage tanks; however, each anhydrous ammonia storage tank is limited to 85% of maximum volume (1700 gallons) and the maximum storage capacity is determined to be 6800 gallons(34,000 pounds.)  The anhydrous ammonia system for treatment train B (TTB) includes storage of anhydrous ammonia in two 3,000 gallon storage tanks(also limited to 85% of the maximum volume) for a maximum capacity of 5,100 gallons (25,500 poun"

      "SummaryText": "ds).\n\nWorst Case and Alternate Case Release Scenarios for the Chlorine System:\nThe worst-case release scenario for the primary chlorination process involves the loss of 2,000 pounds of chlorine from a single one-ton container of chlorine outside of any enclosure. The rule for worst case release analysis assumes all of the contents are released in 10 minutes. The alternative case release scenario for the primary chlorination system was based on accident history at the site, process hazard analysis, and experience at similar facilities, and involves the release of 1,550 pounds of chlorine in 10 minutes as a result of a crack in the cylinder caused by a drop during transport.  The distance to endpoint for both scenarios were analyzed using RMP*Comp, and the analyses resulted in a worst-case release scenario distance to endpoint of 1.3 miles and an alternative case release scenario distance to endpoint of 0.2 miles.\n\nWorst Case and Alternate Case Release Scenarios for Two Anhydrous Ammonia Systems:\nThe worst-case release scenario for the anhydrous ammonia storage and feed systems for TTA involves the loss of 8,800 pounds of ammonia from a single anhydrous ammonia storage tank in 10 minutes. The worst-case release scenario for the anhydrous ammonia storage and feed systems for Treatment Train B involves the loss of 7,252 pounds of ammonia from a single anhydrous ammonia storage tank in 10 minutes.  The alternative case release scenarios for both primary and settling facility anhydrous ammonia process were based on accident history at the site, process hazard analysis, and experience at similar facilities and involves the release of 4,340 pounds of chlorine in 30 minutes as a result of a pump seal failure on the tanker truck during filling operations.  The distance to endpoint for both scenarios were analyzed using RMP*Comp, and the analyses resulted in a worst case release scenario distance to endpoint of 1.2 miles for the anhydrous ammonia storage and feed systems for T"

      "SummaryText": "TA and 1.0 miles for the anhydrous ammonia storage and feed systems for TTB.  Alternate case release scenarios determined the distance to the required endpoint of 0.1 miles.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program:\nThe accidental release prevention program complies with the requirements for Program Level 2 processes.  The prevention program includes an employee training program based on written operating procedures for the WTP, hands-on training in the facilities with the systems, as well as the maintenance, inspection, and testing program for equipment utilized within the covered processes.  These programs all serve to prevent or minimize unintended releases of chlorine and anhydrous ammonia.\n\nFive-Year Accident History:\nThe WTP has not had any incidental or non-incidental releases in the last five years.\n\nEmergency Response Program:\nThe Whitlock Treatment Plant is a \"non-responding facility\"; however, according to Pueblo County's LEPC personnel, it is included in Pueblo's community emergency response plan.  The primary emergency responder to the WTP is the City of Pueblo Fire Department.  WTP employees may only handle small, incidental releases of chlorine and anhydrous ammonia and are trained and equipped to do so.  Pueblo Fire Department personnel are familiar with all three covered systems at the Whitlock Plant.  Responders meet with plant managers plant to discuss RMP and response coordination annually.  PFD also conducts separate, annual site safety inspections."
