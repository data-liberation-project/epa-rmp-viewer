Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at Co-op Country Farmers Elevator Company in Renville, Minnesota  are strongly committed\nto employee, public, and environmental safety.  This commitment is an inherent part of our\ncomprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation,\noperating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our\nfacility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated\nsubstances.  We coordinate our response efforts with the Renville Fire Department, which provides\nadditional emergency response expertise.\n\n  2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities include support services for crop production.  We have anhydrous\nammonia stored in two 26,000-gallon tanks, one 25,300-gallon tank, fifty-nine 1,000-gallon nurse\ntanks, and six 1,400-gallon nurse tanks nurse tanks at our facility in Renville, Minnesota (Figure 1). \nThe maximum amount stored at 85% standard maximum storage capacity is 123,350 gallons \n(634,244.5 pounds) including the capacity of the on-site nurse tanks.   The largest single storage\nvessel at our facility contains 113,726.6 pounds at  85% standard maximum storage capacity.\n\n  3. Worst Case Release and Alternative Release Scenarios\nWe utilized RMP Comp for the worst case and alternate case scenarios of the required offsite\nconsequence analysis for our facility.  The following details these scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario involves a catastrophic release of the entire contents of one of the \nlargest single anhydrous ammonia storage tanks (113,726.6 pounds) in gaseous form ov"
