The Lake Street facility is in the process of developing a program for compliance with 29 CFR 1910.119, OSHA's \"Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals\" for the chlorination process.  Compliance with this regulation, and EPA's \"Risk Management Program Rule\" helps to prevent the release of chlorine from this process.  Additionally, these regulations required development of procedures to minimize releases of chlorine in the event that they do occur, and to outline appropriate emergency response steps to take in the event of a release.\n\nThe La Porte Water Works Lake Street facility is located at 1119 Lake Street, La Porte, Indiana, 46350.  Among the processes required for proper treatment of potable water is the chlorination process.  The chlorination process adds chlorine gas to process water to reduce bacteria. Chlorine is received in 150-pound cylinders. The process has been designed and constructed in accordance with all local, state, and federal codes and requirements. The chlorination process has a gas detection system that alarms should the concentration of chlorine reach 1.0 parts per million. The chlorination process is maintained and operated by personnel certified by the State of Indiana.\n\nThe  La Porte Water Works Department Emergency Response Plan is based upon OSHA requirements for Emergency Action Plans.  The plan has been coordinated with the La Porte Fire Department."
