In the event that an\n\naccidental release should occur, we are prepared to work with our Local Fire Company(s), Emergency\n\nResponse Personnel, and other appropriate authorities deemed applicable depending on the specific\n\nincident, to best mitigate any release and to minimize the impact of the release to people and the\n\nenvironment.\n\n\n\nFacility Information:\n\n\n\nThe primary activity of our company is NAICS code 422510, \"establishments primarily engaged in\n\noperating country or terminal grain elevators\" however we are also engaged in providing \"agricultural\n\ninputs\" that include the receiving, storage, and reloading of Anhydrous Ammonia for delivery to farmers in\n\nour area.   The NAICS code we feel most applicable for  receiving, storing and reloading is #493130 \"farm\n\nproduct warehousing and storage\".  Although Anhydrous Ammonia is the only product subject to the EPA\n\nRisk Management Plan at this time, it should be noted that we also handle Propane for both agricultural\n\nuses and home heating, which is under consideration as a listed substance.  We include Propane (as well as\n\nall crop protectants and petroleum products) in our planning, training and maintenance programs, however\n\nonly the facilities used for Anhydrous Ammonia are included in this report.\n\n\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application to farm fields during the\n\nearly spring and late fall months.  During the balance of the year, inventories will be storage only, with little\n\nif any product transfer taking"

The maximum on site vessel size is 30,000 gallons, storing\n\n130,000 lbs.  The maximum quantity handled at a given time would be the off loading of a semi-trailer\n\nvehicle tank holding 40-42,000 lbs.\n\n\n\nThe facility is operated on an \"as needed\" basis with staff present only during the receiving and reloading of\n\nproduct for delivery.  Total annual hours for these needs do not meet the 2,080 hour requirement to qualify\n\nas a \"full time employee\" on site, therefore item number 1.11 is Zero.  Our facilities have adequate lighting\n\nand are inspected at various times day or night during use and throughout the \"off season\" when not in use.\n\n\n\nItem number 3.5 addressing quantity released shows a total quantity released of 79 pounds however due to\n\nthe pressure in the line, the release rate is 200 pounds per minute which, given the release duration of 10\n\nminutes would indicate a release of 2000 pounds.  When the pressure of anhydrous ammonia is reduced\n\nquickly, the material rapidly self-refrigerates to -33?F.  Once the liquid reaches this temperature the\n\nvaporization is quite slow, from where we estimate a 10 minute release duration.  Additionally, the excess\n\nflow valve which wil stop the flow from the tank when flow rates exceed the rating, has an orifice which\n\nwill allow 0.05 pounds per minute of ammonia to escape at 100 psi.\n\n\n\nWorst -case release scenario:\n\n\n\nThe worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of our largest Anhydrous\n\nAmmonia tank, released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 130,000 lbs.\n\nbased on 85% tank capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the endpoint (point of\n\ndispersion to 200 PPM) based on EPA's  OCA guidance tables, public and environmental receptors, and\n\nresidential population within this area have been provided to our Local Emergency Planning"

EPA's RMP\n\nComp software calculated an affected area of 0.1 mile and is similar to our experience from the incident.  \n\n\n\nAccidental Release Program:\n\n\n\nFor Anhydrous Ammonia, our accidental release program is based on guidelines found in the American\n\nNational Standards Institute, Inc. (ANSI) standard K-61.1 \"Safety requirements for the Storage and\n\nHandling of Anhydrous Ammonia; and the US Occupational  Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)\n\nstandard 29CFR 1910.111 \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\".  Additionally, we conduct\n\nannual employee training on the safe handling, transportation and distribution of Anhydrous Ammonia, and\n\nhave installed safety equipment including, but not limited to : excess flow valves, barriers to avoid damage\n\nby trucks or other vehicles, and lockouts to prevent tampering when the site is unattended.  Finally, we\n\nmaintain routine contact with our local fire department and emergency response personnel and have\n\nprovided and/or participated in safety training exercises on Anhydrous Ammonia.  The primary emergency\n\ncoordinator is listed in the Registration Section of this document.  Additionally, we subscribe to the\n\nChemTrec service (phone 800-424-9300) to provide emergency response information when needed. \n\nChemTrec, through Farmland Industries, also includes a system to notify any of several listed local\n\nemployees in the event of a release.\n\n\n\nFive-Year Accident History:\n\n\n\nWe have had one incident at this facility resulting in an estimated release of between 1,800 and 1,900\n\npounds of Anhydrous Ammonia.  The release was caused by employee error during replacement of a\n\npressure gauge on the East storage tank.  Due to the remote locati"
