The same properties that make this chemical valuable as a refrigerant also make it necessary to observe specific safety precautions.  These safety precautions are exercised in the operation and maintenance of the refrigeration system to control human environmental exposure in an effort to reduce the overall threat to our workers as well as the surrounding communities.\n\nIt is Sinton Dairy Foods policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state and local rules and regulations.  However, the safe handling of hazardous chemicals is paramount at Sinton Dairy Foods.  We adhere to standards and recommended practices governing the safe handling of hazardous chemicals to ensure that we have obtained a reasonable level of risk reduction.  Investigation of inherently safer refrigeration technologies and fail-safe design applications are a few of the continuous improvements occurring at Sinton Dairy Foods.  Safety depends upon our management, the manner in which we handle ammonia, the safety devices inherent to our refrigeration systems, our operating procedures and philosophies, and the training of our employees.\n\nWe believe that accountability for safety reaches throughout all levels of management at Sinton Dairy Foods.  Senior management's commitment and dedication to continued safe-operating practices is clearly evident in our organization structure and employee empowerment.\n\nWe have made extensive improvements to safety and health programs like our prevention program (pro"

We call it employee ownership and its success is portrayed through lower injury rates, fewer incidents, and improved efficiencies at the plant.\n\nThe Emergency Preparedness and Response Plan outlines procedures for warned and unwarned emergencies that may occur at the plant.  Warned emergencies include adverse weather such as heavy snowstorms, or conditions that are reasonably predictable.  Unwarned emergencies usually consist of on-site emergencies such as a spill, fire/explosion, or a chemical release.  \n\nFacility description and regulated substances handled\n\nSinton Dairy Foods is a large domestic producer of dairy products.  The Sinton Dairy Foods Colorado Springs plant site covers approximately 8.5 acres within the Colorado Springs City limits.  It is located at 3801 North Sinton Road in Colorado Springs, El Paso County.\n\nThere are approximately 170 employees at the plant site, which are represented by the Teamsters Local 537 union organization. \n\nWe presently handle only one chemical that is considered hazardous by the EPA.  This substance is present in quantities greater than the threshold quantity identified by the RMP regulation and therefore is included in our risk management program.\n\n\u00d8 Ammonia (anhydrous)- Ammonia is used as a refrigerant at the plant.  It is received into the plant by truck, however deliveries of ammonia are infrequent.  One of the primary refrigeration vessels is the High Pressure Accumulator vessel. This vessel has a maximum inventory of 11,762 pounds that is controlled through administrative procedures.  The refrigeration system at the facility has a operating capacity of approximately 20,000 pounds (3,636 gallons) of anhydrous ammonia.\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis (worst-case & alternate-cases)\n\nThe RMP rule requirements for identification and selection of a worst"

Based on EPA defined Offsite Consequence Analysis (OCA) Guidance, Sinton Dairy Foods has one worst-case hazard scenario for the toxic material handled onsite.  This scenario is estimated to create the greatest distance in any direction to an EPA defined concentration (endpoint) resulting from an accidental release.\n\nSinton Dairy Foods worst-case toxic scenario involves anhydrous ammonia.  Ammonia is used as a refrigerant at the plant and is stored under pressure in a vessel located outside.  This vessel, the High Pressure Accumulator, may have a maximum of 11,762 pounds of liquid ammonia at any one time.  The scenario uses the EPA's theoretical assumption that the vessel catastrophically fails and liquid ammonia is released to the atmosphere.  It completely negates any mitigation attempts and assumes that all 11,762 pounds of ammonia can be spilled onto the ground and evaporated within 10 minutes to form a toxic vapor cloud that drifts offsite into the surrounding community.\n\nUsing the EPA's Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance Document, dated October 1998, to determine the greatest downwind distance, it was determined that an ammonia vapor cloud may extend 1.3 miles from the plant.  This calculation was based on the EPA recommended guide for ammonia.\n\nThe EPA rule also requires that alternate or more likely accident scenarios involving regulated chemical be identified.  Other more likely ammonia incidents were assessed at Sinton Dairy Foods using parameters prescribed in the RMP regulation.  The analysis of the alternate scenarios included mitigation affects from both passive and active safety systems.\n\nSinton Dairy Foods conducted an iterative assessment of several alternate or more likely scenarios.  From the various scenarios assessed, Sinton Dairy Foods selected the following:\n\n\u00d8 An inadvertent hose failure at a valve connection"

This failure assumes that 1,800 pounds of ammonia is released within a 10-minute period.  Evaporation of the liquid ammonia could result in the formation of a vapor cloud extending 0.11 miles (581 feet) from the site.\n\nAccidental release program & chemical-specific prevention steps\n\nAfter significant expansion of our facility's refrigeration capacity, ammonia inventories were increased at or above the threshold quantities established by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA).  This required the development of a Process Safety Management (PSM) program.\n\nThis prevention program was designed around mechanical integrity and training aspects.  The primary objective of the program was to ensure complete containment of ammonia through safe operation and maintenance of the refrigeration system.\n\nSinton Dairy Foods has completed 100% of its initial process hazard analyses (PHAs) of the ammonia refrigeration system.  A PHA was conducted in June 1999. Process hazard analysis of the ammonia system expansion is pending completion of applicable process safety information and is scheduled for later this year. \n\nThe PSM Coordinator is responsible for communicating the PHA recommendations to all affected employees.  The Safety & Health Department entered the recommendations into Sinton Dairy Foods PHA Recommendation Tracking database.  Monthly progress reports are continuously sent to management based on updates received from the departments responsible for addressing the recommendations.  \n\nFive year accident history\n\nSinton Dairy Foods has a very comprehensive Incident Reporting and Investigation procedural process.

Emergency preparedness is a vital part of the prevention program at Sinton Dairy Foods.  While we strive to adhere to the latest mechanical integrity and inherently safer technologies we continue to plan for the unplanned ammonia release.\n\nEmergency response efforts within the plant are conducted by the Colorado Springs Fire Department.  However, our maintenance staff is trained to quickly assess any hazardous release of ammonia and act as a communications resource to make notifications and provide pertinent information during an incident\n\n\nPlanned improvements to reduce risk\n\nThe location of the outside high-pressure ammonia receiver is in close proximity to motorized traffic.  This has been assessed as a potential release point if accidentally struck by vehicular traffic.  Modifications are underway to erect barricades to protect the receiver and its associated piping."
