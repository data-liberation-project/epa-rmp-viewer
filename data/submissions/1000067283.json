HSSEQ performance shall be an important element in the evaluation of employees and contractors.\"\n\n\n\nThe Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nThe EPA RMP regulation applies to Bay-Pol because of the quantities of titanium tetrachloride, butene, isobutane, and ethylene we safely handle in the production of high density polyethylene (HDPE).  Titanium tetrachloride is on the list of EPA toxic RMP materials and is used in the manufacturing of the catalyst used in our Bay 1 process.  Butene, isobutane, and ethylene are on the RMP flammables list.  Butene is added to the HDPE polymer as a comonomer to control density.  Isobutane is used as a solvent in the Bay 2 process.  Ethylene is used as the feedstock in both the Bay 1 and Bay 2 processes.  \n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\nBay-Pol has put a program in place to meet or exceed every requirement of the accidental release prevention provisions set forth in 40 CFR Part 68 by the EPA.  The facility was designed and constructed in accordance with applicable standards and industry best practices.  Processes at our facility are subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard under 29 CFR 1910.119.    The following sections briefly describe the main elements of the accidental release prevention program that are in place at our facility. \n\n\n\n1. Employee Participation - all employees at Bay-Pol are involved in our safety program.  Bay-Pol believes that process safety management and accident prevention are a team effort.  Company employees actively participate in accident prevention and development of our process safety management programs.  In addition, our employees have access to all information created as part of th"

Process Safety Information (PSI) - Bay-Pol maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with our processes.  The information is kept current and is available to all employees.\n\n\n\n3. Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) - Systems are in place to safely manage change as part of our process safety management program.   Comprehensive hazard reviews (where teams of employees examine potential hazards and develop ways to mitigate them) are performed to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled effectively.  The reviews are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at regular intervals.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed promptly.  \n\n\n\n4. Operating Procedures - In order to safely conduct activities at our facility, Bay-Pol maintains detailed written operating procedures.  These procedures cover initial plant startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  They describe the tasks we must perform, safe operating parameters that we must maintain, and safety precautions for operations and maintenance activities.  The procedures are reviewed regularly and are readily accessible to our Operators. \n\n\n\n5. Training - Bay-Pol has a formal training program to ensure that all employees who are operating processes are trained and tested in the operating procedures associated with these processes.   Refresher training is provided at least every three years and more frequently as needed.  During the training, each employee must demonstrate that they have the required knowledge, skills, and abilities to safely carry out their duties and responsibil"

Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of the contractor's safety performance is carried out.  Bay-Pol has a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related to the contractor's work and our processes.  Contractors are also informed of all of the emergency response procedures should an accidental release occur.  \n\n\n\n7. Pre-Startup Safety Review - Pre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at Bay-Pol.  These reviews are used to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup before ever placing equipment into operation.\n\n\n\n8. Mechanical Integrity - We have comprehensive preventive maintenance and mechanical integrity programs in place for the entire facility.  The program incorporates industry codes, procedures from federal and state regulations, and instructions provided by equipment manufacturers.

Due to our stringent prevention policies, there have been no releases of any RMP regulated chemicals at our facility that have had any impact on the community, the environment, or plant personnel.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nBay-Pol has a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials.  The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of regulatory agencies and the public, on and offsite monitoring, as well as post-incident clean up of any affected areas.  The emergency response plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within our processes that would require a modified emergency response.  We coordinate our emergency plan with the Southeast Regional LEPC, our facility's Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  Bay-Pol has been an active member of the LEPC since purchasing the plant in 1992.  The planning effort of the LEPC helps ensure our emergency plan is coordinated with that of the local municipalities.  \n\n\n\nTo quickly and effectively respond to emergencies at our facility, Bay-Pol maintains both a mobile aerial foam truck and a fast attack truck onsite.  The entire plant is surrounded by an underground firewater header that will supply firewater from our 1.2 million gallon firewater storage tank.  In addition, our firewater system is also tied into the fire water system of the neighboring plant. This serves both as a backup to our system and offers additional firewater capacity if needed.
