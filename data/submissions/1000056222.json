The chlorine from one-ton cylinders to disinfect treated wastewater. The hazard assessment was performed on the chlorination process using the United States Environmental Protection Agency(USEPA) RMP*Comp Model. The Facility\"s safety devices include chlorine leak detectors, alarms, a SCADA alarm system, and an automatic system shut-off feature triggered by a loss in system vacuum.                                                                                                                                                                   In order to fulfill the requirements of the Risk Management Program, the Facility has developed an accidental release prevention program and emergency action plan for the Facility. The accidentalrelease prevention program satisfies the requirements for the USEPA RMP. The prevention program ensures that the Facility is operated under safe conditions and that any risk of an accidental release of chlorine is minimized. The program has been written to reduce the potential of an accidental release due to human error, or equipment failure at the Facility. In order to help prevent the release of chlorine due to human error, the Facility's prevention program ensures that operating procedures are current and reviewed annually. Training also plays a vital partin the Facility's program. Employees and contractors working near or on the chlorination process are required to be trained in the chlorination process and the hazards of chlorine.

All chlorine cylinders are examined upon delivery and are rejected if there are any signs of damage. In addition, equipment pertaining to the chlorine process is visually inspected daily. The potential for a chlorine release is greatly reduced in the chlorination process due to the use of a vacuum system from the point of chlorine withdrawal to its point of application. In the event that there is a failure in chlorination equipment, the system will shut down (i.e. failsafe).                          All existing and proposed future chlorination equipment have been designed according to applicable standards and codes. The Facility maintains records and documentation on equipment inspection and tests. Precautions are taken to ensure that new equipment and processes are inspected and tested, that all changes on the process are authorized, and employees are informed of changes.                                                                                                                                                                         The Facility performed a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) to address the hazards in the chlorination process and to evaluate and control where the potential for a chlorine release exists. Employees were involved in determining hazards of the process and subsequent consequences. The chlorination processwas found to be operating safely.
