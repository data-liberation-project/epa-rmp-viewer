The plant processes various pork, beef and animal by-products into high-quality Sausage and Ham products.  This facility was not currently subject to the Environmental Protection Agency's Risk Management Program rules under the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990.  However, Wimmer's anticipates with a planned expansion of facility and additional refrigeration equipment they will exceed the threshold RQ for ammonia.\n\n\n\nThe Risk Management Program rules require facilities handling threshold amounts of certain chemical substances to submit Risk Management Plans for the prevention of accidental releases of these substances.  The plan submission to include hazard assessments defining possible off-site impacts of certain regulated substance release scenarios, a five-year accident history, description of the facilities accidental release prevention program, and an emergency response program. \n\n\n\nThe following is the Executive Summary of the Risk Management Plan for Wimmer's Meat Products, West Point, NE.\n\n\n\nFacility Snapshot\n\nThis facility, was constructed in 1940, was owned and operated by Ocoma Foods prior to Wimmer's acquisition of the plant in 1957.  The plant produces more than 7 million pounds of product annually.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImpact on the community\n\n* Wimmer's employs 125 area residents at a combined annual salary of approximately $3 million.\n\n* Wimmer's supports the city of West Point and the State of Nebraska with state and local taxes.\n\n* The facility purchases more than $325,000 of local services; electricity, natural gas, water, wastewater treatment, and other miscellaneous items.\n\n\n\n\n\nEmployee snapshot\n\nWimmer's employees are involved in community activities.  The facility supports the United Way, American Cancer Society, Regional Blood Bank, Volunteer Fire and Rescue, and other "

Prevention of accidental releases is critical to the safe operation of this plant, to the safety of its employees, and to the safety of the general public.\n\n\n\nTo achieve its goals of accident and accidental release prevention, the facility is committed to the following:\n\n* A knowledgeable and highly trained and motivated employee group\n\n* A well designed facility that is maintained and operated in a superior manner\n\n* Improvements that enhance safety and accident prevention where appropriate\n\n* Excellence in safety programs and practices; a superior safety and accident record\n\n* Preparation and training for emergency response and mitigation\n\n\n\nThe plant has a written Emergency Response Plan in effect.  Wimmer's Meat Products is committed to responding to and mitigating any accidental releases to minimize the impact to employees, the community, and environment.  The response plan is coordinated with the Local Emergency Planning Committee, Emergency Response Agencies and the plant has interacted with possible responding agencies regarding the plan and activities at the plant.  Employees are trained in the implementation of the plan and in possible response activities that could be required in the event of an emergency.  The plant has developed a Hazardous Materials Team made up of plant employees who are trained to respond in the event of an ammonia release on site.\n\n\n\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nAmmonia refrigeration is covered by the EPA Risk Management Plan rule.\n\n\n\nThe facility will maintain an inventory of 18,000 pounds or less of ammonia on site which is used as a refrigerant in its ammonia refrigeration system.

The threshold limit for regulatory implementation of program is 10,000 lbs of ammonia.  Wimmer's plant has been operating below the threshold limit prior to the addition at the facility which will be operating soon.\n\n\n\n\n\nSynopsis of Worst-Case and Alternate Release Scenarios\n\nThe Risk Management rule requires a hazard analysis for worst-case and alternate release scenarios for regulated substances present in threshold quantities at the site.  For this facility Ammonia Anhydrous is the only regulated hazardous substance.  \n\n\n\nThe Risk Management rule requires that the largest amount in a single vessel be considered the release quantity for the worst-case event, unless smaller quantities handled at different conditions result in a greater distance to the regulated endpoint of consideration.  This is a requirement of the rule regardless of whether the event is likely, or, could even reasonably occur.   It should be emphasized that the possibility of such an event as described by the worst-case scenario is extremely low. \n\n \n\nAlternate scenarios, for each regulated toxic and flammable substance, which are more likely events, must also be presented.  More likely release events tend to concentrate in areas such as failure of smaller valves, lines, and hoses. Significantly lower quantities are involved and operator intervention would tend to mitigate and limit the consequences of such failures.\n\n\n\nWorst-Case Toxic Release - Ammonia\n\nThe largest vessel, located indoors, has a maximum capacity of  8,710 pounds.  The worst case scenario assumes that this entire amount would release in 10 minutes, as a result of a catastrophic failure of the tank.  The worst-case scenario would reach offsite endpoints, including public and environmental receptors.\n\n\n\nAlternate Release Toxics - Ammonia\n\nThis alternate release scenario consists of a pipe leak, which discharges 1,300 pounds of"

Once the RQ of 10,000 lbs is maintained the facility will fall under the EPA Risk Management Rule, these are Program Level 3 processes.

Employees receive annual training in the response plan and also receive various safety training, both in general, and in the competencies relative to their required roles in the plan.  Periodically, the plan is practiced in a table top, classroom type setting, and also drilled in mock emergencies including participation by outside responding agencies.\n\n\n\n\n\n5-Year Accident History\n\nThe Risk Management rule requires inclusion of the five-year accident history of the facility for all accidental releases that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.  \n\nThe Wimmer's Meat plant has had no significant releases in the past five years.  During this same period they have upgraded approximately 90% of the mechanical refrigeration system to meet both personal safety and food safety goals.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes for Safety Improvements\n\nSafety improvements are a continual and ongoing process at the plant, facilitated by the EPA Prevention Program and OSHA Process Safety Management Program.  Formal process hazard analysis is conducted at least every five years, but review is constant through management of change procedures, operator training, incident investigation, and mechanical integrity programs.  Wimmer's Meat Products has contracted with third party contractors to assist with implementation Process Safety Management and Risk Management Programs.  As a result, changes relevant to safety occur continuously, as needs are identified through these procedures and policies.\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n"
