The plant processes various pork, beef and animal by-products into high-quality Sausage and Ham products.  This facility was not currently subject to the Environmental Protection Agency's Risk Management Program rules under the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990.  However, Wimmer's anticipates with a planned expansion of facility and additional refrigeration equipment they will exceed the threshold RQ for ammonia.\r\n\r\nThe Risk Management Program rules require facilities handling threshold amounts of certain chemical substances to submit Risk Management Plans for the prevention of accidental releases of these substances.  The plan submission to include hazard assessments defining possible off-site impacts of certain regulated substance release scenarios, a five-year accident history, description of the facilities accidental release prevention program, and an emergency response program. \r\n\r\nThe following is the Executive Summary of the Risk Management Plan for Wimmer's Meat Products, West Point, NE.\r\n\r\nFacility Snapshot\r\nThis facility, was constructed in 1940, was owned and operated by Ocoma Foods prior to Wimmer's acquisition of the plant in 1957.

Prevention of accidental releases is critical to the safe operation of this plant, to the safety of its employees, and to the safety of the general public.\r\n\r\nTo achieve its goals of accident and accidental release prevention, the facility is committed to the following:\r\n* A knowledgeable and highly trained and motivated employee group\r\n* A well designed facility that is maintained and operated in a superior manner\r\n* Improvements that enhance safety and accident prevention where appropriate\r\n* Excellence in safety programs and practices; a superior safety and accident record\r\n* Preparation and training for emergency response and mitigation\r\n\r\nThe plant has a written Emergency Response Plan in effect.

The threshold limit for regulatory implementation of program is 10,000 lbs of ammonia.  Wimmer's plant has been operating below the threshold limit prior to the addition at the facility which will be operating soon.\r\n\r\n\r\nSynopsis of Worst-Case and Alternate Release Scenarios\r\nThe Risk Management rule requires a hazard analysis for worst-case and alternate release scenarios for regulated substances present in threshold quantities at the site.  For this facility Ammonia Anhydrous is the only regulated hazardous substance.  \r\n\r\nThe Risk Management rule requires that the largest amount in a single vessel be considered the release quantity for the worst-case event, unless smaller quantities handled at different conditions result in a greater distance to the regulated endpoint of consideration.  This is a requirement of the rule regardless of whether the event is likely, or, could even reasonably occur.   It should be emphasized that the possibility of such an event as described by the worst-case scenario is extremely low. \r\n \r\nAlternate scenarios, for each regulated toxic and flammable substance, which are more likely events, must also be presented.  More likely release events tend to concentrate in areas such as failure of smaller valves, lines, and hoses. Significantly lower quantities are involved and operator intervention would tend to mitigate and limit the consequences of such failures.\r\n\r\nWorst-Case Toxic Release - Ammonia\r\nThe largest vessel, located indoors, has a maximum capacity of  8,710 pounds.  The worst case scenario assumes that this entire amount would release in 10 minutes, as a result of a catastrophic failure of the tank.  The worst-case scenario would reach offsite endpoints, including public and environmental receptors.\r\n\r\nAlternate Release Toxics - Ammonia\r\nThis alternate release scenario consists of a pipe leak, which discharges 1,300 pounds of"
