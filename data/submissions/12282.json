Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nAusimont USA has developed and currently markets a family of fluorine based products that are noted for their exceptional resistance to chemical agents and environments which attack and degrade other materials.  Produced at the Thorofare, NJ facility are various grades of HYLAR. PVDF, which are used in the formulation of corrosion resistant coatings for aluminum and steel as well as long-life decorative finishes on building panels.  The Thorofare plant, which became fully operational in 1985 and was purchased by Ausimont USA in 1990, was the world's first PVDF manufacturing facility to gain ISO 9002 certification.\n\nIn our processes, we use the following chemicals that are covered by the EPA's RMP regulations:\n\nToxics\n\nChlorine is used at Ausimont as a catalyst in the manufacture of Vinylidene Fluoride (VF2), which is used to produce Polyvinylidene Fluoride (PVDF).  Chlorine is stored in railcars and is fed directly to the process. \n\nHydrogen Fluoride is used at Ausimont as a raw material in the manufacture of Vinylidene Fluoride (VF2), which is used to produce Polyvinylidene Fluoride (PVDF).  Hydrogen fluoride is offloaded from railcars into storage tanks located in the process area.\n\nFlammables\n\nVinylidene Fluoride (VF2) is produced at our facility and is either used to produce Polyvinylidene Fluoride (PVDF) or sold. \n\nOur accidental release prevention programs and our contingency planning efforts help us effectively manage the hazards that are posed to our employees, the public, and the environment by our use of these chemicals.\n\n3. Offsite Consequence Analysis Scenarios\n\nEPA's RMP rule requires that we provide information about the worst-case release scenarios and alternative release scenarios for our facility.
