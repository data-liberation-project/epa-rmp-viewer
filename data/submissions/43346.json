ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY POLICIES\n\nThe City of Tallahassee\u00bfs Arvah B. Hopkins Electric Generating Station (Hopkins Power Plant) recognizes management's responsibility in protecting its employees, equipment, property, citizens, and the environment.  The safety and health of all personnel and the community are of paramount  importance.  The control of accidents has been and will continue to be a basic responsibility of all personnel in the facility.\n\nThe Hopkins Power Plant Process Safety Management (PSM) / Risk Management Plan (RMP) program assigns and documents the specific responsibilities for developing, implementing, and integrating the requirements of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration\u00bfs PSM program and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency\u00bfs RMP standards into its safety program.  The Hopkins Power Plant PSM/RMP program focuses its attention on making PSM/RMP the way we manage our ammonia based processing operations.\n\nThe Hopkins Power Plant understands that employee participation is the key to a successful program.  Operating level employees, particularly the ammonia system and the aqua ammonia system operators, have been deeply involved in the development and implementation of the PSM/RMP program and they assume the major responsibility for operating safely.\n\n2.  STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nThe Hopkins Power Plant produces power primarily from the combustion of clean burning natural gas and fuel oil.  The Hopkins Power Plant operates two separate ammonia processes which are used to increase operating efficiency and to reduce the amount of pollutants discharged to the atmosphere.  These process include:  (1) an enclosed ammonia refrigeration system designed to chill inlet air to the combustion turbines, and (2) a system for injecting aqua ammonia into stack gases to reduce concentrations of NOx and other air p"

SUMMARY OF WORST CASE AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nSection \u00a768.25 of the RMP regulation defines a worst-case scenario as a release of the largest quantity of a regulated substance from a vessel or process line failure that results in the greatest distance to a specified endpoint of 200 parts per million (ERPG-2). \n\nPlease refer to the on-site documentation for the off-site consequence/hazard assessment data.\n\n4.  DESCRIPTION OF THE HOPKINS POWER PLANT ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe Hopkins Power Plant conducts triennial PSM/RMP audits of the entire program to identify strengths and potential weaknesses, and make improvements if necessary.  The Hopkins Power Plant considers the PSM/RMP manuals to be living documents that must be updated and revised regularly to maintain their effectiveness and viability.\n\nThe Hopkins Power Plant emphasizes and insists on employee participation from the chilled water system and the aqua ammonia system operators in all aspects of the development, implementation, and integration of their PSM/RMP program.\n\nThe Hopkins Power Plant provides comprehensive training in safe work practices, ammonia and aqua ammonia properties, standard operating procedures, emergency response, aqua system and chiller system processes, and PSM/RMP principles.\n\nThe Hopkins Power Plant maintains a pro-active open-door policy toward neighbors and concerned community citizens.  Facility tours and risk management discussions are scheduled and conducted upon written requests.\n\n5.  FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT RELEASE HISTORY\n\nThe aqua injection system and the chilled water systems are both new so there have been no releases of ammonia or aqua ammonia that have resulted in an injury, or that had an off-site impact, or that resulted in significant property damage either on-site or off-site.\n\n6.  EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe Hopkins Power Plant emergency response policies have been designed to comply with all applicable federal, state an"

In the event of a spill, the Hopkins Power Plant Emergency Response Team will react with the proper actions, as listed in the Emergency Response Plan, in association with the local fire department and emergency responders.\n\n7.  PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThe Hopkins Power Plant PSM/RMP program is a set of living documents and procedures that will require on-going attention, development, and revision to ensure that safety remains second nature.\n\nThe Hopkins Power Plant expects to improve safety performance by, among other things, emphasizing the following elements of their PSM/RMP program:\n\n(1)  Employee participation is the key to a successful program.  Both the managers and system operators are deeply involved in identifying and understanding the process and instrumentation diagrams, developing and updating the standard operating procedures, and performing the documented preventative maintenance inspections.\n\n(2)  The Hopkins Power Plant PSM/RMP program is: (a) computer based, (b) user friendly, (c) includes one-on-one involvement with specified and qualified trainers, (d) written to minimize paperwork and maximize documentation, and (e) written to be understood and used by the operating level employees.\n\n(3)  All recommendations developed during the process hazards analysis were designed to improve the safety performance of the Hopkins Power Plant ammonia refrigeration and aqua ammonia injection systems.  The Hopkins Power Plant expects to evaluate each recommendation in a timely manner and implement, as soon a practical, those recommendations that will reduce the possibility of release and/or mitigate the consequences of an unintentional release."
