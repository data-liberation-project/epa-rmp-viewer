      "SummaryText": "The Cedar Rapids Water Department is responsible for providing safe, high quality drinking water in sufficient quantities and at pressure levels necessary to meet the residential, commercial, industrial and fire protection needs of the community.  The J Avenue Water Treatment Plant is located on approximately five acres in the northeastern quadrant of Cedar Rapids. Administration, operations, and maintenance buildings provide the support and control functions for the water treatment processes.  The plant was originally built in 1929 with a design capacity of 12 million gallons per day (mgd).  A number of major and minor improvements have been made to the plant over the years and the current capacity is 45 mgd.\n\nThe J Avenue Water Treatment Plant is designed and operated to maintain compliance with the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA).  Federal and state requirements are defined in a Public Water Supply Operating Permit.  Disinfection is required at all surface water supplies and at any groundwater supply under the direct influence of surface water. \n\nChlorine is added to the water as a disinfecting agent to kill disease-causing organisms and to help insure the continued microbiological safety of the water as it reaches the customer?s tap.  Trace amounts of ammonia are added to the water that reacts with chlorine to form chloramines as part of the disinfection process called chloramination.\n\nAll chlorine ton-containers are stored in the Chlorination Room.  All unopened containers in the Chlorine Container Room are stored with their protective domes on. The Chlorination Room is normally unmanned but operators visit the area daily and respond to any trouble alarms that may occur.  \n\nThe general Water Department?s accidental release prevention program is based on the following key elements: (1) high level of training of the operators, (2) preventive maintenance program, (3) use of process and safety equipment, (4) use of accurate and effective operating procedures, (5) pe"

      "SummaryText": "rformance of a hazard review of equipment and procedures, and (6) implementation of an auditing and inspection program.\n\nChemical-specific prevention steps include the availability of respiratory protection devices [an air purifying (APR) is worn by mechanics during the connection / disconnection of chlorine ton-containers and a self contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) is available for emergency use], awareness of the hazardous and toxic properties of chlorine, and the presence of chlorine detectors throughout the Chlorination Room.   Chlorine gas monitors continually check for chlorine gas leaks and each chlorine container in service is equipped with an automatic valve shutoff device that can be activated remotely by operators to cut off gas supply in the event of a leak.  The Chlorine Container Room itself is vented to a scrubber system that can neutralize chlorine gas in the event of a gas leak in the room.\n\nNo accidental releases of chlorine have occurred at the J Avenue Water Treatment Plant in the past five years that had any off-site impacts.\n\nThe Water Department has an emergency response program, which has been coordinated with the City of Cedar Rapids Fire Department, which is a member of the Linn County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  The Cedar Rapids Fire Department Hazardous Materials (HAZMAT) Response Team periodically conducts training and drills in responding to a chlorine ton-container leak.  A Chlorine Institute Emergency ?B? Kit, which includes the necessary tools and equipment for repairing ton container leaks, is available on-site for use by the HAZMAT Team.  The Cedar Rapids Fire Department also has an agreement for mutual aid and assistance with the City of Marion Fire Department."
