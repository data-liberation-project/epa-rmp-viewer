ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES AT THE STATIONARY SOURCE\r\n\r\nCorporate policy is to comply with all applicable regulatory requirements, including those for accidental release prevention and emergency response.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\r\n\r\na. PRIMARY ACTIVITIES: This facility is a waste coal-fired, electric-power generating station.\r\n\r\nB. USE OF REGULATED SUBSTANCES\r\n\r\nThe aqueous ammonia injection system at Seward Station is designed to remove NOx from boiler flue gas by SNCR.  This is accomplished by injecting ammonia and water solution into the flue gas.\r\n\r\nNo other toxic or flammable materials are currently stored at the facility in quantities above the regulatory threshold.\r\n\r\nC. QUANTITIES HANDLED OR STORED \r\n\r\nThe aqueous ammonia system is comprised of two 15,000-gallon storage tanks, pumps, and piping, instrumentation and controls.  The storage tanks are in a concrete diked area for secondary containment.  Tanker truck unloading area is also provided with secondary containment.   \r\n\r\n\r\n3. THE WORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO AND THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO\r\n\r\na. WORST CASTE RELEASE SCENARIO\r\n\r\nTwo 15,000-gallon tanks are used to store aqueous ammonia.  The WCS assumes that the entire contents of one ammonia tank is spilled into the common secondary containment area over time.  The WCS can include the effects of passive mitigation systems, and for Seward Station this is the use of secondary containment to minimize ammonia liquid spills.  The potential quantity released is calculated as:\r\n\r\n15,000 gallons * 7.48 lb/gal = 112,200 lb\r\n\r\nPer EPA guidance, because the horizontal surface area of the secondary containment system (990 ft2) is less than that of the worst-case liquid pool (no secondary containment, one-centimeter deep pool) the rate at which the material is released is"

DISTANCE TO ENDPOINT: The offsite consequences of this accidental release were evaluated with a screening computer dispersion model (RMP*Comp, version 1.07).  Offsite consequence analysis of the worst-case scenario must include the following weather conditions: a wind speed of 1.5 m/s (3.4 mph), F atmospheric stability class, a temperature of 77\u00b0F, and relative humidity of 50%. An urban setting was used to model the dispersion created by the surrounding power plant structures.\r\n\r\nThe maximum calculated distances to the endpoint using the RMP*Comp model is 0.1 miles for the worst-case scenarios for aqueous ammonia.  This represents the maximum downwind distance that the catastrophic release (under worst-case weather conditions) could pose a hazard to the public.  There are no public or environmental receptors in the impact area.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\n\r\nThere are many safety programs in place at the station to minimize the potential for the accidental releases of ammonia considered by this plan.  For example:\r\n\r\n   (1) The ammonia storage tanks are registered pressure vessels that are built to exacting standards.\r\n\r\n   (2) Ammonia tank trucks will only be unloaded during daylight hours on weekdays.\r\n\r\n   (3) Excess flow valves will be mounted on all storage tank liquid lines.\r\n\r\n\r\n5. FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY: No accidents as defined in 40 CFR Part 68 have occurred during the past five years at this site.\r\n\r\n\r\n6. THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM : In the unlikely event that an accidental release of ammonia would occur, the station has prepared a detailed written emergency response plan.  This plan has been in place for many years, and yearly drills are held to test the plan under simulated conditions.\r\n\r\n\r\n7. PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY: All station safety programs, including the emergency response program, are"

      "SummaryText": "INTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nNRG Energy operates a waste coal-fired, electric power generating station located near Seward, East Wheatfield Township, Indiana County, Pennsylvania. This 296-acre facility, known as Seward Station, is located 7 miles northwest of Johnstown, PA, and 14 miles southeast of Indiana, PA near state route 56 and US route 22.  \r\n\r\nSeward station employs approximately 86 full-time staff and a considerable number of contract employees, including approximately 46 employees of SOLLCO (a subsidiary of Robindale Energy Services, Inc.), which operates and maintains the materials-handling system.  The secondary economic impact of the facility on its many material and services suppliers is significant.  \r\n\r\nSeward Station operates two circulating fluidized bed (CFB) boilers that supply steam to one steam turbine generator for the production of electricity. The fuel used at the plant consists of of waste coal from boney piles of low-grade bituminous coal.  At the station's full capacity of 525 megawatts (MW), the station consumes approximately 480 tons of fuel per hr. \r\n\r\nSulfur Dioxide (SO2) emissions are controlled through the use of limestone, as a sorbent, in the CFB system. In order for SO2 absorption to occur, and to minimize thermal NOx formation, the CFB bed temperature is maintained between 1,550F and 1,580F. Approximately 90% of the SO2 formed during fuel combustion is captured internally by the calcium oxide generated by the calcination of the limestone in the CFB combustors. NOx air emissions are further controlled by the use of selective non-catalytic reduction (SNCR), which involves injecting an aqueous ammonia solution into the combustion gas.  SO2 air emissions are further controlled through the use of a flash dry absorber (FDA), which integrates flue gas desulfurization (FGD) processes to achieve 95% SO2 removal efficiency, independent of the fuel's sulfur content. Downstream of the CFB combustors are two fabric filter baghouses for controlling pa"
