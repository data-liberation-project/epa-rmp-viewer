      "SummaryText": "Altavista Power Station (AVPS) is an electric power generation plant. The facility includes two biomass-fired stoker boilers, each equipped with selective non-catalytic reduction (SCNR) and an overfire air system for the reduction of nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions. In the SCNR process, nitrogen oxide emissions are reduced by chemical reaction with ammonia whereby nitrogen oxides are transformed into nitrogen and water. The ammonia used in the SCNR process is anhydrous ammonia.\n\nLiquid anhydrous ammonia is stored and used at the facility. The tank, piping system, and safety devices are designed and constructed to comply with federal codes and regulations. All tank process connections are equipped with internally mounted excess flow valves and a check valve on the liquid fill line. The liquid fill line and vapor return lines at the truck unloading station are equipped with emergency shutoff valves (Snappy Joe valves). All these valves act to minimize or stop the flow of vapor and liquid should a line leak or rupture occur. The tank is enclosed by a concrete containment dike and equipped with chemical sensors to detect ammonia releases. The tank is also equipped with other safety devices: pressure relief valves for overpressure protection; a water deluge system to minimize a vapor release; an overpressure alarm system; emergency shut-off valves; and pressure, temperature, and level indicators. The tank working pressure is normally between 78 and 82 psig, with a liquid vaporizer to help maintain pressure.\n\nAVPS has maintained a strong safety and accidental release prevention program. The facility\u0092s ammonia storage and handling system is subject to OSHA\u0092s Process Safety Management (PSM) requirements. AVPS operating procedures are written and followed with specific detail for safely conducting activities involving the unloading, storage, and handling of anhydrous ammonia. In addition, each employee involved in operating the ammonia process is further trained in emergency"

      "SummaryText": "operations. Station personnel strictly adhere to the written maintenance procedures to ensure the mechanical and functional integrity of the tank, piping system, and emergency shutdown systems. These activities include periodic inspections, testing, and replacement of parts consistent with the manufacturer\u0092s recommendations, applicable codes & standards, and good engineering practices. Any changes to the ammonia process or equipment are managed with a detailed Management of Change process which includes engineering, safety, process hazard, and environmental reviews to ensure any change meets or exceeds the various requirements, and to ensure all related documentation is revised as appropriate. AVPS has taken great care to ensure the anhydrous ammonia system is properly designed, maintained, and operated. As a result, AVPS has had no reportable accidents related to the ammonia system.\n\nAVPS has an emergency response program that has been coordinated with Campbell County Public Safety, which oversees the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC). In the event of an emergency release, the program includes immediate notification of local responding agencies, state and federal agencies, plant management, and the ammonia supplier (as appropriate). The program also includes evacuation and leak isolation procedures.\n\nThere have been no reportable accidents involving this system over the last 5 years.\n\nThe PSM standard requires periodic audits and inspections to be performed to identify changes to improve safety. These changes are evaluated and implemented as required by the regulation."
