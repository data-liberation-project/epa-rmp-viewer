Rinchem management has opted to contract emergency response for releases of these chemicals by containing the spill when it can be safely done and using contracted services for spill cleanup. The Flemington warehouse Emergency Action Program consists of: Emergency Action Plan, Environmental Safety Health Reporting Procedure and Emergency Evacuation Plan.  The Emergency Action Program outlines the instructions and required information in order to respond to fire, chemical spills, natural disasters and other emergencies that may arise.
