      "SummaryText": "The Risk Management Plan(RMP) was developed to comply with the Clean Air Act R112(CAA) which takes effect on June 21,1999. The act requires all industrial plants that have extremely hazardous chemicals over the threshold limit to have a plan that addresses the safe handling and use of these chemicals. This plan is to be provided to all local,state,and federal regulatory agencies. The immediate neighbors of these industrial plants would then have access to these plans and be aware of what could happen if an industrial spill occurred. The Acts intent was to make the users of these chemicals more aware of the safe handling and use through planning. It also wanted the neighbors to be aware and provide input to these plans so they would feel safer living next to these plants.\n\nHazardous Release Scenario\nManatee County Water Treatment Plant is a conventional water plant that provides coagulation,settling and disenfection for treatment. Chlorine and Ammonia are used during treatment and are considered extremely hazardous. Only chlorine is stored on-site over the reportable threshold(Section 304 of SARA Title lll).\n\nNormally,there are full and empty one-ton chlorine containers in an open sided building at the southwest side of the plant. A maximum of 20 one-ton containers are kept. The delivery system is designed to operate with a minimum chance of a accidental release.The tanks in use are positioned in a 'U' shape fashion,three one-ton containers on each arm of the 'U'. All are connected to the chlorine manifold at the same time.But only one container is opened and used at any time.The remaining containers are valved closed until the open container is emptied.Then,one of the full closed containers is opened and the valve for the emptied container is closed.The mainfold piping is only pressurized to the evaporators about 5 feet.A vacuum is maintained from the evaporators to the chlorinators,a distance of about 35 feet.Any break in the in the manifold vacuum line would immed"
