The management and employees of the Atlanta facility are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of Propane and/or Acetylene.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities to mitigate the release and minimize the impact of the release to the community and the environment.\n\nThe facility's primary operation is the storage and distribution of Propane and Acetylene.  Acetylene is stored at the facility in pressurized cylinders of various sizes, the largest being the 24-pound cylinders.  The maximum amount of acetylene on site at any one time is 20,000 pounds.  Propane is stored at the facility in two (2) 1,000-gallon bulk tanks (4,400 pounds of propane gas per vessel at maximum capacity) and in various sized cylinders.  The maximum amount of propane on-site at the facility is 30,000 pounds in bulk storage and various sized cylinders.\n\nAirgas South manages the safety of the regulated processes by means of operating procedures, equipment testing and inspections, safety devices (e.g. alarms, shutdowns, instrumentation, relief devices) inherent in the design of the facility and other controls and systems designed to prevent accidental release of hazardous chemicals. Safe work practices and training of our personnel supplement the inherent safe design of the plant.\n\nOur emergency response program is based upon OSHA's HAZWOPER regulation. The emergency response plan includes procedures for the notification of the local fire authority and Hazardous materials unit so that the appropriate measures can be taken by the local emergency responders to control accidental releases.  This document has been prepared in accordance with the EPA's RMP regulation (40 CFR, part 68). The substances and processes considered during the preparation of this RM"

This facility was designed and constructed to comply with applicable state and industry codes.\n\nThere have been no accidents involving or accidental releases of product that have resulted in deaths, injuries, or property damage on site, or known off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.  At this site, employees are trained to recognize emergencies and initiate emergency response from outside agencies.  The facility has an Emergency response plan which has been integrated with the local community Emergency Response Plan.  All employees and contractors are trained in the plan prior to commencement of work.  The Emergency Plan is tested and critiqued twice a year to insure that it is current.\n"
