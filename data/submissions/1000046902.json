Gerber is committed to performing \"Due Diligence\", which means taking all reasonable care to protect the health and safety of its employees, the community and the environment. This is especially true when it comes to chemical use and safety, including our PSM / RMP process for Anhydrous Ammonia for our refrigeration system.\n\n\n\nGerber has, and continues, to take steps to ensure we move forward as a World Class manufacturing facility. These steps include:\n\n\n\nDeveloping Health, Safety and Environmental policies, procedures, programs, rules and regulations.\n\n\n\nImplementing policies in the facility with the commitment of senior management and involvement of our workers.\n\n\n\nEnsuring that Emergency Response procedures are developed, trained and adhered to at all levels of the organization, including our:\n\n\n\n?    Hazardous Materials Team, for responding to potential leaks or spills of hazardous chemicals.\n\n?    NEM team, (Nestle Emergency Management), for understanding, managing, communicating, documenting and reporting potential adverse issues.\n\n\n\nPlanning for contingencies through:\n\n?    Compliance with legislation\n\n?    Involvement of our employees at all levels\n\n?    Training and development of employees\n\n?    Preventive maintenance programs\n\n?    Understanding and reducing potential risks through development of risk portfolios\n\n?    Identification of process hazards and implementation of controls to eliminate or control these hazards with the use of ZHA, (Zurich Hazard Analysis).\n\n\n\nOur Facility and the Regulated Substances Handled:\n\n\n\nGerber Products Company, Fort Smith, is the premier manufacturer of baby food, including wet, jarred fruits, vegetables and meats, meat sticks and dry cere"

We have our own maintenance, boiler room, waste water treatment, warehouse / shipping and refrigeration departments.\n\n\n\nOne independent \"covered process\" is present at the facility and has been identified based upon federal RMP regulations.  It is called \"Ammonia System 2\" because it replaced an older system in 2009, which was subsequently removed.  \n\n\n\nManagement activities are required under the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program for Accidental Release Prevention (40 CFR 68.15).  Our refrigeration department utilizes anhydrous ammonia (the only PSM / RMP regulated substance on-site) to maintain required temperatures for storage of raw ingredient materials.  At Gerber, Fort Smith, the SHE Manager has overall responsibility for the development, implementation, and integration of the RMP program elements into the facility's safety program. The SHE department is part of the site NEM team.\n\n\n\nWhile the site SHE Manger has overall responsibility for implementation of the RMP, the PSM, an integral part of our RMP, is overseen by a team comprised of our Utility\n\nManager, Ammonia Refrigeration Technicians and the SHE Mgr. The individuals on this team have the responsibility for performing the duties that are detailed in the Fort Smith Plant's Process Safety Management Program.\n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-specific Prevention Steps:\n\n\n\nAnticipating and managing risk is an essential element of doing business today, particularly for companies that manufacture, store, process and / or transport potentially harmful chemical substances. Safety is a priority at all Nestle Corporation facilities, including Gerber, Fort Smith, where emergency planning and preparation are a fundamental part of our business.\n\n\n\nOur Risk Management Planning, (RMP), considers such factors as:\n\n?    The potential effects of chemical releases;\n\n?    The five-year history of a facility's accidental chemical releases;\n\n?    The facility's prog"
