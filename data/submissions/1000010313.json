SDSD operates two wastewater treatment plants (referred to hereafter as the ?North Plant? and ?South Plant?) located in West Bountiful (North Plant) and North Salt Lake (South Plant) in Davis County, Utah.  The North American Industrial Classification System code for the wastewater treatment facilities is 221320, Sewage Treatment Facilities.  SDSD operates in accordance with all applicable federal, state and local environmental and health and safety regulations and is committed to maintaining compliance with these regulations.  SDSD has implemented emergency response procedures at the facility in coordination with local emergency response agencies. \n\nThe North plant treats approximately 6 million gallons of wastewater per day (mgd) with a capacity of 12 mgd. The South plant treats approximately 3 mgd with a total capacity of approximately 4 mgd. Both plants use chlorine to disinfect treated wastewater, and sulfur dioxide to dechlorinate the effluent.  The amount of chlorine and sulfur dioxide used in the chlorination and dechlorination processes at both plants exceed the threshold quantities (TQ) as defined by the U.S. Environmental Protections Agency?s Risk Management Programs (RMP) and Occupational Safety and Health Administration?s Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations. PSM regulations define the TQ for chlorine and sulfur dioxide as 1,500 pounds and 1,000 pounds. RMP regulations define the TQ for chlorine and sulfur dioxide as 2,500 pounds and 5,000 pounds.\n\nThe RMP/PSM regulations require proactive identification, evaluation and mitigation or prevention of chemical releases that could occur because of failures in processes, procedures, or equipment.

This document describes the procedures, training, engineering controls and emergency response procedures implemented by SDSD to prevent or minimize the release of hazardous chemicals from its covered processes. \n\nIt is the policy of SDSD that the receipt, storage and handling of chlorine and sulfur dioxide be done in a manner that meets regulatory requirements and minimizes the probability and severity of accidental releases of chlorine and/or sulfur dioxide into the atmosphere, in order to protect the health and safety of its workers, the public and the environment.  In order to accomplish this goal, SDSD has performed the following tasks:\n\n?    Gathered safety information on the process, equipment and procedures involving chlorine and sulfur dioxide; \n?    Performed a structured process hazard analysis (PHA) and evaluated external events that might affect the process; \n?    Performed an off-site consequences analysis of defined release scenarios; \n?    Established a written program for prevention and mitigation of accidental releases; and \n?    Established a written emergency action plan coordinated with emergency response agencies.\n\nAn integral part of the RMP/PSM program is the completion of a PHA of the facility?s storage and use of chlorine and sulfur dioxide.  The PHA was conducted using a hazards and operability (HAZOP) study.  An independent consultant directed a team composed of SDSD personnel with detailed knowledge of the process, through the HAZOP study.  All persons involved with the PHAs are identified in the documentation provided in Appendix E of this plan. The objective of the study was to identify potential deviations from normal operating parameters of the process, causes for these de"

The team used a relative risk ranking based on the probability and severity of the hazards to assign a hazard category to each identified deviation.  A What If? analysis was also performed as part of the PHA to evaluate other circumstances or outside influences beyond the control of the system operators and maintenance personnel.  The PHA/HAZOP study team evaluated these influences and discussed their possible consequences.  For each consequence, the team presented and/or developed a mitigating action to address such occurrences.\n\nAll of the improvements and mitigation measures identified in the PHA that SDSD has committed to accomplish have been completed or are in progress.  Any other measures identified by employees, during workplace hazard surveys or because of audit activities, will be thoroughly reviewed and considered for implementation.\n\nAt the time of this report, SDSD has updated their program to comply with the RMP/PSM requirements.  SDSD is committed to reviewing and updating the program periodically, as appropriate, and maintaining compliance with regulatory requirements.  This RMP/PSM plan complies with all applicable regulations, and is accessible to all interested employees and contractors, at all times.  SDSD has been proactive in developing and implementing the RMP/PSM for the North and South Plants, not only to comply with state and federal requirements, but also as a commitment to workplace and public safety as a top priority. \n\n\n\nCertification Statement\nAs the General Manager of South Davis Sewer District, I certify that the following document is SDSD's Risk Management Program and describes our current operations and best efforts for preventing and planning for emergency releases of chlorine and sulfur dioxide.
