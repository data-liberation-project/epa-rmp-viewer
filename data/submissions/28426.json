ExxonMobil Production Company, a division of Exxon Mobil Corporation, provides contract operating services for the POPCO Gas Plant.  \n\nExxonMobil (formerly Exxon Company, U.S.A.) modified its safety programs in 1992 by implementing structured safety management systems entitled Operations Integrity Management Systems (OIMS).  In 1997, Lloyd's Register Quality Assurance reviewed OIMS and evaluated it against the international standard for Environmental Management Systems (ISO 14001) to determine if OIMS meets the requirements of ISO 14001.  After an extensive review which included a number of facility audits, they concluded that the environmental components of OIMS are consistent with the intent and meet the requirements of the ISO 14001 Environmental Management Systems Standard.  They went on to say, We further believe Exxon to be among the industry leaders in the extent to which environmental management considerations have been integrated into its ongoing business processes.\n\nThis facility has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention (e.g., training of personnel, considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the facility, etc.).  Our approach is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances as well as other substances.  If a release does occur, our trained personnel will take steps to control and contain it until local emergency organizations arrive.  Additional details are included in the other sections of this RMP Plan. \n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances  \n\nThis facility, located 17 miles west of Santa Barbara, California, consists of one Program Level 3 process, which utilizes several operations (e.g.,"

This facility could contain up to 110,000 pounds of propane and 1,200,000 pounds of a regulated flammable mixture containing methane, ethane, propane, butane, iso-butane, pentane and iso-pentane.  All transportation of regulated flammables into and out of the facility is handled via pipelines.  This facility is located in a vegetated canyon with undeveloped, rural land extending beyond the canyon to the north, east and west.  A highway borders the canyon approximately one mile to the south.\nOffsite Consequence Analysis Results\nWorst Case Scenario (WCS) - Flammables\n\nThe flammable WCS, as defined in the regulation, is a release of flammable materials (i.e., mixture of natural gas liquids) resulting in a vapor cloud explosion (VCE) involving the maximum inventory of the larger vessel.  Even though the normal operating inventory for this equipment is significantly less than the maximum capacity and this equipment is protected by high level alarms, pressure relief valves, periodic inspection, and routine monitoring by operating personnel, this maximum inventory must be assumed to be released in 10 minutes and ignited at the point of release.  No mitigation measures were taken into account in evaluating this WCS.  The WCS could have some offsite impacts and includes one residential public receptor that was recently built about 0.52 miles from the facility within the 0.6-mile worst case release impact area.

Even though this event is unlikely (i.e., process is protected by alarms/shutdowns, periodic inspections, and routine monitoring by operating personnel), the flammable material was assumed to be released from a hole and ignited at the point of release.  No passive mitigation measures were taken into account in evaluating this ARS.  This ARS could have some off-site impacts, but the impact area does not include any public or environmental receptors."
