It is used as a refrigerant in three separate closed-loop refrigeration systems:  Main System, North System, South System.\n\n\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND THE CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR Part 68 of the EPA (RMP) as well as the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) program.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with applicable California Building Codes and updated to RAGAGEP standards.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that are in place at Stamoules Produce Company.\n\n\n\n-Process Safety Information\n\nStamoules Produce Company maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters, and equipment specifications associated with the ammonia refrigeration equipment and process.  This includes design parameters and safe operating conditions, as well as details of the many safety features incorporated into the design of the ammonia refrigeration system.\n\n\n\n-Process Hazard Analysis\n\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses is What if / Checklist, as recommended by IIAR.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of 5 years.  Any findings or recommendations associated with the analysis of hazards are addressed in a timely manner.\n\n\n\n"
