The Cedar Bayou Plant, located on the North side of Interstate 10 between Cedar Bayou and Sjolander, is the largest Chevron Chemical Company plant.  The plant site is situated on approximately 1000 acres.  The plant was initially built by Gulf Oil and began operating in 1963. In 1984, it became part of Chevron through the Chevron-Gulf merger.\n\nThe basic business of Cedar Bayou is to produce simple olefins, mostly ethylene and propylene, and derivatives which include polyethylene resins, normal alpha olefins, and polyalphaolefins.  These products are primarily \"intermediates\" which are processed further by our customers to produce finished consumer products.  End uses for our products include: plastics and packaging, biodegradable detergents, synthetic lubes and hydraulic fluids, and waxes.  We also convert by-product acetylene into acetylene black which is used in battery and magnetic tape production.\n\nELABORATION ON ACCIDENT PREVENTION\n\nThe Cedar Bayou plant complies with our Chevron Corporate Policy 530 for \"Protecting People and the Environment\" and the Chemical Manufacturers' Association (CMA) Responsible Care initiative.\n\nThe processes at Cedar Bayou comply with the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard.  This standard is intended only for the management of highly hazardous chemicals.  However, Cedar Bayou has applied its programs and policies to the entire plant, regardless of the degree of hazard.  Specific programs include:  \n(1)    A detailed hazard assessment conducted on all processes to ensure they have been designed safely,\n(2)    An intensive equipment inspection program to ensure equipment remains in good condition to prevent releases,\n(3)    A work permit system to ensure that all work on process equipment is conducted in a safe manner,\n(4)    A Management of Change system to ensure that any change is thoroughly reviewed prior to being im"

This voluntary program is a partnership between OSHA and industry to recognize and encourage excellence and continuous improvement in safety programs.  STAR certification represents the highest form of recognition OSHA can give a company for outstanding safety performance.\n\nELABORATION ON EMERGENCY RESPONSE\n\nALARM SYSTEMS:  Cedar Bayou has an internal plant wide alarm system for fires and emergencies.  In addition, the Baytown alarm system can be activated in the event of incidents with potential offsite consequences.\nTRAINED EMERGENCY RESPONDERS:  To protect our people and property, Cedar Bayou has fully trained responders consisting of volunteer employees covering all four rotating shifts to ensure 24-hr coverage. Each shift has a Fire & Safety Specialist, 10 Fire Brigade members, and 3 Emergency Medical Service / Rescue members.  ERT members receive training in all recognized categories of response (Fire, Haz-Mat, Emergency Medical Treatment, Rescue, and Environmental Protection).  One recent accomplishment of our ERT was their first place finish in the heavy rescue segment of the 1998 International Rescue & Emergency Care Association (IRECA) competition.\nCOMMUNICATIONS LINK TO OFFSITE RESPONDERS:\nThe Cedar Bayou Emergency Command Center (ECC) is our link for internal and external responders. The ECC is staffed by Environmental, Health & Safety personnel, as well as individuals who are on-call.  City of Baytown emergency assistance would be through 911. Industry assistance would be through mutual aid groups listed below.  Our Safety Supervisor participates with the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  In 1988, we shared release"

The resulting health hazards from this fire and explosion are injuries due to flying debris or glass).  Low concentration exposure to the vapors (typically at a distance from the release site) is not an irritant.  High concentration & prolonged exposure (typically very close to the release site) may have the following effects: (1) Simple asphyxiant; not normally considered an acute hazard.  Symptoms might include Headache, nausea, dizziness, or unconsciousness due to oxygen deficiency.  First aid measures are: Remove to fresh air; get medical attention immediately, include oxygen administration.  Initiate CPR if breathing stops. (2) Irritates eyes. Symptoms are burning sensation, and first aid includes rinsing eyes with fresh water at least 15 minutes; and seeking medical attention after all but minor exposure. (3) Irritates skin.

A safety system activated as designed to prevent the escalation of the release scenario, releasing the small volume of ethylene (2,000 lbs.) at high pressure (25,000 psig) to the atmosphere.  This small vapor cloud ignited and carbon fallout landed off-site.
