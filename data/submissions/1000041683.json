The Cisco WTP produces potable water for the City of Cisco, as well as for wholesale customers supplied through neighboring communities and water supply corporations.  Chlorine gas is used in the disinfection process at the plant.  Up to 6,000 pounds of chlorine may be stored at the Cisco WTP.  Because the stored quantity of chlorine onsite exceeds the threshold quantity for chlorine (\u00a768.130; Table 1), the City developed this Risk Management Plan (RMP).  Cisco WTP is subject to Program 2 RMP requirements (\u00a768.12(c)).  A Management System overseen by the City's WTP General Manager is implemented to ensure that the RMP and associated Prevention Program are implemented correctly and maintained up-to-date. \r\n\r\nThe Prevention Program designed to prevent accidental releases includes all required elements of 40 CFR Part 68.  The TCEQ licensing program for water operators is used as a training tool, along with site-specific RMP training.  TCEQ licensing testing and on-site observation and demonstration are used to evaluate comprehension of all training materials.  Written operating procedures are used in conjunction with on-the-job training to ensure that certified WTP operators are proficient in performing their duties before being allowed to work with chlorine storage and feed systems.  Certified WTP operators conduct daily inspections and any problems with the chlorine systems are corrected and documented.  In addition, the certified WTP operators ensure that the equipment used in the disinfection process is maintained according to the manufacturers' recommendations (\u00a768.56(a)).  Because of these efforts, the WTP has not had a chlorine release that resulted in an injury, either on-site or off-site, within the previous five (5) years (\u00a768.42(a)).  As part of the Program, the City will periodically perform compliance audits, hazard reviews and incide"

The City WTP is a non-responding facility for emergency response.  The WTP is included in the City's Emergency Response Plan.  WTP operators are trained to contact the City of Cisco Fire Department Chemical Hazard Team via 911 in the event of a release.  The City of Cisco Fire Department Chemical Hazard Team will serve as the first responder and coordinate the emergency response according to the regional Emergency Response Plan, including the evacuation of surrounding residents when required (\u00a768.155(e))."
