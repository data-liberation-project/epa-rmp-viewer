On June 1, 2009, the nylon division of Solutia, including the Pensacola site, was purchased by SK Capital Partners, and became a wholly owned subsidary of SK; given the name Ascend Performance Materials Operations LLC.  Pensacola is one of the five chemical manufacturing facilities that make up the company. Ascend has approximately 2200 employees. \n\n\n\nBuilt in 1953, the Pensacola Plant is situated on a 1900 acre tract, 12 miles north of the City of Pensacola, on the Escambia River. Over 600 acres are presently in use for manufacturing.\n\n\n\nStaffing at Pensacola is currently 882 Ascend employees and 400 permanent contract employees.   Ascend is one of the world's largest producers of nylon polymer chips for the automotive and electrical industries, as well as nylon for carpet staple. One of chemicals used to make nylon is adipic acid, which is also produced on site. Some of the adipic acid produced on-site is sold outside the nylon markets, where it goes into food additives -- Jell-o and No Salt to provide tartness.  The facility also produces maleic anhydride, which utilizes butane as a raw material.  The maleic anhydride facility is owned by Huntsman Corp., but staffed and run by Ascend personnel \n\n\n\nThe site has two regulated substances: Anhydrous Ammonia and Butane. Most of the major raw materials used in the manufacturing operations, including Anhydrous Ammonia and Butane, arrive at the plant by barge on the Escambia River - 7 miles from t"

Butane barges can hold up to a maximum of 3.3 million pounds, remain under the control of the carrier, and normally there are no more than two barges on site at any one time. The plant has the capability to receive rail cars of butane, with the largest containing 160,000 pounds. Also tanker trucks of butane are occasionally unloaded, with the largest containing 45,000 pounds. We only receive anhydrous ammonia by barge and it remains under the carrier's control. Although we have never had more than one barge of ammonia on site, we believe there could be situations warranting two. The largest ammonia barge contains 5 million pounds. \n\n\n\nIn 2010 a liquid hydrogen supply system, consisting of three 18,000 gallon storage tanks and a hot water vaporizer system, was constructed on the site, and added to the Risk Management Plan.  The system was leased from Praxair, who also managed and maintained the facility.  The system supplied supplemental hydrogen to the phenol to ketone production unit. This facility was dismantled at the end of April, 2015, as it was no longer needed. The hydrogen facility has been removed as a covered process in this resubmission of the Risk Management Plan.\n\n\n\nThe plant also utilizes chlorine gas to treat the plant process and domestic water systems.  All of the chlorine used in this operation is received into the plant in one-ton capacity cylinders and in 150 lb capacity bottles.  The one-ton cylinders contain a maximum net weight of 1350 lbs.  There is no more than one 1350 lb. cylinder at each of the two water treating systems.  The chlorine inventories are therefore under the threshold quantity for inclusion in the Risk Management Plan.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:\n\n\n\nAscend Performance Materials has the following mission statement, expressing our intention to operate responsibly:\n\n\n\nTo be a safe, healthy, s"

Our exemplary safety performance speaks for itself, but we can never be satisfied. Our goal is simple -to create an incident-free workplace for employees, contractors, guests and the surrounding community.\n\n\n\nWe believe in preventing accidents before they occur. Toward that end, employees are thoroughly trained for their work. In addition, our manufacturing processes use state-of-the-art equipment, designed with the latest safety features.\n\n\n\nThe Pensacola plant has earned recognition for its commitment to safety as the first manufacturer in Florida to earn Star designation in OSHA's Voluntary Protection Program (VPP).\n\n\n\nAscend endorses and supports the American Chemistry Council's Responsible Care program --an international initiative that has helped chemical makers achieve one of the best safety performances of any industry in North America. The site achieved certification for our Responsible Care management System in June, 2013.\n\n\n\nAscend, Pensacola has clear written policies regarding employee involvement in all aspects of Safety.  The Process Safety Management Employee Participation policy Section IV - 1.13 describes this involvement.\n\n\n\nThe plant's written ESS&H procedures and standards are incorporated into two manuals.  The first manual contains 120 plant wide procedures that are reviewed and revised at least every five years.  The second manual contains area-specific procedures (over 125 in number) that are also reviewed and revised on a five-year cycle.  So, on av"

The Safety Dept. manages the ESS&H Manual revision program.  \n\n\n\nManagement demonstrates its leadership through facilitation and/or attendance at safety meetings, participation in 5S/Safety walkthroughs, support of employee engagement teams, permit audits, and compliance training.  Communication is the key to the success of management commitment.  The site managers utilize a variety of media (e.g., emails, critical life safety audits, attendance at various meetings) to convey their personal commitment that completing our work safely is the vision that we must continuously have in front of us each day.\n\n\n\nAscend uses several types of safety audits to ensure that our plant runs safely.  These include PSM and non-PSM audits, ISO audits, insurance surveys and audits, environmental and industrial hygiene audits, and Management of Change audits.  We conduct safety reviews on new processes or process modifications at a number of stages of the project design and installation.  Pre-startup inspections are done before the process is commissioned.\n\n\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program:\n\n\n\nThe Pensacola plant is very dedicated to emergency response preparation in the event of any major incident.  The plant has almost 100 firefighters across all 4 shifts (25 per shift), giving 24/7 coverage.  These firefighters train 96 hours annually at the site on events such as flammable liquid fires, interior and exterior fire fighting, hazardous communications, and incident command.  The firefighters also train at the Texas A&M fire training school and the Gulf Coast Emergency Response Training Academy.  The plant fire department has one Class A pumper with foam capabilities to supplement the six fire pumps that take water from a 2 million gallon supply reservoir.\n\n\n\nCurrently, the plant has 17 EMTs training 48 hours annually on trauma assessment, burn care, and other medical topics.

Ascend also has a good working relationship with other nearby industrial facilities and with the local community fire departments.\n\n\n\nThe Pensacola site falls under compliance of the Maritime Transportation Security Act, which was implemented as a result of 9/11.  Ascend worked with the U.S. Coast Guard, who has responsibility for the Security Act, to develop a facility security plan which improves the security of our personnel, chemicals, and operations.
