SuperValu has developed a Process Safety Management (PSM) program for this process.  The PSM program was modeled after the Process Safety Management Guidelines for Ammonia Refrigeration guidance document by the International Institute for Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR).  The PSM program will serve as the Prevention program.  SuperValu, Inc. developed an Emergency Action Plan (EAP) for the ammonia refrigeration system initially in 1990 and that plan currently remains in effect.  The EAP was most recently updated on 2/26/1999.  Palen-Kimball is prepared to respond toaccidental releases to the extent allowable under the established emergency response procedures.  SuperValu, Inc. and Palen Kimball have utilized the What If/Checklist technique endorsed by the IIAR in analyzing the process hazards associated with anhydrous ammonia.",

      "SummaryText": "Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nSuperValu, Inc. is commited to the protection of its employees, the greater community and the environment from any hazardous substances used in the refrigerated warehouse operation, specifically the anhydrous ammonia used in the refrigeration process.  It is the policy of SuperValu, Inc. to comply with all Federal, State and Local laws.\n\nFacility Description and Regulated Substance Handled\n\nSuperValu, Inc. owns and operates a refrigerated warehouse freezer facility at 101 Jefferson Avenue South and a refrigerated warehouse perishable food facility at 715 Fifth Avenue South.  Both facilities are located in Hopkins, Minnesota.  The refrigeration systems at both facilities use anhydrous ammonia in a  closed circuit charge configuration.  The total amount of anhydrous ammonia at the freezer facility is estimated to be 27,000 pounds.  The total amount of anhydrous ammonia at the perishable food facility is 8,000 pounds.  This Risk Management Plan (RMP) covers only the freezer facility since it is over the threshold of 10,000 pounds established by the EPA.  The refrigeration systems are operated and maintained by Palen-Kimball, a contractor who specializes in anhydrous ammonia refrigeration systems.\n\nWorst Case Scenario\n\nThe worst case scenario defined by the EPA RMP Guidance is a failure of the refrigeration system resulting in the release of the entire amount of 27,000 pounds of liquid anhydrous ammonia which immediately vaporizes.  Under these conditions, the look-up tables in the Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refegeration document (EPA 550-B-98-014) indicate that the distance to toxic endpoint is 2.0 miles.  Based on the current (1997) census data the population density for the city of Hopkins, Minnesota is 4,048.7 people per square mile.  This density rate provides the basis for a calculated population of 50,852 people within a 2.0 mile radius of the site. \n\nAlternate Case Scenario\n\nThe alt"

      "SummaryText": "ernate case scenario is defined by the EPA as a release that is significantly more likely to occur than the worse case scenario.  For the SuperValu, Inc. freezer facility, this release is the failure of a one-inch diameter liquid anhydrous ammonia pipeline which has a pressure of 55 pounds per square inch and the failure occurs over a ten minute period.  The look-up tables in the same guidance document used for the worst case scenario indicate that the distance to toxic endpoint for a 1,200 pounds per minute release is 0.25 miles.  The calulated population density within a 0.25 mile radius is 795 people.\n\nGeneral accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThrough completion of this RMP, SuperValu, Inc. has complied with all EPA requirements under 40 CFR 68.  Process safety information and operations/maintenance procedures are documented on site.  Periodic functions such as process hazard analysis, training, change management and incident investigation are conducted on a regular basis.  Audits of the overall RMP are conducted on a regular basis to assure compliance with EPA regulations.\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nSuperValu, Inc. has not had an ammonia accident causing deaths, injuries, environmental or property damage, evacuations, or in-place sheltering in the last five years at the freezer facility.\n\nThe Emergency Response Program\n\nSuperValu, Inc. has developed and Emergency Action Plan to deal with accidental ammonia releases.  In the event of an emergency, it is the policy of SuperValu, Inc. to notify the local (City of Hopkins) Fire Department and to evacuate all employees from the facility.  Palen-Kimball is prepared to respond to accidental releases to the extent allowable under the established emergency response procedures."
