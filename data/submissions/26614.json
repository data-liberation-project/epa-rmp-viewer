Facility Policy\n The owners, management, and employees of the Seward Branch are committed to the prevention of any releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment. \n\n2.  Facility Information\nThe facility is located approximately five miles north of Seward, Kansas.  The primary activity at this location is the storage of fertilizer for retail sale to producers of agricultural products.  The maximum storage of amhydrous ammonia at this location is 191,300 pounds, which includes the main storage tanks as well as nurse trailers.\n\n3.  Worst Case Release Scenario\nThe worst case release scenario would be the release of the total ammount of anhydous ammonia from the main storage tanks.  The maximum release would be 130,100 pounds, the distance to end point would be 4.4 miles with 140 people affected.\n\n4.  Alternate Release Scenario\nThe alternate release scenario is a relsea from a ruptured transfer hose.  The release of approximately 2400 pounds would travel 0.3 miles to end point affectign about 4 people.\n\n5.  Accidental Release Prevention Program\nThe Great Bend Coop is a Farmland Industries \"AG-21\" memeber.  Ag-21 is a program that is environmental driven.  This Coop strives to go above and beyond industry standards for the safety of customers, employees and the environment.\n\n6.  Five Year Accident History\nThere has been no accidental release of anhydrous ammonia within the past five years.\n\n7.  Emergency Response Program\nThe facility has coordinated with local responders.\n\n8.
