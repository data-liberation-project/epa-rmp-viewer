Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nCarrera Gas Company, L.L.C. is committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activity is the operation of a Natural Gas Processing Plant for the production of Liquified Petroleum Gases.  We have seven regulated substances present at our facility.  These substances include Methane, Ethane, Propane, Isobutane [Propane, 2-methyl], Butane, Isopentane [Butane, 2-methyl-], and Pentane.  These regulated substances are components of the inlet gas, the LPG product, and the residue natural gas\n\nThe maximum inventory of the regulated substances at our facility is:\n\nMethane                  16,000 lb\nEthane                  49,000 lb\nPropane                  67,000 lb\nIsobutane [Propane, 2-methyl]            22,000 lb\nButane                  38,000 lb\nIsopentane [Butane, 2-methyl-]      43,000 lb\nPentane                  17,000 lb\n \n3.    The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\nTo evaluate the worst case and alternate release scenarios, we have used EPA's Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance Reference Tables or Equations.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 3 flammable substances involves a catastrophic release from the Gas Plant Operations.  In this scenario, 182,683 pounds of a flammable mixture containing Ethane, Propane, Isobutane, "

      "SummaryText": "Butane, Isopentane, and Pentane is released.  It is assumed that the entire contents of the full tank are released as a vapor, which finds an ignition source, with 10 percent of the released quantity participating in a vapor cloud explosion.  Under worst case weather conditions, the maximum distance of 0.46 miles is obtained, which corresponds to an endpoint of 1 psi overpressure.\n\nThe alternative release scenario submitted for Program 3 flammable substances involves a release from the Gas Plant Operations, which is assumed to result in a Vapor Cloud Explosion.  The scenario involves the release of 182,683 pounds of flammable mixture containing Ethane, Propane, Isobutane, Butane, Isopentane, and Pentane.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the flammable endpoint of 1 psi overpressure is 0.31 miles.\n\n4.    The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out in EPA's RMP (Risk Management Plan) regulations (40 CFR part 68).  The McLean Gas Plant is also subject to OSHA's PSM (Process Safety Management) regulations (29 CFR 1910.119).  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nThe McLean Gas Plant maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses is the \"HAZOP\" method.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at least once every five years.  Any findings related to the ha"
