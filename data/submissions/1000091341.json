      "SummaryText": "Accidental Release and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nWoodbridge Winery has been in operation since 1978.  Since its inception, it has been committed to providing a safe environment to its employees and surrounding communities.  This commitment is reflected in the safety and environmental programs that are implemented at the facility.  For example, written procedures have been created for operating the ammonia refrigeration systems.  Only trained operators are permitted to perform system operations.  Woodbridge Winery has also developed a robust maintenance program to ensure the equipment is in good operating condition.  All of these programs are geared towards the prevention of an accidental release at the facility.  In addition, these programs incorporate emergency procedures to mitigate the effects of a release if it does occur.  At such an event, emergency coordinators will assess the situation and notify outside responding agencies as necessary.\n\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance\n\n\n\nWoodbridge Winery is located at 5950 East Woodbridge Road in Acampo, California.  Ammonia is used as a refrigerant in the facility's three independent refrigeration systems (Plants 1, 2, and 3).  The systems provide cooling to glycol and wine product.  The maximum intended inventory of ammonia for each process and a description of how each process operates are as follows.       \n\n\n\nPlant 1\n\nInventory: 50,000 lbs\n\nProcess Description: The refrigeration cycle begins with the transfer of high pressure liquid ammonia from the condensers to the Thermosyphon Receiver (TSR) and two High Pressure Receivers (HPRs).  Liquid is supplied from the HPRs to two Low Pressure Receivers (3-Pump and 2-Pump), Wine Chillers, and the Glycol Plate & Frame Chiller.  \n\n\n\nAssociated with 3-Pump Low Pressure Receiver is a Liquid Transfer Vessel, where excess liquid ammonia in the vessel can be routed back to the HPRs via hot gas pressure from the compressors.

The 2-Pump Low Pressure Receiver pumps low pressure ammonia to the 500 series jacketed tanks.  The liquid ammonia in the chillers and jacketed tanks partially vaporizes as it absorbs heat from product being cooled. The resulting liquid/vapor mixture is returned to the two Low Pressure Receivers.  The vapor in the Low Pressure Receivers is then pulled to the compressors, where the pressure and temperature of the gas is increased.  Compressor discharge (high pressure ammonia vapor, or hot gas) is sent to the condensers, where it is condensed to a high pressure liquid and returned to the TSR and the HPRs.  \n\n\n\nThe liquid ammonia in the TSR is used to cool the oil in the screw compressors.  Liquid ammonia flows into the compressor oil cooler vessel and the vapor/liquid mixture is returned back to the TSR.  Excess liquid in the TSR is drained to the HPR.\n\n\n\nPlant 2 \n\nInventory: 160,000 lbs\n\nProcess Description: The refrigeration cycle begins with the transfer of high pressure liquid ammonia from the condensers to either the Thermosyphon Receiver (TSV) or to the High Pressure Receiver (HPR).

Excess liquid in the TSV is drained to the HPR. \n\n\n\nHigh pressure liquid is supplied from the HPR to Compressors S3-S5 for liquid injection oil cooling. The HPR also supplies high pressure liquid to the wine chillers and glycol chillers. At the chillers, the liquid ammonia is partially vaporized as it cools the wine product or the glycol. The liquid/vapor mixture from the chillers is returned to two Suction Accumulators (SA1 & SA2) that are each equipped with a Liquid Transfer Vessel (LTV1 & LTV2). The vapor in each accumulator rises to the top to be drawn off to the compressors, while the liquid settles at the bottom and is drained to the associated LTV. Th"

The program includes but is not limited to the following elements:\n\n?    Process safety information regarding the hazards of ammonia, and operating and technical specifications for the refrigeration systems and the associated equipment;\n\n?    Written procedures for operating and maintaining the refrigeration systems;\n\n?    Training for personnel involved with system operations and maintenance;\n\n?    Written procedures for safely introducing modifications to the processes;\n\n?    Investigating releases of ammonia and near miss incidents and implementing measures to prevent recurrence; \n\n?    Written procedures for conducting hot work on or near the processes;\n\n?    Contractor management policies to ensure contract employee safety while on facility premises;\n\n?    Audit procedures for ensuring that the programs are being implemented in accordance to the regulations; and\n\n?    Employee involvement in program development and implementation.\n\n\n\nIn addition, engineering controls have been implemented to reduce the chance of an accidental release to the environment.  These are comprised of equipment monitoring systems and safety controls to shut off the equipment when operating parameters exceed safe operating limits.  Relief valves on pressurized ammonia vessels prevent equipment rupture in the event of overpressurization.  Regular inspections and tests are performed to ensure these controls are in good working order.\n\n\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\n\n\nA review of the facility's five year accident history showed that there have "

The EAP covers procedures for: 1) evacuating and accounting for visitors and employees, 2) addressing ammonia releases and other foreseeable emergencies that could occur onsite, 3) notifying external agencies and emergency response personnel, and 4) administering first aid measures for ammonia exposure.  Employees are informed of the elements of the EAP and trained in the evacuation procedure.  In the event of an ammonia release, employees will evacuate or shelter-in-place, depending on the nature of the release, and the facility will contact the fire department as necessary for assistance.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nWoodbridge Winery reviews the ammonia refrigeration systems for opportunities to improve on system operations and safety. In 2020, the facility completed a refrigeration controls upgrade for Plant 1, which included the installation of additional safety systems such as an ammonia detector with horn/strobe and emergency stop switches. Plant 2 is currently being evaluated for a controls system upgrade with the installation of similar safety systems.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analyses and Compliance Audits are also performed on the ammonia refrigeration systems, and these studies have resulted in action items to improve safety at the facility.  The recommendations mainly consist of developing new procedures or updating existing procedures, providing employee training, implementing practices consistent with industry standards, and performing inspections and tests to maintain the integrity of the equipment.
