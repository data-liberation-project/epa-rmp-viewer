The facility has a refrigeration system that utilizes anhydrous ammonia as the refrigerant, which is considered a highly hazardous chemical.  The system is currently charged with 11,524-lbs of ammonia.  The system is able to operate with up to 13,500-lbs of ammonia.\n     A hazard and safety analysis was recently conducted on the system and several health and safety recommendations were generated.  Currently, the recommendations are being implemented and include such things as additional audible and visible alarms to alert personnel and people in the area, providing additional safety equipment in strategic areas, provide more response information to security personnel and the PCCA Harbor Master's office in the event of a release, make more detailed process information available to personnel, and other similar recommendations.  Additionally, a Process Engineer quantified and verified  the amount of ammonia currently in the system in January 2003 and conducted an evaluation of the system for potential leaks and problems.\n     The employees are undergoing an annual training program to become more familiar with the potential hazards associated with ammonia in the areas that they work and to become more familiar with the emergency action plan and procedures in place in the event of an ammonia release.  The PCCA is not required to comply with OSHA regulations, however, a Process Safety Manual (PSM), similar to the OSHA PSM program, is being prepared at the facility with the help of facility personnel to prevent or mininmize a catastrophic release.\n     The system is currently equipped with a refrigeration control system that will alarm and shutdown the sytem under certain conditions.  The refrigeration control system also allows for facility personnel to shut the system down from remote locations.  Facility and maint"
