      "SummaryText": "Luke Oil & Fertilizer, Inc has served the farming community in Ocilla, Georgia for the past 39 years. We have an emergency response plan and an accident prevention program in place at all of our facility. Our plan is in the process of being updated to fully comply with the new RMP rules.   We cooperate with public emergency planning agencies on a regular basis to develop and maintain contingency plans in case of an accidental release. Our employees attend  procedural safety and emergency response classes.  This policy has allowed us to remain accident free for more than five years.\n\nOur anhydrous ammonia tank is inspected on a regular basis to ensure safe reliable operation.  The last comprehensive facility inspection was on March 17, 1999.   Safety placards are placed around the facility, on the tanks, and at fill stations.   The facility's single 30000 gallon tank is equipped with pressure relief valves and gauges to prevent overpressurization.  The supply lines are equipped with excess flow devices that will automatically shut off the flow in the event of a pipe or transfer hose failure.  The tanks and pipes also feature manual shutoff valves to stop and isolate a leak so that it can be repaired.  There is a water supply located at the fill station.\n\nThe worst case scenario indicate that businesses and residences offsite will be affected in the event of a catastrophic release.  However we believe that our safety and emergency response programs greatly reduce the likelihood of this scenario from happening.  The alternative case release scenario is a more accurate assessment of risk to the community.  In the alternate release scenario the toxic endpoint was less than a tenth of a mile and would not breach the borders of the facility."
