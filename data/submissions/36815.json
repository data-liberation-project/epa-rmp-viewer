EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nThe ISP Texas City Plant is committed to operating in a manner that is safe for Texas City Plant workers, the public, and the environment.  For example, as a member of the American Chemistry Council and the Synthetic Organic Chemical Manufacturers Association, ISP implements the principles of Responsible Care \u00ae to ensure a safe and environmentally sound operation.  In addition, as part of this commitment, the Texas City Plant has established systems to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility.  One part of these systems is a risk management program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at the Texas City Plant and that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) rule 40 CFR part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule). One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit a risk management plan (RMPlan) describing the risk management program at the Texas City Plant.  This document is intended to satisfy the RMPlan executive summary requirements of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program at the Texas City Plant.\n\n1.1.1 Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe Texas City Plant is committed to the safety of Texas City Plant workers and the public, and to the preservation of the environment, through the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances. The Texas City Plant implements reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous substances. In the event of a significant accidental release, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain such releases.  Texas City Plant evaluates each situation, evacuates workers as necessary, responds based on our capabilities and training, and if necessary, contacts the Texas City fire department to alert the local industrial mutual aid society (IMAS)  to assist i"

Texas City Plant, the local emergency planning committee (LEPC), and the fire department have also established a system to use for warning the community if an accident occurs that could threaten the community.\n\nThe Texas City Site General Manager has overall responsibility for the development and implementation of the risk management program for EPA-regulated processes at company facilities.  However, the specific responsibilities for certain aspects of that program have been delegated by the Site General Manager to other personnel who report either directly, or through other management personnel, to the Site General Manager.  Those relationships are depicted on the organization chart maintained by the Site General Manager's staff. Specific responsibility for the implementation of the process safety management (PSM) and accident prevention program has been delegated to the Safety and Environmental Manager.  Similarly, responsibility for the RMP hazard assessment and risk management plan has been delegated to the plant Safety and Environmental Manager.  The emergency response program, including compliance with the RMP aspects of that effort, is the responsibility of the plant Safety and Environmental Manager.  In keeping with our policy that safe operation is part of everyone's job, many other personnel are also involved in RMP activities on an ongoing basis.\n\n1.2  The ISP Texas City Plant Regulated Substances\n\nThe ISP Texas City Plant is a chemical manufacturing facility located in Texas City, Texas. Chemicals manufacturing commenced on this 330 acre site in 1967. ISP Texas City employs approximately 170 hourly and salaried personnel. We use the following chemicals as our feed materials: methanol, formaldehyde, ammonia, acetylene, butanediol, ethanol, isopropyl alcohol, propyl acetate, vinyl pyrrolidine, vinyl acetate, and propane. The ISP Texas City Plant makes a"

Some of these feed materials and products are toxic or flammable substances that EPA has specifically listed in the RMP rule and are present in our process units above the specified EPA threshold quantity.  In total, we have six (6) process units that are covered by the RMP rule. The following are the RMP substances we handle in covered processes: acetylene, anhydrous ammonia, formaldehyde, methylamine, propane, and vinyl acetate.\n\n1.3  Offsite Consequence Analysis\n\nThis information is no longer required to be submitted in the executive summary.\n\n1.4  Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at the Texas City Plant.  Because processes at the Texas City Plant that are regulated by the EPA RMP regulation are also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) process safety management (PSM) standard,  and because the OSHA PSM requirements are very similar to the EPA RMP requirements for chemical manufacturing facilities, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements.  The PSM program at this facility has been extended by the Texas City Plant, where necessary, to satisfy EPA's Program Level 3 accident prevention program requirements.\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nThe Texas City Plant encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of  process hazard analysis (PHA), incident investigation, pre-startup safety reviews, design safety reviews and plant and process inspection teams. Employees have access to all information created as part of the Texas City Plant accident prevention program.  Specific ways that employe"

In addition, the Texas City Plant has a number of initiatives under way that address process safety and employee safety issues. These initiatives include forming teams to promote both process and personal safety. The teams typically have members from various areas of the plant, including operations, maintenance, engineering, and plant management.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nThe Texas City Plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information. Specific departments within the Texas City Plant are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information. \n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs). This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  For specific process areas, the Texas City Plant has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) in their Process Operating Manuals.  The Texas City Plant ensures that the process is maintained within these limits by using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems). \n\nThe Texas City Plant also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, de"

Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage those hazards.\n\nThe Texas City Plant primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques available.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes recommendations for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary. \n\nThe PHA team recommendations reviewed with plant management for evaluation and resolution. Implementation of safety improvements in response to PHA findings is based on corporate risk acceptance criteria.  This ensures that potential accident scenarios with the highest risks receive immediate attention.  All approved safety improvements being implemented in response to PHA team recommendations are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each recommendation is documented and retained.\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the Texas City Plant periodically updates an"

The results and recommendations from these updates are documented and retained. \n\nOperating Procedures\n\nThe Texas City Plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process. These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  Procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.  Procedures are maintained current by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made to the process.  In addition, the Texas City Plant operating procedures provide guidance on how to respond to events that result in exceeding safe operating limits for specific process or equipment parameters.  The written operating procedures are readily available to operators in the process units and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\nTraining\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the Texas City Plant has implemented a company training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  New or transferred employees receive basic training in Texas City Plant operations. The new or transferred employee is then given classroom training on  the unit(s) to which they will be assigned. After successfully completing this training, a new operator begins the second phase of training, on-the-job training (OJT). This training consists of hands on training coupled with evaluations of both actual in the field evaluation of knowledge and skills and written evaluations of knowledge and skills. During OJT the new or transferred employee is paired with a senior operator to learn"

This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years.  All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\nContractors\n\nThe Texas City Plant uses contractors to supplement its work force during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the Texas City Plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform Texas City Plant personnel of any hazards that they find during their work. This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) information about safety and health hazards, (2) emergency response plan requirements, and (3) safe work practices prior to their beginning work. In addition, the Texas City Plant evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor.  Texas City Plant personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\nPre-startup Safety Reviews\n\nThe Texas City Plant conducts a pre-startup safety review for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information.
