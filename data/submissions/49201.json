The Groton Manufacturing Plant has established systems to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility.  One part of these systems is a risk management program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at the Groton Manufacturing Plant and that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) rule 40 CFR part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule).  One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit a risk management plan (RMPlan) describing the risk management program at the Groton Manufacturing Plant.  This document is intended to satisfy the RMPlan executive summary requirements of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of the Risk Management Program at the Groton Manufacturing Plant.  This update is to document the reduction of chemical inventory covered by RMP; the elimination of Bromine and Anhydrous Hydrochloric Acid from the site.\r\n\r\n1.1\tAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n\r\nThe Groton Manufacturing Plant is committed to the safety of Pfizer employees, its contractors, and the public, and to the preservation of the environment, through the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances. The Groton Manufacturing Plant implements controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous substances.  In the event of an accidental release, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain such releases.  The Groton Manufacturing Plant evaluates each situation, and if necessary, evacuates workers and contractors, and responds based on our capabilities and training. If necessary, the Groton Ma"

The Groton Manufacturing Plant, in conjunction with the City of Groton Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC), the New London Tri-City LEPC (New London, Waterford and East Lyme) and the local police and fire departments, have also established a system for warning the community if a potentially threatening accident occurs.\r\n\r\nThe Groton Manufacturing Plant Manager has overall responsibility for the development and implementation of the risk management program for EPA-regulated processes at Pfizer Global Manufacturing - Groton Manufacturing Plant.  However, the specific responsibilities for certain aspects of that program have been delegated by the Plant Manager to other personnel who report either directly, or through other management personnel, to the Plant Manager.  Those relationships are depicted on the organization chart maintained by the Plant Manager's staff.  The emergency response program, including compliance with the RMP aspects of that effort, is the responsibility of the Director of Environmental, Health and Safety. Specific responsibility for the implementation of the Process Safety Management (PSM) and accident prevention programs have been delegated to the Safety Manager, who reports to the Director of Environmental, Health and Safety.  Similarly, specific responsibility for the RMP hazard assessment and Risk Management Plan has been delegated to the Safety Manager. In keeping with our policy that safe operation is part of everyone's job, many other personnel are also involved in RMP activities on an ongoing basis.\r\n\r\n1.2\tPfizer Global Manufacturing - Groton Manufacturing Plant Regulated Substances\r\n\r\nThe Groton Manufacturing Plant is an Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient (API) manufacturing plant located in Groton, Connecticut.  \"API\" means the active ingredients for medicines tha"

One chemical is used at the Groton Manufacturing Plant and is held above the threshold quantities specified by EPA in the RMP rule. Anhydrous ammonia is used in four separate refrigeration systems, having a total inventory of 19,600 lb. of anhydrous ammonia. Because Pfizer has taken measures in recent years to minimize or eliminate the use of toxic substances in its operations, ammonia is the only RMP-covered processes we have at Groton.\r\n\r\n1.3\tOffsite Consequence Analysis\r\n\r\nPfizer has performed offsite consequence analyses for anhydrous ammonia at the Groton Manufacturing Plant to estimate the potential for an accidental release that could affect the public or the environment.  The offsite consequence analyses consist of evaluating both worst-case scenarios and alternative release scenarios, as defined in the RMP regulations.  The Groton Manufacturing Plant does not expect a worst-case release scenario to ever occur.  An alternative release scenario represents a release that might occur during the lifetime of a facility like the Groton Manufacturing Plant.  Alternative release scenarios can be used to help the LEPC improve the community emergency response plan.  We have shared that information with the LEPC and other organizations involved in emergency response activities.  It is also available to local residents and businesses.  If you are interested in this information, please contact our RMP coordinator (860) 441-3225.\r\n\r\nThe main objective of performing the offsite consequence analysis is to determine the distance at which certain effects might occur to the public because of an accidental release (called the endpoint distance).

Some people who are particularly susceptible to the substance released could be affected to a greater extent.  At distances less than the endpoint distance, the effects would be greater; at distances greater than the endpoint distance, the effects would be less.  The description of the worst case and alternate case scenario has been removed from this report per the March 31, 2004 amendment to the Chemical Accident Prevention Rule (Risk Management Program) under the Clean Air Act Section 112(r)(7).\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n1.4\tAccidental Release Prevention Program\r\n\r\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at the Groton Manufacturing Plant.  Since processes at the Groton Manufacturing Plant that are regulated by the EPA RMP regulation are also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) process safety management (PSM) standard, and because the OSHA PSM requirements are very similar to the EPA RMP requirements, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements.  The PSM program at this facility has been extended by the Groton Manufacturing Plant, where necessary, to satisfy the EPA's Program Level 3 accident prevention program requirements.\r\n\r\nEmployee Participation\r\n\r\nThe Groton Manufacturing Plant encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of process hazard analyses (PHAs), incident investigation, and compliance audit teams.

In addition, the Groton Manufacturing Plant has a number of initiatives that address process safety and employee safety issues. These initiatives include teams to promote both process and personal safety. The teams typically have members from various areas of the plant, including operations, maintenance, engineering, and plant management.\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\n\r\nThe Groton Manufacturing Plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information. Specific operating areas within the Groton Manufacturing Plant are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information. A summary of reference documents and their location is readily available as part of the written employee participation plan to help employees locate any necessary process safety information.\r\n\r\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs). This information is supplemented, where necessary, by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  For specific process areas, the Groton Manufacturing Plant has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition).  The Groton Manufacturing Plant ensures that the process is maintained within these limits by using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems). \r\n\r\nThe Groton Manufacturing Plant also maintains numerous technical docum"

This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, etc. This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis\r\n\r\nThe Groton Manufacturing Plant has a comprehensive Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage those hazards.\r\n\r\nThe Groton Manufacturing Plant primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis and What-If/Checklist analysis technique to perform these evaluations. These analysis methods are recognized as appropriate for determination of the hazards of the processes being evaluated.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes recommendations for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary. \r\n\r\nThe PHA team recommendations are forwarded to management for resolution. Implementation of safety improvements in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.

The results and recommendations from these updates are documented and retained.  Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the recommendations is documented and retained.\r\n\r\nOperating Procedures\r\n\r\nThe Groton Manufacturing Plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process. These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  Procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.  Procedures are maintained current by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made to the process.  In addition, the Groton Manufacturing Plant operating procedures provide guidance on how to respond to events that result in exceeding safe operating limits for specific process or equipment parameters.  The written operating procedures are readily available to operators in the process units and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\r\n\r\nTraining\r\n\r\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the Groton Manufacturing Plant has implemented a training program for all employees involved in operating a process.
