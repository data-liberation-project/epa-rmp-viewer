We continue to investigate potential releases as if it were a release to improve our refrigeration system and procedures involved.\r\n\r\nDrills are held on a regular basis with all stakeholders and the Lake Odessa Fire Department tours the facility on an annual basis.  During this tour a review of our system and changes are addressed with them.  The HAZMAT team drills on a regular basis and these drills are critiqued. Deficiencies are reviewed and corrective action taken.\r\nWe have contracted with a consultant to assist in revalidation of PHA's and to conduct compliance audits.   We continuously review industry practices and benchmark for applicable best practices to improve our ammonia system to make it safer for our stakeholders and the community.  Our scenario planning utilized RMP Comp and USEPA  Environmental Justice Geographic Assessment Tool."
