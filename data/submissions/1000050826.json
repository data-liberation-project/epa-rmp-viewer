Our core purpose is to be the partner of choice for customers worldwide.  Our stakeholders produce value added egg products utilizing liquid egg in either whole, white or yolk form.  We carry a full line of liquid egg and entree products.  Cargill Kitchen Solutions commits to 100% compliance with all applicable laws and regulations; champions waste reduction, energy conservation, pollution prevention and protection of the environment.  Management recognizes that leadership in environmental protection is critical to all of our stakeholders, customers and the communities where we operate.\n\n\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia is used in our refrigeration system to maintain and control temperatures of our manufacturing processes.  This ensures that our products are processed and maintained at proper temperatures to inhibit microbiological growth. \n\nWe comply with OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM), OSHA Emergency Action Plan, EPA Oil Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasure plan (SPCC), and applicable EPCRA regulations at state and local levels.  Preventive Maintenance is tracked via computer based maintenance management system.   This builds trend history that is allowing us to become predictive vs. preventive in our maintenance and further ensures the safe operation of our system.  Management of Change and Pre Start Safety Review are principles from PSM that have been deployed to all of our process lines to ensure safe design.  Contractors are required to submit information on their safety performance and if Cargill Kitchen Solutions standard is met they are approved to work. Before work is started all contractors complete an orientation to ensure understanding of Cargill Kitchen Solutions safety policies, rules and permit procedures. \n\n\n\nCargill Kitchen Solutions, Lake Odessa, MI, has had one reportable "

There were no injuries  and minimal property damage.  An investigation was conducted and corrective action was implemented.  We continue to investigate potential releases as if it were a release to improve our refrigeration system and procedures involved.\n\n\n\nDrills are held on a regular basis with all stakeholders and the Lake Odessa Fire Department tours the facility on an annual basis.  During this tour a review of our system and changes are addressed with them.  The HAZMAT team drills on a regular basis and these drills are critiqued. Deficiencies are reviewed and corrective action taken.\n\nWe have contracted with a consultant to assist in revalidation of PHA's and to conduct compliance audits.   We continuously review industry practices and benchmark for applicable best practices to improve our ammonia system to make it safer for our stakeholders and the community.
