As part of this commitment, Shell Chemical Company has established systems to ensure safe operation of the facility.  One part of this system is the Risk Management Program (RMP) that complies with the Environmental Protection Agency's regulation 40 CFR Part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements:  Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule).  One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit a Risk Management Plan (RMPlan) describing the risk management program at Shell Chemical Company.  This document is intended to satisfy the RMPlan requirements and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program at Shell Chemical Company in Geismar, LA.\n\n\n\nThis submittal has been issued to meet the 5 year update requirement.  Two units have been shutdown dismantled, and removed from the program (EOEG-1 in 2007, and PDO in 2009).\n\n\n\n1.1 Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response\n\n\n\nShell Chemical Company implements reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous substances.  In the event of a significant accidental release, our trained personnel respond to control and contain such releases as appropriate.  Each situation is evaluated individually and appropriate measures are taken to protect the employees and the community.  Shell Chemical Company, the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC), and neighboring industry have established a program to warn the community if an accident occurs that could threaten the community.  A local siren warning system is in place and tested routinely.\n\n\n\n1.2 The Shell Chemical Company and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nShell Chemical Company handles many substances regulated by the RMP rule in sufficient quantities to be covered by the RMP rule.  The information below indicates the processes as defined by the rule and the regulated substances therei"

The OCA consists of evaluating both worst-case scenarios (WCSs) and alternative release scenarios (ARSs).  Shell Chemical Company does not expect a worst case scenario to ever occur.  An ARS represents a release that might occur during the lifetime of the facility like Shell Chemical Company.  ARSs help the LEPC improve the community response plan.  \n\n\n\nRadii of potential impact for all release scenarios were determined using guidance in the RMP rule and the lookup tables from the EPA's RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance document, dated May 24, 1996 and RMP* COMP Version 1.07.\n\n\n\n1.4 Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place for the Program 3 processes at the Shell Chemical Company Geismar Plant.  Because the processes at the Shell Chemical plant that are regulated by the EPA RMP rule are also subject to the Process Safety Management (PSM) standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program. \n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nThe Shell Chemical Company keeps a variety of technical documents that are us"

Within this program, each covered process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\n\n\nThe Geismar plant primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) technique to perform these evaluations.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  The team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\n\n\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to local management for resolution.  Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  They ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options being implemented in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are complete.

Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, Shell Chemical Company has procedures in place to ensure contractors have the proper knowledge of and training on plant systems, procedures, and processes before they go to work at the site.  Safety performance constitutes a major factor in the overall evaluation of contractor performance and Shell performs periodic evaluations of contractor compliance with Shell and regulatory requirements.\n\n\n\nPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSR)\n\nShell Chemical Company conducts a PSSR for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in process safety information.  In addition, all major projects, major turnarounds, and minor turnarounds require a PSSR to be performed.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and the equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment in service.  This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready.  The PSSR review team creates an Expected State of Readiness Document, which is used to verify all aspects of the organization's readiness.  \n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nThe Shell Chemical Company has well-established practices and procedures to maintain the integrity of pressure vessels and storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps, and emergency shutdown systems.

The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to Shell Chemical Company management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings.  Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years so that the reports can be reviewed during future PHAs and PHA revalidations.\n\n\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, the Shell Chemical Company conducts an audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are in place.
