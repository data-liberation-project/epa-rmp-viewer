      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY - RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN\r\nThe Jones-Blair Company, LLC (Jones-Blair) operates a paint manufacturing facility located at 2728 Empire Central in Dallas, Texas.  The facility's primary function is the manufacture of paints, resins, and emulsions.  The facility falls under the Standard Industrial Classification Codes 2821 and 2851 (NAICS 325510).  The plant employs 145 people. \r\nThe Jones-Blair Company is committed to operating a facility that is compliant with all safety and environmental regulations and utilizes best management practices. We have a Risk Management Plan (RMP) to assist in this function. Our efforts include each of the following:\r\n\u00bf\tProcess Safety Management - this plan manages the potential safety, onsite and offsite consequences of releases and accidents.  \r\n\u00bf\tSafety/Training sessions - these sessions are held at regularly scheduled intervals throughout the year and cater to affected employees to maximize understanding and awareness.\r\n\u00bf\tJones-Blair Emergency Action Plan - this plan instructs employees of their responsibilities in the event of an emergency (of any kind). It also provides 24 hour emergency contact numbers, a list of emergency equipment, evacuation routes and the Regulatory/local agency that must be contacted in the event of an emergency. It covers Fire, Spill Control, Threats and Weather.\r\n\u00bf\tJones-Blair Corporate Safety Policy - this plan is to provide a guiding vision and philosophy for maintaining a safe work place on a daily basis. \r\n\u00bf\tPer company policy, all new raw materials coming into the facility for use in our processes are evaluated for hazards/safety concerns. Where possible, less hazardous alternatives are selected for use in our facility. Chemicals that have unique hazards are identified and unique training sessions are provided to users of the material.\r\n\u00bf\tJones-Blair is inspected annually by various departments of the City of Dallas (for compliance with various permitting requirements), the Dallas Fire Dep"

We use TDI in our resin manufacturing process. It is stored in a single dedicated outdoor bulk storage tank. We have trained affected staff accordingly in its usage and handling. Safety precautions have been implemented to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to our own personal health as well as our co-workers, and to reduce the threat to nearby members of our community. We actively monitor the integrity of the bulk storage tank and have concrete containment walls in place. These steps help ensure that a release of TDI to the environment is unlikely.\r\n\r\nDescription of Stationary Source & Regulated Substance Handled:\r\nThe Jones-Blair Company currently handles Toluene Diisocyanate at a Program Level 1 threshold. We use TDI in our resin manufacturing process. It is stored in a single dedicated outdoor bulk storage tank, located in Tank Farm #2. The tank farm is enclosed within concrete containment walls.\r\n\r\nThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program & Chemical Specific Prevention Steps:\r\nThe plant has implemented programs and procedures that comply with EPA's Level 1 Accidental Release Prevention Program Rule. Our facility qualifies for Level 1 coverage because (1) our worst case release scenarios for TDI does not impact persons across the property boundary or the nearest public receptor, (2) TDI is not a substance covered by OSHA's process safety management standard (PSM), (3) The plant has had no release or accidents within the last five years related to a regulated substance, and (4) Jones-Blair has coordinated it's emergency respon"

Our plant has safety features on many units to help (1) contain or control a release, (2) quickly detect a release, and (3) reduce the consequences of or mitigate a release. The following types of safety features are used in various units of the TDI process:\r\n\u00bf\tProcess Alarms (Fill-Level)\r\n\u00bf\tSecondary containment to contain TDI liquid releases\r\n\u00bf\tAutomated shutdown systems (audible siren) for critical process parameters (e.g. high level, high pressure)\r\n\u00bf\tPressure/vacuum relief devices on vessels to prevent rupture or collapse\r\n\u00bf\tRemote shutdown of unloading and transfer pumps\r\n\u00bf\tPersonal protective equipment (e.g., protective clothing, self-contained breathing apparatus)\r\n\r\nFive Year Accident History:\r\nThe Jones-Blair Company has had no accidents over the last five years.\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program:\r\nOur emergency response program is based on the requirements in OSHA's Emergency Action and Fire Prevention Plan regulation, OSHA's HAZWOPER and Jones-Blair's SPCC Plan. Our program consists of procedures for responding to a release of any hazardous material on site, including TDI. \r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:\r\nThe Jones-Blair Company, LLC is committed to improvement in all aspects of performance. As part of ongoing efforts toward that goal, we have capital projects in process to help modernize our resin plant. All future additions to our workforce will receive appropriate training before beginning their job functions."
