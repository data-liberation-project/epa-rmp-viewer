Each of the Regulated Substances was evaluated for possible worse-case release scenarios and alternative release scenarios.  It is important to understand that Cedar Chemical Corporation has invested extensive resources to prevent releases and the potential for a worse-case release is extremely small.  The alternative release scenarios represent a more realistic potential for occurrence and are based on historical data from our processes or other similar processes.  By identifying these potential releases, Cedar Chemical Corporation has developed an extensive program to prevent such occurrences. This program is discussed in detail in the Prevention Program section of this plan.\nThe primary objective of performing the offsite consequences analysis is to determine the distance at which certain effects might occur to the public and/or the environment as a result of an accidental release.  This point is called the endpoint distance.  At distances less than the endpoint distance, the effects would be greater; at distances farther than the endpoint, the effects would be less.\n\n3.1  Hazard Assessment - Toxic Substances\n\nThe worst-case scenario (WCS) associated with Regulated Toxic Substances is a failure of a nitric acid storage tank containing 98,732 pounds of 98 percent by weight nitric acid. The nitric acid is spilled into a 19x19x2 foot diked area, which mitigates"

A primary component of this commitment is the Cedar Chemical Corporation's system that helps ensure the safe operation of our processes.  Our commitment is also demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of our processes, as well as, extensive training of our operating personnel. \nIn the event of an accidental release, Cedar Chemical Corporation has developed procedures which are designed to control and contain the release in a manner which will be safe for our employees and will help prevent injury to the public and the environment.  Cedar Chemical Corporation emergency response personnel receive thorough training in handling accidental releases.  An emergency response coordinator has been assigned to oversee any response activities and to coordinate response efforts with local emergency agencies.  Communications with the Local Emergency Response Committee (LEPC) have been ongoing throughout the preparation of this plan and policies.\nIn order to effectively implement the Company's release prevention and response policies, Cedar Chemical Corporation established a management system headed by the Environmental Manager to ensure the proper implementation and effectiveness of our Risk Management Program (RMP).\n\n\n2.0  Cedar Chemical Corporation And Regulated Substances\n\nCedar Chemical Corporation, located in Helena, Arkansas, is primarily involved in the manufacture of pesticides and agricultural products.  To manufacture our products, Cedar Chemical Corporation utilizes several regulated substances in sufficient quantities to be covered by the RMP rule.

Because of the facility's location, the toxic cloud formed by the evaporating nitric acid would reach offsite endpoints in populated areas and nearby public receptors.\nAn alternative release scenario (ARS) for nitric acid is a ruptured unloading hose spilling the 98 percent by weight nitric acid to the pavement.  There is no secondary containment to mitigate the release.  It would require the standby operator approximately 2 minutes to close the emergency valve to stop the release.  The toxic cloud formed by the evaporating nitric acid would reach nearby offsite receptors, but would not reach densely populated areas.\n\n3.2  Hazard Assessment - Flammable\n\nThe worst-case scenario (WCS) associated with a Regulated Flammable Substance is the failure of a rail tankcar containing 110,000 pounds of dimethylamine (DMA).  Though Cedar Chemical Corporation has numerous controls to prevent such releases, no administrative controls, passive mitigation or active mitigation measures were considered for this release scenario.  The maximum distance to the 1-psi overpressure would reach offsite endpoints in populated areas and nearby public receptors.\nIt should be noted that although not required by the RMP Rule, Cedar Chemical Corporation conducted WCS offsite consequence analyses on other flammable chemicals used at the facility.  These chemicals are used in processes which are covered by the OSHA Process Safety Management standard and have comprehensive safety programs in place to prevent and respond to releases.  WCS for some of these chemicals have similar offsite endpoints as the dimethylamine.\nAn alternative release scenario (ARS) for dimethylamine is a ruptured unloading hose resulting in a flash fire.  The maximum distance to the Lower Flammability Limit (LFL) endpoint would reach only nearby offsite receptors.\nAn alternative release scenario (ARS) for Hydrogen is the severing of the hydrogen gas line to the process unit resulting in a flash fire"

None of these scenarios would result in offsite consequences.\n\n\n4.0 Accidental Release Prevention Program-\nProgram 3\n\nThe Cedar Chemical Corporation Program 3 Prevention Program applies to three of the processes in our facility.  The processes covered by the Risk Management Program Rule are the Acifluorfen Process, the Diuron Process, and the DCA Process.  Other processes at Cedar Chemical Corporation are covered by the OSHA Process Safety Management standard. The requirements of the Risk Management Program Rule and the OSHA Process Safety Management standard are nearly identical.  Therefore, even the processes not covered by the Risk Management Program Rule have comprehensive programs in place to prevent releases of hazardous chemicals.  The Prevention Programs at Cedar Chemical Corporation consist of the following twelve elements:\n\n4.1  Process Safety Information\n\nCedar Chemical Corporation maintains a variety of technical documents that help ensure the safe operation of our processes.  These documents address:\n\n* physical properties of hazardous substances handled \n* chemical properties and associated hazards of those substances\n* operating parameters and limitation of the process equipment \n* design basis and configuration of the equipment \n* specific chemical inventories\n\nCedar Chemical Corporation ensures that the process safety information is available to all Cedar Chemical Corporation employees, the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC), and the local fire department.  The Environmental, Health and Safety Manager is responsible for maintaining and updating this information, as needed.\nChemical specific information, including"

Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\nTo perform the PHAs, Cedar Chemical Corporation primarily uses the HAZOP technique.  The PHAs are conducted using a team of people with experience in engineering and process operation and a leader with experience in process hazard analysis techniques. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and/or mitigation measures, when appropriate.  The team then prepares a written report describing the results of the analysis, including a list of recommendations ranked according to relative risk ratings assigned by the team.  Responsibility to resolve the recommendations is assigned to the process engineer and is tracked through completion.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, Cedar Chemical Corporation periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer in operation.  The results and findings of these updates are documented and retained.  The team findings are forwarded to the process engineer for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\n\n4.3  Operating Procedures\n\nCedar Chemical Corporation engineers, operators, and supervisors work together to develop and maintain written operating procedures to define how tasks related to process operation should be safely performed.

The following describe some of these safety features:\n\n5.1  Nitric Acid\n\nNitric acid is readily soluable in water. Diluting the concentrated acid with water quickly and effectively reduces the toxic cloud formation.  Water cannons are strategically located throughout the facility and ample amounts of water would be directed on a nitric acid release to reduce the formation of a vapor cloud.  Soda ash is kept on hand for neutralization of acid spills.  Holding tanks are available to hold spilled nitric acid and water until the material can be neutralized.\n\n5.2  Dimethylamine\n\nDimethylamine (DMA) is stored and used out of railroad tankcars to minimize the total amount in any single vessel.
