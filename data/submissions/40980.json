The emergency response program. \n\nThis facility's emergency response program is based upon the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency, United States Coast Guard, Department of Transportation, Occupational Safety and Health Administration and Local Emergency Planning Commission. The emergency response plan includes procedures for notification of the local fire and police authorities and notification of any potentially affected neighbors.   This plan has been submitted to and approved by the respective regulatory agencies and is reviewed on an annual basis.  The facility is subject to regular annual inspections by each of the aforementioned governmental agencies.\n\nAdditionally, to ensure that employees are adequately trained and prepared to respond to emergencies, they receive training in Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response (HAZWOPER), Emergency Action and Fire Prevention, Accidental Release Prevention, Environmental Awareness, and Terminal Safety Systems.  Employees also attend fire school at Texas A&M University and HAZWOPER refresher training annually.  \n\nFinally, the facility prepares for emergencies by conducting quarterly notification drills, semi-annual equipment deployment drills, annual tabletop exercises, and participates in area-wide drills that are conducted by governmental agencies.   \n\n6.

(\u00bfKinder Morgan\u00bf) distribution facility, we handle Vinyl Acetate Monomer (\u00bfVAM\u00bf) which is considered hazardous by EPA. The same properties that makes VAM valuable as a commodity also makes it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling VAM to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to our own personal health as well as our co-workers, and to reduce the threat to nearby members of the community. It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and state rules and regulations. Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle VAM combined with the safety devices inherent in the design of this facility combined with the safe handling procedures that we use and the training of our personnel. \n\nOur emergency response program is based upon the EPA, Coast Guard, DOT, OSHA and LEPC requirements. The emergency response plan includes procedures for notification of the local fire authority and notification of any potentially affected neighbors. \n\n2. The stationary source and regulated substances handled. \n\n\u00b7The primary purpose of this facility is to temporarily store, break bulk, and distribute VAM to both retail and wholesale customers. VAM is used as a raw material for manufacturing polyvinyl resins such as those used in latex paints, paper coating, adhesives, textile finishing, and safety glass interlayers. VAM is received by barge and stored in one 12,000 barrel storage tank (12-17).  This facility has equipment for loading / unloading ships, barges, rail cars and tank trucks. Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel and authorized contractors. \n\n\u00b7The regulated substance handled at this distribution facility is VAM. \n\n3.
