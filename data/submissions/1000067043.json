In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures in order to maintain skills and knowledge at an acceptable level. \r\n\r\nContractors\r\n\r\nNatgasoline uses contractors to supplement its work force during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities. Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, Natgasoline has procedures in place to provide that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform Natgasoline personnel of any hazards that they find during their work. This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, (4) safe work practices, and (5) a work permit process (i.e., for hot work, confined space, etc.) prior to their beginning work.

The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident. The investigation team, which can include contractors, will document its findings, develop recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forward these results to Natgasoline's management for resolution. Corrective actions will be taken in response to the investigation team's findings, and recommendations will be tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each finding or recommendation will be documented, and the investigation results will be reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings. \r\n\r\nCompliance Audit\r\n\r\nNatgasoline is a new site that has recently started operations; therefore, there are no relevant compliance audits to report at this"

      "SummaryText": "is review provides one additional check to corroborate that construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready. The review team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness. A review involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function.\r\n\r\nMechanical Integrity\r\n\r\nNatgasoline uses established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition. The basic aspects of this program include: \r\n\r\n\u00bf\tConducting training.\r\n\u00bf\tDeveloping written procedures.\r\n\u00bf\tPerforming inspections and tests.\r\n\u00bf\tCorrecting identified deficiencies. \r\n\u00bf\tApplying quality assurance measures. \r\n\r\nIn combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process equipment. To help ensure that they can perform their job in a safe manner, maintenance personnel receive training on: \r\n\r\n\u00bf\tAn overview of the process.\r\n\u00bf\tSafety and health hazards.\r\n\u00bf\tApplicable maintenance procedures.\r\n\u00bf\tEmergency response plans.\r\n\u00bf\tApplicable safe work practices. \r\n\r\nWritten procedures are used in the order that work is performed in a consistent manner and provide a basis for training. Inspections and tests are completed to evaluate equipment functioning as compared to that intended, and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels). If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service (if possible), or a management of change team will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment.\r\n\r\nAnother integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance. Natgasoline incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs. T"
