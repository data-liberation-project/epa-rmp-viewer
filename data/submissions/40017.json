Mechanical integrity addresses refinery fixed equipment, rotating equipment, electrical and instrument equipment and mobile/lifting equipment. \n\n4.9 Safe Work Practices. OIMS 5.1, Personnel Safety, identifies an expectation and provides a process for employees to contribute directly in every decision and task toward creating a safer work place. No business objective is so important that it will be pursued at the sacrifice of safety. \n\n4.10 Management of Change. OIMS 7.1, Management of Change, requires management of temporary or permanent modifications and changes.  The 7.1 System Plan provides the process for managing temporary or permanent changes to process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures.  Changes impacting these areas are evaluated and managed to ensure that safety, health and environmental risks arising from these changes remain at an acceptable level.\n\n4.11 Incident Investigation. OIMS 9.1, Incident Investigation and Analysis, requires incident investigation, reporting and follow-up.  The 9.1 System Plan documents the process implemented at Chalmette Refining to notify, investigate, report and perform follow-up for Safety, Health, Environmental and other incidents.  This process ensures the opportunity to learn from incidents and implement corrective action to prevent recurrence of the incidents. \n\n4.12 Compliance Audits. The PSM Assessment Program, under OIMS 11.1, Assessment and Improvement, defines the procedure, roles, and responsibilities used for conducting OSHA PSM Assessments at the Torrance Refinery.  The PSM Assessment is completed a minimum of once every 36 months.  The OSHA PSM Assessment may be conducted in concert with the OIMS External Assessment, or can be conducted by a qualified third party PSM Auditor. The PSM Assessment provides a field focus to complement the system focus of OIMS Assessments.  \n\n5. Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe processes at the Torrance Refinery hav"

The accident prevention program summarized previously is applied to covered processes at the Torrance Refinery.  Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by (1) equipment failures and (2) human errors.\n\nIn addition to the accident prevention program activities, the Torrance Refinery has safety features on many units to help (1) quickly detect a release, (2) contain/control a release and (3) reduce the consequences of (mitigate) a release.  The following types of safety features are used in various processes:\n\nRelease Detection\nHydrocarbon detectors with alarms\nHydrofluoric acid detectors with alarms\nTV surveillance cameras\n\nRelease Containment/Control\nProcess relief valves that discharge to a flare to capture and incinerate episodic releases\nValves to permit isolation of the process (manual or automated)\nAutomated shutdown systems for specific process parameters (e.g., high level, high temperature)\nCurbing or diking to contain liquid releases\nRedundant equipment and instrumentation\nAtmospheric relief devices\n\nRelease Mitigation\nFire suppression and extinguishing systems\nDeluge system for specific equipment\nTrained emergency response personnel\nPersonal protective equipment (e.g., protective clothing, self-contained breathing apparatus)\nBlast-resistant buildings to help protect control systems and personnel\n\n\nHF Acid Specific Prevention Steps \n\nExxonMobil has always had risk management programs that are specific to the HF alkylation process to address prevention, early detection and mitigation.  Since 1999, additional enhanced risk management strategies have been implemented to supplement these historical programs.

Emergency Response Program Information\n\nOIMS 10.1, Emergency Preparedness, requires prompt, thorough and effective emergency response to protect the Torrance Refinery's employees, contractors, the surrounding community, the environment, and the plant facilities.  System Plan 10.1 provides the organizational structure and response plans that are clear, well documented, and accessible to both ExxonMobil and governmental response personnel.  This System Plan also identifies responsibilities and activities necessary to maintain the refinery's fixed and mobile loss prevention and emergency response equipment. \n\n7.

Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n     \nThe ExxonMobil Torrance Refinery's process operations involve the handling, use, processing, or storage of hazardous materials that may present a certain degree of risk. The Torrance Refinery is committed to conducting business in a manner that addresses the environmental needs of the communities in which we operate, and that protects the safety and health of our employees, those involved in our operations, our customers and the public. These commitments are documented in our safety, health, environmental, and security policies.  These policies are put into practice through a disciplined management framework called Operations Integrity Management System (OIMS).\nThe Torrance Refinery's OIMS framework establishes expectations for controlling operations integrity risks inherent in our business.  OIMS addresses all aspects of our business, including security, that can impact safety, health and environmental performance.  OIMS encompasses all elements of OSHA's Process Safety Management standard and of EPA's Risk Management Program.\n\nThe OIMS framework includes 11 elements. Each element contains an underlying principle and a set of expectations.  The OIMS framework also includes the characteristics of, and processes\nfor, evaluating and implementing OI Management Systems. Application of the OIMS framework is  required across the facility, with particular emphasis on design, construction and operations.  Management is responsible for ensuring that management systems satisfying the framework are put in place. \n\nThe 11 OIMS elements are:\n1. Management, Leadership, Commitment and Accountability\n2. Risk Assessment and Management\n3. Facilities Design and Construction\n4. Information/Documentation\n5. Personnel and Training\n6. Operations and Maintenance\n7. Management of Change\n8. Third-Party Services\n9. Incident Investigation and Analysis\n10."
