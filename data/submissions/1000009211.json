The Facility Policy\n\nThe owners, management of Van Buskirk Fertilizer, Ringling, Oklahoma are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire dept. or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application and for crop production\nnutrients. \nThe Maximum quantity stored would be 78,795 pounds in our 18,000 gallon storage tank. Due to the rounding requirements of the RMP Submit Program, the 78,795 pounds is rounded to 80,000 pounds.\n\n3. The worst-case release scenario and the alternative scenario.\n\na. The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of the storage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes. The maximum quantity release would be 78,795 pounds, which represents the\nvolume of the storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limiled by design standards. The distance to the \nendpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 2.4 miles.\n\nb. The alternative release scenario based on the most likely potential incident is a release from a break in a transfer hose. The distance to the endpoint (Point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is .83 miles.\n\n4. The accidental release prevention program\n\nThe facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, Kk-611.1\", published by The Aamerican National Standards Institute, Inc., and\nthe standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29CFR 1910.111, \n\"Storage and handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\".\n\n5. The Five-year Accident History\n\na. There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the"

Provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information\nas required under SARA Title III (EPCRA) ;\n\nc.A written emergency response program, in accordance with OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.120 including pre-emergency planning and employee training.\n\n7. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nPeriodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions. Safety improvement is  an on-going process at the facility. There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
