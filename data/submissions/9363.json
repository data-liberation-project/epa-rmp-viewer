The process makes hydrocyanic acid (HCN) as a coproduct and includes the storage tanks for ACRN and HCN as well as the propylene storage tanks and feed system. Propylene is an ingredient for the process. Everything in this prevention plan applies to all the units, with the following exceptions:\n- The ACRN production plant is separated into systems for the purpose of performing PHA studies to spread the PHA load over five years. The PHA information shown is for the most recent PHA performed on the HCN storage system. The dates of the other pertinent PHA's are 12/31/98, propylene storage, 12/31/97, ACRN plant reaction system, 12/31/95, ACRN recovery system and 10/31/94, ACRN purification and ACRN storage. A separate PHA is also performed for the dock loading and unloading operations. This PHA was last updated 1/31/96.\n- The HCN and ACRN detectors apply only for HCN and ACRN respectively, and are used as both process area detectors and perimeter monitors.\n- The propylene detectors apply only to propylene and are used as perimeter monitors.\n- The sprinkler system is not used in the ACRN storage area.\n- The foam system is only used in the ACRN storage area.\n- The flare pistol is only used to mitigate HCN releases.\n- The deluge system, water monitors, are only used at the propylene tank farm.\n- Scrubbers are only used in ACRN service on the ACRN storage tank vents, and on Hydroquinone (HQ) and Methyl Ether of Hydroquinone (MEHQ) make up tanks.\n- All relief valves for toxics and flammables in the ACRN plant and the HCN storage area are routed to a flared vent system except for the ammonia feed system.",

In the case of HCN, material is loaded and stored in rail cars designed for HCN shipping when our on-site customer, the ICI methyl methacrylate (MMA) plant, is shutdown for an extended period for routine or emergency maintenance and repairs. HCN is a coproduct of the ACRN plant and it is not always possible to match the production requirements for HCN and ACRN. When MMA plant using the HCN is back on line, the HCN stored in rail cars is unloaded into the HCN storage tanks feeding the MMA plant.",

      "SummaryText": "DUPONT BEAUMONT WORKS RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\nAt the DuPont Beaumont Plant, we are committed to operating and maintaining all our processes in a safe and responsible manner. Our plant adheres to the DuPont Corporate policies, which are summarized as follows:\n       > All Safety and Environmental incidents are preventable\n       > The Goal is Zero - Zero Incidents Period\n       > All employees and contractors are responsible for their safety.\nThe DuPont Corporate policies are embodied in numerous Safety, Health and Environmental (SHE) and Engineering Standards, which apply globally.  At the Beaumont Plant, the policies are implemented through the Beaumont SHE manual called \"Safety How\". This manual is available to all site employees via the computer intranet system. Safety How Volume III in particular deals with Process Safety Management systems and requirements and contains the complete Emergency Response Plan for the Beaumont site.\nFACILITY DESCRIPTION\nOur facility is located on Highway 347 between the cities of Beaumont and Nederland, Texas. The DuPont Beaumont site consists of three manufacturing processes: An Anhydrous Ammonia plant, an Acrylonitrile Plant and an Aniline plant. The products from these plants are Anhydrous Ammonia, Carbon Dioxide, Acrylonitrile (ACRN), Hydrocyanic Acid (HCN), Acetonitrile Azeotrope and Aniline. Anhydrous ammonia, ACRN and HCN are regulated toxic substances. In the production of these products, the following additional regulated substances are used as raw materials, intermediates or additives:\nToxics - Sulfur Dioxide and Chlorine\nFlammables - Propylene\nKEY OFF SITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS SCENARIOS\nWorst Case Toxic Release Scenario\nThe worst case release scenario for a toxic chemical is the failure of the cold anhydrous ammonia storage tank. The maximum capacity of this tank is 34,000,000 lbs, with no mitigation assumed. This release has off site impact, as determined by the"

      "SummaryText": " use of the OCA Guidance. This release is highly unlikely due to the double-wall, double integrity tank construction and the high-integrity design of the tank and associated equipment.\nWorst Case Flammable Release Scenario\nThe worst case release scenario for a flammable chemical is failure in propylene storage. releasing the contents of seven tanks, or failure of a barge used for interim storage. Amount released is 1,400,000 lbs. The entire content is released in 10 minutes and assumed to vaporize and ignite. The release has off site impact as determined using the OCA Guidance. This scenario is unlikely as it ignores the vessel cooling by evaporation and flow restriction due to two phase flow. No mitigation is assumed. There are propylene detectors and water cannons surrounding the storage area and remotely operated shut off valves. \nAlternate Toxic Release Scenarios\nAnhydrous Ammonia - A 1 inch hole develops in any of the piping associated with the Ammonia transer facilities. The release rate is 600 lbs./min based on the system pumping capability and typical pipeline pressures. Because the leak may be in a remote location, the release was assumed to last 60 minutes. The presence of perimeter leak detectors and emergency response was assumed. This release has off site impact as determined using the OCA Guidance Tables. However no residential populations are affected.\nHydrocyanic Acid - A 1 inch branch connection is ruptured in any of the piping associated with HCN transfer. The release rate of 125 lbs./min. is based on normal pumping rates. There are HCN sensors located throughout the HCN handling areas, so a leak will be detected and located quickly. The release duration used was 10 minutes. Emergency response drills have confirmed a leak can be detected and isolated in 10 minutes. This scenario has off site impact as determined using the OCA Guidance Tables, but has no affect on residential populations.\nAcrylonitrile - A 1 inch hole develops in one of the ACRN sto"

A release duration of 15 minutes was assumed since the storage tanks are monitored continuously. The storage tanks are diked. No other active mitigation was assumed. The vapor release rate was calculated to be 276 lbs./min based on the evaporation rate from the pool. This scenario has off site impact as determined using the OCA Guidance Tables, but does not impact any residential populations.\nSulfur Dioxide - The loading hose ruptures releasing a maximum of 700 lbs./min. of liquid SO2 for a maximum of 15 seconds. The actual flow rate will be much lower because flashing will severely choke the flow. Since the unloading operation is manned 100% of the time, the emergency valve will be shut within 15 seconds. Approximately 18 lbs./min. of SO2 vapor is generated from the spill for ten minutes. No other mitigation was assumed. The scenario will have off site impact as determined using the OCA Guidance Tables, but no residential populations are affected.\nChlorine - The connecting tubing from a one ton chlorine cylinder to the supply header is ruptured releasing 22 lbs./min. for 60 minutes. The release is detected by operator patrols, the operations area responds in full acid suits with SCBA and shuts off the cylinder. No other mitigation was assumed. This release has off site impact as determined using the OCA Tables, but no residential populations are affected.\nAlternate Flammable Release Scenarios\nPropylene - A propylene relief valve lifts in the storage area releasing 530 lbs./hr at ambient temperature. Propylene detectors sound an alarm and operations personnel isolate the tank using remote operated shut off valves and use available water monitors to cool down the tank and stop the release in 15 minutes. If the vapor cloud finds an ignition source, the impact area has off site impact to traffic on the Neches River immediately adjacent to the propylene storage "
