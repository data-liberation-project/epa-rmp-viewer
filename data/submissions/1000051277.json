One of the Authority's missions is to recruit, train and motivate personnel capable of carrying forward this policy in the years to come.\n\nThe Authority's Safety Code provides rules and guidelines for safe working conditions for all employees.  The sole purpose of the Authority's Safety Code is to eliminate unsafe acts and unsafe conditions that cause or could cause bodily injury and/or property damage.  No employee is required to work in conditions that are unsafe or unhealthy.  Each employee has the responsibility to detect unsafe situations and to immediately advise their supervisor of an unsafe situation that is beyond their ability or authority to correct.\n\nBoth instructions and special safety equipment are provided specifically as it has to do with chlorine handling and delivery in addition to general chemical handling, storage and first aid.\n\nWestern Berks Water Authority and Chlorine\n\nChlorine is a very important part of our overall water treatment process and is necessary to insure that the water we produce is free of harmful organisms.  Chlorination of the water occurs at the beginning of the filtration process and again at the end to maintain a residual level in the finished water.  Between the two applications of chlorine, the water is treated with a coagulant to form a precipitate that brings small particles together into larger more readily removed particles.\n\nFor more information on our treatment process and other information about the Authority, visit our website at http://www.wbwa.org\n\nIn the course of one year's time, the authority operators deal with approximately sixty to seventy one-ton chlorine cylinders.

These conditions serve to virtually eliminate the exposure the cylinders would have to sources of heat and therefore the likelihood of fusible plug failure, much less complete cylinder failure.  A vacuum regulator is attached to the gas discharge valve of the chlorine cylinder for the withdraw of chlorine gas.  The vacuum regulator is basically a spring-loaded diaphram valve that requires a vacuum to be present for the valve to open.

The vacuum regulator will close if there is insufficient vacuum as a result of a diminished water supply or a break in the chlorine gas line.  Chlorine gas is conducted through the lines under a vacuum and not under pressure; chlorine gas is under pressure only from the cylinder to the vacuum regulator mounted directly to the cylinder valve.  Maintenance of the vacuum regulators and chlorinators is performed bi-annually by certified representatives of the manufacturer.

The results are those which were prepared using the Safer Systems, Inc. TRACE Version 8 dispersion model as obtained from the Chlorine Institute, Inc. Pamphlet 74, Edition 3, dated April 1998.  The scenario requires that the container be completely compromised, a situation which, as described above, is considered remote.  It is believed that a more likely source of a leak would be from a valve failure of some sort and that is considered as the alternative release scenario.  This scenario was chosen based on the history of the Authority's lack of a chlorine release from its start-up in 1974 through the present time.  The cylinder valve is recognized as the one single component which is operated during each cylinder change operation and which serves as the only control device for chlorine which is under pressure prior to the vacuum regulator.\n\nWhile the alternative release scenario does not take mitigation into account, the Authority conducts plant familiarization tours with the fire departments that would respond to the facility on the initial alarm. The purpose of these tours is to provide an insight to the chemicals utilized in the water treatment process including locations, quantities, and hazards.  Through the Incident Command System, the resources and capabilities of the Berks County Level III Hazardous Materials Team would be called upon to provide mitigation of the situation.

This in itself is not an accient or an anomaly, but rather an indicator of the care, concern, and knowledge exhibited by the operators.\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nThe emergency response program begins with the early recognition of a problem through the activation of the chlorine leak detector.  The on-duty plant operator performs notification of the various emergency response agencies from the local 911 system up through the National Response Center and the state regulatory agency.  The Berks County Local Emergency Planning Committee's Off-site Emergency Response Plan for the Western Berks Water Authority has established localities at risk, methods of public notification, and mass care centers.

Connections are tested after the cylinder valve is \"cracked\" open utilizing a container of 26-degree Baume aqua ammonia (ammonium hydroxide) solution.  Routine preventive maintenance is performed on the vacuum regulators and chlorinators to maintain these components in the proper working condition.\n\n\n\nFive-year Accident History\n\nThere have been no accidents involving the chlorination system at the Western Berks Water Authority from the time of start-up in August of 1974 through the present time.  This in itself is not an accident or an anomaly, but rather an indicator of the care, concern, and knowledge exhibited by the operators.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nThe emergency response program begins with the early recognition of a problem through the activation of the chlorine leak detector.  The on-duty plant operator performs notification of the various emergency response agencies from the local 911 system up through the National Response Center and the state regulatory agency.  The Berks County Local Emergency Planning Committee's Off-site Emergency Response Plan for the Western Berks Water Authority has established localities at risk, methods of public notification, and mass care centers.  A copy of this plan is provided to the township emergency management coordinator, the first due fire department, the local emergency medical service organization, and the township police department."
