      "SummaryText": "Overview\n\nThe City of Hallandale has long emphasized the importance of safety in all departments and is committed to the implementation of safety practices. This emphasis on safety also includes the handling of chemicals. Programs and policies have been established for employee safety. Many of these same policies/procedures also provide for the safety of the general public. The Risk Management Plan consolidates many of these safety procedures into one comprehensive plan. Although there are many chemicals that are used by the City to provide for City services, the Risk Management Plan is concerned with only one - chlorine.\n\n    Facility and Material Handled \n\nThe facility affected by the Risk Management Plan is the water treatment plant. The water plant is responsible for providing the City with potable drinking water. The plant treats the water in accordance with Federal and State regulatory requirements. Part of this treatment process includes disinfection. Disinfection is the most important part of the treatment process because it acts as a barrier to prevent the transmission of water borne deseases. Since 1951 the chemical used for disinfection in Hallandale has been chlorine. Chlorine is delivered to the water plant in one ton cylinders (2,000 ibs).  In the treatment process, only one cylinder is used at a time. However, as many as six cylinders (12,000 lbs) may be stored in reserve at the water plant at any one time.\n\n   Worst - Case Release and Alternative Release Scenarios \n\nThe release scenarios were derived using RMP*COMP developed by the Cameo Team at the Hazardous Materials Response and Assessment Division, NOAA, and the Chemical Emergency Prevention and Preparedness Office of the EPA.\nIn a worst - case scenario, all 2,000 lbs of a chlorine cylinder would be released in 10 minutes. The estimated distance to toxic endpoint is 1.3 miles. Offsite impact may include residences, commercial or idustrial areas, schools, and recreation areas.\nIn the more l"

Offsite impact may include residences and commercial or industrial areas.\n\n   Accidental Release Prevention\n\nBecause of the potential consequences of an accidental release, significant care is used when handling chlorine. Some of the safety protocols include:\n- Contracting reliable chlorine distributors.\n- Establishing procedures for deliveries\n- Utilizing dispensing facilities that minimize the potential for an accidental release.\n- Establihing procedures for maintaining the handling, dispensing, and detection facilities.\n- Establishing policies for the training of operational staff on handling and connection procedures.\n- Utilizing only proficiently trained and experienced staff for chemical handling.\n\n  Five Year Acident History\n\nThere have been no accidental releases in the last five years.\n\n   Emergency Response Program\n\nIn the event of a chemical release, emergency response may be broken dowm into two catagories - defensive and offense.\nDefensive - Water plant operators, as public safety responders are to call 911 and notify Hallandale's Fire Department of the release. Concurrent notification of the local Hazardous Materials Response Team would also occur. The Hallandale Fire Department, upon ariving at the release, would evaluate the release with operational staff and establish command. They would then establish hot, warm and cold zones, and evaluate/execute necessary evacuations. They would also coordinate mitigation efforts with the Haz-Mat Team.\nOffensive - The responding Haz-Mat Team is the special tecnical responder that pro-actively works to terminate the chemical release. Although it coordinates it's effort with the Hallandale Fire Department, it's primary goal is to stop the release. It has the necessary equipment and training to perform this task.\nRecord keeping, debriefing, and post-incident analysis would occur after ternination of the release. Appropriate reg"

However, in October, 1999, the City is planning to retain a consultant to review all applicable procedures and emergency response plans and to revise them as needed. All operators will then be trained to assure compliance with all safety procedures."
