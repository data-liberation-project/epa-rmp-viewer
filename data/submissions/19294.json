      "SummaryText": "I.   EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nIntroduction\nThe Terra Nitrogen Beaumont Methanol facility located in Beaumont, TX manufactures methanol and anhydrous ammonia.  The original RMP, submitted on 6/16/99, included information on flammable synthesis gas containing hydrogen and methane present at the facility in quantities less than the 10,000 pound threshold.  Beaumont Methanol chose to submit an initial RMP even though there was not a threshold quantity of RMP listed flammable gases at the facility in order to inform its employees and community neighbors of potential risks posed by its operations.  The methanol plant was modified in 1999 to allow co-production of anhydrous ammonia.  As a result of the modification, anhydrous ammonia will be present at the facility in an amount above the threshold quantity beginning in January 2000.  This revised RMP includes updated information for anhydrous ammonia as well as the information included in the original RMP for flammable synthesis gas.\n\nIt is Terra Nitrogen's policy to prevent accidental releases from the Beaumont Methanol facility by effective Process Safety Management programs and procedures.  This includes the following:\n\n*Participation by all plant employees in every element of PSM.\n\n*Conduct regular scheduled process hazards analysis.\n\n*Utilize current and accurate process safety information.\n\n*Maintain current and accurate written operating procedures.\n\n*Provide timely and comprehensive training for all employees involved in operating and maintaining process equipment.\n\n*Oversee the activities of contractors and ensuring that they are trained to perform their job safely.\n\n*Follow established pre-startup safety review and management of change procedures to ensure that modifications are adequately evaluated for safety.\n\n*Administer a comprehensive mechanical integrity program to ensure that process equipment is maintained in accordance with good engineering practice and accepted industry standards.\n\n*Investigate incidents when"

      "SummaryText": " they do occur to promptly correct deficiencies and learn from the experience.\n\n*Audit the entire PSM program on a regular basis to verify that elements, procedures, and systems are in place and adequate.\n\n*Maintain a current and accurate written emergency response plan and participate in a well trained and equipped onsite emergency response team.\n\n*A system to notify facility neighbors in the event of a release, and to coordinate emergency response planning with local authorities and exercise those plans annually.\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis\nBeaumont Methanol's Toxic Worst Case Scenario involves ammonia and has offsite impact.  The Alternative Release Scenario for ammonia is a 2\" pipe break, resulting in the release of 5,400 pounds over a 10-minute period.  The distance to the toxic endpoint for ammonia (200 ppm) from the alternative release scenario is estimated to be 0.35 miles.  Beaumont Methanol's Flammable Worst Case Scenario involves hydrogen and does not have offsite impact.  The Alternative Release Scenario for hydrogen is a 1\" pipe break resulting in a release of 540 pounds over 10-minute period.  The distance to the flammable endpoint (3.3% volume-LFL) is estimated to be 0.06 miles.  The impact from the Alternative Release Scenario for hydrogen is limited by emergency shutdown procedures.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\nThe Beaumont facility has a comprehensive Process Safety Management (PSM) Program and is subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's standard for process safety management of highly hazardous chemicals found at 29 CFR Part 1910.119.  Key elements of the PSM program include: 1) stringent design standards of equipment which incorporate substantial safety factors and include state of the art monitoring and control instrumentation; 2) extensive process safety information that is accurate and up to date; 3)  well trained operating, maintenance, and contractor personnel; 4) written operating, maintenance, and safe wor"

The facility is a participant in the Beaumont Industrial Park Emergency Response Team.  Beaumont facility personnel are active members of the Jefferson County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  The plant exercises its emergency response plan annually."
