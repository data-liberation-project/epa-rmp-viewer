Accidental Release Prevention and Response Policies\n\nThe Mobil Chemical Company, Beaumont Chemical Plant, in Beaumont, Texas manufactures base stock chemicals for plastics and synthetic fabrics and synthetic lube oils. The Chemical Complex maintains a policy to be a good business partner and a safe and conscientious neighbor who operates the facility in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. \n\nThe Chemical Complex has a standing commitment to worker and public safety.  This is evidenced by:\n- our history of support and commitment to the community;\n- our high environmental standards; and \n- our participation as a STAR facility in the U. S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Voluntary Protection Program (VPP) since 1984.\n\nThe Chemical Complex utilizes a management system framework called Operations Integrity Management System (OIMS) to effectively establish safety, health, and environmental expectations and manage operating integrity risks.  OIMS addresses all aspect of the business including security measures to prevent unnecessary on-site human exposure and to minimize the potential for any offsite exposure.  The 11 OIMS elements are: \n\n1. Management, Leadership, Commitment and Accountability\n2. Risk Assessment and Management\n3. Facilities Design and Construction\n4. Information/Documentation\n5. Personnel and Training\n6. Operations and Maintenance\n7. Management of Change\n8. Third-Party Services\n9. Incident Investigation and Analysis\n10. Community Awareness and Emergency Preparedness\n11. Operations Integrity Assessment and Improvement\n\n2.  Description of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nAs of July 2002, the ExxonMobil Beaumont Chemical O/A Plant EPA Facility ID:100000152103 and the ExxonMobil Beaumont Chemical Specialty Plant EPA Facility ID 100000061096 merged"

Therefore, both sites, which are located on contiguous property, are being reported within this risk management plan.  The Beaumont Chemical Specialty Plant EPA Facility ID 100000061096 was de-registered as a single stationary source and included within this Beaumont Chemical Plant plan.  The Chemical Complex contains the RMP regulated flammable substances of hydrogen, methane, ethane, ethylene, acetylene, propane, propylene, isobutane, 2-methylpropene, butane, butene, crude butadiene, pentane, pentene, and isopentane.  In addition, the O/A Plant uses chlorine for water treatment and the BCSP Plant uses boron trifluoride for synthetic lube processes.\n\n3.  General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nTo ensure that our risk management program is appropriately developed and implemented, our Site Manager has assigned the role of RMP Coordinator to a staff member with the necessary background, training, and experience.  The RMP Coordinator, acting with the authority delegated directly from the Site Manager, has the responsibility for the development and implementation of our risk management programs.\n\nThe Chemical Complex has developed effective programs to comply with the industry's most stringent environmental, health, and safety standards.  Our plant adheres to the American Chemistry Council's mandatory Responsible Care\u00ae Program.  Mobil Chemical Company was the first in the nation to have all of its facilities certified as STAR facilities in OSHA's VPP.  Facilities in the STAR program are required to demonstrate exemplary safety performance and agree to work cooperatively with OSHA to serve as an example for the industry as a whole.  They are audited by OSHA for compliance every few years.  Both sites in the Chemical Complex were among the first facilities in the nation to earn the prestigious STAR recognit"

Our OIMS elements address each of the essential features of successful accident prevention programs including:\n\n- Employee participation\tOIMS Element 1, 2, and 5\n- Process safety information\tOIMS Element 4\n- Process hazard analysis\tOIMS Element 2\n- Incident investigation\tOIMS Element 9\n- Operating procedures\tOIMS Element 6\n- Training\tOIMS Element 5\n- Mechanical integrity\tOIMS Element 6\n- Management of change \tOIMS Element 7\n- Pre-startup safety review\tOIMS Element 7\n- Hot work permit\tOIMS Element 6\n- Contractor safety\tOIMS Element 8\n- Compliance audits\tOIMS Element 6 and 11\n\nOur RMP uses these individual elements to prevent accidental chemical releases.  \n\nIn addition to our industry-leading management programs, we have designed state-of-the-art systems and equipment to control, prevent, detect, and mitigate potential accidental releases. \n\nWe employ extensive mechanical integrity and preventive maintenance programs to ensure the integrity of our equipment and safety systems.  Our mechanical integrity program uses equipment surveillance and preventive maintenance activities to identify equipment that may be in need of repair or replacement, before failure occurs.  This program also specifies the repairs (or parts replacement) needed to maintain equipment in acceptable operating condition.\n\nWe train our employees to safely perform their assigned tasks.  Our training program includes new employee training as well as periodic refresher training and training updates when major process or equipment changes are made.  As part of our training, we include provisions for ensuring that employees understand the covered material, including written tests and field demonstrations.\n\n4.  Five-Year Accident History\n\nThe Chemical Complex had two accidents that met the criteria for the Five-Year Accident"

      "SummaryText": "History.  One event involved an act of pipeline sabotage that resulted in an offsite release of a regulated flammable substance and a limited precautionary evacuation.  The other event involved a tubing failure resulting in an offsite release of a regulated flammable substance and a limited precautionary evacuation.\n\n5.  Emergency Response Program Information\n\nThe Chemical Complex Emergency Response Plan which is outlined and managed under OIMS Element 10 serves as the final line of defense against, and the mechanism for response to, accidental releases and other emergencies.  The Chemical Complex has an extensive emergency preparedness organization which includes resources from the ExxonMobil Beaumont Refinery.  Emergency drills and exercises are conducted frequently and coordinated with the City of Beaumont's Fire Department, various government agencies (TCEQ, Coast Guard, LEPC), local hospitals, and the news media.\n\n6.  Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThe Chemical Complex is a STAR facility in OSHA's Voluntary Protection Program.  We are continually improving our safety, health, and environmental programs.  We are conducting on-going incident command system training and pre planning for emergencies, and improving stewardship of incident investigations as a key performance indicator."
