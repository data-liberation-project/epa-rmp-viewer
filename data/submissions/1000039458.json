If a situation has impact beyond the\r\nborders of Columbia County, the county-wide emergency plan provides for coordination\r\nwith adjoining counties and parishes.\r\n     All of our south Arkansas facilities use the same basic accidental release\r\nprevention and emergency response programs.  Using the same plan makes training\r\neasier and coordination with local off site responders better.  Details of the emergency\r\nplans (such as maps; locations of response equipment) are different due to the physical\r\ndifferences in the facilities.\r\n\r\nRegulated substances handled at the South Plant:\r\n     The South Plant is known to handle as many as fifteen listed chemicals in up to\r\n21 processes.  Information on the handling and storage was gathered.  Approximately eleven\r\nregulated chemicals in eight processes were found to be subject to the RMP rule.  The\r\naccidental release prevention and emergency response programs are exactly the same\r\nfor covered and non-covered processes; covered and non-covered chemicals are both\r\nsubject to both programs.  A detailed incident reporting system is Lotus Notes Based.\r\n     The Risk Management Program has been incorporated into the PSM program to\r\nprovide continuity.  A description of our risk management program is found below.  \r\n\r\nOur accidental release prevention program:\r\n         The South Plant Facility is subject to the OSHA PSM standard.  We have internal\r\nprocedures which drive compliance with both the OSHA PSM standard and the EPA RMP standard.\r\n     We have compiled detailed information on all process (both covered and non-covered) \r\nwhich includes hazard information on each substance, technical process\r\ninformation, and process equipment information.  This information is used in the\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA).\r\n     PHA's have been conducted on all proce"

The PHA identifies any and all possible mishaps, the likelihood and\r\nconsequences of mishaps, and predicts how safety and mitigation systems will perform\r\nin the event of a mishap.  For each PHA, a team is formed which possesses the\r\nrequisite expertise in engineering, process operations, hazard analysis, industrial\r\nhygiene, safety systems, and emergency response.  Several standard methods may be\r\nused to analyze the available information, and more than one method may be applied\r\nto a process hazard analysis.  The PHA documentation is retained for the life of the\r\nprocess.  This information is used to eliminate hazards when possible, and mitigate\r\nthose hazards when elimination is not possible or impractical.\r\n     Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) exist when each process is first started\r\nup, and undergo continual review and improvement.  Some of the items included in\r\nSOP's are procedures for start-ups, shut-downs, routine or hazardous procedures,\r\noperation of safety and environmental control systems, and mitigation of process\r\nhazards.  SOPs are updated to reflect current operating conditions.  Each SOP is\r\nreviewed no less often than annually.\r\n     Training is the key aspect of accident prevention.  Each employee in an\r\noperating process receives job specific and general training on safety and health\r\nhazards, emergency operations, and safe work practices.  This training is administered\r\naccording to the needs of the employee and the specific requirements of the program.  \r\n     Preventative Maintenance (PM) is an integral part of our accidental release\r\nprevention program.

Sometimes, tasks involving welding, cutting, braising, or other\r\nflame or spark producing activities, must be performed in areas where flammable\r\nchemicals are present.  Hot work permits insure fire prevention and protection\r\nrequirements have been implemented prior to beginning the work.  Another essential\r\npart of the risk management program is the use of lock out/ tag out procedures. \r\nWhen a safe work permit is issued, the permit requires the permittee to assure that all\r\nsources of potential energy have been deactivated.  For instance, the permittee may\r\nperform the following procedures before working on a pump: Check the Safe Work\r\nPermit to make assure operations has purged and drained the pump; check the red\r\ntags in place to make sure the pump is isolated from the process; and place a personal\r\nlocking device on the electrical switchgear energizing the pump.  No employee can\r\nremove a red tag, actuate a tagged component, or remove a personal locking device\r\nplaced by another employee.  \r\n     We depend on contractors and contract employees for many essential services. \r\nUnder our PSM program, we insure that contractor preformed maintenance, repair, and\r\ngeneral operations are preformed safely.

This format is\r\ncommonly known as the One Plan.  This particular format was developed to address\r\nthe off site responder need for simplicity while complying with all regulatory\r\nrequirements.  \r\n     The emergency response program is based on the principle that the facility\r\nshould respond to incidents within the scope of the facility's expertise, while the local\r\nauthorities respond within the scope of the Columbia County Emergency Response\r\nPlan.  This means that the facility is responsible for preventing incidents before they\r\nhappen.

      "SummaryText": "About our Facility:\r\n     The South Plant Facility is located in rural Columbia County, about six miles\r\nsouth of Magnolia, Arkansas.  Land use in the immediate vicinity of the site is primarily\r\nagricultural, with silviculture predominating.  The plant is located astride a low hill or\r\nridge east of Horsehead Creek. \r\n     The location of the plant is due to the presence of natural brine deposits located\r\nabout 1.5 miles beneath the plant.  These brines are withdrawn through a system of\r\nwells and processed to produce bromine and hydrogen sulfide, and then replaced into\r\nthe same geologic formation by a second system of wells.  \r\n     The South Plant produces bromine, sulfur, fire retardants, pesticides and\r\npesticide intermediates, clear completion fluids and other speciality chemicals.  \r\n\r\nAbout our accidental release prevention and emergency response policies:\r\n     The South Plant Facility has very active accidental release prevention and\r\nemergency response programs.  It is the policy of the South Plant Facility to reduce the\r\nrisk of chemical release to the extent feasible.  The main vehicle for chemical risk\r\nreduction is the Process Safety Management (PSM) program.  When the OSHA PSM\r\nstandard was promulgated, existing programs were subsumed into the PSM program\r\nfollowing the OSHA standard.  \r\n     The Policy of the South Plant is to first prevent the occurrence of emergency\r\nsituations, but if prevention measures are unsuccessful, to respond to those situations\r\nin a professional and appropriate manner.  The site has an integrated Emergency Plan\r\nwhich follows EPA's One Plan concept.  South Plant personnel respond to\r\nemergencies on site with a trained fire brigade, HazMat responders, and a corps of\r\ntrained EMTs.  The emergency plan provides for coordination with local care givers, first\r\nresponders, law enforcement, and the county emergency response infrastructure\r\nthrough the county-wide emergency plan.  \r\n     Briefly, if a chemical incident appear"
