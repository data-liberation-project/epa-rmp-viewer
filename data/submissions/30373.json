We will comply with all environmental regulations and policies. Operating our plant without spills or releases is equivalent to operating with zero injuries and of higher priority than production. It is our responsibility to operate and maintain our plant without spills to prevent any impact on ourselves, our coworkers and the community around us. Our business and customers expect us to operate in this manner.\" \n\nIn addition we have environmental and safety \"cardinal rules\" that cover proper operation of pollution control equipment, data integrity, reporting of all spills and releases, and change management for all process revisions. \n\n\nBayport Facility and Chemicals Handled:\n\nThe Bayport plant is a chemical manufacturing facility. Primary products are specialty monomers, herbicides, and biocides. End use applications range from contact lenses and cosmetics to oil field drilling fluids and soy bean crops.\n\nWe handle chlorine in 180,000 lb. rail cars, ethylene oxide and propylene oxide in 165,000 lb. rail cars, nitric acid in 110,000 lb. capacity tank and monomethylamine in a 38,000 lb. capacity tank.\n\n\nWorst Case and Alternative Case Release Scenarios:\n\nThe worst case toxic release scenario is the EPA defined complete release of 180,000 lb. chlorine from a rai"

For this case, per EPA look up tables, the chlorine would carry 14 miles and impact of approximately 740,546 people. \n\nThe alternative release case for chlorine is the release of 61 lb. of chlorine from a hose failure. In this case the emergency shut down systems function (excess flow valves, chlorine detectors, remote shut off valves, trained personnel, etc.). While the projected release leaves our property, no residences are impacted.   \n\nFor ethylene oxide and propylene oxide the alternative release scenarios are failure of our air pollution control device. With detection (process control instrumentation) and response (shut down of unit operation) neither of  the 3750 lb. releases travel off site, and thus no residences are impacted.\n\nFor nitric acid, the alternative release scenario is 1499 lb. of nitric acid from a failed 2\" transfer hose. With detection (operating procedures require personnel monitor transfer) and response (shut down of transfer by closing valves and stopping pump) the release does not travel offsite and thus no residences are impacted. \n\nThe worst case flammable release scenario is the EPA defined complete release of 38,000 lb. monomethylamine from a tank in 10 minutes with complete failure of our emergency systems and our highly trained personnel standing by and watching without responding. For this case, per EPA look up tables, the monomethylamine would carry 0.26 miles. No residences would be impacted. \n\nThe alternative release case for monomethylamine is the release of 13,300 lb. of monomethylamine from a hose failure. In this case the emergency shut down systems function (excess flow valves, detectors, remote shut off valves, trained personnel, etc.). The projected release travels 0.02 miles, does not leave our property and no residences are impacted.\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Programs:\n"

Our emergency plans are reviewed at least annually. Our public notification system consists of calling the LEPC, State of Texas, Harris County, CAER line, and industrial neighbors.\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Safety Program\n\nHAZOP's for our various processes are frequently updated."
