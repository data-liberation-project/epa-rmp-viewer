Five-year Accident History\n\n\n\nThe Synfuels Plant has a good record of preventing significant accidental releases over the last five years, reflecting the good safety at the facility. Due to our stringent release prevention policies, only one reportable accidental releases as defined in 40 CFR 68.42 have occurred in the last five years. The one accident resulted in an economic loss. Since there was not an off-site release impact, the Emergency Response Program for off-site notification was not required or invoked.\n\n\n\n5.  Emergency Response Plan\n\n\n\nThe Synfuels Plant provides a written Emergency Response Plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials. The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including response to and mitigation for fires, explosion, hazardous and gas releases; adequate first aid and medical treatment; evacuations; notification of local emergency response agencies and the public; as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas.\n\n\n\nPotential off-site impacts are addressed through an in-place Emergency Response Plan to deal with the DGC health, safety, and environmental policies. In case of an off-site release impact, DGC is responsible for notifying residents and businesses downwind out to 4 1/2 miles from the plant. The notification will be done by using the computerized out-calling system. Mercer County Emergency Services will notify residents beyond 4 1/2 miles. Notification will be made to the Mercer County Sheriff's Office, North Dakota State Emergency Commission, National Response Center, and the on-call DGC Environmental Department representatives. In case of an accidental release with a potential off-site release impact, the public will be instructed to either shelter-in-place or evacuate.\n\n\n\nDGC has a long-standing commitment to protect the safety of our employees and the public through risk management.

Fully trained response teams are thoroughly prepared to respond to facility accidents and other incidents. DGC employees work hard to follow all applicable safety regulations and have established strict safety programs and procedures to make the plant as safe as possible. Coordinated emergency response drills are conducted to test response equipment, procedures, and capabilities.\n\n\n\nDGC plays an active role in its Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC). A primary goal of the LEPC is to protect local citizens by developing and maintaining a coordinated Emergency Response Plan and working with industry to minimize the impact of chemical hazards. Through the LEPC, citizens can obtain information about hazardous substances handled at local facilities and about emergency planning efforts designed to successfully cope with accidents if they occur. The LEPC maintains a coordinated Emergency Response Plan for the community, detailing operational procedures to be followed in the event of an accident involving hazardous materials. The plan is available for public inspection. DGC must file detailed information with local, state, and federal agencies concerning hazardous materials located on-site and emissions of hazardous materials.\n\n\n\nTo ensure proper functioning, our on-site emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced. In addition, the plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within our processes that would require a modified emergency response. DGC health and safety procedures ensure that emergency response facility personnel are well trained through the use of an extensive in-house and off-site training program.\n\n\n\n6.

The existing DGC Emergency Response Plan was modified to conform with the requirements of Section 112(r) of the CAAA. Changes to the existing Emergency Response Plan primarily involved performing a new Hazard Assessment and putting the existing Emergency Response Program and OSHA Process Safety Management Program into Section 112(r) format. Continuous efforts are ongoing for improvements in the Chemical Release Prevention Program as illustrated by the example of the installation of new computer control systems in operating areas and the efforts in the preventive maintenance program of equipment.\n\n\n\nResponsible Care is a voluntary initiative brought forth by the United States chemical industry through the American Chemistry Council. DGC achieved its goal of becoming a certified Responsible Care Company by passing a certification audit in December 2008 and has retained certification since.\n\n\n\nAchieving this goal demonstrates that DGC's effective management system works to continually improve in the areas of health, safety, security, environmental performance and product stewardship as stated in the policy. The third party Responsible Care Management System recertification process was performed in 2016 with DGC being an approved Responsible Care site based on this audit.\n\n\n\nThe elements of the Process Safety Management Systems within the RMP are detailed in Section 3. As a follow-up to our Responsible Care certification, there has been a refocus and effort to upgrade and support the initiatives for process safety. For example, a contractor was hired to provide the expertise to conduct vapor cloud emission impact analysis on various processes. Current MOC training has been completed for an expanded audience of personnel in respective departments and areas.
