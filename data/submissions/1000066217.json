The maximum inventories of Section 112(r) substances at the Synfuels Plant are approximately 136 million pounds of ammonia, approximately 223 thousand pounds of flammable-gas mixtures, and 300 thousand pounds of formaldehyde. \r\n\r\nThe ammonia is sold as a fertilizer and used in the refrigeration systems and in the production of ammonium sulfate. The flammable gas mixtures are used in the manufacturing of SNG as well as the gas feed for the ammonia production facility. The formaldehyde solution is used in the urea production facility. \r\n\r\nThe offsite consequence analysis for the Synfuels Plant included an analysis of ten potential worst-case releases from flammable-gas mixture process areas, six potential worst-case releases from ammonia process areas, and one worst-case formaldehyde release scenario to estimate the potential distance to explosion endpoints and toxic endpoints.  The offsite consequence analysis was done using the EPA's offsite consequence analysis guidance documents, which provide conservative estimates, as well as a computer model, Degadis, for the facility's most significant worst-case scenarios. \r\n\r\n3.

Five-year Accident History\r\n\r\nThe Synfuels Plant has a good record of preventing significant accidental releases over the last five years, reflecting the good safety at the facility. Due to our stringent release prevention policies, only one reportable accidental releases as defined in 40 CFR 68.42 have occurred in the last five years. The one accident resulted in an economic loss. Since there was not an off-site release impact, the Emergency Response Program for off-site notification was not required or invoked.\r\n\r\n5.  Emergency Response Plan\r\n\r\nThe Synfuels Plant provides a written Emergency Response Plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials. The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including response to and mitigation for fires, explosion, hazardous and gas releases; adequate first aid and medical treatment; evacuations; notification of local emergency response agencies and the public; as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas.\r\n\r\nPotential off-site impacts are addressed through an in-place Emergency Response Plan to deal with the DGC health, safety, and environmental policies. In case of an off-site release impact, DGC is responsible for notifying residents and businesses downwind out to 4 1/2 miles from the plant. The notification will be done by using the computerized out-calling system. Mercer County Emergency Services will notify residents beyond 4 1/2 miles. Notification will be made to the Mercer County Sheriff's Office, North Dakota State Emergency Commission, National Response Center, and the on-call DGC Environmental Department representatives. In case of an accidental release with a potential off-site release impact, the public will be instructed to either shelter-in-place or evacuate.\r\n\r\nDGC has a long-standing commitment to protect the safety of our employees and the public through risk management.

Fully trained response teams are thoroughly prepared to respond to facility accidents and other incidents. DGC employees work hard to follow all applicable safety regulations and have established strict safety programs and procedures to make the plant as safe as possible. Coordinated emergency response drills are conducted to test response equipment, procedures, and capabilities.\r\n\r\nDGC plays an active role in its Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC). A primary goal of the LEPC is to protect local citizens by developing and maintaining a coordinated Emergency Response Plan and working with industry to minimize the impact of chemical hazards. Through the LEPC, citizens can obtain information about hazardous substances handled at local facilities and about emergency planning efforts designed to successfully cope with accidents if they occur. The LEPC maintains a coordinated Emergency Response Plan for the community, detailing operational procedures to be followed in the event of an accident involving hazardous materials. The plan is available for public inspection. DGC must file detailed information with local, state, and federal agencies concerning hazardous materials located on-site and emissions of hazardous materials.\r\n\r\nTo ensure proper functioning, our on-site emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced. In addition, the plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within our processes that would require a modified emergency response. DGC health and safety procedures ensure that emergency response facility personnel are well trained through the use of an extensive in-house and off-site training program.\r\n\r\n6.
