Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nHillshire Brands-St. Joseph Facility located on Mitchell Avenue, in St. Joseph, Missouri complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Program Rule (40 CFR Part 68), OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard (29 CFR 1910.119) and OSHA Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response (HAZWOPER) rules (29 CFR 1910.120).  The enclosed Risk Management Plan addresses the requirements of 40 CFR Part 68 as they relate to the storage, handling, and processing of a highly hazardous chemical, ammonia.  Through our compliance with Part 68 and 29 CFR 1910, we promote overall plant, worker, and community safety.  Our Risk Management Program enables our facility to prevent the occurrence and minimize consequences of significant releases of ammonia, including leaks, spills, fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents. \n\n\n\nIn order to reduce the likelihood and severity of accidental chemical releases that may affect on-site workers and off-site populations and environmental receptors, the Company policy is to fully comply with the letter of EPA's Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions rules (40 CFR Part 68).  The Company has developed a formal Risk Management Plan in compliance with 40 CFR Part 68.  All employees are expected to understand their role in developing and implementing the plan and to diligently adhere to its provisions.  Hillshire Brands-St. Joseph Facility's Risk Management System has clearly defined lines of authority and designation of responsibilities to ensure that the risk management plans are developed, implemented, and revised.  Hillshire Brands-St. Joseph Facility's safety and risk programs prevent accidents because they focus on the rules, procedures, and practices which govern individual processes, activities, or pieces of equipment.\n\n\n\n\n\n2.

      "SummaryText": "essing facility, located at 5807 Mitchell Avenue, St. Joseph, Missouri,  and is subject to the requirements of 40 CFR Part 68, the Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions (112(r)) of the Clean Air Act, due to one stationary source containing a regulated chemical above its threshold quanitity of 10,000 pounds.\n\n\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia, the regulated chemical,  is present as the refrigerant in the plant refrigeration system.  Preparation of the meat products, packaging, and storage operations require refrigeration to keep raw ingredients and products fresh. The system consists of high pressure tanks, compressors, piping, pumps, chillers, and associated equipment located at various strategic locations throughout the plant.  The ammonia may exist as a gas or as a liquid in different parts of the system.  The total amount of ammonia present in the refrigeration system can contain quanitites over the 10,000 pound threshold.  This process is a Program 3 process as defined by the Rish Management Program rule (40 CFR Part 68).\n\n\n\n\n\n3.  Worst-Case and Alternative Case Scenarios\n\n\n\nAmmonia\n\n\n\nIn accordance with 40 CFR Subpart B, Hillshire Brands-St. Joseph Facility evaluated off-site consequences for releases of anhydrous ammonia.  Both a worst case and alternate case scenario were developed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.  Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\n\n\nThe Hillshire Brands-St. Joseph Facility complies with EPA's Chemical Accident Prevention Provision rules and OSHA safety rules under 29 CFR 1910 for ammonia.  All elements of the accidental release prevention requirements under Part 68 have been developed and implemented for ammonia at the Hillshire Brands-St. Joseph Facility.\n\n\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system was designed and constructed in accordance with ANSI/IIAR 2-1992 Standard for Equipment, Design, and Installation of Ammonia Mechanical Refrigerating Systems.  A process hazard review was conducted for ammonia  using a \"What-If Checklist\" and all identified problems were addressed. "

      "SummaryText": " Written operating procedures associated with all facets of ammonia storage, handling, and transfer are in place.  All persons working with ammonia or ammonia containing equipment have been trained on operating procedures and understand the consequences of deviation from the procedures.  A mechanical integrity program is in place for ammonia refrigeration equipment and operations.\n\n\n\n\n\n5.  Five-year Accident History\n\n\n\nThis facility was constructed in the years 1999 and 2000.  In the last 5 years there have been no releases of ammonia that resulted in offsite impacts of any kind.\n\n\n\n6.  Emergency Response Program\n\n\n\nThe emergency response program at the Hillshire Brands-St. Joseph Facility is based on the OSHA requirements for Emergency Action Plans (29 CFR 1910.38 and 1910.119) and HAZWOPER (29 CFR 1910.120).  We have trained employees for emergency response and maintain a written emergency response plan.  The plan is coordinated with the Buchanan County (Missouri) Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC), and the St. Joseph, Missouri Fire Department.  The Hillshire Brands-St. Joseph Facility emergency response team trains and drills monthly.  We conduct annual drills for implementation of the emergency response plan at the facility. The emergency response plan includes procedures for notification of fire department and notification of any potentially affected neighbors.\n\n\n\n7.  Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nAmmonia refrigeration is a mature industry employing known technology.   Yet, the plant remains abreast of currrent innovations that will improve safety.  To this end, the Hillshire Brands-St. Joseph Facility is an active member of the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) and the Refrigeration Engineers Training Association (RETA).  This involvement enables the facility to learn and implement the most modern safety system improvements as they emerge within the ammonia refrigeration industry.  \n\nAs part of our ongoing program to upgrade"
