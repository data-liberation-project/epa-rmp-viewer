The Facility Policy\nThe owners of Pawnee Fertilizer, Inc. are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n2. Facility information\n- The primary activity at the facility is the storage of fertilizer for sale to farmers.\n- Anhydrous ammonia is recieved, stored, and distributed for direct application for crop nutrients.\n- The maximum quantity stored would be 50000 pounds in our 12000 gallon storage tank.\n3. The worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario.\nA. The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of our storage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 50000 pounds, which represents the volume of the storage tank at 85% capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 1.75 miles.\nB. The alternative release scenario based on the most likely potential accident is a release from a break in a transfer hose.  The distance to the endpoint is .64 mile.\n\n4. The accidental release prevention program.\nThe facility has implemented the provisions of ?Safety Requirements for the Storage and handling of Annhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\" published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc. and standard of the U.S. Occupational Safety and health administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, Storage and handling of annhydrous ammonia.?\n\n5. Five year accident history - None\n\n6. Emergency Response program\nThe facility has a written emergency action plan.  \n\n7. Planned Changes to improve Safety\nStaying alert to safety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.\nBruce Droge\nSafety "
