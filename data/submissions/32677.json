Our program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.  Furthermore, we coordinate our plan with the Houston area Channel Industries Mutual Aid Organization (CIMA) and the local community emergency response plans.\n\nRECENT CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\nSince 1999, the BASF Pasadena Texas Plant has implemented several projects to improve our fire protection systems, including adding a deluge system for pumps in the OXO area and upgrading the deluge system valves, repairing and upgrading fireproofing, and replacing underground firewater pipelines.  BASF created a Quick-Attack Truck and an Emergency-Response Trailer to add to our collection of fire trucks and emergency response equipment.  BASF has also installed low-flow cutoffs on the propylene feed pumps, which will shut off the pumps if an abnormal condition is detected."

      "SummaryText": "ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\nAt the BASF Corporation Pasadena Texas Plant, we are committed to operating and maintaining all of our processes (especially those using hazardous substances) in a safe and responsible manner.  We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public, as well as the protection of the environment.  This summary provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including:\n\n* A description of our facility and the use of substances regulated by EPA's RMP regulation;\n* An overview of our accidental release prevention programs;\n* A five-year accident history for accidental releases of chemicals regulated by EPA's RMP rule;\n* An overview of our emergency response program;\n* An overview of improvements at the facility to help prevent accidental chemical releases from occurring and adversely affecting our employees, the public, and the environment.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\nBASF operates two production units at its Pasadena Texas Plant for the production of Phthalic Anhydride (PA) and 2-Ethyl Hexyl Alcohol (2-EH).  The facility is located adjacent to Route 225 on the Houston Ship Channel.  The Phthalic Anhydride (PA) Unit came on line in August of 1983 and has an annual production capacity of over 260 million pounds.  The 2-Ethyl Hexyl Alcohol (2-EH) Unit came on line in September of 1983 and has an annual production capacity of over 276 million pounds.  The 2-EH process utilizes substances that are on the EPA's List of Regulated Substances.  The following is a list of those substances:\n\nToxics - There are no toxic substances used in any of the processes at the facility that meet the EPA's threshold limits for those substances.  \n\nFlammables - \n\nChemical                          Total Quanity on Site (in pounds)"

This standard is a fully comprehensive prevention program designed to prevent accidental releases of hazardous chemicals.  We take a systematic, proactive approach to preventing accidental releases of hazardous chemicals through the requirements of OSHA's PSM Standard.  Our management systems address each of the key areas of this successful prevention program including:\n\n* Process safety information\n* Process hazard analysis\n* Operating procedures\n* Training\n* Mechanical integrity\n* Management of change\n* Pre-startup safety review\n* Compliance audits\n* Incident investigation\n* Employee participation\n* Hot work permit\n* Contractors\n\nThese elements of our prevention program work to prevent accidental chemical releases.  Our company and our employees are committed to the standards that these management systems establish for the way we do business, and we have specific accountabilities and controls to ensure that we are meeting our own high standards for accident prevention.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nRecords are kept for all significant accidental chemical releases that occur at our facility.  There were no accidental chemical releases of covered substances that resulted in onsite or offsite injuries or property damage from 1997 to June 20, 2004 when this updated Executive Summary was submitted.\n\nEMERGENCY RESP"
