This philosophy involves making each and every employee and contractor accountable for their own safety as well as that of the community around them.  As a company we follow a close adherence to all applicable federal, state, and local laws to ensure a safe and healthy environment for all.\n\n\n\nEmployees who enter the Venice Station complete a thorough training, both in the classroom and on-the-job, that enables them to address emergency issues as they arise.  This preparation includes standard operational, emergency operational, and release prevention training.  In addition, periodic refresher courses help to keep operators' problem solving abilities up to date and in sync with our recurring safety improvements.  Our regular internal audits provide an excellent checks and balances system for monitoring these high standards that we set.\n\n\n\nThe Venice Station is one of the many facitlities operated by Enbridge Offshore Facilities, LLC  The facility is an onshore facility at the endpoint of the Mississippi Canyon Gas Offshore Pipeline (MCGP) and located inside the Targa Facility.  The facility receives gas and liquids from the MCGP.  The liquids are separated from the gas, which is piped to Targa for processing and sale.  The liquids are piped to the condensate stabilization units, then to storage tanks and ultimately to the Chevron Texaco Pipeline for sale to wholesale markets.  There are four 796 barrell tanks for stabilized condensate storage at the facility.  There are no threshold quantities of toxic substances present.  The facility consists of multiple small lube oil, waste oil, and fuel tanks and their associated piping, valves, pumps, and compressors on site that support the stabilization unit.  The fa"

As such, the Venice Station is classified as a Program 3 RMP facility.\n\n\n\nThe purpose of the Risk Management Plan (RMPlan) is to provide information about our operations at the facility, our programs to prevent accidental chemical releases, our emergency response plans in case an accidental release should occur, our 5-year accident history, and our planned changes to improve safety at the facility.  \n\n\n\n&#8195;\n\nWorst Case and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\n\n\nAs specified by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) RMP Regulations, our worst-case release scenario for flammables would be the loss of all of the liquids in our largest vessel causing a vapor cloud explosion.  In the case of the Venice Station, this would involve our 796 barrell (33,432 gallons) flammable natural gas liquids tank (91,404 pounds).  Such a scenario is highly unlikely; however, using the EPAs RMP Comp calculations, the distance at which the resulting vapor cloud explosion could cause an overpressure of 1 psi would be approximately 0.4 miles (approximately 2,112 feet).  An overpressure of 1 psi is the EPA's threshold for measurable impacts. \n\n\n\nThe alternative release scenario characterized as a more likely scenario that would involve offsite consequences is calculated to reach approximately 0.2 miles (approximately 1,056 feet) from the release point.  This distance calculation is also based on the EPAs RMP Comp, which is known to be highly conservative and should over predict any potential release from such a scenario.  We have selected the alternative release scenario based on a release from our 33,432 gallon NGL tank due to a four inch puncture of the tank and a release of 20,520 pounds of  Methane (largest constiuent of NGL tank) in 90 minutes resulting in a vapor cloud ex"

This incident could occur if a truck backs into the tank or piping is broken off of the tank in the event that a truck drives off while load lines are still connected.  Additionally, this sceanrio would account for any potential releases from process piping including flanges, joints, welds, valves, and valve seals. Any releases from vessels including drains, bleeds, cracks, seal failures, plug failures, overfiling, overpressurization, and venting would also be accounted for in this scenario.   As a method of preventing such events, signs are posted in conspicuous locations to provide constant reminders to the drivers about proper unloading techniques.\n\n\n\nEnbridge has discussed these potential hydrocarbon releases with its employees and with local emergency response officials in Plaquemines Parish , thereby further reducing the possibility of any impact on the public.  \n\n\n\nPrevention Program\n\n\n\nBelow is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the Venice Station.  Because the processes at the facility are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) Risk Management Program (RMP) and are also subject to the OSHA PSM, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation:  Active employee participation and involvement in the development and implementation of  Venice Station PSM program is an important step toward achieving the objective to prevent or minimize the consequences of catastrophic releases of toxic, reactive, flammable, or explosive chemicals.  Employee involvement will help to ensure that all perspectives regarding PSM are considered, and that the best ideas are implemented.  Open communications are encouraged between supervisors and employees regarding all safety and health issues.

The PSI will be useful to the operators; the team performing the PHA; those in charge of training; contractors; those conducting pre-startup safety reviews; and those in charge of updating the emergency preparedness plans.  Process safety information is readily available to all employees.  Venice Station keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the process.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  Chemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response / exposure treatment consideration, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs).\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA):  Venice Station has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.  The facility primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) method analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.

Periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.  \n\n\n\nOperating Procedures:  Venice Station maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, normal shutdown, and initial startup of a new process.  These procedures provide guidance for experienced operators and also provide the basis for training new operators.  Operating procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.  The review and certification process involves both operators and technical staff.  \n\n\n\nTraining:  In addition to training on operating procedures, the facility has a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating the process.  New employees receive basic training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skill and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years.  All of this training is documented for each operator including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.  \n\n\n\nContractors:  Venice Station uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the facility has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have appropriate skills, (3) are aware of the hazards of their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site specific safety rules, and (6) inform facility personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.

The goal of each investigation is to gather the facts, determine the root cause, and develop corrective action to prevent the reoccurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a reoccurrence, and forwards these results to the business management team for resolution.  \n\n\n\nCompliance Audits:  To help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, the Venice Station periodically conducts an audit to determine whether procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented.  Compliance audits are conducted at least every 3 years.  Both hourly and staff personnel participate as audit team members.  The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to Venice Station management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are retained.  \n\n\n\n&#8195;\n\nFive-year Accident History\n\n\n\nNo incident resulting in onsite or offsite impacts from a hydrocarbon release has occurred at the Venice Station wit"

Although we take pride in that record, we also place daily emphasis on our prevention and safety programs to ensure this record continues.  \n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\n\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving our natural gas liquid extraction, LP-Gas handling and storage facility, it is our policy to follow our Emergency Action Plan, which is linked with the Plaquemines Parrish Emergency Response Plan.  Activation of this emergency response plan sets in motion a pre-planned series of events that notify all area emergency response agencies.  Emergency response agencies are notified on the 911 system and directly.  The 911 call is channeled through the Plaquemines Parrish Sheriff's Department.  All agencies and personnel respond to predetermined staging areas with representatives from each agency reporting to the Central Command Post (CP).  A contingency plan is developed and executed using trained industry personnel along with other emergency response personnel from responding agencies, as needed. \n\n\n\nMr. Clint Persick, Chair Iberville Parish Emergency Planning Committee \n\nc/o Total Petrochemicals and Refining USA, Inc \n\nPO Box 324 Plaquemine, LA 70765 \n\nPhone: 225-642-4574 \n\nEmail: clint.persick@total.com\n\n\n\nEmployees of this facility are provided with copies of the Emergency Response Plan when initially hired and the plan is reviewed and kept up to date by the Emergency Response Supervisor and deemed to be acceptable.
