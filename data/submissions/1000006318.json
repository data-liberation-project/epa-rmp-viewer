Corporate Prevention  and Emergency Response Approach\n\nThe Stanton Energy Center is a division of Orlando Utilities Commission, headquartered in Orlando, Florida.  Corporate policy requires each site to develop and maintain accident prevention programs and an emergency response plan appropriate to the site.  The Corporate environmental organization provides support to the sites in the form of advise and direction on regulatory compliance issues, training for site employees, budgeting and procurement of environmental services, and assistance in the development of new programs.\n\n2. Description of Stationary Source\n\nThe Stanton Energy Center is a two unit coal- fired power generating facility that supplies 420 MW electric power from each unit to the greater Orlando metropolitan area and distributes excess capacity.\n\nThe Stanton Energy Center adds chlorine to the water in the cooling tower basins as a biocide. Liquefied chlorine gas is stored in up to ten one-ton containers at the Circulating Water Chemical Feed facility.  Five containers are always connected to the system, and five are on standby.  The total chlorine inventory in the process is 20,000 lbs.  This is greater than the 2,500 lb. threshold quantity.\n\nThe Stanton Energy Center  also stores liquefied anhydrous ammonia in two 30,000 gallon tanks for addition to the Selective Catalytic Reduction System.  Although the tanks have a total capacity of 60,000 gallons, the Ammonia Unloading, Storage and Supply procedure limits the tank levels to 85% of capacity, or a maximum total inventory of 51,000 gallons.  This is equivalent to approximately 259,000 lbs. of ammonia, which exceeds the 10,000 lb. threshold quantity.\n\n3. Prevention Program\n\nThe Stanton Energy Center has a program in place to comply with the OSHA Process Safety Management Standard, 29 CFR 1910.119.  The PSM Program also serves as the RMP prevention plan.  The PSM Program was establishe"
