Barry Road, in Natchez, Adams\r\nCounty, Mississippi. Ammonia and oleum are among the raw materials\r\nused in the manufacturing process at the facility. Due to the\r\nquantity of these chemicals stored at the facility, the facility\r\nis subject to the United States Environmental Protection Agency's\r\nRisk Management Program.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the Risk Management Program is to prevent or reduce\r\nthe severity of an accidental release of a hazardous chemical.\r\nAmong the requirements of the Risk Management Program is the\r\nsubmission of a Risk Management Plan (RMP) summarizing the overall\r\nprogram. The following information is an Executive Summary of the\r\ninformation contained in the Risk Management Program. This\r\nExecutive Summary includes a description of the company's\r\naccidental release prevention and safety policies, a facility and\r\nprocess description, an explanation of the accidental release\r\nscenarios studied, a five-year accident history, and details of\r\nthe facility's accidental release prevention program.\r\n\r\n\r\n2.0  Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n\r\nEthyl Petroleum Additives takes great care to ensure the safety of\r\nits employees, visitors, and the surrounding community.

      "SummaryText": "USEPA has published reference\r\ntables to be used in calculating the distance offsite that an\r\naccidental release would travel. These tables employ very\r\nconservative assumptions and therefore provide conservative\r\nestimates of the offsite distance that an accidental release would\r\ntravel. Ethyl Petroleum Additives used the USEPA reference tables\r\nto calculate a worst-case offsite impact radius of 0.43 miles for\r\noleum and 7.50 miles for ammonia. It is estimated that no\r\nresidential receptors would reside within the 0.43-mile radius of\r\nthe oleum release.\r\n\r\nEthyl Petroleum Additives also calculated offsite impact distances\r\nfor alternate, more realistic accidental release scenarios. These\r\nrelease scenarios took into consideration safety systems and\r\ncontrols in place to reduce the severity of an accidental release\r\nand considered a more realistic release rate of the hazardous\r\nchemicals. For oleum, overfilling the storage vessel was\r\ndetermined to be the most likely accidental release scenario even\r\nthough no serious accidental oleum releases have occurred at the\r\nfacility during the five-year accident history period. An oleum\r\noffsite impact radius of 0.19 miles was calculated using the USEPA\r\nreference tables and a quantity of 9,828 pounds released over a 10-\r\nminute period. It is estimated that no residential receptors would\r\nreside within the 0.19-mile radius of the oleum release.\r\n\r\nFor ammonia, a rupture disk or relief valve failure was the most\r\nlikely accidental release scenario even though no serious\r\naccidental ammonia releases have ever occurred at the facility. An\r\nammonia offsite impact radius of 0.31 miles was calculated using\r\nthe USEPA reference tables and a quantity of 500 pounds released\r\nover a 5-minute period. It is estimated that no residential\r\nreceptors would reside within the 0.31-mile radius of the ammonia\r\nrelease.\r\n\r\n\r\n6.0  Accidental Release Prevention Program\r\n\r\nThe facility's accident prevention program includes each of the\r\nelements"
