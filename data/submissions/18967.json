Certain elements are not fully implemented or not documented in a form that allows us to determine last review date, etc.  The RMP*Submit program will not write the submittal disk without dates in each box, so we have been forced to use dummy dates (1/1/65) for these elements.  Other dates should be considered approximate.\n\nThe facility both manufactures fluid milk products and distributes fluid milk & frozen dairy products.  The refrigeration system for this Prevention Program serves both ends; the RMP*Submit program requires a single NAICS code, so the one for fluid milk was used.\n\nManagement of change review date reflects last cycle of facility capital projects review.\n\nContractor qualifications screening, hazard briefings, etc. are performed but not to a written contractor program.  Date of review for the \"contractor safety procedures\" is therefore a dummy.",

      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary:\nRisk Management Plan submission for Shenandoah Pride Dairy\n\nShenandoah's Pride operates a facility in Mount Crawford, VA which produces dairy products.  The facility receives milk from local dairy farms; pasteurizes and otherwise processes the milk; packages milk, cream, and other dairy products; and distributes to customers from New England to Florida.\n\nMost large refrigerated facilities use a chemical called anhydrous ammonia as a vital part of the refrigeration system.  Ammonia performs the same functions as the hydrochlorofluorocarbon - \"Freon\" refrigerants used in home air conditioners, refrigerators, automobiles, etc. Ammonia is the most environmentally friendly, energy- and capital-efficient refrigerant available for industrial applications; \"Freons\" are not suitable for many industrial uses.  Anhydrous ammonia is also used widely as a fertilizer, both for direct injection into the ground and for manufacture of other fertilizers.  Because of its moderate toxicity and slight flammability, it is considered a hazardous material.\n\nShenandoah's Pride is committed to maintaining a safe manufacturing operation for our employees and the surrounding community.  This commitment includes the ammonia refrigeration system.  To further safety in our facility, the refrigeration system is constructed under permit from local authorities, such as the building and fire departments.  Additionally, we adhere where appropriate to industry-consensus codes and standards, including the ASHRAE Safety Code for Refrigeration and the IIAR-2 standard of the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration.  Finally, to comply with requirements of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and the United States Environmental Protection Agency, we implement a method called Process Safety Management to ensure that the refrigeration system is operated and maintained safely.\n\nWe use a variety of methods to ensure that accidental releases of hazardous materials are pre"

We are striving to implement our process safety management program 100%.\n\nAs required by the EPA, we have analyzed \"worst-case\" and \"alternative\" hypothetical ammonia release scenarios and their consequences, details of which appear in other portions of this Risk Management Plan.  The methodology used to evaluate these accidents is prescribed by regulation, and makes no effort to estimate the likelihood or \"risk\" of these incidents.  Shenandoah's Pride uses other methods to develop plausible scenarios for emergency planning and response drills.\n\nThe \"worst-case\" release scenario involves loss of the contents of a high-pressure receiver vessel over ten minutes.  As required, this scenario has offsite impact, meaning that a level of 200 ppm ammonia is reached beyond the property line.   The alternative scenario involves lifting of a relief valve, a safety device provided on all vessels to prevent accidents such as the one specified as the \"worst-case.\"  The alternative scenario also has offsite impact.  We estimated that the release would end after ten minutes, a plausible value considering the normal behavior of relief valves and ammonia in vessels.\n\nWe used a computer program supplied by the Environmental Protection Agency to estimate the offsite impacts.  (See the Risk Management Plan, available from the Environmental Protection Agency, for details on the offsite impacts; due to National Security concerns, the U.S. Government has advised the regulated community not to disclose the actual numerical data in this Executive Summary.)  \n\nThere have been no accidental releases "

We support the efforts of the Bridgewater Volunteer Fire Department and other County emergency organizations by providing information and technical assistance.  Some members of the responding organizations are full-time employees at Shenandoah's Pride.\n\nWe systematically look for possible system changes to improve safety in our facility.  Because our facility is well-managed, the opportunity for such changes is small.  At time of writing, few significant changes are planned for safety reasons.  As changes are made (or as process hazards analysis studies are updated - which we do on a regular schedule), safety issues and improvements are identified and made as a matter of course. Our adherence to accepted codes and standards drastically reduces the number of safety issues in a change; safety is designed in rather than added later."
