      "SummaryText": "Verso Luke LLC in Luke Maryland, has been a proud and responsible member of the Allegany County community since 1888.  During this time, the Luke Mill has safely converted millions of tons of pulp wood into Fine Paper.  Operations at the Luke Mill include debarking, chipping, pulping, bleaching, paper coating production, paper making, and paper finishing.  In addition to producing paper, the Luke Mill operates three power boilers to produce steam and electric for use at the facility, and operates a water filtration plant to produce drinking water for the mill and the town of Luke.\r\n\r\nOn June 20, 1996, the Environmental Protection Agency published the final rule for its Risk Management Program (RMP).  This regulation is designed to assist facilities and communities in their efforts to reduce the number and severity of serious chemical accidents.  The EPA formally developed a final list of regulated substances, with threshold storage quantities established for each substance.  This list includes 77 toxics and 63 flammable substances.\r\n\r\nOnly two regulated substances are handled at the Luke Mill in excess of their applicable threshold quantities.  Chlorine dioxide has been used at the mill since 1958.  It is produced at the Luke Mill's new (1997) state of the art R8 Chlorine Dioxide Plant and is used to bleach the raw pulp.  Chlorine is used at the Water Filtration Plant to disinfect drinking water for the mill and for the residents of the town of Luke.  Sulfur Dioxide use has been discontinued and replaced with a baghouse  collection system to help control particulate emissions.\r\n\r\nEach facility which stores a chemical above its threshold quantity is required to prepare one worst-case release scenario analysis.  In addition, an alternative release scenario must be prepared for each chemical.  By using the information from these Hypothetical Release Scenarios, the Luke Mill, working with the Local Emergency Planning committees and local fire departments, has develope"

      "SummaryText": "l safety.  Over the years the Luke Mill has implemented a multitude of programs designed to decrease the likelihood of these hypothetical release scenarios.  The programs have included; extensive operator training, mechanical integrity procedures, written standard operating procedures, and management of change procedures.  We have also developed and implemented safe work practices such as lockout/tagout, confined space entry permits, hot work permits, and control over workplace entrances.  These programs were not only written by management personnel, but also includes; operators, contractors, and engineers were required.  The Luke Mill also has its own volunteer fire squad, rescue squad, and hazardous materials team.  These groups and their associated equipment may be used in the event of an accident involving chlorine dioxide and chlorine.  The mill's Tank Integrity Program insures that tanks and the storage of hazardous materials are checked for integrity on a regular schedule. \r\n\r\nWithin the past few years the Luke Mill has made operational changes which have had a direct impact on the Risk Management Plan.  Strict storage limitations have been placed on certain chemicals to guarantee amounts on-site remain small in quantity.  Secondary containment has been placed around the chlorine cylinders and chlorine dioxide tanks.  In addition the Luke Mill has eliminnated chlorine bleaching, an act which decreases the amount of chlorine stored on-site by approximately 360 tons.\r\n\r\nThere has been no accidents at the Luke Mill since the last revision date (2012).  The last accidental release occurred on Novemeber 16, 2011 and is described below.\r\n     On November 16, 2011 at 11:08 am there was a release of chlorine dioxide residual combined with filtrate from the No. 2 CLO2 Tower within the pulp bleaching area.  The duration of the incident was approximately 35 minutes and resulted in a total release of 61 pounds of Chlorine; of which 30.5 pounds was released as a vapor clo"

      "SummaryText": "ud and 30.5 pounds was released as a liquid into the mill sewer system.  The NAICS code corresponding to this process area is: 322121.  The weather conditions during the event were mostly cloudy with a high temperature of 56 degrees, average wind speed of 1.8 mph out of the northeast.  The combined filtrate and liquid Chlorine Dioxide residual that drained from the No. 2 Tower entered the mill yard around the bleach plant.  A total of five (5) people were exposed to and treated for ClO2 inhalation, and transported to the local emergency room.  They were all treated and released to return to work.  The coordinator for emergency operations at the mill made contact with the Emergency Operations Centers within the surrounding counties and a local elementary school was contacted directly and instructed to shelter in place.  The direction of the vapor cloud release was advancing upstream from the release area and a nearby community was advised to have all residents shelter in place.  \r\nThe contributing factors of the accidental release include; \r\n     1) Operator error while filling the No. 2 ClO2 Tower.  An excess amount of ClO2 entering the tower lead to \r\n        a much higher ClO2 residual that combined with filtrate in the tower and was eventually released into \r\n        the millyard.  \r\n     2) Feed water continued to be added to the No 2 Tower which led to a greater than expected rapid rise of \r\n        filtrate level in the tower.  \r\n     3) The Distributive Control System (DCS) reading did not provide an alarm when the level in the tank \r\n        continued to rise above the higher level setting. \r\n\r\nSome operational and/or process changes that have resulted from the investigation include; \r\n     1) The incident investigation was reviewed with all Bleach Room Operating personnel.  \r\n     2) A checklist has been added to the existing SOP for filling the No. 2 ClO2 Tower.  \r\n     3) A new SOP has been developed to include a statement that sets an upper control limit"

      "SummaryText": "d emergency response plans and training procedures.\r\n\r\nThe Worst Case Release scenario is for chlorine dioxide and consists of the catastrophic failure of a storage tank and associated piping with the release of 15,200 lbs of chlorine dioxide spreading within a diked area.  This hypothetical release would result in offsite chlorine dioxide concentrations that equal or exceed the EPA's designated endpoint concentration.  The environmental and public receptors include a state forest, wildlife management area, public recreation areas, residences, schools, hospitals, commercial facilities, office buildings, and churches.\r\n\r\nThe alternative release scenario for chlorine dioxide consists of the release of 75 pounds of chlorine dioxide solution, as a result of a pipeline breakage downstream of a storage tank.  This hypothetical release would result in chlorine dioxide concentrations that equal or exceed the EPA's designated endpoint concentration of 2.8 x 10-6 kg/m3, from the point of release out to a distance of 0.85 miles.  The following public receptors are within this distance from the point of release: schools; residences; hospitals; recreation areas; and commercial, office, or industrial areas.\r\n\r\nThe alternate release scenario for chlorine consists of the release of 1 pound of chlorine over a duration of 5 minutes from the breakage of a pipeline due to a crane dropping a cylinder on a common line connected to three chlorine cylinders in the chlorine storage building.  This hypothetical release would not result in offsite chlorine concentrations exceeding the EPA's designated endpoint concentration of 8.7 x 10-6 kg/m3.\r\n\r\nThe Luke Mill has placed a high priority on being in full compliance with the Process Safety Management requirements under 29 CFR Part 1910.119 for preventing or minimizing the consequences of catastrophic releases of chlorine dioxide, chlorine, and sulfur dioxide since the early 1990's.  In fact, the Luke Mill has always been a leader in operationa"
