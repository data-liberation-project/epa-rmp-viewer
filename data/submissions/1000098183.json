      "SummaryText": "ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nThe customers of Rise Baking Company LLC are both large and small. They look to us for excellent value, dependable delivery, consistent formulas and hands-on service. Since our inception in 1971, our simple goal has been to be the most reliable and responsive company in our industry.  The Rise Baking Company LLC management is not only committed to offering superior service, but also to maintaining a safety and environmental program to promote a safe environment for all its employees and the surround communities.  Rise Baking Company LLC's safety and environmental policies are administered by the Maintenance Manager, who oversees the entire safety and environmental programs, including the PSM/RMP/CalARP Program for the anhydrous ammonia systems.\n\nRise Baking Company LLC employees conduct ongoing inspections, testing, and replacement of the critical items in the ammonia refrigeration systems.  The ammonia refrigeration systems are inspected daily by the Maintenance personnel.  A record of the maintenance or work performed on the systems is maintained onsite.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nThe Rise Baking Company LLC facility is located at 2111 West Valley Blvd. in Colton, California.  The facility is located approximately 0.1 mile north of the Interstate 10 and approximately 3.1 miles west of Highway 215.  The area immediately surrounding the facility is primarily urban with light commercial and residential areas.  \n\nThe ammonia refrigeration processes are used for the production and storage of a variety of food products in their processing area and cold storage warehouse.  The refrigeration process, consisting of piping, valves, and equipment, cycles ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration for cold storage rooms and to continuous line blast"

      "SummaryText": "freezers.  Changes in pressure are directly related to changes in temperature.  For example, lowering the ammonia pressure lowers its temperature.  Low pressure (cold) liquid ammonia provides refrigeration by removing ambient heat.  Removal of ambient heat causes the liquid ammonia (contained within the system) to vaporize.  Heat is later removed from the ammonia as it is condensed back into a liquid.  Typical operating conditions for System 1 range from 8 PSIG on the low pressure side of the system to 160 PSIG on the high side.  Typical operating conditions for System 2 range from 5 PSIG on the low pressure side of the system to 160 PSIG on the high side.\n\nAmmonia is used as the refrigerant in two separate and independent refrigeration processes.  The ammonia inventory in the original system is 19,100 pounds, while the second system (July 2001) contains an ammonia inventory of 23,000 pounds. \n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nA prevention program is in place to minimize the risk of hazardous chemical releases in accordance with the California Occupational Safety and Health Administration (CalOSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (Section 5189 of Title 8, CCR), the EPA Risk Management Program (RMP), and the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program.  This prevention program covers those processes that handle anhydrous ammonia above the threshold quantity.\n\nAmmonia Refrigeration System\n\nThe facility operates in accordance with the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) guidelines and standards including the following:\n\n- IIAR Bulletin 107, \"Suggested Safety and Operating Procedures When Making Ammonia Refrigeration Tie-ins\"\n- IIAR Bulletin 109, \"Minimum Safety Criteria for a Safe Ammonia Refrigeration System\"\n- IIAR Bulletin 110, \"Startup, Inspection, and Maintenance of Ammonia Refrigeration Systems\"\n- IIAR, \"A Guide to Good Practices for the Operation of an Ammonia Refrigeration S"

      "SummaryText": "ystem\"\n\nIn addition, Rise Baking Company LLC has implemented a Process Safety Management program for compliance with the Cal-OSHA regulation.  There are also ammonia detectors located throughout the facility.  There are sensors within Machine Room 1's Freezers, Cooler Dock, Processing Area, and Cooler Room which will alarm at 25 ppm.  The visual and audible alarms are activated at the Freezer Room entrance and a signal is sent to the central computer and is logged within alarm history and calls ADT.  ADT then calls the fire department and facility personnel on the contact list.  An initial shutdown occurs at 35 ppm which does the following: (1) Evaporator fans turn off and (2) Evaporator liquid supply and hot gas valves are closed.  There are also ammonia sensors within the Machine Room 1.  At 25 ppm, the audible and visual alarms are activated inside the Machine Room and a signal is sent to an auto dialer to alert ADT as well as facility's operators.  ADT is instructed to call the fire department.  At 125 ppm, the following actions take place: (1) Shut down of solenoid valves in order to isolate the ammonia and (2) the emergency ventilation fan is turned on.  A final shutdown occurs at 10,000 ppm which de-energizes all of the equipment in the Machine Room including the compressors.  The facility is equipped with an automatic shut off button located outside of the Machine room.  If a release were to occur, operators can activate this prevention measure.   \n\nSensors are also located within Machine Room 2 (July 2001).  Sensors in the new Processing Area, where the Continuous Line Freezing Evaporators AU4A-AU4D, AU13A-AU13D, AU14A-AU14D, and AU15A-AU15D are located, activate the audible and visual alarms in the refrigeration space at 25 ppm and a signal is sent to the auto dialer (ADT) who contacts the fire department and personnel on the contact list.  An initial shut down occurs at 35 ppm where all refrigeration valves and evaporators are de-energized. The sensors in"
