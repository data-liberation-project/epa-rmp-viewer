      "SummaryText": "ed within the Plan are written procedures that outline the actions to be taken for various types of emergencies that could occur in the facility. These emergencies may include airborne releases of chemical substances or flammable materials, spills to the water or ground, fires, explosions, and personnel medical emergencies. \nAs a responsible owner operator of a stationary source, in compliance with 68.210(b), the terminal will hold a public meeting to provide information required under \u00a768.42(b), no later than 90 days after any RMP reportable accident at the stationary source with any known offsite impact specified in \u00a768.42(a) (i.e., known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage). The terminal also holds annual meeting and communication with the county LEPC\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY EPA FACILITY \nPhillips 66 is continually striving to make the Phillips 66 Mount Vernon Terminal the safest and most reliable workplace possible for its employees, neighbors, and community. The facility's focus is safe, reliable, and environmentally sound operations. The goal of the Phillips 66 Mount Vernon Terminal is to demonstrate continuous improvement in its health, environmental and safety performance. In addition, Phillips 66 will work cooperatively with our neighbors to ensure the health, environment, safety and security of the Phillips 66 Mount Vernon Terminal and surrounding community. Since the last RMP submission one PHAs revalidation have been conducted to improved process safety using LOPA for assessing high consequence scenarios. PHA/LOPA recommendations are tracked and completed in a timely manner. In 2020, a new Independent Protection Layer (IPL) was added to the Butane Blending process to prevent loss a primary containment due to pump seal failures."

      "SummaryText": "planning and response programs help effectively manage the hazards posed by the facility's regulated substance to employees, contractors, the public, and the environment. The covered process is regulated by the EPA RMP regulation 40 CFR Part 68 and the OSHA Process Safety Management Standard 29CFR 1910.119. Due to that fact, the accident prevention and risk management plan is organized to be consistent with the PSM regulation requirements. The following accident prevention programs are in place at the Phillips 66 Mount Vernon Terminal: \n1.\tEmployee Participation, \n2.\tProcess Safety Information, \n3.\tProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA), \n4.\tStandard Operating Procedures,\n5.\tOperator Training, \n6.\tContractors, \n7.\tPre-startup Safety Review, \n8.\tMechanical Integrity,\n9.\tHazardous Work Authorization (Hot Work, etc.), \n10.\tManagement of Change,\n11.\tIncident Investigation, \n12.\tEmergency Procedures/Planning, \n13.\tCompliance Audits, and \n14.\tTrade Secrets\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY \nThe RMP rule requires facilities to compile a 5-Year Accident History for all RMP regulated substances in covered processes at the facility. As part of the ongoing PSM Program, the facility documents and tracks all incidents and near misses that occur within the facility. This incident database serves as the basis for the five-year accident history. \nRMP requires facilities to report any incident from a covered process involving a regulated substance and resulting in any of the following:\n\u0095\tOnsite deaths, injuries, or significant property damage \n\u0095\tOffsite deaths, injuries, property damage, evacuations, sheltering-in-place, or environmental damage\nThere have been no reportable RMP accidents/incidents related to the operation of the covered system during the past five years.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM \nThe Phillips 66 Mount Vernon Terminal Facility Response Plan provides the essential planning and training for protecting employees, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.

The Processes at Mount Vernon Terminal are classified as Program Level 3 under the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency\u0092s (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) regulation.\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT RESULTS\nThe objectives of this hazard assessment are twofold: (1) satisfy the requirements of the RMP regulation and (2) provide Offsite Consequence Analysis (OCA) information that will help local emergency planning officials improve community emergency response in the event of an accidental release at the refinery. Due to the nature of covered substance (butane), OCA focused on potential releases of flammable materials. In modeling flammable materials, the stationary source is required to present distances to endpoints resulting from any of the following: \n\u0095\tExplosion: Overpressure of 1 Psig \n\u0095\tRadiant Heat/Fire: Radiant heat of 5 kW/m2 for 40 seconds. \n\u0095\tLower Flammability Limit: a lower flammability limit as provided in NFPA documents or other generally recognized sources. \nThe facility has submitted to the EPA a worst case and alternative release scenario for the regulated substance held in the covered process. The facility has modeled alternative release scenarios (ARSs) to show release scenarios that may have a more realistic chance of occurrence. Even the ARSs are rare events. The details of the process release conditions assumed for the hazard scenarios and assumptions made are provided in the Worst and Alternative Case Release Scenarios sections of the 2022 RMP Resubmission. \nSince no changes in inventory of the regulated substance or the operating conditions of the covered process have occurred in the last 5 years, the facility revalidated the Worst-Case and Alternate Scenarios that were modeled for the 2017 submission. \n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAMS \nPhillips 66's accidental release prevention programs and emergency"
