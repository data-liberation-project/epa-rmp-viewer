This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as the design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the ammonia refrigeration system at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate control measures to prevent possible releases of Ammonia (anhydrous).  Unforeseeable, if such a release does occur; our highly trained employees are on hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  We are also completely coordinated with the Fairdale Fire Department, who provides our off-site emergency response services.\n\nThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled:\n\nWe have one regulated substance present at our facility.  That substance is Ammonia (anhydrous).  The maximum inventory of Ammonia (anhydrous) that is expected to be present in this facility, based on process/operational requirements, is 11,000 pounds.\n\nThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical Specific Prevention Steps:\n\nOur facility has taken the following steps as required by 40 CFR Part 68 of the Clean Air Act.  Our Ammonia (anhydrous) process is subject to the OSHA PSM Standard 29 CFR 1910.119.  Our facility is also subject to EPCRA Section 302 reporting requirements.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the accidental release prevention program that is in place at our facility.\n\nProcess Safety Information:\n\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our process"

The studies are conducted by a team of qualified personnel, process operations, and maintenance and are revalidated at a regular interval of every 5 years.  Any findings related to the hazard analyses are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures:\n\nSysco/Louisville Food Services maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial start-up, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown, and start-up after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators and maintenance personnel involved in the process.\n\nTraining:\n\nSysco/Louisville Food Services has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating and maintaining processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  New employees receive basic classroom training in process operations, followed by on-the-job supervision until they are deemed competent to work independently.  Refresher training is provided every three years and more frequently if needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity:\n\nSysco/Louisville Food Services conducts highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operation.  Process equipment examined during these checks includes pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Qualified personnel conduct maintenance operations with special training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are given specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified during the maintenance checks are corrected in a timely manner.\n\nManagement of Change:\n\nWritten procedures are in place at Sysco/Louisville Food Services to manage changes in process chemicals,"

These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for a safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits:\n\nSysco/Louisville Food Services conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions required by the RMP regulation are being implemented.  These audits are completed at least every three years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are completed in a timely manner.\n\nIncident Investigation:\n\nSysco/Louisville Food Services promptly investigated any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of Ammonia (anhydrous).  These investigations are conducted to identify the circumstances leading up to the incident, as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release or near-miss from recurring.  All accident/incident reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\n\nEmployee Participation:\n\nSysco/Louisville Food Services believes that process safety management and accident prevention require a team effort.  Company and contractor employees are urged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements for the ammonia refrigeration system.
