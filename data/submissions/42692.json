      "SummaryText": "We have one process, that is Anhydrous Ammonia, the office of the Indiana State Chemist has regulations that we have been in compliance with for many years.  The equipment has been inspected and maintained in accordance to each of these regulations.  All safety equipment is in place and available in case of an emergency.  Employees have been trained to respond to emergencies.  This facility is a retail Farm Supply outlet, that supplies a variety of Fertilizer, Feed, Pesticides, and other equipment.  All of our fertilizer and pesticides are in concrete secondary containment.  We have emergency response plans in place with Local and State agencies and comply with Sara Title III and 302 reporting.  The Anhydrous Ammonia tanks are equipped with over fill protection devices and excess flow valves.  Anhydrous Ammonia is a seasonal product and is not stored for more than four to five months each year (usually between the months of January to June).  The storage tank has a capacity of 40 Tons and is highly unlikely it could all be released in an accident.  The worst case Scenario would be if the wind is from the North and a release occurred, which would move vapor toward the town of Rosedale.  Prevailing spring winds are usually from the South, which would not have the offsite impact."
