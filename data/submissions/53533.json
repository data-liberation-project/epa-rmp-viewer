Section 112 \u00ae of the CAA required the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to issue a rule.  EPAs rule went beyond OSHA\u00bfs PSM in intent by requiring the intent of these provisions was to identify potential impacts to public and environmental receptors. The Rule\u00bfs \u00bfChemical Accident Prevention Provisions\u00bf, published in Title 40, Part 68 of the Code of Federal Regulations (40 CFR Part 68) apply to a wide variety of facilities that handle, store, manufacture, or use toxic substances.  This rule requires that covered facilities develop and implement a risk management program.  The risk management program also incorporates the OSHA PSM program. \nThe Facility is classified as Program 3 and therefore is subject to the following program elements:\n\n-An overall management system to supervise the implementation of the program,\n-An offsite consequence analysis that evaluates specific potential worst-case and alternative release scenarios,\n-A 5-year history of regulated accidental substance releases from covered processes,\n-An integrated prevention program to manage risk, consisting of 12 elements.  These 12 elements are essentially identical to those defined under OSHA PSM (trade secrets are not applicable to refrigeration, and emergency response is covered separately).                                                                                                                                                                         - An emergency"

The RMP is the summary document submitted to the EPA.\n\n2.0 OFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\n\nThe offsite consequence analysis (OCA) consisted of evaluating a worst-case release scenario and an alternative release scenario.  The methods used to calculate a distance to toxic endpoint for both the worst-case and alternative release scenarios are presented in EPA\u00bfs Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration (EPA 550-B-98-014).  Results were verified using the EPA software RMP*Comp version 1.06.  The toxic endpoint for ammonia is 0.14 milligrams per liter (200 ppm) ambient concentration in air.\n2.1 Worst-Case and Alternative Release Scenarios \nThe EPA requires that failure of the largest vessel at full capacity be evaluated as the worst-case release scenario.  Administrative controls for ammonia inventory may be considered.  The high-pressure receiver (HPR) is the largest vessel in the ARS at the Facility.  The anticipated charge of ammonia to the ARS is 45,705 pounds. The largest vessel is High Pressure Receiver (HPR). Maximum liquid anhydrous ammonia in the HPR can be stored at 80% of the full capacity.  17,800 pounds of ammonia in the HPR will be used as the release quantity for the worst-case release scenario.   The release is assumed to occur in ten minutes, in accordance with the methodology prescribed in 40 CFR 68.25.  Since the HPR is located indoors, a mitigated release was run. \nThe distance to toxic endpoint for the worst-case scenario involving a liquid ammonia release from the refrigeration system is calculated at 1.7 miles.  The formula used to calculate the worst-case scenario distance is presented in EPA\u00bfs Risk RMP*COMP for Ammonia Refrigeration Systems, Appendix 4B.

The scenario assumes a 1/4-inch diameter hole in the air unit that took 10 minutes to isolate.  Pressure within the air unit was assumed to be 100 pounds per square inch gauge (psig).  Based on EPA\u00bfs RMP*Comp software, the alternative scenario would result in a release of 1,000 pounds of ammonia over 10 minutes. The distance to toxic endpoint for the alternative release scenario selected is 0.1 miles.  Model assumptions include an urban release (obstacles present) and no mitigation (release occurred outdoors).  The formula used to calculate the alternative scenario distance is presented in EPA\u00bfs RMP*COMP  for Ammonia Refrigeration Systems. The results of the selected alternative release scenario were verified with RMP-Comp software, version 1.07.  \n \n2.3 OFFSITE IMPACTS\n\n40 CFR 68 requires that the area within the worst-case and alternative release zones (within a circle with a center at the point of the release and a radius determined by the distance to the endpoint) be evaluated for off-site impacts, including: \n\n-Estimated residential population (rounded to two significant figures)\n-Public receptors including: residences; schools; hospitals; correctional facilities; recreation areas; and commercial, office, or industrial areas \n-Environmental receptors including: national or state parks, forests or monuments; officially designated wildlife sanctuaries, preserves, or refuges; and federal wilderness areas\nLand view Software using 1990 US Census data were considered for Worst-Case and Alternate Release Scenarios.\n\n3.0 FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe five-year accident history that must be included in the risk management program manual and the RMP submittal includes only releases of ammonia that meet the following criteria.\n-On-site deaths, injuries, or significant property damage, or"
