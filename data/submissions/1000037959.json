      "SummaryText": "Background\n\n\n\nFirst Energy operates a coal fired electrical generation plant, known as the Bruce Mansfield Plant (BMP), in Shippingport, Pennsylvania.  In order to reduce NOx air emissions, BMP installed in 2003 a Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) system.  This system removes NOx by catalytically reacting NOx with Ammonia to form Nitrogen and water.  This system has operated since September 2003 during the ozone season (May through September).  The system's operational schedule changed in 2009 when it started operating continuously over the whole year and not just seasonally.\n\n\n\nAn unloading arm was installed at the rail car unloading facility at of the end of 2008 to replace existing hose connections.  This modification helped to reduce the potential for ammonia leaks from the hoses by replacing the hoses with solid piped connections. No operational issues with the ammonia rail car unloading arms have been noted since their installation.\n\n\n\nThe process is covered by the EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) rules due to the presence of 29 % Aqueous Ammonia.\n\n\n\nThe covered process includes:  rail car unloading, tank truck unloading, storage, and SCR feed.  There are six storage tanks that contain 57,000 gallons each (95% capacity).\n\n\n\nBMP operations are also covered by other regulations such as the PADEP and air regulations, EPA SPCC rules, OSHA and PA Department of Labor and Industry (pressure vessel requirements).\n\n\n\nOverview of the RMP Prevention Program \n\n\n\nBMP is a Program 2 site but it has some elements of a Program 3 site.  BMP uses a management of change and pre-startup safety review procedure as well as a tri-annual compliance audit schedule following EPA guidelines.\n\n\n\nProcess protections are primarily those measures that will reduce, prevent or minimize a release from happening or, if it did happen, minimize the consequences of that threat.    These include:\n\n?    Training on operations, emergencies etc.\n\n    -All operators have refresher training at least every "

No rail cars or tank trucks stored on site other than those in immediate use at the unloading station\n\n?    Onsite wireless communication\n\n?    Onsite trucks/vehicles for emergency transportation needs\n\n?    Selected drain and process valves are locked and capped when not in use,         \n\n?    Fire extinguishers; \n\n?    Ammonia monitors/detectors/alarms\n\n?    Main feed pump flow alarms/detector\n\n?    High level tank alarms with interlock shutoffs  \n\n?    Secondary containment; vault under storage containment area\n\n        -Vault is large enough to minimize any potential gaseous or off site aqueous    ammonia releases.        \n\n?    Reactor and tank design and internal testing\n\n?    Temperature/pressure indicators\n\n?    High level alarms\n\n?    High pressure water cannon, hose stations and service water hydrants (knock down ammonia fumes) \n\n\n\nThese are the major site security measures:\n\n\n\n?    Fence with barbed wire on top surrounding the site\n\n?    Security cameras in selected areas\n\n?    Main entrance staffed with guards on a 24 hour basis.\n\n?    All other gates are either locked or guarded but may be opened in the event of emergency egress from the inside.\n\n?    Warning signs\n\n\n\nIt is the policy of BMP to assure the safe operation of the facility which is designed and built to good engineering practices that incorporate methods or principles in accordance with applicable industry standards.  Some of these standards include the ASME code for pressure piping, B31.3, and ASME Boiler and Pressure code, Section VIII.   \n\n\n\nAccident History\n\n\n\nThere have been no accidents in the history of operation of the ammonia system.\n\n \n\n\n\nEmergency Response\n\n\n\nThere is a written emergency response plan that is coordinated with the Beaver County LEPC and the local fire departments.  There are periodic site drills.  Selected site response personnel are Hazwoper trained.    \n\n\n\nEmergency respo"
