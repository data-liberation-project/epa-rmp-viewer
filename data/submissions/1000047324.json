The plan includes  regular preventative maintenance (mechanical integrity) for the ammonia system components, and a program for both pre-startup safety reviews and management of change (MOC)to the ammonia refrigeration system. The program also includes operating procedures for the safe operation of the refrigeration system, specific requiremenst for safe work practices\n\n(such as safe approaches to welding and similar hot work), and safety requirements for contractors hired to operate and maintain the refrigeration system. Save A lot has a procedure in place for investigating incidents to ensure root causes are identified and corrective actions taken to minimize the potential for recurrence of incidents. The program also has a procedure for conducting compliance audits to ensure that the PSM Program is being implemented at the facility. Lastly the PSM written program incorporates the facility's emergency response plan and places special emphasis on handling accidental releases of ammonia and coordination  of emergency response with the local fire department and other emergency response organizations.

Save A Lot operates many reatil grocery stores throughout the East that are supplied through a distribution and transportation complex located in Wiliamsport, MD. Save A Lot's Wiliamsport Distribution Center employs  182 people and uses anhydrous ammonia for refrigeration of grocery products in storage.  Anhydrous ammonia is subject to EPA regulation under 40 CFR 68, Accidental Release Risk Management of Highly Hazardous Chemcials. Save A Lot's Wiliamsport Distribution Center has never experienced a release of ammonia involving consequences that affected nearby residents or the environment. \n\n\n\nPursuant to RMP Regulations (40 CFR 68)and the Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations Save A Lot has developed a comprehensive PSM written program to protect employees and the surrounding community from exposure  to the hazardous chemicals located on site. The facility completed a process hazard analysis (PHA)for the ammonia refrigeration system using the industry standard What-If Checklist Analysis developed  through the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR). The PHA was completed using refrigeration contractor that operates the system and onsite operations staff from the Williamsport facility as well as experinced facilitators from outide engineering firm and corporate staff. The PHA was revalidated to meet both PSM and RMP requiremenst in June 2014. \n\n\n\nSave A Lot's implementation of the PSM program includes employee education in the hazards of ammonia and measures that can be used to reduce employee and community exposure to accidental releases of ammonia.
