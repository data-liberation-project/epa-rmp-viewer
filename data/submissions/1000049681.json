The Facility Policy\n\n\n\nThe owners, management, and employees of Brandt Consolidated, Inc. are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the Greenview Fire Dept., Menard Co LEPC or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n\n\n2. Stationary Sources and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers, farm chemicals and related agricultural products, for sale to the farmer.\n\n\n\nThe maximum quantity of Anhydrous Ammonia stored would be 30000 gallons (or 140196 lbs.) in our storage tank(s), consisting of 1-30,000 gal. fixed ammonia storage tank. The maximum quantity handled in the largest tank (1-30,000 gal. ) would be 140196 pounds of Anhydrous Ammonia. We also store ammonia in our nurse tanks parked at the facility, total storage if all nurse tanks and storage tank were full could exceed 445,000 lbs.\n\n\n\n3. The Worst-Case Release Scenario and the Alternative Release Scenario.\n\n\n\nWorse-Case:  Information not released\n\n\n\nAlternative Case:  Information not released\n\n\n\n4.
