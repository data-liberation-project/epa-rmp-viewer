EPA guidance documentation was utilized to determine all receptors within toxic endpoints of a chemical release from a covered process emanating from our WWTP .\n\nChlorine\nA Worst Case release could potentially affect a radius of 1.3 miles in our urban environment. An estimated population within that radius was estimated to be 2,640.\nAn Alternative Case (most likely scenario) could potentially affect a radius of .45 miles. An estimated population within that radius was estimated to be 56\n\n\nIn the past five years the WWTP has had no releases associated with a covered process.\n"
