It is also the policy of the Collier County Water Department to work with surrounding community and local emergency response agencies, and promote a spirit of cooperation and teamwork to provide an effective contingency plan in the event that a process incident occurs at the North County Regional Water Treatment Plant (NCRWTP).    The first responder to any incident at the NCRWTP is the Golden Gate Fire Department (GGFD).  The GGFD works in close relation with the operations team at the NCRWTP, including training on site annually and sitting in on the annual review of the Risk Management Plan (RMP).  \r\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled:\r\nThe primary activity at the NCRWTP is a municipal water treatment plant.  Chlorine is the only 40 CFR 68 regulated substance at plant.  Chlorine is used primarily as a disinfectant.  The maximum amount of chlorine on site at this facility is 24 tons.\r\n\r\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps:\r\nCollier County is in compliance with 40 CFR 68. The County has conducted a comprehensive review of the chlorine system, as well as, administrative, technical, operating, and maintenance procedures.  In addition, all program elements have been reviewed by the County's internal safety auditors (Risk Management Department) and found to be in compliance.\r\n\r\nThe County has both passive mitigation, an enclosed building and active mitigation, an emergency scrubber, to minimize the consequences of an accidental release.  The Risk Management Program addresses actions to minimize the likeliho"

The issue was the result of defective equipment provided by Collier County's at that time chlorine vendor.  The incident resulted in 1 pound of chlorine released within the chlorine room.  Internal on-site trained staff responded to the incident and was able to secure the cylinder.  The vendor removed the cylinder from the site within 48 hours.  After this incident the vendor was terminated.\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program:\r\nThe NCRWTP has an emergency response program that is coordinated with the Collier County Comprehensive Emergency Response Plan (ERP) that has been prepared in accordance with all local, state, and federal regulations.  The ERP for the NCRWTP specifically is attached to the RMP document as Attachment A to Chapter 9.  The ERP is reviewed annually by the Water Department management team.  Collier County conducts regular exercises on various components of the ERP, which the Water Department actively participates in. \r\n\r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:\r\nAs part of the Process Hazard Analysis that have been conducted every three years various actionable items have been identified.  The following is the update on the items that were pending since the last five year update to the RMP:\r\n\r\nThe current location of the header vacuum gauge and valves is a trip hazard. The header should be moved to a safer location to avoid potential falls, which could result in leakage at a valve.  \r\nOutcome:  The Chlorine Room was reviewed by Camp, Dresser, and McKee Engineering firm and it was found that there was no alternative locations for the current equipment.  The area has been painted with bright paint and lighting is on at all times to alleviate the potential for trips or fall incidents.  Additionally, all NCRWTP are reminded annually of the importance of maintaining this area"

The first responder to the NCRWTP is the Golden Gate Fire Department and the primary haz-mat responder is the North Naples Fire Department.  Both Department's have been provided copies of the Department's Risk Management Plans.\r\n\r\nWrite chlorine vendor to request all documentation of safety training that relates to off load and loading cylinders.\r\nOutcome:  The Plant Manager annually updates the information maintained on file at the NCRWTP to document that all drivers sent to the Plant have been appropriately trained.\r\n\r\nProvide updated awareness training to permit team regarding blasting restrictions in the area surrounding the Plant.  \r\nOutcome:  The Collier County Growth Management Division is responsible for issuance of blasting permits for all of Collier County.  On the County's GIS the two regional water treatment plants, including the NCRWTP is clearly identified.  \r\n\r\nDevelop Job Safety Analysis (JSA) in addition to existing standard operating procedure for offloading and loading cylinders be sure it addresses chalking of cylinders, ergonomics (body mechanics), and crane inspection/operation.\r\nOutcome:  JSA has been developed and is part of the NCRWTP RMP base document.\r\n\r\nInstall additional Wind Sox so one can be seen while standing at all areas from the ground on plant property.\r\nOutcome:  The wind sock has been installed and a work order created in the NCRWTP's maintenance management software to replace twice per year.\r\n\r\nConduct 8HRs of HAZMAT Scenario training for all hazardous materials potential releases including chlorine and terrorist acts and community notification.
