The stationary source and regulated substances handled:\n\nThe facility is approximately 20 acres, with the primary purposes of chemical distribution.  More specifically, this facility stores chlorine and sulfur dioxide for distribution which include water treatment and general industry facilities.  Chlorine and sulfur dioxide are received in Department of Transportation (DOT) approved 150 pound cylinders and ton containers and are shipped in the same packages.  Chlorine and sulfur dioxide are not used, manufactured, or repackaged at this facility.  Access to the site is restricted to Harcros employees, and authorized contractors and visitors. \n\n \n\n3. The general accidental release prevention program and the specific prevention steps:\n\nThis distribution facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention and OSHA's Process Safety Management programs.

Below is a summary of our Prevention Program:\n\n\n\n-Hazard reviews are conducted at least every five years for chlorine and sulfur dioxide.\n\n-Standard operating procedures which includes visual inspection of the cylinders and containers.\n\n-Training - Workers at facilities receive initial CHLOREP training plus periodic refresher training.\n\n-Incident investigations occur for any releases, injuries, or \"near-misses\" that could have led to either injuries and/or releases.  Corrective actions proposed as a result of these  -investigations are addressed in a timely manner.\n\n-Compliance audits are conducted every three years to assure the documentation and procedures fully comply with the RMP regulations.  Deficiencies discovered during audits are corrected in a timely manner.\n\n\n\n4. Five year accident history\n\nSince this facility began operations in 2006, we have had no accidental releases that have resulted in deaths, injuries or significant property damage on-site, or known off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage.\n\n\n\n5. The emergency response program\n\nThis facility's emergency response program is based upon The Chlorine Institute's Pamphlet 64, Emergency Response Plans for Chlorine Facilities.  This plan is reviewed annually and updated when required.  All response team members attend annual CHLOREP refresher training including the use of response equipment on simulated leaks.  We work closely with our suppliers, customers, public responders, and The Chlorine Institute to continuously improve our emergency response capabilities.  \n\n\n\n6. Planned changes to improve safety\n\nWe continue to be active participants in The Chlorine Institute and the National Association of Chemical Distributor programs, and to continue to improve our operations in accordance with Responsible "
