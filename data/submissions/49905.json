(ECO) operated and maintained the City of Sugar Land South Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP), located along Oil Field Road, south of Commonwealth Boulevard, in Fort Bend County, Texas until the Brazos River Authority took over as the plant operator in 2006.\n\nThe 7.5-mgd facility treats domestic sewage and waste sludge, and is situated amongst residential properties.  Treated effluent from the facility is chlorinated to kill pathogenic organisms using chlorine gas and dechlorinated with sulfur dioxide to remove residual chlorine from the effluent prior to its release to the receiving stream.  Chlorine and sulfur dioxide are hazardous substances, as defined by 40 CFR 68 and 29 CFR 1910.119, and would pose a threat to human health and safety and to environmental receptors if released.  The presence these two chemicals onsite mandates that a Risk Management Plan (RMP) be developed in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.119 to provide guidance and procedures for preventing or minimizing the consequences of the accidental hazardous release of gaseous chlorine and/or sulfur dioxide.  The existing RMP for the South WWTP was developed in June of 1999.  \n\nFor the RMP to be effective, the plant operator must become familiar with its contents through routine training and review of the prescribed procedures.  An update of the RMP must be performed every five years to review established procedures and practices outlined in the existing document and to check and revise each of the nine sections within the RMP*Submit program for accuracy.  \n\nIn the event of a toxic release, worst-case and alternate scenarios were examined as part of the RMP*Submit Program.  The scenarios utilized the EPA Risk Management Program Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants to model the distance to the toxic end point.  The worst-case scenario, a gas release, for both chlorine and sulfur dioxide assumes an urban setting with a distance of 1.3 miles to the toxic end point, which would impact 6"

In addition, a process safety hazard analysis was conducted using the program?s what-if methodology.  The consequences of both the worst-case and alternate scenarios for several what-if situations were analyzed and ways to prevent or minimize these consequences are provided in the original RMP.  \n\nThe following paragraphs detail the information, processes, and procedures described in the existing RMP that are currently in place at the South WWTP and were recently reviewed during the RMP Audit in September of 2003.\n\nSection 3, Process Safety Information, provides information regarding the physical properties and characteristics of chlorine and sulfur dioxide, as well as the process chemistry of the gases, chlorine and sulfur dioxide equipment information and Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) for each chemical.\n\nSection 4, Process Hazard Analysis, describes the process hazard analysis performed for the City of Sugar Land South WWTP.  An initial process hazard analysis was performed by ECO, which identified and evaluated all actual, potential and probable hazardous situations that might occur at the plant.  Based on the facility?s history, no events were identified that could be considered an incident, i.e., which had a likely potential for causing catastrophic consequences in the workplace.  \n\nSection 5, Operating Procedures, provides information regarding the handling and storage of chlorine and sulfur dioxide, procedures outlining how to change and repair chlorine and sulfur dioxide cylinders, safety protection measures to be follow when dealing with the two chemicals, and emergency situations which could result when dealing with the two gases and the appropriate procedures to follow should these events occur.\n\nSection 6, Training, mandates that ECO provide training for indivi"
