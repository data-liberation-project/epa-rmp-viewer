      "SummaryText": "Blencor, LLC. is a small facility located south of Sealy and Hwy 10 off of FM 3013. The ammonia refrigeration system is used to freeze product and cool raw materials. A ammonia cooled propylene glycol system is used to cool the process area. The system has exactly 11,000# of pure anhydrous ammonia used as a refrigerant. Parts of the system run 24hrs a day 7 days a week and are monitored by a control system that alarm operators of any potential issues or upset conditions. There are 4 levels of overpressure prevention. 1st, the compressors alarm and then shut off. If that fails, the control system shuts off the compressors.  If that does not stop the rise in pressure, a crossover system opens equalizing the system. As a final protection, relief valves are in place to prevent rupture relieving ammonia to atmosphere.  Ammonia detectors are installed in all spaces where ammonia is present in the equipment.  These sensors shut down the zones when ammonia is detected reducing losses to the volume of the equipment. All equipment is new and has been tested. Operating levels of the vessels are 25% or less. All equipment is state of the art technology. A full PSM program is in place and operators were trained by an ANSI-RETA (CIRO) Certified Industrial Refrigeration Operator who holds a RETA Authorized Instructor Certificate. All SOP were written by same person and reviewed by all Blencor operators, Blencor Safety personnel, and the Blencor maintenance manager.  The system is locateed about .5 miles from the nearest occupied residence.  The LEPC and Fire Department have been notified and the Hazmat team instructed. All equipment and material meets or exceeds current codes and regulations. All welds were made by welders certified by a Metallurgical Laboratory. All safety inspections were done by person holding an ANSI-RETA CIRO certification and 18 years experience in this field. The estimated maximum inventory the system could hold and still operate is 27,574# of ammonia.  The"
