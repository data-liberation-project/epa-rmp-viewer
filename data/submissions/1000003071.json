      "SummaryText": "The Litchfield Wastewater Treatment Facility's address is 1350 East Ryder Street. The facility is located in between East Ryder Street and the Litchfield Country Club. The facility uses one-ton cylinders of chlorine for disinfection of the discharge. Three cylinders are kept on site at all times in a cinderblock building. Only one cylinder is kept on line. When the on line cylinder has only 200 pounds of chlorine remaining, the second cylinder is placed on line.\n\nThe safety of the facility's employees and the community is our number one priority. The chlorination equipment is monitored on a daily basis. All chlorination equipment is tested on a monthly basis. The facility is equipped with a leak detection system that will alert the employees at any time of day. All proper safety and repair equipment is kept on site. All employees attend training sessions to prepare them for a safe response and a safe repair. The Litchfield Fire Department has agreed to assist with evacuation, safety of the employees and community, and chemical control. The facility has not had a release of chlorine over the past five years.\n\nTo comply with the Clean Air Act Part 112R, Environmental Management Corporation (EMC) and the City of Litchfield have developed this Risk Management Program (RMP). The RMP contains two scenarios, a worst-case and an alternative case. The worst-case scenario is a release of an entire one-ton cylinder in ten minutes. If this were to happen, it is a possibility that a chlorine cloud could reach 0.9 miles from the facility. The speed and direction of the chlorine cloud would depend on the wind speed and direction. During an event like this, the fire department would respond as well and the EMC employees to assist in public notification, evacuation, chemical control, and repair. The alternative release would be a release of 171 pounds of chlorine over one hour. The chemical cloud would not leave the facility's boundaries."
