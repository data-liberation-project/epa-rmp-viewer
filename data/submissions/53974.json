If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the BELLE RIVE Fire Depaartment, JEFFERSON County Local Emergency Plannning Committee or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to to people and the environment.\n\n2. The stationary source and the regulated substances handled.\n\nThe primary activity at the facility, which is located at 100 NORTH BIRCHis the storage and distribution of fertilizers for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient.  The storage and handling system consists of NURSE TANKStank, loading risers, associated plumbing and nurse tanks.  Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel and authorized contractors.\n\nThe maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia that can be stored would be 42,000pounds, this includes the amount of anhydrous ammonia that could be stored in nurse tanks.\n\nThis facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations. This facility has implemented the provisions of Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, \nK6-11, published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc as adopted by state regulation and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CF"
