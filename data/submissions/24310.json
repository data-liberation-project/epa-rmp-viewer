      "SummaryText": "    The Village of Monticello Water Treatment Plant, located on Kiamesha Lake in the Town of Thompson, Sullivan County, New York has a current capacity of 2.4 MGD, although average consumption flows range from 0.85 MGD in the winter months to 1.0 MGD in the summer months.  Water is pumped from Kiamesha Lake through a flashmix and flocculation chamber, clarifier tank and a series of gravity sand filters, with filtered water discharged into a large capacity clearwell under the main plant building.  Water flows are disinfected by gas chlorination and conveyed to the village distribution system.\n     Three (3) one ton steel chlorine cylinders are located in a room at the northwest corner of the main plant building.  The tanks hold approximately 2,000 lbs. of chlorine gas each, used in accordance with the water disinfection process.  The room is equipped with a chlorine monitor/alarm, a tank and piping repair kit and dual scott packs located on the entrance door to the storage room to be used in the event of a chlorine leak.\n     Due to the potential hazards associated with the potential release of toxic, chlorine gas, the storage of approximately 6,000 lbs. of the substance requires conformance with EPA Risk Management Program Regulations (40 CFR 68) found in 112(r) of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, OSHA Process Safety Management Standards and NYSDEC Hazardous Substance Bulk Storage Regulations.  The safety procedures and spill prevention measures are outlined in this Program Level 3 Report and a Spill Prevention Report for Handling and Storage of Hazardous Substances at the Village of Monticello Water Treatment Plan and Wellfield, dated November 6, 1998 and prepared by Glenn L. Smith, P.E., Consulting Engineer."
