A Hazop analysis supplemented with what if/checklist was selected and utilized.\n\nThe process hazard analysis were conducted/revalidated in 2008, 2009, 2014, and 2019.

Plant personnel do not fight pentane fires. Upon detection of a pentane fire, personnel are instructed to initiate automatic shutdown of the process which removes heat, closes isolation valves, and depressurizes equipment.

Responding fire department personnel assume incident command upon arrival. \n\nCallout protocol\nIf any of the following alarm conditions are indicated by the CS-5 monitoring system, the call-out protocol must be followed: OEC failure, security/fire alarm trip.

Employees report any equipment deficiencies  and generate work orders for the repair or assessment of the problem. Routine comprehensive inspections are performed using checklists. \n\nStandard Operating Procedures:\nOperating procedures are developed to address plant startup, shutdown, normal operation, monitoring, and emergency shutdown.\n\nSafety Systems:\nThe principal methods of accident prevention include equipment design safeguards, written procedures, and operator training. Safety systems are present in the plant that provide alarms and control interlocks to place the process in a safe state. High pressure safety systems are one such example. An initial alarm alerts the control room operator both audibly and visually of the pressure rise. This initial alarm affords the operator the opportunity to take some corrective action. If the pressure rise continues unabated, automatic shutdown of select process equipment is initiated to mitigate the problem. If the initial alarm and subsequent shutdown fail to mitigate the pressure rise, pressure safety valves are in place to relieve the pressure safely to atmosphere or to larger volume, lower pressure, systems. Another safety system component is the combustible gas detection system. Sensors are strategically located in each plant. Control Room audio and visual alarms annunciate concentrations of concern. There are also cameras that can be used to monitor and view possible issues. \n\n\nTraining: some equipment in the OREG2 facilities poses potential fire, explosion, and elec"

Examination of topographic maps, aerial photographs, and visual observation of the potentially affected area in a worst-case scenario did not identify any residential structures or parks. However, this facility is adjacent to the compressor station that provides the heat source and this station is within the affected area. The compressor station staff is not employed by Ormat, nor does Ormat control their access to the compressor station. Given this proximity to public receptors, this facility cannot qualify for an RMP program level 1. In the initial RMP submittal, compressor station employees were not considered public receptors; hence, a program level 1 was designated. Although program level 1 was initially designated, the OREG always had a program level 3 prevention program in place and are now registered as a program level 3 facility.\n\nAlternate Case Scenario Description\n\nThe alternate case scenario is based on a pool fire.

The power from this project is sold to Basin Electric Power Cooperative based in Bismarck, ND.\n\nThe basic Rankine cycle model consists of four components:\n1. Pump -Work Input\n2. Waste Heat Boiler -Heat Input\n3. Turbine -Work Output\n4. Condenser -Heat Rejection\n\nThe Rankine cycle consists of pressurizing a liquid (pentane), vaporizing the high-pressure liquid, expanding the high-pressure vapor and condensing the low-pressure vapor for reuse in the closed loop process. The energy necessary for the vaporization is provided by thermal oil at a maximum temperature of 572\u00b0F. The thermal energy is transferred to the pentane working fluid via tube and counter-current shell heat exchangers. The OREG2 facility uses a commercial pentane with a dry cooling heat rejection system.\n\nPrimary Activities \n\nWaste thermal energy is converted to electric power. The facility is rated at 6000 KW. The net power output to the electrical grid is rated at 5100 KW. Power output is reduced in warm weather due to limitations of the air cooled heat exchangers.\n\nUse of Regulated Substance\n\nPentane, a flammable vapor/liquid is used as a binary working fluid. Liquid pentane is pumped from a condenser to shell and tube heat exchangers. Thermal energy provided by thermal oil is transferred to the pentane. The thermal oil heat input causes the pentane to change physical states from liquid to high pressure superheated vapor that is passed through a turbine to produce electric power. The vapor is condensed and recycled back to a pressurized liquid recuperator vessel to complete the Rankine cycle. A pentane storage tank is available for makeup. The facility design is segregated into multiple sections, each having its own design specifications dictated by the pentane conditions in that section. The sections include: the low pressure process equipment, the high pressure process equipme"

(OREG2 ) Recovered Energy Generation (REG) facility complies with numerous standards for pressure vessel design and testing as well as all Federal and North Dakota process safety management requirements. It is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws. Copies of emergency response, process hazard analyses, process safety management plans, and all technical drawing (P&IDS) for process equipment are maintained onsite for reference. Regular inspection and testing of the pentane and thermal oil systems are performed to ensure equipment integrity is maintained. The facility is equipped with a network of leak detection equipment, automatic shutdown logic controls, insulation, safety relief valves, and fire detection monitors. OREG2 provides high levels of training in operating procedures, safety and emergency response. If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to implement the emergency response procedures to mitigate damages, and to notify the nearest fire department and request their assistance.\n\nDescription of Stationary Source\n\nThe OREG2 power units are fueled by waste heat from a compressor turbine exhaust that is transferred from thermal energy into mechanical energy. This is accomplished by utilizing the organic Rankine cycle technology. The hot gases of the turbine exhaust flow through a Waste Heat Oil Heater (WHOH), where the heat from the gases is transferred to a thermal oil heat transfer fluid. The thermal oil is then circulated to the shell and tube vaporizer of an Ormat Energy Converter (OEC). The motive fluid on the shell side is vaporized and these vapors drive a special organic fluid turbine. This turbine drives a generator which produces grid compatible power. The motive f1uid then passes through a heat exchanger and enters the cycle again as a liquid. After exiting the various heat exchangers, t"
