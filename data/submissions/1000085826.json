Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nThe primary technique used to perform these evaluations is the Hazard and Operability Study (HAZOP).  The purpose of a PHA is to perform a systematic review of existing and/or proposed processes to identify, evaluate, and control process hazards.\n\n\n\nQuestSpecialty uses one or more of the following PHA methods, as appropriate, to determine and evaluate the hazards of the process being analyzed:\n\n\n\n-What if\n\n-What If/Checklist\n\n-Hazard and Operability study (HAZOP)\n\n-Failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA)\n\n-Fault tree analysis or\n\n-An appropriate equivalent methodology.\n\n\n\nThe PHA is conducted by a team of people with expertise in engineering and process operations.  The team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as prevention and mitigation measures currently in place and makes recommendations for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures as necessary to reduce risks to as low as reasonably practicable. Recommendations are reviewed by the QuestSpecialty Management Team and after approval, corrective actions are assigned and distributed to impacted personnel for follow-up.  \n\nAction items are tracked to closure to ensure that all follow-up items are completed in a timely manner.  Completed items are documented, and a copy of this document is placed with the PHA.  PHAs will be revalidated at least every five years.  The revalidation will include a review of the changes and incidents that have taken place in the process since the last PHA and will include recommendations for additional prevention a"

These operating procedures are stored electronically on an internal server for employee access and are periodically reviewed and revised. \n\n\n\nTRAINING\n\n\n\nQuestSpecialty's Training program includes formal on-boarding, job-specific training, compliance training, and safety training. Each employee involved in operating a process is trained in an overview of the process and in the operating procedures developed for that process. The Safety Manager or their designee is responsible for scheduling and coordinating the following training for PSM/RMP affected employees.\n\n\n\nMECHANICAL INTEGRITY\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity includes all activities required to ensure proper design, construction, and ongoing integrity and reliability of equipment in order to prevent or minimize incidents for the life of the equipment.  QuestSpecialty has a written program in place that detail well-established practices and procedures for the inspection, testing, monitoring, and maintenance of process equipment.  Mechanical Integrity Training is routinely conducted, and procedures are periodically reviewed and updated.  \n\n\n\nMANAGEMENT OF CHANGE\n\n\n\nThe Management of Change (MOC) program is intended to cover changes to the process chemicals, technology, equipment, and procedures, and changes to stationary sources that affect a covered process. QuestSpecialty reviews and approves a proposed modification at conception under the MOC/PSSR process prior to addressing the change. The MOC requests are tracked, and once all the required reviews are completed, the MOC is approved for change implementation.

For changes requiring significant updates to procedures or equipment, special training sessions (meeting the training requirements of the company's RMP/PSM programs) may be necessary for operators, mechanics, and/or contractors. For less significant changes, simply communicating information about the change and its anticipated effects on operation/maintenance may substitute for training sessions.\n\n\n\nPRE-STARTUP REVIEW\n\n\n\nPre-startup safety review (PSSR) must be conducted on new facilities and modified facilities when the modification is significant enough to require a change in the process safety information.  The pre-startup safety process is used in conjunction with the Management of Change (MOC) process.  If the change triggers a PSSR, then approval for startup also requires satisfying the PSSR requirements. The PSSR process requires the appropriate personnel to field verify that the change was constructed and installed per the approved design and equipment specifications following the completion of the installation and prior to startup.\n\n\n\nCOMPLIANCE AUDITS\n\n\n\nThe QuestSpecialty RMP/PSM program is audited every three years and includes verification that the procedures and practices that have been developed to comply with the RMP Prevention Program and PSM regulations are adequate and being followed.   Compliance audits are conducted by at least one person knowledgeable in the process, and this person is impartial toward the facility or area being audited. The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to QuestSpecialty Management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked to closure.  The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are kept on the internal server.\n\n\n\nINCIDENT INVESTIGATION\n\n\n\nAn incident investigation must be conducted for every incident that resulted in or could reasonably have resulted of a regulated substance in a covered process."

Incident Investigation reports are retained for at least five (5) years.\n\n\n\nEMPLOYEE PARTICIPATION\n\n\n\nQuestSpecialty encourages participation in Process Safety Management through training and the development of cross-functional teams to perform process hazards analyses, incident investigations and compliance audits.  All new employees should be made aware of the RMP/PSM program as a part of the initial orientation process.  At least one hourly employee or a representative of the hourly employee, directly involved in the operation or maintenance of the site operations is represented in all meetings and/or formal discussions concerning RMP/PSM policies and procedures.

The EAP describes requirements that must be followed in the event of a release involving our LP-Gas system or if an emergency arises during maintenance activities. Since QuestSpecialty employees will not respond to releases of regulated substances, the EAP defines the response organizations on call, emergency notification procedures (internal and external), facility evacuation, site communication and best practices to be used in the event an incident should occur. The EAP is reviewed and updated at least once per year to incorporate any facility change.\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY \n\n\n\nWhile there are no planned changes to our safety program at this time, QuestSpecialty constantly reviews our safety program and institute revisions as appropriate to enhance safety and promote continuous improvement of our operations. \n\n\n\n"
