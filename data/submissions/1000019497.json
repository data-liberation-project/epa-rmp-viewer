              "Description": "Propylene is stored as a liquid in a vessel built to pressure vessel code.  The vessel is interconnected to a refrigeration unit which utilizes the propylene to reduce temperature to -300 F.  This cryogenic process separates the syngas into carbon monoxide and hydrogen, which is consumed in other processes.  The storage vessel utilizes pressure relief devices and local LEL detection for protection.  The portions of the unit operations at cryogenic temperatures utilize materials designed for use at this temperature.  A firewater system with hydrant monitors allows this system to mitigate leaks.  The unit has a DCS control system which provides the operators with information, warnings and alarms that ensure safe operation.  Operators are trained to follow standard operation procedures that ensure safe operation during normal, abnormal and emergency situations.  Linde Gas participates in a complex Emergency Response Team which allows trained responders to handle fire and hazardous materials response.",

              "Description": "Chlorine is stored in one ton cylinders as a liquid.  These cylinders are connected to the process via high pressure tubing to a Chlorinator unit where the Chlorine gas mixes with water and is then carried into the process.  The Chlorine treats the site's water systems for microbiological control in the Cooling Tower and Raw Water Treatment areas.  All instruments and materials of construction are designed for the process conditions and are a part of the site's inspection program.  Upon connecting the cylinder to the process, the fittings are leak checked with an Ammonia solution.  While the cylinder is connected, Operations frequently monitors the operations and ensures there are no leaks by smell (since Chlorine has a very pungent odor).  Usage is also monitored to ensure there are no undected leaks in the system.  There are procedures in place that Operations is trained on that handle normal, start up, shut down, and emergency operations.  Pre-plans have been made on handling small and large Chlorine leaks.  There is an on-site Emergency Response Team, trained in Hazardous Materials response, ready to respond on a 24/7 basis.  They have leak kits for the one ton cylinders and piping leaks",
