It case an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department and other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release on people and the environment.\n\nGeneral Operations:\nWe are located in the country.  Our business is selling fertilizer, pesticides, seeds, and related items to the farmers in our surrounding area.  We also provide custom application of fertilizer and pesticides to farms owned by our customers.  We have employees who are well versed in the safe handling of all of our hazardous materials.  Any new employees are trained by management plus are given on-the-job training by experienced employees.\n\nAmmonia:\nWe have an 12,000 gallon storage tank for anhydrous ammonia and several mobile tanks (1000 gallon capacity) on wagons.  We do not mix or react the ammonia with any other chemical.  We receive all of our ammonia by truck; the incoming trucks are unloaded by the truck drivers with their equipment according to DOT and other regulations.  The truck drivers are well trained.\nAfter the ammonia is in our storage tank it is loaded into the mobile tanks and delivered to farms by our employees or by the farmers themselves.  The use of ammonia by farmers is very seasonal.  Most of the handling of ammonia takes place in April-May-June in the spring and then also in October-November in the fall.\n\nAccident History:\nWe have had no accidents in the last five years.  We have a safe history of handling anhydrous ammonia.  Our employees recognize the potential dangers of unsafe handling of ammonia and thus treat it very carefully.\n\nWorst Case Release and Alternative Release Scenarios:\nIn preparing this data we have utilized the, \"Retail Guidance Document for EPA's Risk Management Program\" prepared by The Fertilizer Institute.  We have reported in Pro"

      "SummaryText": "gram 2 as this document suggests.  The releases were calculated using the model - DEGADIS.  In the worst case scenario we reported a release of the entire contents of our largest storage tank, 12,000 gallons of ammonia.  The estimated population within the maximum distance of 1.60 miles is 100.\nIn the alternative scenario we also used the - DEGADIS - model and supposed a transfer hose failure and a two minute release of ammonia.  The estimated population within the maximum distance of .80 miles is 20.\n\nRisk Management:\nWe operate our anhydrous ammonia installation under the rules and regulations of the Ohio Department of Agriculture.  Their representative inspects our operation annually and lists any deficiencies in the operation.  Any deficiencies are immediately corrected.  Normally, very few deficiencies are found.  For instance: ammonia hoses have the date of manufacture stamped on them and all hoses are replaced five years after date of manufacture or anytime there is evidence of damage.\nWe inspect our ammonia tank and piping prior to each season of use.  Also as our employees are loading ammonia form the storage tank to the mobile tanks, they are visually looking for any problems which might potentially occur.\n\nTraining:\nWe believe that hands on training is the best training for an employee who will handle anhydrous ammonia.  We have safety procedures and operation procedures for the handling of ammonia.  Annually the Ohio Agribusiness Association puts on a one day training seminar on Safe Handling or Anhydrous Ammonia.  We often send employees to attend this seminar.\nWe have an annual employee Right-to-Know training session and we cover anhydrous ammonia along with other hazardous materials.  We do emphasize the use of personal protective equipment and the inspection of tanks, piping, hoses, and wagons.\n\nEmergence Response:\nWe have an Emergency Action Plan and a Safety book which will spell out actions to be taken in case of spills or releases of any hazardou"

We will call the local Fire Department and the County Emergency Coordinator in any case of any spill which creates a danger to people or the environment.  In the case of an ammonia release of substance we will call the state EPA and The National Response Center.  \n\nWe do not have Self-Contained Breathing Apparatus respirators on hand and thus cannot approach leaks of ammonia unless the mist or vapor is very lowly concentrated.  We will call the Hazmat people immediately in case of a release of ammonia.  We will cooperate with the local fire department and emergency personnel in any exercises which might help us be prepared for an emergency.  In 1997 we hosted a visit from the fire department to show them all of the hazards they might face at our facility."
