A primary goal of the LEPC is to protect local citizens by developing and maintaining a coordinated emergency response plan and working with industry to minimize the impact of chemical hazards.  Through the LEPC, citizens can obtain information about hazardous substances handled at local facilities and about emergency planning efforts designed to successfully cope with accidents if they occur.  The LEPC maintains a coordinated emergency response plan for the community detailing operational procedures to be followed in the event of an accident involving hazardous materials.  The plan is available for public inspection.\n\n\n\nTippecanoe Labs actively supports local community outreach efforts through Community Advisory Panels and neighborhood groups.  These panels provide feedback from the community and advise Evonik on community issues.  Evonik also hosts plant tours and informative evening programs for nearby neighbors.  \n\n\n\n2.  THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED:\n\n\n\nTippecanoe Labs is divided into three main functional areas.  1) Bulk Pharmaceutical Manufacturing, manufactures bulk drug substances and clinical trials materials for human health products.  This area includes manufacturing facilities and warehouses.  2) Fermented Products Manufacturing, manufactures antibiotics and animal feed additives. This area includes manufacturing facilities, Utilities, Solvent Recovery, and storage tanks.  3) Site Services, includes Environmental Controls, Solvent Recovery and storage tanks, Incineration and infrastructure areas that provide services to the entire site.  The site also has laboratories and pilot plant facilities supporting research and development.  The facility has a Title V operating permit under the Clean Air Act.\n\n\n\nThe following regulated substances are handled at Tippecanoe Labs in quantities"
