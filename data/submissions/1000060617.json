      "SummaryText": "Introduction and Policies\n\n\n\nAllison Plant, owned and operated by Midcoast Pipelines (Texas Gathering) L.P., is committed to the same quality of safety and environmental excellence that all other Midcoast assets promote.  This philosophy involves making each and every employee and contractor accountable for their own safety as well as that of the community around them.  As a company we follow a close adherence to all applicable federal, state, and local laws to ensure a safe and healthy environment for all.\n\n\n\nEmployees who enter the Allison Plant complete a thorough training, both in the classroom and on-the-job, that enables them to address emergency issues as they arise.  This preparation includes standard operational, emergency operational, and release prevention training.  In addition, periodic refresher courses help to keep operators' problem solving abilities up to date and in sync with our recurring safety improvements.  Our regular internal audits provide an excellent checks and balances system for monitoring these high standards that we set.\n\n\n\nThe purpose of the Risk Management Plan (RMPlan) is to provide information about our operations at the facility, our programs to prevent accidental chemical releases, our emergency response plans in case an accidental release should occur, our 5-year accident history, and our planned changes to improve safety at the facility.  \n\n\n\nThe Allison Plant is a natural gas plant that extracts natural gas liquids (NGLs) from natural gas.   The plant  receives, stores and introduces natural gas liquids (NGLs) into the pipeline for sale to wholesale markets. After arriving at the facility via pipeline the inlet gas stream has condensate removed.  The remaining gas stream moves to the molecular sieve gas-dehydration unit, which removes most of the water from the gas stream.  Following dehydration the gas stream enters the cryogenic process where propane from (1) 30,000 gallon propane storage tank is used to cool the gas stream."

      "SummaryText": "  As the gas is cooled and expanded the heavier hydrocarbon gases are liquefied, thereby seperating the residue gas stream from the NGL stream.  The NGLs are then routed through (1) 20,000 gallon NGL surge tank prior to sale via pipeline.  There are no threshold quantities of toxic substances present.   The facility consists of multiple small lube oil, waste oil, condensate and fuel tanks and their associated piping, valves, pumps, and compressors on site that support the plant's compression as well as the NGL tanks.  As such, the Allison Plant is classified as a Program 1 RMP facility.\n\n\n\n\n\n&#8195;\n\nWorst Case and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\n\n\nAs specified by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) RMP Regulations, our worst-case release scenario for flammables would be the loss of all of the liquids in our largest vessel causing a vapor cloud explosion.  In the case of the Allison Plant, for the flammable liquids this would involve our 20,000 gallon flammable natural gas liquids tank (91,771 pounds) and for propane it would involve our 30,000 gallon propane storage tank.  Such a scenario is highly unlikely; however, using the EPAs RMP Comp calculations, the distance at which the resulting vapor cloud explosion could cause an overpressure of 1 psi would be approximately 0.3 miles (approximately 1,585 feet) for the flammable liquids and 0.4 miles (2,112 feet) for the propane.  An overpressure of 1 psi is the EPA's threshold for measurable impacts. \n\n\n\nMidcoast has discussed these potential hydrocarbon releases with its employees and with local emergency response officials in Wheeler County, thereby further reducing the possibility of any impact on the public.  \n\n\n\nAs a result of the Allison Plant being a Program 1 level RMP facility, there are no alternative release scenarios for the regulated substances on site.\n\n\n\nPrevention Program\n\n\n\nBelow is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the Allison Plant.

Employee involvement will help to ensure that all perspectives regarding PSM are considered, and that the best ideas are implemented.  Open communications are encouraged between supervisors and employees regarding all safety and health issues.  Allison Plant strongly promotes employee imvolvement in safety issues through existing programs.  These programs include Unit Safety Teams (which are made up of a cross section of employees and supervision), regularly scheduled safety meetings, tail-gate safety meetings, Hazard Communication, Safety Suggestion Forms, and special training programs (Emergency Response Training, First Aid, etc.). \n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information:  Complete and accurate written process safety information (PSI) concerning process chemicals, process technology, and process equipment is essential to an effective PSM and RMP program and to completing and maintaining a process hazard analysis (PHA).  The PSI will be useful to the operators; the team performing the PHA; those in charge of training; contractors; those conducting pre-startup safety reviews; and those in charge of updating the emergency preparedness plans.

Chemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response / exposure treatment consideration, is provided in safety data sheets (SDSs).\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA):  Allison Plant has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.  The facility primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) method analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.  Periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.  \n\n\n\nOperating Procedures:  Allison Plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, normal shutdown, and initial startup of a new process.  These procedures provide guidance for experienced operators and also provide the basis for training new operators.  Operating procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.  The review and certification process involves both operators and technical staff.  \n\n\n\nTraining:  In addition to training on operating procedures, the facility has a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating the process.

All of this training is documented for each operator including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.  \n\n\n\nContractors:  Allison Plant uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the facility has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have appropriate skills, (3) are aware of the hazards of their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site specific safety rules, and (6) inform facility personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.  This is accomplished by providing contractors with orientation sessions pertaining to these key points.  \n\n\n\nPre-startup Safety Review (PSSR):  Allison Plant conducts a PSSR on any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in process safety information.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready.  The PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves as a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.  \n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity:  Allison Plant has well established practices and procedures for maintaining process equipment.

These procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.  \n\n\n\nManagement of Change:  Allison Plant has a comprehensive system to manage changes to all covered processes.  This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented.  Changes are reviewed to ensure that adequate controls have not been compromised by the changed.  Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on the change.  \n\n\n\nIncident Investigation:  Allison Plant promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in or reasonably could have resulted in a fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury.

Although we take pride in that record, we also place daily emphasis on our prevention and safety programs to ensure this record continues.  \n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\n\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving our natural gas liquid extraction, LP-Gas handling and storage facility, it is our policy to follow our Emergency Response Plan, which is linked with the Wheeler County Emergency Management District Emergency Response Plan.  Activation of this emergency response plan sets in motion a pre-planned series of events that notify all area emergency response agencies.  Emergency response agencies are notified on the 911 system and directly.  The 911 call is channeled through the Wheeler County Sheriff's Department.  All agencies and personnel respond to predetermined staging areas with representatives from each agency reporting to the Central Command Post (CP).  A contingency plan is developed and executed using trained industry personnel along with other emergency response personnel from responding agencies, "

Box 375\n\nWheeler, TX 79096\n\nPhone: 806-826-3333\n\nkjdeoc@hotmail.com\n\n\n\nEmployees of this facility are provided with copies of the Emergency Response Plan when initially hired and the plan is reviewed and kept up to date by the Emergency Response Supervisor and deemed to be acceptable.  All of our operators at this facility have had the appropriate emergency response training as mandated by the OSHA standard.  This plan and our emergency response policy have also been discussed with the local fire departments and members of the fire departments have thoroughly inspected our facility.  \n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nDiligent compliance with our RMP Prevention Program forms the framework on which we will continue to improve the level of safety at the Allison Plant.  Some of the key components of the safety improvements we expect to achieve are as follows:\n\n\n\n?    The Management of Change provisions ensures that we consider the potential safety and health impacts of any change we make to process chemicals, technology, equipment or procedures.  \n\n?    The Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) provisions serve as a tool to ensure continual evaluation of potential hazards, thereby leading to continual improvements in our safety standards.  \n\n?    The Mechanical Integrity provisions ensure that process equipment and instrumentation are designed, constructed, installed and maintained to minimize the risk of hazardous releases, thereby serving as an integral part of our safety program.  \n\n?    Internal and third party compliance audits will ensure we maintain and increase our level of safety protection.\n\n\n\nWe encourage all interested citizens or community organizations to learn more about our latest information on emergency response for the county.  We plan to diligently integrate our response capabilities and personnel with those of the county on an ongoing basis.  \n\n&#8195;\n\n"
