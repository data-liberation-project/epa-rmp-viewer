      "SummaryText": "Monsanto Ag Products, RMP Facility ID#1000 0016 4162, November 2011, voluntary update.\n\n\n\nMonsanto performs agricultural research and prepares cotton seed for planting at the facility located in Aiken, Texas.  Cotton seed is prepared for planting by chemically removing lint from the seed using anhydrous hydrogen chloride (gas).  The delinted seed is treated with fungicides and other treatment chemicals and packaged for distribution.  Monsanto is dedicated to performing these activities safely and complying with all regulations regarding use of HCL, including requirements of the OSHA Process Safety Management Program and the EPA Risk Management Program.\n\n\n\nA maximum of 30,000 pounds of HCL is kept onsite for use in the delinting process.  The HCl is delivered and is stored in two trailers, each containing up to six 3,000 pound compressed gas cylinders.  Only one tube is used at a time to supply HCl to the delinting process.  The facility operates from September through May of each year and is shut down for the summer months.\n\n\n\nMonsanto has conducted offsite consequence analyses for HCl from the process. Both a worst-case and alternative release scenario was considered.  The worst-case scenario considered the release of an entire cylinder containing 3,000 pounds of HCl over a 10 minute period.  The alternative release scenario considered a slow release of a 3,000 pound cylinder of a 80 minute period.  The EPA RMP Comp Version 1.07 release modeling software, used with published EPA guidance, predicted that a toxic plume could affect offsite receptors under both release scenarios.  \n\n\n\nMonsanto's Aiken facility has not had an accidental release of HCl in over 30 years.  To protect employees and the local community from any future HCl release, Monsanto had developed an incident prevention program. Elements of the program include:  hazardous analysis and identification, engineering design HCl system, operating procedures, emergency response procedures, employee training,"

      "SummaryText": " preventive maintenance, and incident investigation.  Hazard analysis identified piping leaks as the most probable cause of a release.  The use of only one cylinder at a time from the 6 cylinder trailer limits the potential release amount.  The engineering design of the HCl piping system includes excess flow detection and automatic shutoff valves.  Check valves are also installed between critical points in the HCl system to prevent backflow in case of a line rupture.  These automatic systems are backed up by manual shutoff valves.\n\n\n\nIn addition to engineering controls, various administrative controls are also used to prevent releases.  Specific personnel are trained to follow the operating procedures developed for the delinting system and on-the-job training is used to assure their competence.  Emergency response procedures and equipment are maintained for use in the unlikely event of a significant accidental release.  \n\n\n\nIf a release should occur, Monsanto will immediately notify and coordinate with local emergency personnel.  Local wind speed and direction from monitors at the facility would be used to plan any offsite protective measures necessary and local emergency response personnel would notify the affected residents and implement responses. \n\n"
