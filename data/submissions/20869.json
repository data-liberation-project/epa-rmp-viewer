The properties of chlorine make it necessary to observe safety precautions in handling this chemical to prevent human exposure, and to reduce the threat to the facility's workers and nearby members of the community. It is the facility's policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and State rules and regulations. Safety depends upon the safe procedures used to handle chlorine; the safety devices and systems designed and constructed into the facility; and the training of the pertinent personnel.\n\n2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe City of Reedley operates a 2.77 million gallon per day (MGD) wastewater treatment plant and disposal facility.  Disposal is to 23 acres of percolation-evaporation basins with an underdrain system.  Treated effluent is also available for farm irrigation.  During a three to four month period during the winter, when the evaporation rate is not sufficient to supplement the percolation capacity of the ponds, and when the Kings River is flowing at a rate to provide an adequate dilution rate, excess, treated, percolated, disinfected and dechlorinated effluent can be diverted to the Kings River.  Chlorine gas is injected into water to form a concentrated chlorine solution.  This solution is then mixed with water received from the percolation pond subdrains for disinfection  prior to discharge into the Kings River.\n\nThe chlorine is received in one ton containers.  Gaseous chlorine is obtained from a one ton container connected by a vacuum regulator to a chlorinator which feeds the chlorine gas under vacuum to an injector where the chlorine gas is injected into a water flow.\n\n3a. Worst Case Release Scenario\n\nThe largest storage vessel is a one ton container of chlorine for the chlorine system. Failure of  the container will release 2,000 lb of chlorine.  It is assumed that "

      "SummaryText": "the entire 2,000 lb is released as gas in ten minutes. The assumption is made that the gas release from the one ton container is directly to the surrounding atmosphere.  The distance to the endpoint of 3 ppm for the Worst Case scenario for the chlorine will extend beyond the boundaries of the stationary source.\n \n3b. Alternative Release Scenario\n\nThe Alternative Release scenario is considered as a small leak in the packing material around the valve stem of the vapor phase valve located on the one ton container of chlorine. There are no active or passive mitigation measures that would reduce the amount of chlorine released or treatment system to which the released chlorine would be directed. It is assumed that there is a release of 0.5 lb/min which would continue for a period of sixty minutes. During that time, a total of 30.0 pounds of chlorine would be released. The distance to the endpoint of 3 ppm for the Alternative Release scenario for the chlorine will extend beyond the boundaries of the stationary source.\n\n3c. Administrative Controls\n\nAdministrative control to limit the distances for each reported scenario exists to restrict the amount of chlorine released to a minimum, if a release were to occur; and preferably to not have a release occur. This administrative control is inherent in the operational procedures for the chlorine system and the training provided to the chlorine system operators.\n\n3d. Mitigation Measures\n\nMitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario exists to restrict the amount of chlorine released to a minimum, if a release were to occur; and preferably to not have a release occur. The mitigation measures are based upon the design, inspection, testing, and maintenance of the chlorine system and the related equipment and components.\n\n4. General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe facility complies with all applicable federal and state codes and regulations. There are safety me"

The Process Safety Management (PSM) program implemented at the facility for the chlorine related activities and equipment represents one of the facility's main active commitments to an accidental release prevention program.\n\n5. Five Year Accident History\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of chlorine within the last five years.\n\n6. Emergency Response Program\n\nThe Emergency Response Program is based upon the alerting of personnel at the facility to evacuate the facility and await the arrival of responders from outside the facility at the evacuation assembly location if a release occurs that causes the evacuation to be initiated.  This response can be incorporated into the Area Plan by the Local Emergency Planning Committee.\n\n7. Planned Changes To Improve Safety\n\nAny commitments made for scheduled mitigation actions are listed in the element (e) (i.e. Process Hazard Analysis) of the Process Safety Management (PSM) document. These mitigation actions are being implemented at this time for the next year. Current applicable codes and regulations are being reviewed to determine if other commitments need to be made to achieve increased operational safety for the chlorine system."
