The facility manufactures bleached kraft pulp and employs about 350 employees. The bleached kraft pulp operation manufactures papergrade and fluff pulp. The papergrade and fluff pulp is sold and made, respectively, into fine paper and absorbent products such as diapers.\n\nChlorine dioxide is the only RMP covered chemical used, manufactured or stored on the plant site in quantities above the designated Threshold Quantity. Chlorine dioxide (ClO2) gas is a yellowish/green gas used to bleach kraft pulp. There are 2 ClO2 solution storage tanks with a volume of 94,000 gallons each. The chlorine dioxide generator is capable of manufacturing about 600 gallons/minute at a concentration of about 11.2 grams/liter solution (1.12%). \n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\nThe CCF accident prevention program for"

CCF encourages team members with knowledge and experience working with hazardous chemicals to participate in the PHA task team effort. The PHA findings are shared with employees working with hazardous chemicals. Employees are advised of any necessary changes brought about by the PHA and, in some cases, may be involved in the design change and implementation process. \n\n?\tOperating Procedures: \nCCF process engineers, operators, and management work together to develop and maintain operating procedures to define how tasks related to process operations should be safety performed. Employees participate in operating procedure development in several ways: \n1.\tEmployees are consulted during procedure development and implementation to determine if the procedures accurately reflect what is practiced in the field and what additional measures should be added to increase worker safety and protect the environment.\n2.\tDevelopment of Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) are assigned to employees that have recognized knowledge, experience and job skills related to the assigned procedure. \n3.\tImplementation of new processes or procedures is assigned to a commissioning team. These assignments typically include an opportunity for a critique of the work processes and procedures. \n\n?\tTraining: \nCCF trains employees to safely and effectively perform their assigned tasks. Employees are trained through self-taught learning materials including operations manuals, educational modules and computer based education programs. In addition, employees are trained one-on-one through on-the-job training in the field. Employees are encouraged to identify education needs and tak"

Employees record equipment history, data and observations, maintain the SAP maintenance system database, and generate Reliability Maintenance system reports. The employee doing the actual test and inspection work is typically asked to review and comment about manufacturers recommendations for preventive maintenance procedures and test frequencies. Employees take part in equipment failure reviews, participate in work process critiques, and are encouraged to make recommendations for change. \n\n?\tManagement of change: \nThe CCF management of change program evaluates and approves all proposed changes to chemicals, equipment, and procedures for a covered process to help ensure that the change does not negatively affect safe operations. Process changes that are determined to be a replacement in kind are approved without completing the full management of change process. Changes other than \u00c2\u00bflike kind\u00c2\u00bf must be approved through the management of change process to ensure that potential accidents resulting from change are prevented, safety concerns of changes are addressed, affected process safety information and procedures are updated, and affected employees are notified of the changes.  \n\n?\tPre-startup Review: \nCCF performs a safety review of a new or modified process before the process is placed into service to ensure that the process has been prepared to operate safely.

In these audits, adherence to both Corporate and mill policies, internal procedures and standards are verfied. Team members will be interviewed as part of audit protocols to permit them to give input on the specific issues being audited. Audit reports, response plans and status updates are shared with affected employees. \n\n?\tIncident Investigation: \nCCF investigates all incidents that could have resulted in a serious injury to personnel, the public, or the environment so that similar accidents can be prevented. Team members are involved in incident investigation since their knowledge and skills in operations or maintenance are necessary to conduct the investigation. Once investigation team reports become available, the results and recommendations of the team are made available to those working in the process or operation. Communication is in the form of a report, which is circulated among employees and is discussed in scheduled safety meetings and in ad hoc meetings with team members. \n\n?\tEmployee Participation : \nCCF developed a written employee participation program for covered processes to help ensure that the safety concerns of CCF workers are addressed. Team members participate in compiling process safety and maintenance information with field checks to verify the accuracy of P&IDs, loop drawings, and equipment drawings used in normal work processes and through communication of observations made during the normal conduct of their work - particularly those that reflect operational safety hazards. \n\n?\tHot Work Permits (Safe Work Practices): \nCCF established a hot work permit program to control activities which"

It is the intent of site management to disclose to team members and contract employees as necessary (subject to 29 CFR 1910.1200(i) trade secret protection constraints where applicable) the process safety related information needed to have an informed workforce whose efforts and attention to detail will ensure the CCF continues to be a safe workplace. \n\n5 Year Accident History\nIn the past 5 years, there has not been any injuries as a result of chlorine dioxide exposure. \n\nEmergency Response Program\nAn Emergency Response Team capable of providing multiple emergency response functions is available on the plantsite. The team has regular Haz-Mat, fire fighting, and confined space/high angle rescue training and drills. In addition, the team is trained in CPR, patient packaging and handling and bloodborne pathogens. \n\nIn emergencies, the production coordinator is the incident commander who determines the degree of hazard and risk posed to public health and the environment. An internal alert millwide alarm system can be sounded to summon the emergency response team.

      "SummaryText": "may result in fires or explosions in covered processes. Team members, with appropriate job skills and experience, participate in the review of safe work practice procedures through their involvement with safety subteams, site-central safety core team or ad-hoc task teams.  A cross section of knowledgeable team members may be called upon to draft procedures and revisions to procedures. During the development or changes to critical activity procedures, emphasis is placed on involving a core functional team that will be affected by the procedure. \n\n?\tContractors: \nCCF established a program to ensure that contractor activities at the CCF facility are performed in a safe manner. Team members at CCF have an integral role in the interface with contractors working at the site. They often work side-by-side with contract employees and have a high level of knowledge about how the contractor's work can affect or be affected by the process or adjacent processes. Each site team member and contract employee is encouraged to ask questions and to raise concerns about unsafe work activities or conditions. Site team members are expected to inform contract employers of the potential hazards of fire, explosion or toxic releases when repairing equipment so that contractors can work on it safely. Contractors are given a PSM Safety Orientation to the hazards of the process, how to protect themselves from those hazards and what to do in the event they do get exposed. After the Safety Orientation they must pass a written exam to document their understanding of the material presented.\n\n?\tEmergency Planning and Response: \nCCF has established a written emergency response program to help safely respond to accidental releases of hazardous substances. A formal review process to solicit and obtain employees input on millwide procedures exists to improve site emergency response plans. Employees and participants in both safety incidents and drills conduct critiques to get comments and observations,"
