All applicable procedures of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Prevention Program are adhered to.  \n\nThe Goldschmidt Chemical Corporation Hopewell plant has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in safety and environmental protection, employee safety training and safety in the design installation, operation and maintenance of plant equipment.  GCC has implemented reasonable controls to prevent and mitigate probable releases of highly hazardous chemicals.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF STATIONARY SOURCES AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\nGoldschmidt Chemical Corporation\u00bfs Hopewell plant is specialty chemicals production facility located at 914 E. Randolph Road in Hopewell, Virginia.  The plant is situated on approximately 40 acres on the east side of Hopewell in the industrial section of the city.  \n\nOrganic surfactants and esters have been manufactured at the GCC Hopewell site since 1982, with an organo-modified silicones production facility added in 1991.  The Hopewell Polyether Plant (HPE-1) produces specialty polyethers begins operation in 2004.  The plant employs approximately 125 employees at the Randolph Road site and is operated 24 hours a day, seven days a week.\n\nGoldschmidt Chemical Corporation produces organic surfactants, organo-modified silicones and polyethers at the Hopewell, Virginia facility.  As defined by the regulations, the Hopewell facility stores the following Highly Hazardous Chemicals (HHC\u00bfs) in excess of the threshold quantities: \n\u00bf Ethylene Oxide (CAS # 75-21-8), Maximum storage capacity = 174,488 pounds\n\u00bf Propylene Oxide (CAS # 75-56-9), Maximum storage capacity = 177,399 pounds\n\u00bf Allyl Alcohol (CAS # 107-18-6), Maximum stor"

      "SummaryText": "age capacity = 83,704 pounds  \n\nThe HHC\u00bfs are utilized in the HPE-1 production facility to produce specialty polyethers that are used primarily as a raw material in the production of organo-modified silicones.\n\n\nWORST-CASE SCENARIO AND ALTERNATE RELEASE SCENARIO\nThe Risk Management Program (RMP) rule requires the development of accidental release scenarios and off-site consequence analysis for the toxic chemicals at our site.\n\nA worst-case scenario and alternate release scenario are designed to evaluate the potential impact to the surrounding community.  EPA defines the worst-case scenario as the complete release of the largest inventory of a chemical over ten minutes under weather conditions that would allow the chemical to travel the farthest distance at ground level.  It assumes that none of the facility\u00bfs controls or safety systems is functional.  A worst-case scenario is a highly unlikely event.  \n\nThe worst-case toxic release for the Hopewell plant would be the catastrophic failure of the ethylene oxide storage tank.  Assuming all safety systems fail in the worst possible weather conditions, and a total release of the entire contents of 174,488 pounds  in 10 minutes using EPA mandated criteria, the off-site impact is predicted to be up to 8.7 miles as calculated by the EPA\u00bfs RMP*Comp\u00bf  model.\n\nHowever this scenario is highly unlikely to occur as the tank is equipped with pressure relief devices to prevent over pressurization and subsequent rupture.  Additionally the tank is an above-ground mounded tank that protects it from fire exposure and mechanical damage.  The tank level, temperature and pressure are continuously monitored.  Additionally the tank and piping undergoes routine mechanical integrity inspections.\n\nFurthermore, this scenario is unlikely to impact up to 8.7 miles as the plant and emergency response personnel would utilize water deluge systems to minimize the release of ethylene oxide.\n\nGiven the severe guidelines of a worst case scenario, a more"

      "SummaryText": "realistic alternate or planning scenario was developed to more closely resemble a real world event.  This scenario involves smaller releases and allows safety systems to be included in the release containment and dispersion calculations.  These alternate release scenarios are useful to local government and industry to prepare emergency response plans.\n\nAlternate release scenarios are those which are more likely to occur than the worst-case scenario.  Alternate release scenarios are those that lead to concentrations above the EPA specified endpoint and which extend past the facility\u00bfs fence line. GCC has utilized EPA\u00bfs default modeling parameters and assumed releases at ground level.  All alternate release modeling utilized EPA\u00bfs RMP*Comp\u00bf model, which yielded a toxic endpoint of less than 0.1 miles for all scenarios modeled.  Local area gas detection and intervention by plant personnel are considered as active mitigation measures.\n\n-Ethylene Oxide: The alternate release scenario involves a release due to a gasket leak on a 2\u00bf unloading line.  The calculated release rate is 10 pounds per minute requiring twenty minutes to abate.\n-Propylene Oxide: The alternate release scenario involves a release due to a gasket leak on a 2\u00bf unloading line.  The calculated release rate is 10 pounds per minute requiring twenty minutes to abate.\n-Allyl Alcohol: The alternate release scenario involves a release due to a on a 2\u00bf unloading line.  The calculated release rate is 10 pounds per minute requiring twenty minutes to abate.\n\nRELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\nThe general GCC accidental release prevention program is based on the following key elements:\n\u00bf High level of training of the operators\n\u00bf Mechanical integrity program\n\u00bf Use of state-of-the-art process and control equipment\n\u00bf Use of accurate and effective operating procedures\n\u00bf Performance of a thorough hazard review\n\u00bf Compliance with the OSHA Process Safety Management Program\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nThis facility is a new facilit"
