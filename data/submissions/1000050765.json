The facility produces fresh and frozen seafood products, using anhydrous ammonia in a closed system as a refrigerant in freezers and chillers. Ammonia is the safest refrigerant available and has excellent warning properties; it is extremely pungent at levels far below dangerous concentrations. \n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\nIcicle Seafoods - Wood River has implemented a prevention program to comply with the requirements of the Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (29 CFR 1910.119), which is designed to prevent accidental releases of all chemicals held in quantities over given thresholds. The PSM program addresses all required elements including employee participation, process safety information and system drawings, operating procedures, hot work permits, management of change, mechanical integrity, training, pre-startup review, compliance audits, process hazard analysis, contractor safety, incident investigation and emergency response. The system has many safety features built in including high and low level controls and alarms, high pressure shut downs, pressure relief valves, automatic and manually controlled valves, check valves, and leak detectors.\n\n\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nPer the requirements of 40 CFR 68.42, facilities must include a five-year accident history for all accidental releases from covered processes that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage onsite, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage. There have been no such incidents at the facility in the past five years.\n\n\n\nEmergenc"

The plan identifies personnel designated and trained to assist in evacuation, make required notifications, and conduct the necessary actions to help ensure employee and community safety during an emergency. The facility has coordinated its Emergency Action Plan with local responders and conducts drills periodically to practice required actions.\n\n"
