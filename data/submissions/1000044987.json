This state of the art system is operated 24/7 by experienced, licensed refrigeration management and operators. \n\n\n\nOver one half of the plant is protected by an automatic sprinkler system where flammables and combusible materials are either used or stored.  The balance of the facility is of concrete and metal construction. Triumph Foods' fire protection system includes pull stations, smoke & heat detection, and sprinkler flow alarms. All are monitored by a remote off site alarm company 24/7 as well as the on site security personnel.
