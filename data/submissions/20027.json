The same properties that make this chemical valuable for making drinking water safe also make it necessary to observe specific safety precautions.  These safety precautions are exercised in the operation and maintenance of our chlorination system to control human and environmental exposure in an effort to reduce the overall threat to our workers as well as the surrounding communities.  \n\nIt is Coastal Water Authority's policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state and local rules and regulations.  However, the safe handling of hazardous chemicals is paramount at CWA and we often exceed standards and recommended practices governing the safe handling of hazardous chemicals to ensure that we have obtained a reasonable level of risk reduction\n\nWe believe that accountability for safety reaches throughout all levels of management at CWA.  Senior management's commitment and dedication to continued safe-operating practices is clearly evident in our organization structure and employee empowerment. \n\n\n\nFacility Description and regulated substances handled\n\nThe Red Bluff plant site covers approximately 4 acres within the Pasadena City limits.  It is located at 120 North Red Bluff, Pasadena, Texas in Harris County. Our facility treats approximately 3,000,000 gallons of water per day.\n\nThere is a maximum of six (6) full-time employees at the plant site at any one time. \n\nWe presently handle only one chemical, which is considered hazardous by the EPA.

Other more likely chlorine incidents were assessed at CWA, using parameters prescribed in the RMP regulation.  The analysis of the alternate scenarios could include mitigation affects from both passive and active safety systems.  \n\nCWA conducted an iterative assessment of several alternate or more likely scenarios.  From the various scenarios assessed, CWA selected the following as a representative example of an alternative scenario:\n\nX Inadvertent mishandling of a chlorine shipping container during delivery results in complete separation of the container's valve.  This failure assumes that 251 pounds per minute of chlorine is released.  Dispersion of the chlorine gas could result in the formation of a vapor cloud extending 0.27 miles (1,426 feet) from the plant.\n\n\nAccidental release program & chemical-specific prevention steps\n\nCoastal Water Authority contracted with an outside engineering firm to assist in the development of a prevention program tailored exclusively to water treatment operations.  This prevention program was designed around mechanical integrity and training aspects.  The primary objective being to ensure complete containment of chlorine through safe operation and maintenance of the chlorination system.  \n\nAlthough newly developed, the prevention program has been designed with the following objectives:\nX Enhancement of the mechanical integrity of all chlorine equipment and piping,\nX Compilation of safety information to improve hazard awareness, and\nX Training to increase hazard recognition\n\n\nFive year accident history\n\nCWA has a very comprehensive Incident Reporting and Investigation procedural process.  This process is defined and explained by CWA-008.  Basically, an incident occurs when a deviation from expected performance is experienced.  \n\nFormal investigations are"

It is received into the plant in one ton containers.  These containers are standard DOT and Chlorine Institute specified containers.  Deliveries of chlorine are received at the plant every three (3) months.  The plant has a maximum inventory of 8,000 pounds of chlorine onsite, however, only one container (2,000 pounds) is being used at any one time.  \n\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis (worst-case & alternate-cases)\n\nThe RMP rule requirements for identification and selection of a worst-case hazard scenario are prescriptive.  These requirements negate most safety systems designed to mitigate an incidental release that would typically be used in the event that an incident occurred.  Based on EPA defined Offsite Consequence Analysis (OCA) Guidance, CWA has one worst-case hazard scenario for the toxic material handled onsite. This scenario is estimated to create the greatest distance in any direction to an EPA defined concentration (endpoint) resulting from an accidental release.\n\nOur worst-case toxic scenario involves chlorine.  Chlorine is used as a water treatment chemical at the plant.  It is stored under its own vapor pressure in standard one ton containers located under a protective open-sided shed. The scenario uses the EPA's theoretical assumption that a container may catastrophically fail and release chlorine to the atmosphere.  It completely negates any mitigation attempts and assumes that all 2,000 pounds of chlorine can be dispersed within 10 minutes to form a toxic vapor cloud that drifts offsite into the surrounding community.\n\nUsing the EPA's Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance Document, dated October 1998, to determine the greatest downwind distance, it was determined that a chlorine vapor cloud may extend 1.30 miles from the plant.
