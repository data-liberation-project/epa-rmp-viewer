Some of the specific activities in the prevention program include: Process Safety Information is accessible at all times.  A hazards review was conducted as part of preparations for RMP compliance.  Written operating procedures are used for training and guiding the work of operators.  Training is provided to all employees that operate the system.

Some of the specific activities in the prevention program include: Process Safety Information is accessible at all times.  A hazards review was conducted as part of preparations for RMP compliance.  Written operating procedures are used for training and guiding the work of operators.  Training is provided to all employees that operate the system.  A program is in place to maintain the system and equipment.  Incidents are investigated and actions are taken as a part of continuous improvement efforts.  Routine audits are conducted to assure safe practices are being followed.
