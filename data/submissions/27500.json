This process is regulated by the EPA's Risk Management Program rule because the quantity of propane is in excess of the 10,000 pound threshold quantity listed for propane in that EPA regulation.\n\nThe Newark facility receives propane in bulk form, stores it in a tanks, and then transfills it into cylinders for distribution to customers by truck.  \n\nWelco-CGI is required to report one Worst Case Scenario and one Alternate Case Scenario for its propane storage process.  The Worst Case Scenario for flammable susbstances is defined by the EPA as the release of the entire contents of the largest vessel in the process, with essentially none of the safety systems and devices that are in place to prevent such an occurrence functioning as designed.  The released gas is assumed to ignite, causing a vapor cloud explosion.  Given these conditions, we are then required to estimate the distance to an EPA-specified flammable endpoint, which is defined to be an overpressurization effect of 1 pound per square inch.  At the Newark facility, the Worst Case Scenario for propane would involve the propane storage tank, which contains 76,500 pounds.  Using the criteria listed above, the Worst Case Scenario would result in a maximum impact distance of about 0.34 miles to the EPA-specified endpoint.  To determine this distance, we used the EPA's \"RMP*Comp\" software.\n\nWhile an Alternative Release may never occur at a facility, it is generally accepted to be more likely, or more credible, than the Worst Case Scenario, and can be used by the facility and local response organizations to plan community emergency response activities.  The RMP rule assumes more typical atmospheric and weather conditions for an Alternative Release Scenario, and allows a facility to take credit for safety devices and other mitigation systems that are in place to minimize the likelih"

When selecting an Alternative Release Scenario, EPA suggests a facility consider scenarios such as transfer hose releases, valve and flange leaks, pump seal leaks, and shipping container mishaps, among others.\n\nFor the Newark facility, a credible release would be a piping failure resulting in a propane gas release at grade.  An accidental release of this type may occur due to mechanical failure, corrosion, failure of a piping component (such as a joint or valve), impact by a vehicle, or other cause.  A release of this type could result in the released gas igniting, causing a vapor cloud explosion.  The distance to the EPA-specified endpoint of 1 pound per square inch overpressure is about 0.05 miles, or about 265 feet.  To determine this distance, we used the EPA's \"RMP*Comp\" software.\n\nIn accordance with OSHA's Process Safety Management standard and EPA's Risk Management Program rule, the Newark facility has a comprehensive accident prevention program in place to ensure the safety of our employees, our neighbors and the community around us.  On a local level, this prevention program is built around process safety concepts such as:\n\n? Documented process safety information to ensure the process design is understood and maintained throughout its life;\n? Process hazard analysis to identify and control all of the hazards associated with handling flammable substances;\n? Trained operators, using written operating procedures, to safely operate the process as intended; and\n? Maintenance programs and procedures to ensure the on-going mechanical integrity of the process.\n\nThe prevention program is audited periodically, by our corporate assessment group, to ensure that the process safety concepts and practices are in place and working effectively.\n\nAs a result of our process safety and risk management practices, the Newark facility has not had an accident involving any of the regulated substances in the last five years.
