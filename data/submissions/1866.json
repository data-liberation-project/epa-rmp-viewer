We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public as well as protection of the environment.  This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including:\n\n *  A description of our facility and use of substances regulated by EPA's RMP regulation\n *  A summary of results from our assessment of the potential off site consequences from accidental chemical releases\n *  An overview of our accidental release prevention programs\n *  A  accident history for accidental releases of chemicals regulated by EPA's RMP rule\n *  An overview of our emergency response program\n *  An overview of planned improvements at the facility to help prevent accidental chemical releases from occurring and adversely affecting our \n     employees, the public, and the environment\n *  The certifications that EPA's RMP rule requires us to provide\n *  The detailed information (called data elements) about our risk management program\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nOur facility produces polyurethane foam seals for doors, windows and gaskets for use in the electronic industries using a variety of chemicals and processing operations.

The following are brief summaries of these scenarios, including information about the key administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the exposure distances for each scenario:\n\nWorst-case Release Scenario(s) - Regulated Toxic Chemicals, Toluene Diisocyanate (TDI)\n\nA sudden and unexpected loss of the entire contents of the chemical bulk storage tank could conceivable result in a release of up to 45,000 lbs. of TDI. The TDI chemcial bulk storage tank is located inside of our manufacturing building in a separatly ventilated and diked area. The secondary containment system consists of a double \nlined dike that is capable of containing all of the contents of the chemical bulk storage tank. To prevent a signifcant release of TDI into the air that could potentially affect anyone off-site of our property, the chemical bulk storage tank room can be isolated and all ventilation turned off. In addition there is a sophisticated chemical monitoring \nsystem to alarm in the event of even a trace amount of TDI were to be released. There are no off-site or public receptors that would be impacted by a worst case release scenario of TDI as a result of the systems in place to capture and mitigate the affects of a TDI release.\n\n   \n\nAlternative Release Scenario(s) - Regulated Toxic Chemicals, Toluene Diisocyanate (TDI)\n\nA sudden and unexpected release of TDI from the discharge pipe on the TDI chemical bulk storage tank could result in up to 100 gallons of TDI to be released. The discharge pipe is located off the top of the TDI chemical bulk storage tank but still within the secondary containment system of the chemical bulk storage tank.\nAll of the TDI would be contained with"

Our management systems address each of the key features of successful prevention programs including:\n\n *  Process safety information\n *  Process hazard analysis\n *  Chemical unloading procedures\n *  Training and emergency response team training\n *  Mechanical integrity\n *  Management of change\n *  Chemical Safety\n *  Compliance audits\n *  Incident investigation\n *  Employee participation\n *  Hot work permit program\n *  Contractors\n\nAs part of our prevention efforts, we have implemented the following chemical specific prevention steps:\n\n    * All mechanical and electrical systems are checked prior to the delivery and unloading of bulk chemicals.\n    * A minimum of 2 properly trained Schlegel Employees plus the bulk tank delivery driver are utilized when unloading bulk chemicals.\n    * All personnel communicate directly using hand held communication devices.\n    * The inventory of the chemical bulk storage tank is checked both mechanically and electronically to prevent overfilling of the storage tank\n    * The chemical unloading area is diked in the event of spill or release.\n    * The chemical unloading connections are labeled, color coded and sized to only fit the hose for unloading of toluene diisocyanate.\n    * An unloading checklist form is required to be completed reach time a delivery of bulk chemicals is received.\n    "

Schlegel Systems, Inc. and our employees are committed to the standard that these management systems set for the way we do business, and we have specific accountabilities and controls to ensure that we are meeting our own high standards for accident prevention.   \n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nWe keep records for all significant accidental chemical releases that occur at our facility.  The following is a brief summary of accidental chemical releases involving materials covered under EPA's RMP rule during the past five years:\n\n    *We have not had any significant releases of toluene diisocyanate (TDI) during the last 5 years\n\nIf an incident were to occur we would conduct a formal incident investigation to identify and correct the root cause(s) of the event.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nWe maintain an integrated contingency plan, which consolidates all of the various federal, state, and local regulatory requirements for emergency response planning.  Our program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.  Furthermore, we coordinate our plan with the Henrietta Fire Department.   \n\nWe have an in-house emergency response team consisting of approximately 40 employees who have recieved specific training on how to respond to chemcial spills. This training has included scenario is on releases of toluene diisocyanate in a variety of conditions. \n\n    * 7 complete Scott Air pack SCBA Units and 19 spare air cylinders\n    * A completely stocked and mobile spill response cart\n    * All team members meet monthly to review haz. mat team issues\n    * All team members are required to train and practice at least quarterly with the Scott Air Pack\n    * Schlegel Systems, Inc.
