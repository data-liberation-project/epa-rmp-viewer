Many technical papers and presentations came from this work.  We continue to investigate process incidents using this technique so that we can gain all the information from each incident that we can, in order to prevent future incidents and to add to the body of information about each process.\n\u0015 Employee participation - Employees participate in all aspects of the prevention program.  Since 1978, Rohm and Haas Texas would not perform a HAZOP unless hourly employees were present.  Operators help write operating instructions and perform much of the training for new employees.  Operators and mechanics are expected to attend MOC reviews.\n\u0015 Hot work permit - Rohm and Haas has had a very effective Hot Work permit system for over 25 years.  \n\u0015 Contractors - Contractors are picked according to stringent standards of management, competence, and safety.  Contractors are expected to adhere to the same standards of safety that our own employees do.\n\nAs part of our prevention efforts, we have implemented the following chemical-specific prevention steps:\n\nHydrogen Cyanide: Where possible, HCN lines are all-welded construction, and all welds are 100% X-rayed.  Where flanges are required, we use 300# flanges and spiral-wound gaskets for maximum integrity, and flanges are inspected on a regular basis.  Pumps for 100% HCN are of two types; in one system, the pumps are inside the tank, and leaks outside the process are impossible.  In the other system, a magnetic drive pump having no seals is used, and leaks are, again, impossible.  HCN detectors are mounted at strategic locations throughout the unit, and provide an excellent warning system."

This scenario results in overpressure that would barely affect Tidal road, and would affect no other offsite receptors, not even industrial neighbors.\n\nPropylene\nThe alternative case scenario for propylene is a leak in the line that lasts 5 minutes, or until mitigation (blocking in isolation valves, beginning to apply water spray to disperse the cloud) can be applied.  This could result in a vapor cloud explosion that would cause an overpressure that can affect Tidal Road and the closest parts of the two closest plants.  It would not affect the general public in Deer Park.\n\nWe are using this information to help us ensure that our emergency response plan and the community emergency response plan address all reasonable contingency cases.

These HAZOPs were used to define the scenarios used in this report. The accident scenarios found in HAZOPs form the basis of additional analyses which allow us to ensure that the integrity levels of all protective systems are high enough to protect both our employees and our neighbors.   They also help us target the most important equipment for more frequent inspection.  \n\u0015 Operating procedures - Operating procedures include windows for safe operations and guides for trouble shooting which allow operators to keep the processes out of unsafe areas.  Operators are involved in writing, reviewing, and updating operating procedures.\n\u0015 Training - Training is based on the operating instructions.  Operators help determine the frequency of refresher training.\n\u0015 Mechanical integrity - We have a comprehensive inspection and preventive maintenance system that ensures that equipment maintains its capability to contain the process chemicals.  This system is being continuously improved.\n\u0015 Management of change - Rohm and Haas Texas was a pioneer in the management of change and has a comprehensive, well-institutionalized MOC system.  Employees at all levels are involved in the operation of the MOC system.\n\u0015 Pre-startup review - The Pre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR) is integral to ensuring that any new or modified process is build as intended.

      "SummaryText": "There are evacuation procedures at each HCN unit which are tested and drilled.\n\nAmmonia:  There is a new, all-welded stainless steel ammonia line from the metering station to the unit.  (Carbon steel is considered adequate for ammonia service, but we opted for the more costly choice to eliminate future concerns about external corrosion.)  There are two tanks capable of storing ammonia, but only one is in service at any time.  This allows maintenance to be performed at leisure on the tank that is out of service.  The tanks are made from carbon steel and both are stress-relieved.  There are excess-flow check valves in the tank outlets and in the line from the tank to the north end of the plant.  These valves will slam shut on flow increases such as might be encountered upon line rupture or significant leaks.\n\nAcetylene:  All large lines containing acetylene are packed with small-diameter tubing to prevent detonations.  Pressure in acetylene systems is carefully controlled to prevent operating in the area in which ignition would cause a detonation.  Acetylene lines operate at no more than 22 psig, which is far below the pressure capability of the heavy pipe used.  The pipe can contain a detonation.  Where acetylene lines can be near vehicles, the lines are 12-inch XX heavy construction.  This line can and has withstood vehicle impact with no damage at all.\n\nPropylene:  The propylene lines are welded carbon steel; one is buried, the other is above ground.  The buried pipe is coated and wrapped and is cathodically protected.  As a matter of interest, if this line leaks, the leak will be dissipated by its travel through the ground.  Unfortunately, we do not know how to model this, and the EPA lookup tables certainly cannot take this into account.  The design pressure of the propylene lines is 1440 psig, while it operates at about 250-300 psig most of the time.  The extra capability gives us an inherently safer means of being prepared for pressure surges, but there are a"

There are remotely-operated isolation valves in the line to allow isolation of a segment that happens to leak.  There are vehicle barricades to protect above-ground parts of the line.  There is no tank, so the only inventory is in the lines themselves.  The vaporizer system is surrounded by propylene detectors.\n\nNote:  All lines and vessels have inspection programs tailored to the hazards.\n\nThese individual elements of our prevention program work together to prevent accidental chemical releases.  Our company and our employees are committed to the standard that these management systems set for the way we do business, and we have specific accountabilities and controls to ensure that we are meeting our own high standards for accident prevention.\n\nFive-Year Accident History\nWe keep records for all significant accidental chemical releases that occur at our facility.  The following is a brief summary of accidental chemical releases involving materials covered under EPA's RMP rule during the past five years:\nAmmonia - There have been no releases of ammonia that met the criteria for the Five-Year Accident History.\nHydrocyanic Acid - There have been no releases of HCN that met the criteria for the Five-Year Accident History.\nAcetylene - There have been no releases of Acetylene that met the criteria for the Five-Year Accident History.\nPropylene - There have been no releases of propylene that met the criteria for the Five-Year Accident History.\n\nEmergency Response Program\nWe maintain an integrated contingency plan, which consolidates all of the various federal, state, and local regulatory requirements for emergency response planning.  Our program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.  Our responders are trained in fire fighting at Texas A&M University fire school, and also in Hazardous Material response tec"

It is also used in various neutralization processes around the plant.\n\nHydrogen Cyanide\nHCN is produced by the catalytic reaction of ammonia, natural gas and air over a platinum gauze.  It is stored as a refrigerated liquid in two separate, non-connected, widely-separated stainless steel tanks.  Inventory is limited by policy to 3500 pounds in each tank. HCN is used as an intermediate in the production of methacrylic acid and its esters, methyl methacrylate and butyl methacrylate.  \n\nFlammables\n\nAcetylene\nAcetylene gas is made by the partial oxidation of natural gas with pure oxygen.  It is stored as a gas under 2 psig in a dry gas holder.  The holder contains 18,900 pounds of acetylene.  Acetylene is sold to a single customer.\n\nPropylene\nLiquid propylene is received into the plant via pipeline, and there is no storage tank.  There are two long, interconnected pipelines from the metering station to the process units, and each of the lines can contain 6,000 pounds.  Propylene is used to produce acrylic acid via  partial oxidation presence of a catalyst.\n\nOur accidental release prevention programs and our contingency planning efforts help us effectively manage the hazards that are posed to our employees, the public, and the environment by our use of these chemicals.\n\nKey Offsite Consequence Analysis Scenarios\nPA's RMP rule requires that we provide information about the worst-case release scenario(s) and alternative release scenario(s) for our facility.  The following are brief summaries of these scenarios, including information about the key administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the exposure distances for each scenario:\n\nWorst-case Release Scenario(s) \u0017 Regulated Toxic Chemicals\n\nAmmonia\n\nThe inventory of the tank is limited to 50% of capacity by automatic level controls and the operating procedures.

This will produce a cloud that can reach into the city of Deer Park, and could impact the North Campus of the Deer Park High School, San Jacinto Elementary School, Tidal Road, and the San Jacinto Battleground State Park in addition to surrounding plants in our area.\n\nHydrogen Cyanide\nThe inventory if HCN is limited by procedures and controls.  The worst case for HCN is the release of the inventory of one tank into the diked area that surrounds each tank.  This will produce a cloud that will not impact public receptors other than neighboring industrial plants and Tidal road.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario(s) \u0017 Regulated Toxic Chemicals\n\nAmmonia\nThe Alternative case for ammonia is a line leak.  This will produce a cloud that will not reach into the city of Deer Park, and could impact only Tidal Road and the San Jacinto Battleground State Park in addition to surrounding plants in our area.\n\nHydrogen Cyanide\nThe Alternative case for HCN is a line leak.  This will produce a cloud that will not impact public receptors other than neighboring industrial plants and Tidal road.\n\nWorst-case Release Scenario(s) \u0017 Regulated Flammable Chemicals\n\nAcetylene\nThe Worst case release scenario for acetylene is a rupture of the product holder that would release the entire inventory of acetylene in 10 minutes, which then ignites.  This scenario results in a overpressure that would affect Tidal road, but would affect no other offsite receptors, not even industrial neighbors.\n\nPropylene\nThe worst case scenario for propylene is a rupture of the line such that the entire contents of both lines is emptied in 10 minutes, followed by ignition.  This could result in a vapor cloud explosion that would cause an overpressure that would affect Tidal Road and the closest parts of the two closest plants.  It would not affect the general public in Deer Park.\n{For each scenario that you have selected for reporting, provide a brie"
