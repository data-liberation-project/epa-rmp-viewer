However, facility personnel are not trained to be first responders to large fires, and should a release occur from one of the vessels, the Sarsen Plant would rely on the local fire department and Butler County HAZMAT to respond.\nEmployees receive training in the procedures to be followed when certain employees must remain to operate critical process operations before they evacuate.  The Sarsen Gas Plant has around the clock communication capability with appropriate emergency response organization (e.g., Fire Department). This interface provides the means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.  \nThe overall emergency response program for the Sarsen Gas Plant is coordinated with the Butler County Emergency Management Agency.  This coordination includes periodic meetings of the committee, which includes local emergency response officials and local government officials.  The Sarsen Gas Plant has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., Fire Department).  This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.

The following types of safety features are used in the covered process:\n\nRelease Detection\n1) Hand-held hydrocarbon detectors operated by facility personnel.\n2) Fire and gas detection systems interlocked with plant process controls and ESD system.\n3) Facility wide ESD system with process interlocks and strategic location of emergency pull stations.\n\nRelease Containment/Control\n1) Valves to permit isolation of the process (manual and automated).\n2) Automated shutdown systems for specific process parameters (e.g., high temperature)\n3) Curbing or dykes to contain liquid releases.\n4) Redundant equipment and instrumentation (e.g., uninterruptible power supply for process control system).\n\nRelease Mitigation\n1) Fire extinguishing systems for specific equipment.\n2) Trained emergency response personnel will be utilized.\n3) Personal protective equipment (e.g., chemical protective clothing).\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nIn the last five years, the Sarsen Gas Plant has had no reportable accidental releases from covered processes that resulted in death, injury or significant property damage on site, or known off site death, injury, evacuation, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\n\nThe Sarsen Gas Plant is a Non-Responding Facility as per 48 CFR 68.90(b).

Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors: perform their work in a safe manner; have the appropriate knowledge and skills; are aware of the hazards in their workplace; understand what they should do in event of an emergency; understand and follow site safety rules; and inform facility personnel of the hazards that they find during their work. This is accomplished by providing contractors with: a process overview; information about potential fire, explosion, or toxic release hazards; emergency response plan requirements; and safe work practices prior to their beginning work. In addition, the Sarsen Gas Plant will only select contractors who submit certification that employees are trained in specifics and safe work practices associated with their job, and that provide safety performance documentation from the previous three years. Finally, facility personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\nCHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe processes at the Sarsen Gas Plant have hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation.

The investigation team consists of the immediate supervisor, one person knowledgeable in the process, and other members with appropriate experience to investigate and analyze the incident. The team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to facility management for resolution. Corrective actions that are identified will be promptly addressed, resolved and tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with facility employees (including contractors) whose job tasks are relevant to the investigation. Incident investigation reports are retained for at least five years so that the reports can be reviewed during PHAs and PHA revalidations.\n\nEMPLOYEE PARTICIPATION\n\nMPLX encourages employees to participate in the facets of process safety management and accident prevention. Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a PHA team. Employees will be provided with the information created as part of the facility accident prevention program. Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the facility. Company employees are encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.\n\nHOT WORK PERMIT\n\nMPLX uses a hot work permit for hot work operations including grinding, welding, and spark producing activities conducted on or near a covered process.

Ultimately, these reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating, and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nCOMPLIANCE AUDITS\n\nTo help ensure compliance with the RMP, MPLX periodically conducts audits to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented. Compliance audits are conducted at least every three years. Team membership will include at least one person knowledgeable of the system being audited. One member of the team must be qualified to lead the audit and be familiar with the auditing protocol being administered. The Plant will maintain a listing of non-conformances identified during an audit and document closure of compliance audit action items. The two most recent audit reports will remain on file with the documentation of closed items.\n\nINCIDENT INVESTIGATION\n\nMPLX promptly investigates incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury. The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts, determine what error states l"

Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels). If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service (if possible), or a management of change team will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment. \n\nAnother integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance. The Sarsen Gas Plant incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs. This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.\n\nMANAGEMENT OF CHANGE\n\nMPLX has a comprehensive system to manage changes to the covered processes. This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented. Changes are reviewed to ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage new hazards and to verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change. Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures, are updated to incorporate these changes. In addition, process operators, maintenance personnel, or any other employees whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and are trained on the specifics of the modification.\n\nPRE-STARTUP SAFETY REVIEWS (PSSRS)\n\nMPLX conducts a PSSR for a new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information.

The procedures are kept current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process. The operating procedures are centrally located and accessible to employees.\n\nTRAINING\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the Sarsen Gas Plant has implemented a comprehensive training program for the employees involved in operating a process. New employees receive basic training in facility operations unless they provide written certification that they have the required knowledge, skills and abilities to safely carry out their specific duties and responsibilities. MarkWest employees at the Sarsen Gas Plant will be trained in PSM/RMP requirements upon hire as part of their qualification to work in PSM/RMP processes. Operations employees will undergo refresher training at least every three years. A training attendance record will be kept for training activities and a verification of understanding will be conducted by a performance evaluation or through testing.\n\nMECHANICAL INTEGRITY\n\nMPLX has well-established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition. The basic aspects of this program include: training; written procedures; inspections and tests; correcting identified deficiencies; and applying quality assurance measures. In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process.\n\nMaintenance personnel receive training on an overview of the process, safety and health hazards, applicable maintenance procedures, emergency response plans, and applicable safe work practices to help ensure that they can perform their jobs in a safe manner.

Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team. This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned that highest risk receive immediate attention. Approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed. The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the facility periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results. These periodic reviews are conducted at least every five years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operative. The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained. Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\n\nOPERATING PROCEDURES\n\nMPLX maintains written procedures that address various modes of operations, such as: unit startup; normal operations; temporary operations; emergency shutdown; normal shutdown; emergency operations, startup after a turn around, and initial startup of a new process.

For the process, the facility has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) in key process parameter documents. The facility ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\n\nThe facility also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment. This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment. This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\nPROCESS HAZARD ANALYSIS (PHA)\n\nMPLX has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the process are identified and controlled. Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nMPLX will use one or more of the following techniques to identify hazards: what-if, checklist, what-if/checklist, hazard and operability (HAZOP), failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA), or fault tree analysis (FTA). HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques and will be utilized for each major process change or renovation.

The worst case and alternative case radii to endpoint were determined utilizing RMP*Comp software provided by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). In evaluating the worst-case and alternative-case scenarios, there were no administrative controls or mitigation measures taken into account to reduce potential off-site impact. Populations within each radius were determined using the Missouri Census Data Center and Google Earth mapping.  Several vessels within the facility process were evaluated for their release scenarios. Results of the worst-case release scenarios indicate that the process is subject to RMP Program Level 3 requirements. Details of the worst-case release scenarios and alternate release scenario are included with the backup documentation associated with this RMP Plan.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place for the process at the facility. This summary addresses each of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) process safety management (PSM) elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program since the process at the facility that is regulated by the EPA's RMP regulation is also subject to the OSHA's PSM standard.\n\nPROCESS SAFETY INFORMATION\n\nMPLX keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.

      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY \u2013 SARSEN GAS PLANT\n\nMarkWest Liberty Bluestone L.L.C. (MarkWest), owner and operator of the Sarsen Gas Plant and a subsidiary of MPLX, L.P., has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, facility trained personnel will respond to contain the release and local LEPC and firefighters will be alerted to extinguish fires and contact the local population as necessary.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe Sarsen Gas Plant processes raw gas from the field gathering system. The unprocessed gas is brought into the plant via the inlet slug catcher which separates the condensate and free water from the natural gas stream. The gas is then compressed, combined with field compressed gas, and dehydrated. After this process, the gas enters a cryogenic process where it is cooled and the heavy natural gas liquids (NGLs) are removed. The remaining natural gas is sent to a sales line off site via pipeline. The NGLs, also known as Y-Grade, are also sent off site via pipeline for further processing. The products at the Sarsen Gas Plant contain methane, ethane, propane, butanes, pentanes, and heavier hydrocarbon components. The regulated flammable substances include the same methane through pentane components. This facility does not handle regulated toxic substances above their threshold quantities, and there are no toxic release scenarios to consider.\n\nWORST-CASE AND ALTERNATIVE CASE RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nThe parameters of the offsite consequence analyses for this MarkWest facility were based on the\nrequirements set forth in the Risk Management Program (RMP) rules outlined in 40 CFR 68.25 (e"
