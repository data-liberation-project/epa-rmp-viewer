Each of the following sections provides a general overview of the requirements and defines the design attributes, documentation, and actions that are established to comply with those requirements.  In most instances, John Soules Foods - Valley has already developed measures and systems that provide compliance with 40 CFR Part 68 rules as a result of other regulatory programs and requirements.  This document does not replicate that information but rather provides cross-references to the applicable existing documentation.  In those instances where information was developed specifically to comply with the Part 68 requirements, that information is contained in this document.\r\n\r\n\r\n1.1.\t Corporate Commitment to Safety\r\n \r\nJohn Soules Foods - Valley is committed in providing to all employees a work environment that is free from recognized health and safety hazards.  Accordingly, our goal is achieving and sustaining  safety through communication, information, and training.  To this end, we are dedicated to the concept that all employees receive the proper orientation and are provided with the means necessary to ensure the environment remains as safe and healthful as possible.\r\n \r\n1.1.1.\t It is the policy of John Soules Foods - Valley to:\r\n \r\n1.1.1.1\tProvide safe working conditions, proper tools, and personal protective equipment.\r\n \r\n1.1.1.2\t Comply with all federal, state, and local occupational health, safety, and environmental laws and regulations.\r\n \r\n1.1.1.3\tProvide and sustain a high level of commitment to ensure all employees have a safe and healthy work environment in which to"
