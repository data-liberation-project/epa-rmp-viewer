Each of the following sections provides a general overview of the requirements and defines the design attributes, documentation, and actions that are established to comply with those requirements.  In most instances, John Soules Foods - Valley has already developed measures and systems that provide compliance with 40 CFR Part 68 rules as a result of other regulatory programs and requirements.  This document does not replicate that information but rather provides cross-references to the applicable existing documentation.  In those instances where information was developed specifically to comply with the Part 68 requirements, that information is contained in this document.\n\n\n\n\n\n1.1.     Corporate Commitment to Safety\n\n \n\nJohn Soules Foods - Valley is committed in providing to all employees a work environment that is free from recognized health and safety hazards.  Accordingly, our goal is achieving and sustaining  safety through communication, information, and training.  To this end, we are dedicated to the concept that all employees receive the proper orientation and are provided with the means necessary to ensure the environment remains as safe and healthful as possible.\n\n \n\n1.1.1.     It is the policy of John Soules Foods - Valley to:\n\n \n\n1.1.1.1    Provide safe working conditions, proper tools, and personal protective equipment.\n\n \n\n1.1.1.2     Comply with all federal, state, and local occupational health, safety, and environmental laws and regulations.\n\n \n\n1.1.1.3    Provide and sustain a high level of commitment to ensure all employees have a safe and healthy work environment in which to"

Encourage all employees to \"Think Safety\", so that safety habits developed and practiced at work carry through to non-work related activities.\n\n \n\n1.1.3.    John Soules Foods - Valley's aim is to provide a professional service as efficiently as possible while minimizing the use of toxic materials wherever and whenever prudent.  In this effort, our highest priority will be the proactive pursuit of cost-effective process changes that reduce or eliminate the use and/or generation of hazardous toxics at the endpoint of service.  Where hazardous toxics cannot be eliminated, improving controls to handle these substances will be explored and implemented wherever possible.\n\n \n\n1.1.4.    John Soules Foods - Valley has prepared a facility safety policy and procedures program specifically tailored for the facility. In addition, a Process Safety Management Program has also been established and implemented regarding the ammonia refrigeration system process.  It is the responsibility of the designated facility personnel to carry out these programs.\n\n \n\n1.1.5.    The first duty of John Soules Foods - Valley employees is to exercise care in the performance of his/her work tasks to prevent an accident to him/herself, co-workers, the general public or equipment.

The facility employees approximately 200 personnel.  The facility uses Anhydrous Ammonia in the \"Refrigeration System\".\n\n\n\n Accidental release program & chemical-specific prevention steps\n\n1.2.1.    The substance regulated under the Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions (40 CFR 68) that is located on site, in various locations and quantities is anhydrous ammonia.\n\n \n\n1.2.2.    Anhydrous ammonia is utilized on site for the \"Refrigeration System.\" Approximately 51,900 pounds of ammonia is used as a refrigerant in the facility's system.  The ammonia is contained in various vessels, piping, condensers and evaporators used throughout the ammonia refrigeration system.  \n\n \n\n1.3.    Worst Case Release Scenario\n\n \n\n1.3.1.    Considering that a \"catastrophic\" possibility does exist; the facility modeled two off site consequence analyses; a worst case and alternate case scenario.\n\n \n\n1.3.2.    For both scenarios, EPA's RMP Comp was used to determine the facility Off-Site Consequence Analysis.  The distances to the toxic endpoints for both releases, and the potential impacts are discussed in Section 3.0. Releases are represented on the maps in Appendix B of this document.\n\n \n\n1.4.    Emergency Response Program\n\n \n\n1.4.1.    John Soules Foods - Valley is equipped with an emergency information system.  Evacuation plans are placed throughout the facility to inform personnel in an emergency relating to the accidental release of ammonia, or other emergencies that may be encountered.  There are specific procedures that all employees must follow in the event of release; which can be found in the John Soules Foods - Valley Emergency Action Plan.  These procedures include evacuation of personnel, notification of authorities and actions to be taken to stop, or mitigate the emergency if it is safe to do so.\n\n \n\n1.4.2.    Plant personnel hav"

Under EPA's 40 CFR 68.15, the Facility is required to assign a qualified person with overall responsibility for the development, implementation, and documentation of a system to manage the Risk Management program elements.  \n\n \n\n2.2.    When responsibility for implementing individual requirements of this RM plan is assigned to persons other than the overall qualified person, the names and positions of those personnel are documented and the lines of authority defined through the John Soules Foods - Valley PSM/RM Management System, (refer to Appendix A). \n\n \n\n2.3.

Alternative Release Scenario\n\n \n\n3.2.2.1    The alternative release scenario for the anhydrous ammonia system involves the rupture of the shaft seal on one of the seven compressors. This scenario resulted in a release of approximately 500 pounds of ammonia over a period of fifteen minutes. The release from the suspect compressor that is located in the ammonia room would be dispersed into the atmosphere via the relief header vent located on the facility roof above the ammonia room.\n\n \n\nThe distance to the toxic endpoint of the alternate scenario is 250 yards.  The affected area for the alternative release scenario is shown in Appendix B. Within the affected area, according to MARPLOT described above, there are no hospitals, prisons, recreation areas, national or state parks, forests, or monuments; officially designated wildlife sanctuaries, preserves, or refuges; or federal wilderness areas.

The process system used at John Soules Foods - Valley is an enclosed loop mechanical process system that utilizes anhydrous ammonia as a heat exchange media in the freezing and cooling of the refrigerated food products.  There are no chemical reactions involving ammonia that occur. The principle involved is the ability of a refrigerant, in this case ammonia, to absorb heat as it changes state from a liquid to a gas, and to give up that heat as it changes back to a liquid.  The change in pressure levels required to accomplish this is supplied by the compressors.  The heat is absorbed in the cooling evaporators of various designs, and removed from the system by the condensers.  Mo"
