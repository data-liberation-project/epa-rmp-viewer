      "SummaryText": "The U.S. Environmental Protection AgencyA?s (EPA) Clean Air Act (CAA Amendments of 1990 included provisions that require facilities that use certain substances to develop a plan to reduce the likelihood of and accidental release of the substances to the atmosphere and reduce the likelihood of serious harm to the public and the environment. The plan must also include mitigation measures to reduce the potential impact on the public in the unlikely event of a release. The requirements of this plan, commonly referred to as a Risk Management Plan (RMP), are detailed and codified in 40 Code of Regulations (CFR) Part 68.\n\nThe Fort Collins Water Treatment Facility (FCWTF) supplies water to the City of Fort Collins, Colorado. Chlorine is used at the FCWTF primarily to disinfect drinking water prior to distribution and is a regulated toxic substance under the RMP regulations (40 CFR Part 68).  The FCWTF takes safety very seriously and has not had a reportable incident related to chlorine since June 1994. The FCWTF has voluntarily installed a chlorine scrubber to neutralize the chlorine in the event of a chlorine leak. If a leak occurs, it should not pose a threat to the outside environment or the surrounding community.\n\n\nThe RMP consists of three major elements; the Hazard Review, Prevention Program and Emergency Response. A Hazard Assessment has been performed to determine the effects of a release of the regulated substance on the public and is not included in this Executive Summary for security reasons. The prevention program is designed to improve the system security and decrease the likelihood of a release. The emergency response program has been developed to deal with a release in the unlikely event that one would occur.\n\nThe Prevention Program, together with the Emergency Response Program and Hazard Review, comprises the RMP. Details of the Prevention Program are outlined below:\n\n1.    Safety Information: All of the required process safety information was compiled as requi"

Hazard Review:  A process hazard analysis (PHA) was conducted to evaluate potential causes and consequences of accidental releases.  This information was used by FCWTF staff to improve safety and reduce the consequences of accidental releases.  Equipment, instrumentation, utilities, human actions and external factors that might affect the process were the focus of the PHA. \n\nThe chlorine PHA was conducted by an interdisciplinary team of FCWTF facility staff familiar with the process, operation and maintenance and facility management along with FCWTF consultant CH2M Hill.  The PHA was performed using a combination of A?What IfA? and A?ChecklistA? methods.  Based on the results of the PHA, changes in operating, maintenance and other process safety management procedures that improve the overall safety of the FCWTF were identified.  These changes have all been addressed and are being implemented.\n\n3.    Operating Procedures:  Operating procedures for the chlorination process were developed prior to the RMP.  The operating procedures include start-up, shutdown, and emergency operating procedures.  The procedures also emphasize safety considerations during operation and address hazardous situations that can occur and corrective actions necessary.\n\n4.    Training:  FCWTF staff has received initial training on the safety information and operations and maintenance of the chlorine system.  In addition to the initial training, select FCWTF staff are trained in accidental release and emergency response procedures. To obtain state licensure as a water treatment plant operator, it is required that FCWTF operators pass chlorine-related process and safety examinations.\n\n5.    Maintenance:  The FCWTF maintenance staff use a computerized maintenance management system (Maintenance Data Interface; MDI) to store equipment information, generate and prioritize work orders, schedule preventative"

In addition to preventative maintenance, the FCWTF staff performs corrective maintenance in the event of equipment malfunction or breakdown. Work orders indicate what safety precautions must be followed including the need for lockout/tagout and confined space entry provisions.\n\n6.    Compliance Audit:  An internal compliance audit has been conducted at the FCWTF at least once every three years beginning June 21, 1999, for the chlorine process.  A team that includes at least one person knowledgeable in the covered process and an audit leader knowledgeable in RMP requirements and audit techniques conducted the audits.  The Water Production Manager (WPM) and the audit team promptly determine and document the appropriate corrective action for each deficiency identified during the audit and specify the dates by which corrective actions must be taken.\n\n7.    Incident Investigation:  A process to identify the underlying causes of incidents and implement procedures for preventing similar events has been developed.  To investigate an incident, an investigation team will be established.  As part of the investigation, an incident report will be prepared to recommend system changes.  On the incident report form, the WPM will identify which recommended system changes are approved for implementation.  The incident report and any system changes resulting from the report will be reviewed with all staff members who operate and maintain the applicable system.\n\nEmergency Response Program:  The Emergency Planning and Response Plan provides specific emergency response procedures for accidental releases of chlorine and other chemicals not included in this RMP.  The emergency response procedures cover a release from the initial alarm stage through either leak stoppage or hazardous material (HAZMAT) assistance.  The emergency response procedures include plans for leak investigation and"
