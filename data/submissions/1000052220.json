Nestle takes many precautions to prevent or minimize accidental releases of ammonia.  These precautions include safety controls (alarms and automatic shutdown devices) which are designed to identify and prevent potentially unsafe conditions like pressure increases that could cause a system failure, a preventive maintenance program designed to maintain the on-going integrity of the system, a training program designed to ensure that the system is operated by qualified personnel, and emergency response procedures which enable trained personnel to respond quickly to system upsets.\n\n\n\nThe Industrial Services Manager is responsible for the management of the ammonia safety program.\n\n\n\n\n\nB.   Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nNestle operates a cold storage warehouse in Gaffney.  The facility uses ammonia in its refrigeration system as a heat transfer medium to provide cooling and freezing capabilities.  Ammonia is the only regulated substance handled at the facility.\n\n\n\n\n\nC.   Description of the Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\n\n\nThe facility has a program level 3 accident release prevention program for the ammonia system that complies with OSHA's Process Safety Management Standard and EPA's Risk Management Program Regulation.  The ammonia prevention program consists of the following elements:\n\n\n\no Employee Participation Program\n\no Process Safety Information\n\no Process Hazard Analysis\n\no Operating Procedures\n\no Training Program\n\no Contractor Safety Program\n\no Pre-Startup Safety Review Procedures\n\no Mechanical Integrity Program\n\no Hot Work Permit Procedures\n\no Management of Change Procedures\n\no Accident Investigation Procedures\n\no Compliance Audit Procedures\n\n\n\n\n\nD.   Five-Year Accident History\n\n\n\nThere have not been any ammonia-related incidents at the cold storage warehouse during the previous five year"
