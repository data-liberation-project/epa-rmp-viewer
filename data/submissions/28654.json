      "SummaryText": "A. Chain of Rocks Water Treatment Plant\nThe Water Division is a branch of the City of St. Louis Department of Public Utilities.  We have proudly invested in and served the greater St. Louis Metropolitan area since 1835.  The Water Division's Chain of Rocks Water Treatment Plant has been providing safe, clean drinking water to city customers since 1894.  The plant is located on the Mississippi River near the Chain of Rocks Bridge in the City of St. Louis, Missouri.\n\nB. Chlorine\nAt the Chain of Rocks Water Treatment Plant, we have used chlorine as a part of the treatment process that provides our community with safe drinking water for more than 80 years.  Chlorine is the most widely used disinfectant.  It has been safely used to disinfect drinking water for nearly 100 years.  Water supply disinfection has virtually eliminated incidences of waterborn diseases such as cholera, typhoid, and dysentery and is credited with increasing American's life expectancies by more than 50 percent.\n\nChlorine is a greenish-yellow gas with a pungent, irritating odor similar to bleach and is toxic in certain concentrations.  Chlorine exists as a gas at ambient temperature and pressure, but comes to us under pressure in a liquid state.  It is converted to gas in our process equipment.  We receive chlorine in DOT-approved one-ton containers transported by truck.  The containers are unloaded from the truck and stored securely within a dedicated facility fully protected by a scrubber system.\n\nC. Environmental, Health and Safety Policy\nWe have long understood the hazards of handling chlorine, which, if not handled properly, can pose a risk to the community.  It is the Water Division's policy to conduct our business in accordance with all applicable environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations and to promote a healthful, safe, and protected environment.  The chlorine process at the Chain of Rocks Plant is regulated by the U.S. EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) Rule.  The Chain of Roc"

Risk Management Plan\nWe recognize there are risks associated with handling and using chlorine.  We have been, and will continue, working very hard to minimize these risks.  Our Risk Management Plan is the latest step in our continuing efforts to improve the safety of our plant.  The Water Division has conducted hazard reviews and has implemented an accidental release prevention program which integrates technologies, procedures and management practices.  Additionally, the Chain of Rocks Plant has trained employees for emergency response and maintains an Emergenency Response Plan which has been supplied to the St. Louis City Fire Department.  These programs enable the Chain of Rocks Plant to prevent the occurence, and minimize the consequences of hazardous releases of chlorine.\n\nE. Offsite Consequence Analysis\nUnder the RMP rule, the Chain of Rocks Water Plant is required to conduct and document an offsite consequence analysis, which includes consideration of two chlorine release scenarios, identified as a \"worst-case release scenario\" and an \"alternative release scenario\".  The first scenario is defined by EPA as the \"maximum quantity in the largest vessel...released as a gas over 10 minutes\" during worst-case weather conditions (no wind, low humidity), due to an unspecified failure.  This worst-case scenario assumes that all safety systems fail and that there is no emergency respose.  The alternative release scenario is a different, more realistic scenario, which depicts a failure defined by the facility.  In the alternative release scenario, facilities are allowed to include active mitigation systems in calculating the distance that an accidental release of this type could pose as a hazard to the public or the environment.\n\nThe offsite consequence analysis is done by 1) det"

To determine the distance over which releases could pose a hazard to the public or the environment, the EPA has established endpoint exposure concentrations.  The endpoint for chlorine is based on the American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA) Emergency Reponse Planning Guideline (ERPG)-2.  This value represents the \"maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects of symptoms which could impair an individual's ability to take protective action\".  The chlorine toxic endpoint used in offsite consequence analysis is 3 parts per million (0.0087 milligrams/liter).  The population potentially effected is defined as the population within a circle that has as its center point of release, and its radius equals that distance to the endpoint. The offsite consequence analysis for the Chain of Rocks Water Treatment Plant was conducted using EPA's RMP*Comp v.1.07 atmospheric modeling software.\n\nWorst Case Release Scenario\nFor the Chain of Rocks Water Treatment Plant, the worst-case release would be the instantaneous failure of a one-ton cylinder wall causing a total release of the contents of a cylinder in 10 minutes under worst-case weather conditions.  This scenario also assumes a complete failure of all safety controls and no emergency response.  This would result in the release of 2,000 pounds of chlorine.\n\nThe hypothetical worst-case scenario is intended to define the full potential for offsite impacts from an accidental chemical release.  Defining that potential is valuable, however, the worst-case scenario is extremely unlikely to occur, and therefore is presented only due to the regulatory requirement.  It is unlikely to occur bec"

This plume area, or footprint, is approximately one-twentieth of the area of the circle.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario\nRMP regulations require that a scenario which is a more realistic scenario than the worst-case release be selected as the alternative release.  The scenario selected involves the failure of the 1/2 inch whip that transfers chlorine from the one ton cylinder to the water chlorination system.  In this scenario, the amount of chlorine released is 2,000 pounds at an average rate over 30 minutes (the duration of the release) of 66.7 lb/min.  Active mitigation systems considered are the actuation of a chlorine detector and execution of emergency response procedures, and employment of an automatic neutralization system.\n\nF.
