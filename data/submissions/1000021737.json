Maintenance staff shall conduct routine preventative maintenance of key process components.\n. Employees shall conduct all work according to any applicable Lockout/Tag-out procedures.\n. The City of Huntsville shall maintain routine inspection schedule.\n. Employees shall be trained on the operation and maintenance of all the chlorine facilities.\n. Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for all chlorine operations and maintenance shall be adhered to.\n. Only those persons trained in chlorine safety shall be present during any work that could produce a release.\n\n\nThe City of Huntsville's emergency response program uses the Huntsville Fire Department Hazardous Materials Response Team. It focuses on keeping employees away from dangerous areas, while the Fire Department responds to and controls the chemical release. When an employee observes a release, he/she shall leave the problem area, proceed to a staging area and take a roll call., notify on the emergency responders, and leave the area.\n\nWe are currently rewriting the safety manual for t"
