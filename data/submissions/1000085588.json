      "SummaryText": "Gebbers' MAF Plant processes, stores and ships apples and cherries in the County of Okanogan, State of Washington.  This first-time submission is due to the increase of toxic substance above the threshold of 10,000 lbs. The substance used in the refrigeration process is anhydrous ammonia.  In order to increase the tonnage of cherries processed per day, the addition of one Hydrocooler was required.  To facilitate this change anhydrous ammonia also had to be increased to meet the refrigeration needs.  The facility consists of 5 Common Storage Zones and 4 Hydrocoolers.\n\n\n\nIt is the policy of Gebbers' MAF Plant Management to operate in compliance with all applicable federal and state rules and regulations.  Inspections show the design and construction of the facility was in accordance with published standards, tests or recommended methods of trade, industry and governmental agencies.\n\n\n\nThe safety of our employees, neighbors and the environment are very important to management.  While the design of the facility incorporates a multitude of safety devices, Standard Operating Procedures combined with appropriate training of our personnel are key aspects to maintaining safety at this facility.  Some safety devices utilized are:\n\n    Suction trap hi-level floats\n\n    High discharge pressure shut down\n\n    Low suction pressure shut down\n\n    High discharge temperature shut down\n\n    Oil pressure failure shut down\n\n    250 psi relief valves on high pressure side (to prevent overpressure situations)\n\n    150 psi relief valves on low pressure side (to prevent overpressure situations)\n\n    High amperes shut down\n\n    Automatic timer to prevent short cycling\n\n    Oil filters plugged shut down\n\n\n\nWe have a written Process Safety Management (PSM) plan that complies with the regulations stipulated by WAC 296-67-017, including an Emergency Action Plan, developed in compliance with the Emergency Response provisions of WAC 296-62-3112.  The Emergency Action Plan includes pre-emergency p"

      "SummaryText": "lanning and coordination with local emergency responders.  It is the policy of Gebbers' MAF Plant not to respond to large releases of ammonia.  Therefore, employees are trained on evacuation procedures at least once every year.  The responding fire or hazmat team will take control of the situation upon their arrival.  Other preventative steps are found in our Process Hazard Assessment, Hazard Analysis, Pre-startup Safety Review, Mechanical Integrity, Management of Change, Hot Work Permits and Compliance Audits.\n\n\n\nAccess to the facility is restricted to authorized employees, management personnel and contractors.  All visitors and contractors are required to sign in and wear a guest badge while on premises.  Contractors are required to provide evidence of experience and training in ammonia safety before working around the refrigeration system.  This training uses guidelines developed by the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) and the Refrigeration Engineers Technology Association (RETA).  Only qualified maintenance personnel operate and interact with the refrigeration system.  This minimizes the chances of inadvertent error in operating that could lead to a release of ammonia.\n\n\n\nThere has been no significant release of ammonia at this facility in the past five years.\n\n\n\nAll system components were designed with specifications approved by ANSI/IIAR.  All pressure vessels were built according to the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME), ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code.  Any upgrades or extensive maintenance work performed in the future will be in compliance with those standards applicable at the time "
