This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, our facility is completely coordinated with the Oklahoma City Fire Department which provides emergency response expertise.\n\n\n\nThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nPresently Anhydrous Ammonia is the only RMP regulated substance present at this facility above a threshold quantity.  Ammonia is utilized as the primary cooling media in our closed-loop refrigeration system. The system's purpose is to provide refrigeration and cold storage capabilities for American Prepared Foods' operations.  Due to the  and characteristics of our ammonia refrigeration systems, as well as Process Safety Management (PSM) applicability, American Prepared Foods is covered under Program 3 of the RMP regulations.\n\n\n\n- Offsite Consequence Analysis \n\n\n\nThe Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario have been completed as stated in Sections 2 and 3 of the RMP*eSubmit document.\n\n\n\nTo evaluate both the worst case, and alternative release off site consequence analysis, EPA's RMP Comp Hazardous Release software was utilized exclusively. As specified in the RMP Guidance, the worst case and alternate case release scenarios have been calculated and the results of the calculations are documented in the American Prepared Foods' RMP Plan on file at the facility.

      "SummaryText": "nmental receptors that could possibly be affected by the release scenarios were determined through the use of data from the 2010 US Census Bureau in CAPS, Circular Area Profiling System and Microsoft Streets mapping system software.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Accidental Release Prevention Program \n\n\n\nAmerican Prepared Foods has taken all necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set forth in 40 CFR Part 68.  To meet these necessary requirements American Prepared Foods has implemented their Process Safety Management program through the written guidelines stated in the OSHA PSM Standard, 29 CFR 1910.119. \n\n\n\n\n\nFive-year Accident History\n\n\n\nAmerican Prepared Foods has an excellent record of preventing accidental releases at our facility over the last 5 years.  This facility is expected to continue this exemplary record.  \n\n\n\nEmergency Response Plan\n\n\n\nAmerican Prepared Foods has a written emergency action plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials.  The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas. \n\n\n\nOklahoma County LEPC is the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) with which our emergency plan has been coordinated and verified.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nAmerican Prepared Foods currently has no changes planned for the ammonia refrigeration processes at this time.   However, the processes will be subjected to periodic process hazard analysis reviews for the purpose of identifying potential hazards and implementing the necessary improvement to provide a safer system. American Prepared Foods personnel will also periodically review all potential opportunities to improve the safety of our personnel, the surrounding community, and the ammonia refrigeration processes."
