      "SummaryText": "The Percy D. Miller Water Treatment Plant is located in Warren County, Virginia and is operated by the City of Winchester's Department of Public Utilities.  As part of the operations at the facility, a chlorination system is used for disinfection purposes.  In accordance with federal regulations, the City has developed and implemented a Risk Management Program including accidental release prevention and emergency response procedures to address onsite and offsite safety issues associated with the use of chlorine at the plant.  In addition, the facility complies with OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) provisions.\n\nThe facility has not had an accidental release of chlorine that caused injuries, property damage, or environmental damage in the past five years.  Also, mitigation measures and procedures have been established by the City to minimize the potential for accidental chlorine releases and to minimize offsite impacts in the event of an accidental release of chlorine.  These measures include the presence of chlorine leak detectors and alarms, required operator training in chlorine safety, a preventive maintenance program for the chlorine system equipment and related components, and established emergency response procedures including coordination with the local fire department and notification of the public."
