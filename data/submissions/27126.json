Ammonia vapor, High Stage Suction (HSS), from the Horizontal Recirculator (V-2) is routed to the suction inlet of four High Stage Compressors (HS-1 through HS-3).  \n\nAt the High Stage Compressors (HS-1 through HS-3), ammonia vapor (HSS) is compressed to a super heated vapor (HSD).  The super heated vapor (HSD) from the High Stage Compressors is routed from the engine room to the three Condensers (EC-1, EC-2A and EC-2B). At the Condensers the super heated vapor (HSD) rejects heat and converts to high pressure Condensed Liquid Drain (CD).  The condenser accomplishes this by using a combination of air and water flow across ammonia coils.  The condensers are equipped with Hydrostatic Safety Relief Valves which vent back into the system.  Airflow is supplied to the condensers via fans internal to the condenser and water is supplied via condenser water pumps.  \n\nWater from the condenser water sump is pumped via condenser water pumps to the Condensers (EC-1, EC2A and EC-2B).  At the Condensers the water is sprayed via a spray header over the ammonia coils.  Water is collected at the bottom of the Condenser in a sump pan where it gravity drains back to the condenser water sump.  From here it is recirculated back to the condensers.  As the water level of the condenser"

As HPL is needed in the system, HPL is fed by pressure differential from the High Pressure Receiver to the Auto Purger (AP-1), several evaporators and serves as liquid makeup to several vessels.\n\nHigh Pressure Liquid (HPL) is fed to the Auto Purger (AP-1).  Purged Gas (PUR) is piped from the purge point at the piece of equipment to the Auto Purger.  This system has fourteen purge points, the Condensers (EC-1, EC2A and EC-2B) and the High Pressure Receiver (V-1). Each purge point consists of a solenoid valve with shutoff valves on either side for isolation.  Any non-condensables in the Vapor Stream are removed periodically by the Auto Purger.  The Auto Purger separates the Purged Gas (PUR).  It separates ammonia from the non-condensables by condensing the ammonia into a liquid.  Any non-condensables are piped to a Water Bubbler to remove any traces of ammonia.

The map generated using LandView III (tm) displayed the following public receptors are within the radius: are commercial and industrial sites and a school that is School Number 5 (Historical).\n\n\nDESCRIPTION IF THE ALTERNATE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\nIn the alternate case scenario the High Temperature Pumped Recirculator V-2 is penetrated by a fork truck..  The E-Stop circuit is tripped.  This action shuts down the compressors and closes the King Solenoid Valve stopping t"

      "SummaryText": "he flow of ammonia through the refrigeration system.  The amount of ammonia that will be expelled, the calculated amount of this release is approximately 2,800 lbs.\n\nEPA's RMP*COMP (tm) calculated a release rate of 280 lbs. per minute with release duration of ten minutes.  The Atmospheric Stability Class is F and the wind speed is 1.5 meters per second.  The topography around the facility is urban.\n\nRMP*COMP (tm) calculated a toxic radius of 0.3 miles.  Using LandView III (tm) it was determined that approximately 62 people live within this radius.  The map generated using LandView III (tm) displayed the following public receptors are within the radius: are commercial and industrial sites.\n\nThe use of active mitigation devices include: Emergency shutdown systems and Ammonia Detectors, etc..\n\n\nSUMMARY OF THE FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nSouthern Ohio Holding has had no recordable accidents in the past five years involving ammonia.\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN\n\nAn Emergency Planning and Response Program has been established to allow for safe mitigation of any ammonia release.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nSouthern Ohio Holding is committed to continuous improvement of our policies, procedures, and facility. It is the intention of Southern Ohio Holding to remain an industry leader. New technology, training techniques, and equipment are continuously being added to our system. \n\nAmong the improvements slated for completion in 2002 and 2003 is an extensive operator training, additional operating procedures, additional emergency responder training."
