Our policy is to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws.  If an emergency were to occur, we would notify the George West Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency.\n\nFacility Description and Regulated Substances Handled\nThe Three Rivers Gas Plant is located in Live Oak County off of Airport Road near George West, Texas.  \nThe plant produces stabilized condensate, de-methanized/de-ethanized natural gas liquids (NGL), and residue gas.  The NGL and residue gas are transported off-site vma pipeline.  No NGL product tanks exist at the Three Rivers Gas Plant.  Produced stabilized condensate is stored in one of two fixed roof atmospheric storage tanks.  The liquids are stored onsite until loaded onto tank trucks and transported offsite.\n\nThe Three Rivers Gas Plant does not handle any regulated toxic substances.\n\nWorst-case Release Scenario\nThe main potential hazards at the Three Rivers Gas Plant are those from fires and explosions.  These hazards are associated with any facility that handles large volumes of flammable hydrocarbons.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario is defined as a release of the largest quantity of a regulated substance from a vessel or process piping failure that results in the greatest distance to an endpoint.  The worst-case release scenario assumes that none of the many safety systems and process controls are operational.  The distance for the worst-case release scenario presented in the RMP has been calculated using the method described in EPA's Off-site Consequence Analysis Guidance.\n\nThe worst-case flammable release scenario is from the Product Surge Tank V-1103.  The Product Surge Tank handles flammable mixture of light hydrocarbons, principally ethane, butane, and pentane.  The worst-case release scenario is an aboveground vessel or piping failure.  Approximately, 40,574 pounds of "

This release scenario does have an off-site impact; however, no public receptors are impacted.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program\nThis facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule and all applicable state and local codes and regulations.\n\nFive-Year Accident History\nAs a result of the facility's commitment to safety, no accidents as defined by the RMP rule, have occurred in the last five years.\n\nEmergency Response Program\nTo be prepared for potential accidents, facility personnel communicate and work closely with local community responders.\n\nThe Three Rivers Gas Plant maintains a written emergency response plan.  This plan consolidated the multiple emergency response and contingency plans required by various federal and state regulations.  This consolidation ensures rapid and appropriate response to quickly control any incident, and to minimize the consequences of any release.  The emergency response plan addresses pre-emergency planning and establishes personnel lines of authority, training, and communications.  The emergency response plan also documents the procedures for informing the public and local responders about accidental releases and the procedures for review and updates of the plan.  The provisions of the emergency response plan will be carried out immediately if a fire, explosion, or any unplanned or sudden release of a hazardous substance to air, soil, or surface water occurs at the Three Rivers Gas Plant.\n\nThe local fire department (George West) has copies of this plan. These responders and facility personnel perform regular drills.  Emergency response training is conducted for all employees.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety.\nNone."
