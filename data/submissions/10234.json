Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at Great Plains Co-op in Idalia are strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental\nsafety.  This commitment is an inherent part of our comprehensive accidental release prevention\nprogram that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and\nemployee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement\nappropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  If such a release does\noccur, our trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of\nthe release.  We also coordinate our response efforts with the Idalia Fire Department, which provides\nadditional emergency response expertise.\n\n  2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities include support services for crop production.  We have anhydrous\nammonia stored in 18,000- and 26,000-gallon interconnected tanks at our facility in Idalia (Figure\n1, ammonia).  The maximum amount stored is 37,400 gallons (192,460 pounds) at the maximum fill\ncapacity of 85%.\n\nWe also have propane stored in two 11,800-gallon tanks located at our facility in Idalia (Figure 1,\npropane).  The maximum amount stored is 20,060 gallons (84,713 pounds) at the maximum fill\ncapacity of 85%.\n\n  3. Worst Case Release and Alternative Release Scenarios\nWe utilized RMP PRO for the worst case and alternate case scenarios of the required offsite\nconsequence analysis for our ammonia and propane facility.  The following details these scenarios.\n\n            3.1     Ammonia\n\nThe worst case release scenario involves a catastrophic release of the entire contents of the\ninterconnected an"

At Class F atmospheric stability, 1.5 m/s wind speed, and urban topography, the\nmaximum distance to a toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L is 6 miles (Figure 2).  The estimated population\nwithin a 6-mile radius of this facility is 2,000.\n\nThe alternative release scenario involves a release from an anhydrous ammonia product line.  The\nscenario involves the release of 8,378.07 pounds of ammonia in a gaseous form over a period of 30\nminutes.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.14\nmg/L of ammonia is 0.31 mile (Figure 3).  The estimated population within a 0.31-mile radius of the\nfacility is 1,000.\n\n            3.2     Propane\n\nThe worst case release scenario involves a catastrophic release of the entire contents of the\ninterconnected propane storage tanks (84,713 pounds) in gaseous form over a 10-minute period.  At\nClass F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s wind speed, the maximum distance to an endpoint of 1 psi\noverpressure is 0.35 miles (Figure 2).  This amount of overpressure can cause partial demolition of\nhouses and can result in serious injury to people within this distance.  The estimated population\nwithin a 0.35-mile radius of this facility is 1,000.\n\nThe alternative release scenario involves a 30-minute release of propane from a product line that\ncontacts an ignition source and detonates, resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  Under neutral\nweather conditions, the maximum distance to an endpoint of 1 psi overpressure is 0.13 mile (Figure\n3).  The estimated population within a 0.13-mile radius of this facility is 200.\n\n  4. General Accidental Release Prevention Program\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the EPA's accidental release prevention\nrequirements as set forth in 40 CFR part 68.  The following sections briefly describe the elements\nof the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary so"

Any findings from the hazard analysis are addressed in a\ntimely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\nGreat Plains Co-op maintains written operating procedures to ensure that activities within our\ncovered processes are conducted safely.  These procedures address various modes of operation; the\ninformation is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nTraining\nGreat Plains Co-op has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are\noperating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nGreat Plains Co-op conducts documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure\nproper operation.  Maintenance checks are conducted by qualified personnel with previous training\nin maintenance practices.  Examples of process equipment that would receive maintenance checks\ninclude:  pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency\nshutdown systems, controls, and pumps.
