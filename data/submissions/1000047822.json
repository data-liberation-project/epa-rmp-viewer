Mr. Mark Hickey, EHS Manager, is responsible for RMP implementation for this site.  \n\n\n\nThe Port Arthur Plant has developed an Integrated Contingency Plan to guide responses to various types of emergencies and events.  This ICP includes procedures for coordination with on- and off-site responders.  Jefferson County Local Emergency Planning Committee (409-835-8757) is the primary organization responsible for coordinating emergency response operations for this area.  The Port Arthur Plant is an active member of this organization and we are also a member of Sabine Neches Chiefs Association, a mutual assistance emergency response organization dedicated to providing fire protection and safety management resources to the petrochemical industry of Jefferson County.  In the event of a major release of any hazardous substance, or a fire, the Port Arthur Plant would coordinate emergency response with these groups as well as the appropriate governmental agencies as needed.  The plant has an internal plant wide alarm system for fires and emergencies.  In addition, the plant"

The plant also maintains a volunteer Emergency Response Team.      \n\n\n\nThis facility uses light hydrocarbon feedstocks purchased from refineries to make the following products: Cyclohexane, Ethylene, Propylene, 1,3-Butadiene and RPG.  This facility consists of three process units designed to make these products.  Greater than threshold quantities of regulated flammable mixtures are found in this plant, which includes: methane, hydrogen, ethylene, ethane, propylene, propane, butenes, butanes, 1,3-butadiene, pentenes, and pentanes.   \n\n\n\nThis facility includes (3) RMP covered processes, that we have identified as the Ethylene Unit (EU-1544), Cyclohexane Unit (CU-1741), and the Cumene Feed Prep Unit (CFPU-1740).  The (3) processes contain mixtures of flammable regulated substances in greater than threshold quantities and are classified as Prevention Program 3 facilities. \n\n\n\nVarious safety measures are in place to prevent the release of flammable chemicals.  Some examples of these measures include: (pressure relief valves, hydrocarbon area detectors, remote valves to isolate the process, administrative controls, operating procedures, Safety Instrumented Systems, etc,).\n\n\n\nThis facility is covered by OSHA Process Safety Management regulations and we are in substantial compliance with these PSM regulations.  This facility is also covered by numerous EPA and Texas Commission on Environmental Quality regulatory requirements designed to limit the impact on the environment and we are in substantial compliance with these regulations.  \n\n\n\nAccidents with On-Site Effects:\n\nThe plant had (1) accident with on-site effects in the last five years involving chemicals that are on the 40 CFR PART 68.130 List of Substances and meeting the RMP criteria for accidents.\n\n\n\nAccidents with Off-Site Effects:\n\nThe plant had (0) accidents with off-site effects in the last five years involv"

The plant manages all aspects of process safety through employee participation at all levels in the organization.  Each element of the PSM and RMP standards is assigned to a responsible organizational position to maintain the systems that ensure compliance with regulatory requirements and management of that aspect of process safety.  We have adopted a program of continuous improvement which can involve changes to plant design, operating procedures, or safety systems.  The facility continually uses the MOC / PSSR and PHA processes, to implement and evaluate changes to the equipment and chemical processes, and to determine if change will occur to the Alternative or Worst Case Release scenarios that have been previously identified.  The facility also uses extensive facility siting procedures / requirements, to continuously evaluate personnel safety and process hazards.  "
