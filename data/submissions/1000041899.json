For minor responses that are triggered by the process alarms or personal monitors, SMBSC staff will respond and correct.  For any significant release or catastrophe, SMBSC plans to evacuate all employees from the facility, notify the Renville Fire Department and County Sheriff, notify our chemical response contractor and notify area emergency managers as well as downwind sheriffs.

It is the policy of SMBSC to comply with all Federal, State and Local laws.\r\n\r\nFacility Description and Regulated Substance Handled\r\n\r\nThe SMBSC operates a beet sugar processing and refining facility in Renville, Renville County, Minnesota.  The facility's principal products are beet sugar, beet pulp pellets and molasses by-products.  The sugar beet refining process requires the use of sulfur dioxide to control pH and color.  SMBSC is phasing out the use of liquid SO2 and installed two sulfur stoves in 2012.  The stoves were brought on line in 2013 and integrated into the system.  A backup system using sodium bisulfite is being installed in 2014 and the SO2 storage tank has been emptied and purged.  The system is being maintained as a third backup to the process until the sulfur stoves and bisulfite systems are fully functional and proven.  The maximum amount of sulfur dioxide that could be stored on-site is estimated to be 146,000 pounds.  The sulfur dioxide is stored as a liquid and is vaporized via an evaporator for process usage.\r\n\r\nGeneral Accident Release Prevention Program\r\n\r\nThrough completion of this RMP, SMBSC has complied with the EPA requirements under 40 CFR 68.  Process safety information and operations/maintenance procedures are documented on site.  Periodic functions such as process hazard analysis, training, management of change and incident investigation are conducted on a regular basis.  Audits of the overall RMP will be conducted on a regular basis to assure compliance with EPA regulations.\r\n\r\nFive-Year Accident History\r\n\r\nSMBSC has not had a sulfur dioxide accident causing deaths, injuries, environmental or property damage, evacuations, or in-place sheltering in t"
