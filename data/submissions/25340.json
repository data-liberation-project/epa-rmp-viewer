(2) We will work to continually reduce workplace injuries; incidents with the potential for causing property damage, material loss, or interruption of our business; waste; and releases to the environment. (3)We will emphasize the importance of safe and environmentally responsible handling of  our products to our  transporters,  distributors, and customers.\n\nFacility Description:\nAt the Green Tree Aerosols Division site in Seaford DE, we fill aerosol cans with a variety of specialty products. Flammable propellants, including propane, butane and methyl ether (DME), are used to pressurize many of our product containers.  The propellants are stored in four tanks in the tank farm. Each tank is limited to 85 % full by administrative controls. The largest of the tanks has a 12,000-gallon capacity (10,200 considering administrative controls).  The remaining tanks range from 1,850 to 5,500 gallons nominal capacity.  Propellants are piped from the tank farm to a specially designed Gas House where the aerosol cans are pressurized. Subsequently, the cans are mechanically conveyed into the plant from the Gas House for testing, packing and shipment.\n\nWorst Case Scenario:\nThe worst case scenario for the plant is the release of the contents of the largest tank. Assuming that n-butane was stored in the tank, 49,500 pounds of flammable propellant would be released. This scenario will have an offsite impact, based on the use of the EPA RMP*Comp program. \n\nAlternative Case Scenario: \nThe alternative case scenario assumes that simultaneously the internal excess flow valve on one of the tanks within the tank farm malfunctions and the cover of the transfer pump develops a leak while o"

      "SummaryText": "perating.  We assume that the leak would be detected and controlled within 10 minutes. This scenario would result in the release of 900 pounds into the atmosphere and would have an offsite impact up to a distance of 0.08 miles (about 420 feet), based on the use of the EPA RMP*Comp program. \n\n\nAccident Prevention Program:\nThe use of flammable propellants in the plant has been subject the Delaware Extremely Hazardous Substance Risk Management Act (EHSRMA) and the OSHA Process Safety Management standard (29CFR 1910.119) since operations commenced in 1994.  The plant has an established risk management system in place to meet these requirements and to minimize the potential for accidental release of these substances. Our \nmanagement system includes:\n\nProcess hazard analysis to identify and address potential hazards.\nManagement of change procedures to assure that standards are maintained and potential new hazards assessed. \nMechanical integrity procedures for minimizing mechanical failures,\nDetailed operating procedures for process control \nTraining for the personnel involved in operating and maintaining the processes.\nFacility design incorporates multiple layers of incident prevention.\n\nFive Year Accident History:\nIn the past five years, the Seaford plant has not had any accidental releases of flammable substances that resulted in on-site injuries or damage or any off site impacts.\n\nEmergency Response Program:\nThe Green Tree Seaford plant has a written emergency response plan, which has been coordinated with the Sussex County Local Emergency Planning Committee (L.E.P.C.) and the Seaford Fire Department. Key plant employees are regularly trained on this plan."
