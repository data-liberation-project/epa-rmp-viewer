Attached please find a copy of the FedEx receipt noting arrival of the package at EPA, which was signed by R. Freeman at 8:59 AM on June 21, 1999.  On or about June 23, 1999, a representative of EPA contacted Lincoln Environmental, Inc. and stated that the RMP submission should have been sent to Arlington, VA, and that Region One would forward it.  They suggested a duplicate be sent.  A duplicate disk was sent on or about June 23rd.  The local LEPC was also given a printed copy of the electronic submission on or about June 23. \n\nChemArt is committed to an on-going chemical safety program with employee participation at every step of the process.  ChemArt has established a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) team to evaluate, develop, and implement a management system to control the hazards associated with chlorine.  The team is made up of ChemArt employees and outside contractors with knowledge and expertise in various areas of Process Safety Management (PSM).  ChemArt employees involved in the PHA Team include operators, supervisors, and managers that are effected by the usage, storage and handling of chlorine.  Personnel from the following groups and departments are included: Etching, Maintenance, Laboratory, Operations, Human Resources, Senior Process, and Plant Management.\n\nIn addition to ChemArt personnel, Mabbett & Associates, Inc. (M&A) was retained by ChemArt to participate in the PHA and to develop the written PSM Program.\n\nThe PSM Plan will be reviewed at least annually, when the process changes or the plan fails.\n\nIn addition to the PSM Plan ChemArt has implemented an employee Emergency Response Team trained in accordance to 29 CFR 1920.120 and equipped to respond to chlorine releases to Level A. ChemArt also maintains a chlorine cylinder repair kit with trained personnel.\n\n2.1\tDescription of Facility and Regula"

      "SummaryText": "ted Substances\n\nChemArt manufacturers etched decorative metal parts.  The manufacturing process involves automated etching equipment utilizing closed loop systems.\n\nThe primary hazard in this process is the release of chlorine.  There have been no releases of chlorine from this process that could be classified as catastrophic since the original installation.  The specific hazards of the process are described in the following paragraphs in terms of the chlorine flow from cylinder delivery to the regenerators on the etching tanks.\n\nFour one-ton cylinders of liquid chlorine are stored in a cutoff storage room that shares two walls with the rest of the building.  The cylinders are manifolded in pairs with one in each pair supplying chlorine to the system while the other cylinder is held in reserve.  The cylinders are set on cradles that are part of the weighing system.  There is a potential for chlorine release during the change-out of empty cylinders when pipes are disconnected, cylinders are hoisted from their cradles, full cylinders are transferred from the delivery truck with an overhead crane, and pipes are reconnected. The delivery driver and a trained ChemArt employee use the standard operating procedures to minimize the risk of a catastrophic release during cylinder change-out.\n\nThe chlorine cylinders are positioned so that chlorine is withdrawn only from the gaseous phase. The gas pressure in the cylinders and in the withdrawal lines is the vapor pressure of chlorine at the temperature of the liquid in the cylinder.  At 700F, the vapor pressure is approximately 85 psig.  The Chlorine Storage Room is not climate controlled, so that in the warm weather seasons with temperatures as high as 900F, the pressure could rise to about 125 psig.  In colder weather, the pressure would be less that 50 psig.  The cylinders have fusible plugs that release at 159 - 1650F to prevent tank rupture during a fire.  There are no sources of ignition or flammable materials in the Chlo"

Within this 0.9 of mile radius, there are approximately 75 single and multi-family dwellings within the Hazard Zone.   There are 45 manufacturing and commercial facilities, one apartment complex, a state airport, a mall, and a day care center.  \n\n2.3\tAlternate Release Scenario\n\nThe alternate scenario release was also calculated using RMP Comp,( assuming a supply line failure with a 540 pound release.  As calculated by RMP Comp, the hazard radius is 0.1 miles.  Within this radius there are five commercial /industrial facilities.\n\nEvacuation would be dependent on the wind direction and speed at the time of the release.  Lime Rock Fire district has plans in place for notification and evacuation of the effected population.\n\n2.4\tAccidental Release Prevention Program and Emergency Response Program\n\nAll employees involved in the handling and use of chlorine are capable of operating the process on a day-to-day basis.  Special training was provided on the emergency procedures described in the attached standard PSM for catastrophic releases of chlorine.  This included training and exercises in the use of Level A Protection, the selection and use of other types of personnel protective equipment and the use of the Chlorine Institute Emergency Kit.  Satisfactory completion of this training was recorded in the training documentation record.  The training record incorporates a certification that such covered employees have the knowledge, skills and abilities, based on classroom training and their hands-on experience, to carry out the daily duties and responsibilities specified in the operating procedures.\n\nWhen employees are newly assigned to tasks associated with the chlorine process, they will be trained by the operations manager or designee and by employees currently involved in the process.  At the completion of the training the employee will work for two weeks under the direct supervision"

      "SummaryText": "rine Storage Room; however, a fire in the rest of the building that engaged the room could cause the fusible plugs to release large quantities of liquid and gaseous chlorine.  The evaporation of chlorine in the cylinders reduces the temperature of the liquid and the vapor pressure. Immediately next to each set of chlorine cylinders is a Capital Controls pressure regulator that reduces the pressure to below atmospheric for transmission through two chlorinated polyvinyl chloride (CPVC) pipes through the Plating Room and into the Etching room.  The regenerators operate in such a way as to maintain the pressure in the CPVC supply lines below atmospheric.  The regulators in the Chlorine Storage Room are set below atmospheric and will not deliver gas to the transmission lines if the pressure in the CPVC lines exceeds the sub atmospheric set point.\n\nA chlorine sensor is positioned near the floor in the Chlorine Storage Room.  An alarm sounds in the Plating Room outside the Chlorine Storage Room if the chlorine concentration exceeds 2 ppm.  If the alarm sounds, properly trained maintenance personnel would don protective equipment including self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) to enter the room, shut off the main cylinder valves and open the large doors to the outside.  The irritating odor of chlorine is used for warning employees of releases in other parts of the facility.  The procedure is described in the attached standard operating procedure included in Appendix A.\n\nAn etching solution regenerator is attached to each etching tank.  The etching solution is circulated through educators and back to the etching tanks.  The venturi effect of flow of liquid through the educator causes a partial vacuum to form which draws chlorine from the CPVC supply lines.  Chlorine is automatically metered to the educators through valves actuated by a controller that responds to the oxidation-reduction potential in the etching solution.  The action of the educators serves to keep the CP"

      "SummaryText": "VC chlorine supply lines under negative pressure all the way back to the pressure regulator in the Chlorine Storage Room.\n\nFailure of engineering and administrative controls could result in the release of chlorine into the Chlorine Storage Room, the Maintenance Shop/Wastewater Treatment Area, the Etching Room, the Plating Room, and other parts of the plant.  A What-If PHA analysis was used to identify possible failures at various points in the process, the consequences of those failures and the controls and procedures that are in place to prevent failures.\n\nChlorine is not released into the air in the Etching Room under normal operating conditions.  Occasionally, there may be small releases that cause minor transient eye, nose or throat irritation.  As exposures rise toward 5.0 ppm, severe irritation could be anticipated which might require medical treatment.  Levels above 5.0 ppm of chlorine could cause permanent irreversible tissue damage and would be considered a catastrophic release.  It is anticipated that exposures above 5.0 ppm would be confined to the Chlorine Storage Room.  If a release occurred in the chlorine storage room in excess of 2ppm, the alarm would sound and the plant would be evacuated according to established standard operating procedures.  However, if a release were to occur in other areas of the plant, olfactory detection would prompt an evacuation of affected areas of the building before the concentration rose as high as 5.0 ppm.  Because chlorine is so intensely irritating, concentrations in the air well below 1 ppm are readily detectable.  Thus, only employees wearing appropriate personal protective equipment who enter the Chlorine Storage Room could potentially experience chlorine concentrations as high as 5.0 ppm.\n\n2.2\tWorst Case Release Scenario\n\nA worst-case release scenario was conducted on the total release of one 2,000-pound cylinder.  The analysis was performed using EPA's RMP Comp. As calculated by RMP Comp, the worst-case scenario"

      "SummaryText": "ork schedule.  A full work shift would consist of approximately 91 employees.\n\nThe main process building is one floor with cement block walls and steel bar joust and roof decking with a built up asphalt roof.  The office/assembly building consists of a one-story structure with a partial second floor above the administrative offices.\n\nBoth buildings contain approximately an equal amount of employees of about 45 to 50 employees. All buildings are equipped with active sprinkler system and fire alarms.\n\nThe process building contains storage areas for all hazardous chemicals including chlorine gas, acids, cyanides, and flammable liquids.  Chlorine storage is located on the eastern end of the process building and contains four (4) two thousand-pound cylinders of chlorine.  Other hazardous chemicals are stored in an interior room located mid point on the southern and of the process building. \n\nTravel Directions:\n\nTravel to ChemArt would be from Powder Hill Road to New England Way.  Powder Hill Road is the nearest cross street.  Responding fire and police units would be required to travel this route to reach the facility.  There is no other access road into the industrial park.  The nearest interstate is Interstate 295, which is approximately 0.8 of a mile from the facility.\n\nTravel for trucks carrying hazardous material will likely travel from Interstate 295 to RI 146 to Route 116 south to Powder Hill Road to New England Way.  \n\nMSDS Sheets\n\nMSDS sheets are maintained throughout the facility for access by any employee.  A master MSDS file is maintained by the Vice President of Operations.  \n\nExtremely Hazardous Substances\n\nChlorine is the only extremely hazardous substance above the threshold planning quantity.  Normal operation could have as much as four (4) two thousand-pound cylinders and as low as two (2) two thousand-pound cylinders.  Small quantities of acids, caustics, cyanides, and flammable liquids are on hand.  These quantities would not exceed 110 gallons.\n\n\n\n\nE"
