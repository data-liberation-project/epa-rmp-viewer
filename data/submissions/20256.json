Facility Policy.\n\n            The owners, management and employees of Kesley Ag Center are committed to the \n             prevention of any accidental releases of Anhydrous Ammonia.\n             If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire\n             department, or other authorities, to mitigate and minimize the impacts of the release to the \n             people and the enviroment.\n\n2.          Facility Information.\n             \n             The primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to \n              farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is recieved, stored and distributed for both direct\n              application and for blending into mixed-grade fertilizers for crop production nutrients\n\n              Annhydrous ammonia is stored at the facility in (1) 30,000 gallon and (1) 18,000\n              gallon storage tanks.  The maximum quantity stored of anhydrous ammonia is\n              213,589 pounds.\n\n3.           Worst-Case Scenario and Alternate Release Scenario.\n\n             \n              a.        The worst case scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage\n                          tank released as gas over a period of 10 minutes. The maximum quantity released\n                          would be 133,493 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank \n                          at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the end point\n                          (point of dispersion to 200 parts per million, or ppm) is 1.5 miles.\n\n\n              b.         The alternate release scenario, based on the five-year accident history (or the most\n                          likely potential incident), is a release from a break in a transfer hose.
