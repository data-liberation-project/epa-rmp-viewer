Brush believes that is it extremely important to provide their employees with the best available safety information and equipment.  Brush believes that well-trained and informed employees are the key to preventing or minimizing chemical accidents that may affect the community, and has several training programs in place for the safe handling of all chemicals and their facility, not just ammonia.\n\nBrush has several emergency response teams in place and ready to respond in the event of an emergency at the Delta facility.  These teams have specialized knowledge and training in order to safely and effectively respond to first aid, fire, chemical releases, and rope rescue incidents.  If an emergency were to occur, Brush emergency response teams would respond to the best of their abilities to control the situation.  If needed, Brush would request the assistance of the Delta fire Department or the Millard County LEPC, depending on the nature of the emergency.\n\nBrush's facility is a milling operation that uses ammonia in its production processes.  The facility uses one ammonia storage tank with a water capacity of 39,880 gallons.  Potential problem areas such as valves, hoses, connection points, etc. are visually inspected on a daily basis to ensure that the system is operating properly and there are no indications of potential equipment failure.\n\nBrush's facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule and all applicable state and local codes and regulations.  The ammonia system has been designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with state law.\n\nBrush h"
