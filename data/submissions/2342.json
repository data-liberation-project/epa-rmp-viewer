In the event of a release it is the policy of the Village to minimize the effect of the release to the general public by commiting the resources necessary to stop the discharge and evacuate the effected areas.\n\nThe Robert L. Pratt Water Plant uses chlorine gas in its operation.  The gas is stored in 2,000 pound steel canisters inside a room equipped with chlorine detectors.  When the detectors sense a chlorine release an active mitigation system consisting of a fan leading to an air scrubber removes the chlorine.  In addition, the chlorine delivery lines are under vacuum.  If a break in the line occurs the chlorine will not escape and the drop in pressure will cause the regulators on the chlorine cannisters to shut off eth flow.  This will also set off an alarm.\n\nThe worse case accidntal release scenario indicates that a catastrophic chlorine release will effect approximately 19,000 people within 1.3 miles of the facility.  The alternate case scenario would effect approximaely 270 people within 0.1 miles of the facility.  The Village of Palm Springs is included in the written emergency response plan for Palm Beach County.  Should a release occur the Village of Palm Springs Public Safety Department and the Palm Beach County Fire Rescue would be contacted.  Citizens within the effected are would be evacuated and the leak woul be stopped as quickly as possible.\n\nThe only chemical included in the Risk Management Plan is chlorine.  In an effort to minimize a release to the atmosphere, the chlorine is stored in a closed room equipped with leak detectors.  A positive response from the leak detectors activates a fan which would feed the atmosphere within the room through a scrubber.  In addition, the chlorine is delivered to the chlorine mixing room under vacuu"

Pratt Plant in the last five years.  On November 27, 1994 an employee was exposed to chlorine gas.  The gas escaped through a faulty diaphram inside the high pressure alarm box in the chlorine mixing room.  The employee was taken to the Palm Beach Regional Hospital for treatment.  The leak was mitgated by shutting off the chlorine at the canister and replacing the diaphragm.\n\nIn the eventof an emergency, the appropriate Village of Palm Spring personnel will be contacted to evaluate the situation.  These personnel will contact the appropriate emergency responder such as the police, chemical suppliers, fire departments or hazmat teams.  Areas that have the potential to become effected will be evacuated by the police and/or fire departments, the chemical suppliers and hazmat teams will mitigate the release."
