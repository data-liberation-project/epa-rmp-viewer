      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY OF RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN FOR NATCHEZ WATER TREATMENT PLANT\n\nI.  Introduction\n\nThe Natchez Water Treatment plant provides drinking water for the inhabitants and businesses located in the city of Natchez, MS.  The city of Natchez has a population of 19,460 people and a number of businesses, schools, industrial facilities, and recreational areas.\n\nII.  Regulated Substance and Covered Process\n\nIn order to comply with Federal and State regulations concerning water treatment, chlorine is used for the disinfection of drinking water.  There is up to 4,000 lbs. of chlorine in process at any given time, with potential storage of an additional 4,000 lbs., therefore, the Natchez Water Treatment Plant falls into Level II of the EPA's Risk Management Program Regulations.\n\nIII.  Emergency Response and Policies\n\nThe Natchez Water Treatment Plant is committed to reliably providing quality drinking water that conforms to all local, state, and federal water quality standards to the inhabitants of Natchez, MS with public safety as a top priority.  The Natchez Water Works has coordinated emergency response activities with the local fire department, police department, and civil defense organization among others.\n\nIV.  Worst Case and Alternative Scenarios\n\nAs required by the EPA's Risk Management Program regulations, the City of Natchez has calculated off-site consequences for accidental releases of chlorine.  The first analysis is the worst-case analysis.  The EPA's Risk Management Program regulations define the worst case as the entire loss of the maximum inventory of the largest tank or vessel.  The EPA also mandates that the most conservative weather conditions be used to calculate the distance to toxic endpoint.  The City of Natchez used the EPA-approved program Degadis to perform the worst-case analysis.  The facility is located in a populated area and the worst-case release yielded a distance to toxic endpoint that includes public receptors.  Beyond the toxic endp"

      "SummaryText": "oint, the airborne concentration of chlorine would drop below that at which nearly all individuals could be exposed to for up to one hour without experiencing or developing life threatening health effects.\n\nThe City of Natchez also performed a more likely alternative scenario for a chlorine release.  This case included a release due to a tubing failure that allowed a gas release through a 5/16\" diameter valve body opening.  This scenario yielded and distance to toxic endpoint that also included public receptors.\n V.  Accidental Prevention Program\n\nThe facility's accident prevention program includes each of the elements required by the Risk Management Program regulations.\n\nVI.  Safety Information\n\nThe Natchez Water Treatment Plant has gathered the necessary documentation of safety information on the covered chlorine process including a chlorine material safety data sheet, maximum intended inventory of equipment in which chlorine is stored or processed, safe upper and lower temperatures, pressures, and flowrates in all of the equipment in which chlorine is stored or processed, equipment specifications, and applicable codes and standards used to design, build, and operate the process.\n\nVII.  Hazard Review\n\nA hazard review was conducted on the covered process to identify all hazards and potential hazards associated with the process.  The results of the review were used to determine the appropriate safeguards needed to prevent or mitigate a release.\n\nVIII.  Operating Procedures\n\nWritten operating procedures have been in place at the Natchez Water Treatment Plant for several years.  These procedures address daily and periodic duties of plant operators as well as emergency situations.\n\nIX.  Maintenance Procedures\n\nWritten maintenance procedures have been in place at the Natchez Water Treatment Plant for several years.  Included in these procedures are inspections, a preventative maintenance schedule, and logs for all of these activities.\n\nX.  Five-year Accident History\n\nNo"
