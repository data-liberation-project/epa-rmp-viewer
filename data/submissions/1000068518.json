      "SummaryText": "Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nFareva Richmond, Inc. (herein, Fareva) is committed to providing optimal employee and public safety and health.  Fareva is dedicated to providing the resources necessary to assure, so far as possible, that every employee has a safe and healthful workplace.  Fareva also expects that all employees, contract employees and visitors commit to safety and follow all safety rules.\n\n\n\nIt is Fareva policy to ensure that adequate emergency response capabilities exist to handle an on-site emergency involving RMP-chemicals.  Fareva has developed an Emergency Response Plan for all emergency scenarios at the site that addresses how to respond in the event of a chemical release.  Fareva strives for prevention of chemical releases through employee training, equipment maintenance, and coordination with local emergency response agencies.\n\n\n\nFacility Description and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nFareva is located at 2248 Darbytown Road in Henrico, Virginia and operates a contract manufacturing facility for over-the-counter pharmaceuticals, health care products, and cosmetics.  Included at the facility is an operation for the manufacture of propellant-based health care products (aerosols).  As part of this manufacturing process, Fareva stores and utilizes flammable gases (e.g. propane, butane, isobutane, dimethyl ether, difluoroethane, and other mixed gases associated with the aerosol propellants) that are subject to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions detailed at Section 112(r) of the 1990 Clean Air Act (RMP Regulations) and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management Regulations at 29 CFR 1910.119 (PSM regulations).\n\n\n\nAs part of the propellant-based health care products manufacturing process, Fareva manages several flammable gases subject to the RMP regulations and the OSHA PSM Regulations at 29 CFR 1910.119.  Fareva has performed a detailed "

      "SummaryText": "review of the facility operations and has determined that there are two processes (as defined at 40 CFR Part 68.3 and 29 CFR Part 1910.119(b)) in which the chemicals are managed at levels greater than the regulatory threshold levels under the RMP regulations.  The processes include:\n\n\n\n(1) Flammable Gas Filling Operations including Flammable Gas Storage and Transfer (Storage & Use of Flammable Gases for manufacture of propellant-based health care products), and \n\n\n\n(2) Finished Product Goods Storage (Storage of aerosol cans containing flammable gases). \n\n \n\nThe RMP regulated chemicals associated with both processes are Flammable Gases (e.g. propane, butane, isobutane, dimethyl ether, difluoroethane, and other mixed flammable gases associated with aerosol propellants).\n\n\n\nFlammable Gas Filling Operations including Flammable Gas Storage and Transfer:\n\n\n\nPropellants, as detailed above, are stored in five above-ground pressurized vessels ranging in size from 6,565 gallons (one tank) to 30,000 gallons (four tanks).  These tanks are stored outside of the aerosol manufacturing building, but are interconnected to the aerosol can gas-houses (filling stations).  Propellants are also stored in portable 400 lb Dewar vessels which are considered collocated with the gas houses.  Therefore, the propellant storage tanks, Dewar storage vessels, and aerosol gas houses are considered a single process for purposes of RMP applicability.\n\n\n\nThe aerosol can filling operations currently include five can manufacturing lines as follows: one bag-on-valve line, two rotary fill lines, and two indexing fill lines.  Each line generally consists of the following steps:  liquid content filling, can capping, propellant filling, actuator insertion, and packaging.  The liquid contents are filled into the cans within the aerosol can manufacturing operations building.  The cans are then capped and transferred via conveyor to the gas houses, which are located exterior to the manufacturing building.  Once"

      "SummaryText": " in the gas houses, flammable (and non-flammable) propellants (transferred via hard piping from the propellant storage tanks) are filled into the cans and actuators are inserted.  Smaller (up to 400 lb) Dewar propellant storage vessels are also located adjacent to each gas house for temporary filling operations.  The cans are then returned to the building where they are packaged for distribution.\n\n\n\nThe aerosol can packaging lines (liquid fill, can capping, actuator insertion, and packaging) are located within the manufacturing building and therefore, are considered a separate process under RMP.  The liquid contents of the cans contain no regulated RMP constituents.  In addition, the packaging lines within the building do not manage cans in sufficient quantity to exceed any regulatory thresholds for flammable gases and therefore, the aerosol packaging area (liquid filling and post gas-house packaging) is not considered part of an RMP process.\n\n\n\nFinished Product Goods Storage:\n\n\n\nOnce the aerosol cans are packaged, they are palletized and transferred into the facility's warehouse area.  The warehouse area can store a maximum of 1,462 pallets of cans.  Based on the maximum amount of propellant stored in each can, Fareva has determined that the Finished Product Goods Storage area is a regulated RMP process.  \n\n\n\nPrevention Program\n\n\n\nFareva's Flammable Gas Storage and Filling Operation is subject to the Program Level 3 requirements of RMP.  A main component of the RMP Program 3 requirements is the implementation of a Program 3 \"Prevention Program.\"  However, the RMP Program 3 Prevention Program requirements mirror the OSHA PSM requirements detailed at 29 CFR 1910.119.  Fareva has developed a PSM Policy Manual to implement the PSM requirements.  Therefore, the PSM Policy Manual includes all elements required under the RMP Program Level 3 Prevention Program detailed at Part 68, Subpart D (Sections 68.65 through 68.87).  The following paragraphs provide a listing of PSM "

The Finished Product Goods Storage area is subject to the Program Level 1 requirements of RMP and therefore, not required to comply with the Program 3 \"Prevention Program\" requirements.  However, the Storage area is subject to OSHA PSM requirements and therefore, is also included in the facility's PSM Plan. \n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nProcess Safety Information (PI) relating to the covered processes is divided into three categories: chemical hazards, process technology, and process equipment.  PSI relating to chemical hazards is included in Safety Data Sheets (SDSs) that are maintained in readily-accessible locations for all employees.  PSI relating to process technology is indicated on process diagrams and is referenced in Operating Procedures and the Process Hazard Analysis.  PSI related to process equipment is located in process diagrams and equipment files maintained by the Engineering Department. \n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nProcess Hazard Analyses (PHAs) have been conducted on the two regulated processes and will be conducted on each covered process every five years, or when a significant change in the process occurs.  The PHA for both of Fareva's covered processes was last conducted in November 2018.  PHAs are conducted by a team of knowledgeable individuals representing, at a minimum, operations, maintenance, engineering, and safety.  PHAs address the following items: (1) the hazards of the processes; (2) any previous events that had a likely potential for catastrophic release, (3) engineering and administrative controls applicable to the hazards, (4) consequences of failure of those controls, (5) facility siting, (6) human factors, and (7) a qualitative evaluation of the possible safety and health effects on employees.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nWritten operating procedures for each part of the covered pro"
