      "SummaryText": "Cool Pacific was founded in 1991 as a cooling, storage and distribution center for fresh vegetables in Salinas, California.  Currently during the busiest part of the year, Cool Pacific will employee approximately 45 people.  The major work activities at Cool Pacific can be broken down into three groups: 1.) Receipt of fresh vegetables from the field and the removal of the field heat.  2.) Storage and maintenance of the fresh vegetables in coldrooms at a temperature range of 34 to 38 degrees Fahrenheit.  3.) Shipment of the fresh vegetables from Cool Pacific to their destination.  As part of the processes that are employed at Cool Pacific to accomplish the removal of the field heat and the maintenance of the desired temperature prior to shipment, Anhydrous Ammonia is used in the cooling apparatuses.  At any one point, the maximum amount of ammonia we have on site is approximately 6,000 gallons.\n\nIt is Cool Pacific's policy to protect and safeguard its' employees against all industrial injuries or illness.  To accomplish this, Cool Pacific has set forth employee regulations and guidelines concerning good safety practices.  These can be found in the Injury and Illness prevention Program Book.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE AND PREVENTION PROGRAM: At Cool Pacific, we are concerned about accidental releases of ammonia onto our employees and the general public.  In an effort to relieve the pressure during an accidental release, we have installed Emergency Relief Valves at each of our critical points in the cooling system which kicks back the ammonia into a holding tank on site.  We also have trained professionals come in each year to educate our employees on what action they should take if an ammonia release occurs.  This is part of our Industrial Saftey Committee's continuing education of employees on subjects of critical importance.\n\nAMMONIA RELEASES: Over the past five years, we have not had any ammonia releases.  In the event we do have a release, the procedures to be followed a"
