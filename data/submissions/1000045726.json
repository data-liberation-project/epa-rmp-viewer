The RMP conforms to the legal requirements established by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The purpose of this RMP is to:\n\n\n\n 1) Describe existing safety systems at the Chester facility that are designed to protect employees, community, environment, and assets;\n\n 2) Comply with the applicable EPA regulations:  40 CFR Part 68.\n\n\n\nThe following executive summary presents an overview of the Chester facilityA?s accident prevention and emergency response programs.\n\n\n\nOMNOVA SOLUTIONS Responsible Care Policy:\n\n\n\nOMNOVA Performance Chemicals will operate its facilities and conduct its business activities in a manner that protects the safety and health of its employees, preserves and protects the environment and maintains sound security processes.  We are committeed to compliance with safety, health, environmental and security laws and regulations as well as those programs we have implmented as part of our Responsible Care values.  All OMNOVA Performance Chemicals facilities will establish goals, objectives, and processes to drive continual improvement of their safety, health, environmental and security practices.  This policy reflects OMNOVA's commitment to its employees, shareholders, customers and communities.\n\n\n\n \n\nDESCRIPTION OF REGULATED PROCESSES:\n\n\n\nOMNOVA Solutions, Chester Plant has two regulated processes.  One process uses 50% Formaldehyde Solution (49% Water) in the production of permanent press finishing resins for the Textiles industry. Vinyl Acetate is used in the production of latex polymers for the Paper, Textiles, and Non-wovens, and other industries.   \n\n\n\n\n\n5 YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\n\n\n\nThe EPA regulations require regulated facilities to provide information for all accidental releases from regulated processes that resulted in (1) deaths, injuries according to the RMP defin"

The Risk Management regulation also specifically requires offsite consequence analyses in the form of Worst-Case Scenarios and Alternative Release Scenarios for certain regulated substances.\n\n\n\nOMNOVA Solutions is concerned that these Worst-Case Scenarios, required to be disclosed under the regulation, may overstate the risk of a worst case release.  For example, the EPA published lookup tables do not take any local physical conditions into account.  \n\n\n\nOMNOVA Solutions has also prepared Alternative Release Scenarios which it believes are more accurate predictions of potential accidental releases from the Chester facility.  Alternative Release Scenarios are by definition more likely to occur than the Worst-Case Scenarios but are still very improbable due to engineering and administrative controls in the facility's prevention program.  \n\n  \n\n\n\nWORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO:\n\n\n\nEPA regulations require facilities to develop one Worst-Case scenario to represent all toxic substances and one Worst-Case scenario to represent all flammable substances from a list of regulated materials.  Additional Worst-Case Scenarios are required if different public receptors (off site residences, businesses or community buildings within a possible impact radius) could be affected by the release of another regulated material.  OMNOVA Solutions is not subject to this additional requirement.\n\n\n\nWhen examining the following Worst-Case and Alternative Release Scenarios, it is i"

      "SummaryText": "mportant to keep in mind that OMNOVA Solutions has numerous preventative measures in place at its Chester facility to effectively prevent these situations.  These measures, most of which were not taken into consideration under EPA regulations, include leak detection systems, continuous monitoring, automated controls, emergency shutdowns, secondary containment and employees specially trained in handling these materials and in emergency responses methods.\n\n\n\nFlammable Materials\n\nThe Chester facility uses none of the 63 listed flammable substances above the regulated threshold.  \n\n\n\nToxic Materials\n\nThe Chester facility only uses two of the 77 regulated toxic substances on site above the regulatory threshold.  These are 50% Formaldehyde Solution and Vinyl Acetate.\n\n\n\nThe Worst-Case Scenario for a regulated toxic substance is the release of the entire contents of a Vinyl Acetate railcar.  This scenario assumes that there is no containment of the material and that the entire contents of the railcar would spill and vaporize.  It also assumes, unrealistically, that facility employees would do nothing to mitigate the release to limit the amount that is evaporated to the atmosphere.  OMNOVA Solutions does not think that this worst-case is likely and may not be possible due to the conservative assumptions required by the regulation.\n\n\n\nALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS:\n\n\n\nApplicable EPA regulations also require facilities to submit one alternative release scenario to represent all flammable substances and one to represent each toxic substance. \n\n\n\nFlammable Alternative\n\nThe Chester facility does not use any of the listed flammable substances above the regulated threshold.  \n\n\n\nToxic Alternatives\n\nThe facility is required to submit two alternative scenarios, one for each of the two toxic substances listed above.\n\n\n\nThe Alternative Release Scenario for Vinyl Acetate involves failure of a pressurized pipeline, which would result in an uncontained release. \n\n\n\nThe Alternative Releas"

      "SummaryText": "e Scenario for Formaldehyde involves failure of a tank truck unloading hose, resulting in a release of 50% Formaldehyde Solution from the hose.\n\n\n\n\n\nACCIDENTIAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM:\n\n\n\nOMNOVA Solutions' Chester facility began a formal Process Safety Management Program in 1992 when OSHA promulgated A?29 CFR 1910.119.  Process Safety Management in concert with effective engineering design, Employee Safety Programs, American Chemical Council's Responsible Care; Program, and Emergency Response Programs make up the Chester Plant's Accident Release Prevention Program.\n\n \n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM:\n\n\n\nOMNOVA Solutions' overall safety efforts consist of measures to prevent the release of hazardous materials, as well as programs to mitigate the effects of a release should it occur.  OMNOVA Solutions has a trained and equipped emergency response team capable of handling foreseeable emergency situations.  Coordination with local emergency response agencies is a key element of the emergency response planning process.  Specific plans are in place to respond to chemical emergencies within the facility.\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY:\n\n\n\nIntrinsic safety is a key element in the design of all process equipment and systems at OMNOVA Solutions' Chester facility.  All covered process equipment design and modification is subject to formal hazard analysis procedures.  During a hazard analysis, key recommendations are made for improvement to the process.  Application of new design principles to existing equipment is a key element of continuous process safety improvement.\n\n\n\nContinued training and planned drills will sustain and improve emergency response capabilities.   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
