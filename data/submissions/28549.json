      "SummaryText": "CHLORINE PROCESS EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe Contra Costa Water District's (CCWD) Randall-Bold Water Treatment Plant (Randall-Bold WTP), located in Oakley, California, supplies filtered and disinfected water to the general public for drinking and other uses.  Disinfection involves addition of chlorine gas to the water to destroy bacteria, viruses and other pathogens that may cause harm to public health.  Other chemicals are handled and safely used onsite to aid filtering and removal of organics and other particulate materials that may affect the taste and odor of the treated water.  These chemicals are not part of the RMP program, but are handled, stored, and used in a safe manner by Randall-Bold WTP staff.  \n\nThe chlorine disinfection process at the Randall-Bold WTP is subject to two new regulations - the federal Risk Management Plan (RMP) and the California Accidental Release Prevention Program (CalARP), which is California's version of the RMP.  The compliance deadline for both of these regulations is June 21, 1999.  The Randall-Bold WTP has already implemented programs to comply with several other accidental release prevention regulations including California's OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) program and California's Risk Management and Prevention Program (RMPP) because of use and storage of chlorine. The California RMPP law was repealed in January 1997 and replaced by the CalARP regulation.\n\nThe goal of these regulations and programs (new and existing) is to prevent and minimize the consequences of accidental releases of chlorine to both on-site staff and the surrounding community.  To meet this goal, CCWD has identified potential hazards, implemented comprehensive accident prevention programs, installed safety and release response equipment (including a scrubber system to treat release events and other process and piping related safety equipment), and prepared for emergencies.

They are transported on roads, water, and railways.  We at the Randall-Bold WTP use chlorine to disinfect our water.  Storing large qualities of chlorine can be a hazard.  We take our safety obligations in storing and using chlorine as seriously as we take providing a safe, reliable supply of drinking water.  This RMP describes what could happen if there were to be an accident, the steps we take every day to ensure a safely operating plant, and what we do in event of an emergency.  Please feel free to contact David Omoto, CCWD Environmental Compliance Officer at (925) 688-8023 if you have any questions regarding this plan.\n\nCCWD Mission\n\nThe mission of the Contra Costa Water District is to strategically provide a reliable supply of high quality water at the lowest cost possible, in an environmentally responsible manner (August 1, 1994).

The Randall-Bold WTP uses chlorine to disinfect water so that it is safe for customers to drink. Chlorine disinfection is a common process at water treatment plants. The Randall-Bold WTP disinfection system uses liquefied chlorine gas from up to four 1-ton containers. Up to eight more 1-ton containers are kept in the chlorine storage room. A vacuum is used to draw chlorine out of the containers and into the water supply.  \n\nThe chlorine storage and use areas are all inside a building that is designed to vent to a scrubber in the event of a chlorine release. The scrubber system can remove up to 2,000 pounds of chlorine gas released inside the building. The areas where chlorine is stored or used are equipped with chlorine sensors that alarm in the event of a chlorine leak. The Randall-Bold WTP is operated and maintained 24-hours a day by highly trained and experienced staff who are experts in the safe handling of chlorine and are prepared to respond to any release situation. Plant access is controlled so that only authorized personnel are allowed to enter the chlorine building. Trained plant staff must accompany visitors.\n\nChlorine Process Potential for Releases with Offsite"

      "SummaryText": "Consequences\n\nCCWD evaluated two scenarios that might lead to releases. The worst case scenario is specified by the EPA and consists of releasing the entire contents of one of the chlorine containers over a 10-minute period. This scenario is extremely unlikely, resulting only from catastrophic events such as an airplane crash. This scenario assumes that the incident occurs after the containers have been delivered and are in the chlorine storage building because containers are not stored outside. An EPA-developed air dispersion model called RMP*Comp was used to estimate the distance to a point at which the released chlorine gas would no longer present a significant public health impact. The calculated distance for the worst case scenario was 2.2 miles based on indoor chlorine use and storage. This distance may be exaggerated because of the use of the conservative EPA model and the use of conservative weather conditions required in the regulation. In addition, this scenario is extremely unrealistic and does not take into account Randall-Bold WTP's existing safety and prevention programs or the scrubber and alarm systems. \n\nA second, alternative release, scenario was identified based on the process hazard analysis update as the occurrence of 1/16th-inch leak in the flexible connection between the piping and the chlorine container. This scenario is less improbable than the worst-case release scenario. It takes into account that Randall-Bold WTP's extensive safety and release prevention systems will help to mitigate the impacts of such a release. The relatively small quantity of chlorine gas that is estimated would be released through this hole would be prevented from leaving the building by the scrubber system.  Thus, it was determined that the offsite impact associated with this alternative release scenario is minimal.

The tank is equipped with various devices to relieve vacuum and prevent over pressurization, and control emissions during bulk loading and operation.  These devices include a pressure vacuum relief valve, vapor scrubber, and vapor return line.  In the event of excess pressure, ammonia vapors from the tank vent through the pressure relief valve to the vapor scrubber.  During bulk loading, vapors are returned to the delivery tanker truck by way of a vapor return line.\r\n\r\nThe primary use and purpose of aqueous ammonia is to form chloramines to maintain chlorine residual.  Chloramines prevent the formation of trihalomethanes in the treated water distribution system.  To form these chloramines, the chemical feed room pumps draw aqueous ammonia from the bulk storage tank.  From the chemical feed room, aqueous ammonia is piped to an injector.

Worst-Case Release Scenario and Alternative Release Scenario\r\n\r\nCalARP requires an offsite consequence analysis of a worst-case scenario (WCS) and alternative release scenario (ARS).  The purpose of the offsite consequence analysis is to identify and communicate the potential hazards at the stationary source.\r\n\r\nThe Randall-Bold WTP offsite consequence analysis was conducted in accordance with the EPA document, RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidelines (guidelines).  An EPA approved dispersion model (RMP*CompTM) was used to evaluate the WCS and ARS.   RMP*CompTM is readily available to the public through EPA.\r\n\r\nFollowing are the results of the offsite consequence analysis.\r\n\r\nC.1 Worst-Case Scenario\r\n\r\nUnder the guidelines, a WCS considers a catastrophic release of the entire contents of the single largest container over a ten-minute period.  Given these parameters, the single largest container at Randall-Bold WTP is the aqueous ammonia storage tank.  The tank has a maximum capacity of 6,000 gallons.  By CCWD administrative procedure the tank volume never exceeds 5,400 gallons.\r\n\r\nFor the Randall-Bold WTP WCS, the model input used passive mitigation.  This mitigation consisted of the containment of a spill in both the chemical storage area (area) and spill containment basin (basin).  For modeling purposes it was assumed that both the area and basin flooded simultaneously.  The depth of the modeled basin was set at the maximum height of the basin.  These are extremely conservative assumptions as they present the maximum amount of spill surface area exposure.\r\n\r\nThe model input also consisted of conservative input (e.g., rural conditions, stability class F, and wind speed of 1.5 meters per second) in accordance with the guidelines.

The ARS assumes that it will take outside responders approximately 90 minutes to repair the leak.  The ARS also assumes that the spill will cover the entire surface area of the chemical storage area and spill containment basin during the 90 minutes period.  Using RMP*CompTM, the estimated release rate is 331 pounds per minute (about 41.4 gallons per minute).\r\n\r\nDefault values found in RMP*CompTM (e.g., stability class D, and wind speed 3 meters per second) were used to calculate the ARS distance to TE.

Some of these safeguards, which were identified during the CCHSD audit (September 2001), have been implemented.\r\n\r\nD.3 Prevention Program Elements\r\n\r\nThe prevention program identifies basic elements that are the foundation of sound prevention practices.  Under CalARP Program 2 requirements, there are seven elements in the prevention program.  These elements and CCWD compliance with these respective elements are presented below.\r\n\r\nD.3.a Safety Information\r\n\r\nDevelopment, dissemination, and use of safety information are vital to the effective operation of the Randall-Bold WTP.  CCWD personnel use information regarding the chemical hazards, equipment specifications, and operating limits on a daily basis and in all strategic decision-making processes.  Accurate and complete information readily available to all personnel is therefore a basic component of the RMP.\r\n\r\nSafety information may need to be developed and/or revised, and distributed in the event of certain process modifications as described in Section 2745.11(a) of the CalARP regulations.  If the proposed modification is subject to this section, then specific measures will be taken to ensure that the appropriate persons/parties are consulted and/or notified, and measures are in place to ensure safe process start-up.  \r\n\r\nFor CCWD consultation and notification purposes, proposed modifications affecting the aqueous ammonia process are subject to the procedures found in Section 12, \"Management of Change (MOC),\" of the CCWD Process Safety Management Manual.

CCWD performed a Hazard Review of the aqueous ammonia process in May 2003 to:\r\n\r\n\u00b7 identify hazards and credible human errors and/or equipment failures that could lead to an accidental release of aqueous ammonia; \r\n\u00b7 evaluate the likelihood and/or consequence of various release scenarios; determine if existing aqueous ammonia chemical-specific prevention steps and controls are adequate; and,\r\n\u00b7 where existing controls were deemed inadequate, identify additional steps to control the hazard.\r\n\r\nThe Hazard Review used an aqueous ammonia checklist methodology based on the United States Environmental Protection Agency document entitled, Risk Management Program Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants (October 1998).  External events considered in the Hazard Review include equipment failure and seismic events.  \r\n\r\nIn accordance with Section 2755.2 of the CalARP regulations, CCWD consulted with CCHSD on the use of this methodology.  The Hazard Review was completed in May 2003.\r\n\r\nA formal seismic assessment was conducted in June 2003.  The seismic assessment reviewed various faults including the Concord Fault, with a Maximum Credible Earthquake (MCE) of Richter Magnitude 6.5 and the Coast Ranges-Sierran Block Boundary Zone (CRSB) with an MCE of Richter Magnitude 7.0.

The training program instructs personnel on safe operating process within operating limits, and how to handle potential emergencies. The training program satisfies the requirements of Section 2755.4 of the CalARP regulation and is described in the CCWD Process Safety Management Manual.\r\n\r\nAll operators receive initial training in safe work practices and basic operating principles prior to assignment. The operators receive training specific to the operations of each process when they are assigned to a process. The training criteria are documented in job dimension documents that list the knowledge required (e.g., safe operating limits, safety system setpoints) and skills to demonstrate competence (e.g., emergency shutdown, lockout/tagout procedures). Competency is verified in several ways: through written and oral examinations, demonstrations, and on-the-job training. Documentation of training is maintained at Randall-Bold for process-related training.  The files include job dimension documents and certification letters for all employees involved in operating the aqueous ammonia process prior to June 1999.\r\n\r\nRefresher training on specific operating procedures (e.g., normal operations, startup, shut down), safe work practices (e.g., limiting contractor access, lockout/tagout), and company-wide practices is conducted during monthly safety meetings, special training classes, and drills.
