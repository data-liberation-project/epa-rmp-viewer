The company endeavors to execute these policies through the implementation of its Safety Program. The company safety program includes, but is not limited to a comprehensive Process Safety Management (PSM) Program. The PSM program is executed through YEX2's business partner, Western Precooling Systems (WPS).  WPS is a stakeholder in the YEX2 operation and has offices and staff about 100 yards from the facility.  PSM is specifically designed and intended to prevent accidental releases. It is the primary goal of YEX2 and WPS to protect employees, visitors and neighbors from harm due to company operations. \n\n\n\nYEX2 has adopted a \"non-responding facility\" policy; has an established Emergency Action Plan and has taken the steps necessary to be included in the community emergency plan.  An Emergency Coordinator has been established and coordination with the State Emergency Response Commission (SERC), Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and Fire Department is performed on an ongoing basis.  Emergency response pre-planning is coordinated and kept current through the annual submittal of appropriate reports and periodic tours of the facility by the Fire Department.\n\n\n\nWPS policy includes maintaining appropriate emergency capabilities and to deal with emergencies safely if and when they do happen.

Refrigeration Technicians employed by WPS are trained for their emergency actions).\n\n\n\n \n\n1.2  General Description of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nThe Yuma Express - Site #2 facility is located in Yuma, AZ in a commercial/industrial area outside the city. The facility was built in 1987; an expansion and upgrade project was completed in the latter part of 2011.  The facility provides refrigeration effect for the removal of field heat from freshly harvested vegetables (produce) and subsequent short-term refrigerated storage. The product that comes to the facility for pre-cooling and subsequent short-term storage is on-site generally four days from harvesting. The facility is a seasonally operated plant with product harvest periods beginning in mid-November and finishing in early April. \n\n\n\nThe Regulated Substance in use is Anhydrous Ammonia, CAS #7664-41-7, which is used in a closed-loop mechanical refrigeration system. Pressure and temperature controls are installed in accordance with appropriate standards, including isolation and overpressure relief valves. At certain times of the year portable cooling equipment is required to augment the fixed equipment at the facility. Due to the seasonal operation of the Plant, the majority of ammonia refrigerant is removed and placed in storage vessels at the end of each season.  The vessels are provided shade, traffic barriers and a water sprinkler system. The water sprinkler system reduces pressure and temperature by reducing the skin temperature "

Yuma Express Cooling, LLC is an Arizona Limited Liability Company made up of Western Precooling Systems (WPS) - 50 % and a group of individuals and entities affiliated with American Growers Cooling LLC (AGCC) - 50 %.  Yuma Express Cooling, LLC leases the site including stationary refrigeration equipment to AGCC.  Separately, WPS leases portable refrigeration equipment to AGCC. Maintenance of the entire refrigeration system is the responsibility of WPS which has offices and staff about 100 yards from the site. WPS and AGCC work together to implement the Risk and Process Safety Management Plan which is in the name of Yuma Express Cooling, LLC - Site # 2.  \n\n\n\n1.3  General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\n\n\nAs noted above, a comprehensive Process Safety Management (PSM) Program has been established in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.119. The PSM Program is specifically intended to prevent accidental releases & promote the safe operation of ammonia-handling equipment and processes. PSM is an integral part of daily Plant operation. The written PSM document is maintained in the site's RMP/PSM Plan.\n\n\n\nAs noted above WPS is the company that inspects and performs mechanical maintenance of the ammonia refrigeration equipment.  Schedules and written procedures for the operation and maintenance of ammonia-handling equipment, including the steps to be taken in the event of a release or threatened release, have been developed.  The written procedures include necessary safety precautions for Plant operation, inspection, maintenance, and moving of portable equipment (Hydro-Vac&trade; Vacuum Tubes).  As maintenance needs are determined, the need is expressed to the WPS Area Manager.  Specific tasks for the expressed need is decided by the WPS Area Manager and entered into the service call system.

Through a regular routine of inspect, discuss, assign and confirmation of completion, YEX2 and WPS have reduced equipment operational problems and also reduced the potential for releases.\n\n\n\nWPS actively encourages its ammonia Technicians to seek Certification through the Refrigerating Engineers and Technicians Association (RETA).  Technicians only perform tasks for which they have been pre-qualified.\n\n\n\nChemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nIt has become apparent in the industry that a mishap while draining oil from the system is one of the most common incidents to occur. Special self-closing valves are now used as a permissive for oil drain flow. If a release were to develop during the oil-draining task, the mechanic simply releases the handle of the self-closing valve and flow is terminated. The facility uses these types of valves at all of the oil drain points.\n\n\n\nOther release prevention steps taken at YEX2 - Site #2:\n\n - The facility has fencing and gates to limit access to the facility and to increase the security of the facility from potential \"wrong-doers\".\n\n - A Security Service is employed on-site to control casual visitors (truck drivers reporting to pick-up produce).  \n\n - CCTV's are employed for site monitoring (added)\n\n - An ammonia monitoring, sensing and warning system is installed.\n\n - An Ammonia-Water Diffusion System was installed under supervision of the Yuma Fire Dept.\n\n - There is a controlled pressure receiver installed for daily operational swing capacity.\n\n - An evaporative cooling water sprinkler system is installed over the site's high pressure receiver vessel.  This system reduces pressure during sustained hot weather.\n\n - Employees are trained for hazard communication (discovery and communicating) for releases, fires, vandal's etc. Training is documented in each employees training record file.\n\n - Staff is trained in the benefits of good housekeeping.

The accident occurred on December 2, 2011 and resulted in the release of approximately 1100 lbs. of anhydrous ammonia.  One Refrigeration Technician was admitted to the hospital.  One Cooler employee was seen and released with no restrictions.  There were no off-site injuries or other off-site consequences other than precautionary evacuations and a temporary road closure.  20 other people sought attention; there were no hospitalizations or other medical treatments of those people.  An Incident Investigation was initiated on the day of the event.  \n\n\n\n1.5  The Emergency Response Program\n\n\n\nThe Emergency Response Program is divided into two elements, as only properly trained and qualified personnel are authorized to respond to emergencies. Production workers contracted by YEX2 are trained to notify and evacuate via the Plant's Emergency Action Plan. Only the Yuma Fire Department would respond to an emergency; support would be made available via WPS personnel trained to 29 CFR 1910.120(q) standards. Emergency equipment is maintained under the control of WPS. Written ammonia emergency procedures are detailed in the facility's \"Thirty Minute Plan\". Appropriate written plans are maintained on-site and updated on a regular basis. Local Emergency Response capabilities have been verified.\n\n  \n\n \n\n1.6   Planned changes to improve safety\n\n\n\nMechanisms to identify and plan safety improvements include (but are not limited to):\n\n - Process Hazard Analysis revalidation/update;\n\n - Compliance Audits;\n\n - Routine maintenance (Mechanical Integrity Program);\n\n - IIAR Bulletin 109 Inspections  (IIAR minimum safety criteria for the safe operation of ammonia refrigeration process);\n\n - WPS Inspection Protocol\n\n - Incident Investigation Reports\n\n\n\nEach of the Programs above may result in recommendations ranging"
