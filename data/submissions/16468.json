The  COGWD emergency policy involves the preparation of response plans tailored to each facility and to the emergency response available within the community.   All applicable procedures of the EPA RMP are adhered to.\n\nMadison Pump Station (MPS) is a facility used to collect raw water from the wells located  around station.  MPS is an unmanned remotely controlled station.  MPS, for the purpose of RMP, consists of a chlorine storage room a feed room.  These two room have their own entrances to the outside. The rooms are aside of the main pump bay and next to the workroom, bathroom, and office area, which hold the leak repair kits and self contained breathing apparatuses.  The maximum amount of chlorine on site at any one time is two 1-ton containers (4000 lbs.), only one container is on line at once. The feed room contains feed control valves and injection equipment.  MPS is equiped with a computer control operating and alarming system.  Operators check the facility every week, or as often as needed.\n\nThe offsite consequence analysis includes consideration of the two chlorine release scenarios identified as \"worst case scenario (WCS)\" and \"altenati                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    "
