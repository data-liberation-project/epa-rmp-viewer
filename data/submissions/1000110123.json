      "SummaryText": "Stationary source and regulated substances handled \n\nPregis Granite Falls owns and operates a polyethylene foam manufacturing process, which produces packaging material. The foam manufacturing process uses isobutane as a blowing agent, which is received by truck and stored at the facility in two (2) pressure vessels, then transferred from the storage vessels to the blowing area via piping. Isobutane is a regulated flammable substance under the EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) Chemical Accident Prevention rule (40 CFR 68) and the Occupational Safety & Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (29 CFR 1910.119); therefore, the foam manufacturing process is subject to EPA RMP and OSHA PSM requirements. Our facility has taken all necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA RMP rule. The following sections briefly describe the elements of the accidental release prevention program implemented at the Pregis Granite Falls facility. \n\n \n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies \n\nWe at Pregis are strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety. This commitment is inherent to the comprehensive accidental release prevention program in place at Pregis Granite Falls. The RMP program covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. In the unlikely event that such a release were to occur, we are completely coordinated with the Caldwell County Local Emergency Planning Commission (LEPC) and the Granite Falls Fire Department to provide highly trained emergency response personnel to control and mitigate the effects.  \n\nGeneral accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps \n\nOur facility\u0092s systems and practices are de"

      "SummaryText": "signed to achieve compliance with EPA's RMP Rule, OSHA\u0092s PSM standard, and all related state and local requirements for prevention of accidental chemical releases. The process includes safety features such as a fire suppression system, gas sensors, emergency shutdowns, and excess flow valves.  \n\nFive-Year Accident History \n\nPregis has an excellent record of preventing accidental releases. Owing to Pregis' stringent release prevention programs at this facility, there have been no significant accidental releases in the past 5 years. \n\nEmergency Response Program \n\nPregis maintains a written RMP Response Management Plan for the safety of its employees in the event of an accidental release of hazardous materials. The facility is a non-responding source, meaning it relies on local emergency responders in the event of an accidental release. The Response Management Plan includes first aid and medical treatment measures, evacuation routes, and notification procedures to inform local emergency response agencies of a potential accidental release. Emergency notification equipment is regularly inspected and serviced to ensure proper functioning. Upon modification of the covered process, the plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes within the covered process that would require changes to the Response Management Plan. \n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety \n\nTo enhance our continuous improvement in occupational safety and health, we conduct monthly general safety planning meetings and encourage employee participation and consultation."
