      "SummaryText": "LOBECO PRODUCTS, INC.\nRisk Management Program\nExecutive Summary for Chemical Facilities\n\nThis is an update, as required by 40 CFR 68.190 (Updates) to the RMP submitted by Lobeco Products, Inc. on 05/31/2002.  The submittal adds the Program 3 chemical 65% Oleum which will now be stored in above the reportableThreshold quantity. \n\n1.\tAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at Lobeco Products, Inc. are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n\n2.\tThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities encompass Intermediate Dye & Pigment Manufacturer.  We have 7 regulated substances present at our facility.  These substances include Ammonia (aqueous), Dimethylamine  [Methanamine, N-methyl-], Ethyl chloride  [Ethane, chloro-], Ethylenediamine  [1,2-Ethanediamine], Formaldehyde, Methyl chloroformate  [Carbonochloridic acid, methylester] and Oleum (65% solution)(Fuming Sulfuric acid). Ammonia (29% solution) and Methyl chloroformate (97% solution) are used for manufacturing Herbicide.  Dimethylamine (40% solution) is used in manufacturing an intermediate chemical for sale to other manufacturers.  Ethyl chloride (30% solution) is a recycle stream generated by our Herbicide process.  Ethylenediamine (99% solution) is used for Dye and Pigment manufacturing.  Formaldehyde (37% solution) and Oleum (65% solution) are used for manufacturing a water based additive. \n\nThe maximum inventory of Formaldehyde (37%) is 57,000 lbs., Methyl chloroformate (97%) is 40,000 lbs., Dimethylamine (40%) is 38,200 lbs., Ethylenediamine (99%) is 38,000 lbs., Ethyl Chlor"

For alternate release scenario analysis, we have also used the RMP Pro-98 Program incorporating the look-up tables and equations provided by the EPA in the RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance.  The most recent upgrade to the RMP Pro-98 Program , upgrade #18, was used for this submittal.  The calculated released quantity for both the worst case and alternate scenario is different from our original submittal, but the end point remains the same.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from Oleum Storage Tank T-8404.  In this scenario 59,591.34 lb. of Oleum (65% solution)(Fuming Sulfuric acid)is released.  The total quantity of the Oleum storage tank is released into the diked area from which evaporation takes place, with a tempurature of 102 degrees F and average ambient relative humidity of 72%.  The entire pool is estimated to evaporate over 1,994.86 minutes.  The released quantity has been limited to 31% of the maximum capacity of the source by a system of administrative controls.  At Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s wind-speed, the maximum distance of 1.5 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.01000 mg/L.\n\nThe altermative release scenario for Oleum (65%) involves a release from a ruptured transfer ho"

As part of the Beaufort County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) actions, our response plan, which has been coordinated and verified by the LEPC includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas.\n\nTo ensure proper functioning, our emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced.  In addition, the plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within our processes that would require a modified emergency response.\n\n7.\tPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\nSeveral developments and findings have resulted from the implementation of the various elements of our accidental release prevention program.  Existing dike systems have been modified and some new dikes constructed around those chemicals that are affected by the RMP Program.  We have also constructed an enclosure around our Methyl chloroformate Storage Tank as an additional passive mitigation system.  We have initiated semi-annual preventive maintenance programs that verify the integrity of the associated pumps for off-loading chemicals from tank trucks.  These changes have already taken place, but Lobeco Products, Inc. is committed to continuously strive to provide safety features to prevent any accidental release of a hazardous chemical substance.\n\n8.
