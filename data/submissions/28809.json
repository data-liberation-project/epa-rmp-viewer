              "Description": "Anhydrous Ammonia is not stored or used on-site on a full time basis. It is anticipated the ammonia will be stored on the site in a standard tank truck disconected from the truck (capacity 24 tons) when the operator needs to fill his liquid storage tanks with ammonium polyphosphate solution. The ammonia is reacted with phosphoric acid (brought on site in railcars) to produce the product. The production of the liquid fertilizer is carried out in a portable pipe reactor which is brought on site by an independant contractor/operator. The portable pipe reactor operator assumes responsibility for the ammonia when he comes on site and hooks the tank truck to the portable pipe reactor. The portable pipe reactor is covered under OSHA's PSM. The only responsibillity for the terminal personel is the time period when the ammonia trailer is spotted on site prior to the arrival of the portable pipe reactor (possibly 1 - 5 days) and any empty trailer that may contain some residue prior to being removed. The operating and maintenance procedures used by the terminal include periodical observation of the trailer ot detect leaks or vandalism. The operators for the terminal will serve only on a first responder basis by observing and notifying responsible individuals if serious leaks are noted.",

THE FACILITY POLICY\nThe owner, management and employees of Abilene Ag Services (the facility) are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local police, fire, LEPC and/or any  other authorities to mitigate any releases and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. FACILITY INFORMATION\nThe primary activity of the facility is the storage and distribution of liquid fertilizers. It is anticipated that anhydrous ammonia will possibly be located on site for only limited time periods. The ammonia will be brought on site in tank trucks and stored as is until an outside contractor  comes on-site and connects his processing machine (portable pipe reactor)  to the tank truck. The facility is responsible for the trailer only during the time period from when the trailer arrives on site until the outside contractor connects his equipment to the tank.  After the contractor connects to the trailer, their PSM program takes over the operation and maintenance of the anhydrous ammonia system.\nThe maximum quantity stored on site at any given time would be approximately 48,000 pounds\n\n3. WORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO\na. The wosrt case release scenario would be the release fo the total contents of the trailer (48,000 lb) over a 10 minute period. The distance to endpoint is 2.6 miles as calculated using RMP Comp.\n\nb. The alternative release scenario based on the most likely potential incident is a release from a leaking valve due to a mechanical failure or having been left partially open by an unauthorized person (during a theft of ammonia for drug production). A total of 750 pounds of ammonia could be released from a trailer over a period of about 15 minutes. The distance to endpoint is 0.1 miles as calculated by RMP Comp.\n\n4. ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PORGRAM\nAbilene Ag Service and Supply is committed to pre"
