Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at CITY OF SULPHUR REGIONAL WASTEWATER FACILITY are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities encompass  TREATMENT OF WASTEWATER FROM THE CITES OF SULPHUR    AND WESTLAKE AND THE COMMUNITY OF MOSSVILLE, CALCASIEU PARISH LOUISIANA. CONDUCT ROUTINE LAB. TESTS AS REQUIRED BY EPA PERMIT.  .  We have 2 regulated substances present at our facility.  These substances include Chlorine and Sulfur dioxide (anhydrous).  Chlorine is used for DISINFECTANT FOR REMOVAL OF EXCESS BACTERIA.  Sulfur dioxide (anhydrous) is used for REMOVAL OF CHLORINE FROM WASTEWATER BEFORE DISCHARGE INTO OUTFALL..\n\nThe maximum inventory of Chlorine at our facility is 4000.00 lb. while Sulfur dioxide (anhydrous) is present at our facility in a maximum quantity of 4000.00 lb..\n\n3.    The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used the EPA's OCA Guidance Reference Tables or Equations.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from CHLORINE TREATMENT.  In this scenario 2000 lb. of Chlorine is released.  The toxic liquid released is assu"

The released quantity has been limited to 30% of the maximum capacity of the source by a system of administrative controls.  At Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s windspeed, the maximum distance of 5.4 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.0087 mg/L.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for Chlorine involves a release from CHLORINE TREATMENT.  The scenario involves the release of 800 lb. of chlorine.  Toxic liquid is assumed to be released to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to have evaporated after 30 minutes.  Passive mitigation controls such as   OPEN PAVILION are taken into account to calculate the scenario, having the effect of a minimum gas leak due to the installation of a dual point gas monitor and a dual emergency shut-off system.  The release is also assumed to be controlled by emergency shutdown system(s).  These active mitigation systems have the effect of a minimum gas leak due to the installation of the abive mentioned equipment..  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.0087 mg/L of Chlorine is 0.58 miles.\n\n4.    The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-58 Standard, 1967 Edition    TEN STATES STANDARD.    The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nCITY OF SULPHUR REGIONAL WASTEWATER FACILITY maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with "

The methodology used to carry out these analyses is testing and inspection of all equipment related to chemical injection .  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of once every twelve months.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.  The most recent PHA/update was performed on 01/25/1999.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, CITY OF SULPHUR REGIONAL WASTEWATER FACILITY maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nTraining\nCITY OF SULPHUR REGIONAL WASTEWATER FACILITY has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Refresher training is provided at least once a year and more frequently as needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nCITY OF SULPHUR REGIONAL WASTEWATER FACILITY carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.
