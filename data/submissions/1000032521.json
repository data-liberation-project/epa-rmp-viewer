The safety and health of all personnel are very important. The control of accidents has been and will continue to be a basic responsibility of all personnel in the Middlesboro, Kentucky facility.\r\n\r\nTo accomplish the company's goal in controlling accidental losses, the facility has established plant safety programs. The objectives of the plant safety programs are to: maximize safety performance, eliminate human suffering and the economic burden resulting from injuries and accidents and reduce losses associated with damage of property.\r\n\r\nOne of the activities associated with the Plant Safety Program has been the development and implementation of accidental release prevention and emergency response programs which are designed to comply with OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals, 29 CFR 1910.119), and EPA's Risk Management Program (RM program) regulation (Risk Management Programs for Chemical Accidental Release Prevention, 40 CFR Part 68). The Safety Manager is responsible for\r\nimplementation of the Risk Management Program.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the accidental release prevention and emergency response programs is to prevent the occurrence and minimize the consequences of significant releases of toxic substances as well as fires,explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents. Overall, these programs prevent accidental fatalities,injuries and illnesses, environmental impact and avoid physical property damage.\r\n\r\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response programs help prevent accidents because they focus on the rules, procedures, and practices which govern individual processes, activities, or pieces of equipment. These rules are detailed and improved a necessary. They are also commu"

It operates two ammonia refrigeration systems that provides cooling and freezing capabilities. The amount of anhydrous ammonia (CAS #7662-41-7) contained in the systems is in excess of 10,000 pounds. The maximum inventory for the two systems is approximately 32,255 pounds. Since an ammonia release from either system could pose\r\na risk of offsite public and/or environmental impact and the systems are regulated under the OSHA PSM standard (29 CFR 1910.119), the systems are subject to the Program 3 requirements of the EPA's RM program.\r\n\r\nA A\u00bfWorst-Case Scenario Offsite Consequences AnalysisA\u00bf and an A\u00bfAlternative Release Scenario Offsite Consequence AnalysisA\u00bf were performed identifying the public and environmental receptors within the toxic endpoint concentration radius of 200 parts per million.\r\n\r\nDescription of the Accidental Release Prevention Program\r\n\r\nThe prevention program consists of the following elements:\r\n\r\nEmployee Participation: This program involves the employees in establishing and implementing the program. Employees are also to be involved when a process hazard analysis is conducted. The program also ensures that all employees have complete access to the program.\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information: Written information has been collected which enables the employees to identify and understand the potential hazards in the system. The written information includes the ammonia MSDS and a description of the design of the ammonia refrigeration system.\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA): Formal studies using the What-If/Checklist Technique have been conducted to examine the system and identify potential hazards. Any recommendations from the PHA are resolved to improve facility safety.\r\n\r\nOperating Procedures: Written, detailed procedures have been developed which desc"

The contractors are also periodically evaluated to ensure that they perform work by following safe work practices.\r\n\r\nPre-Startup Safety Review: A pre-startup safety review is required for all new ammonia projects to verify that all safety programs are in place, training has been performed, and construction has been completed according to design standards before the project is put into use. A pre-startup safety review is also performed when the process safety information related to the system changes significantly.\r\n\r\nMechanical Integrity: This program ensures that the ammonia refrigeration systems are built and maintained using preventive maintenance procedures to minimize unexpected breakdowns or failures.\r\n\r\nHot Work Permit: These procedures ensure that a signed permit is obtained prior to any cutting, welding, or burning.\r\n\r\nManagement of Change: Procedures are designed to ensure that all changes made to the ammonia refrigeration system are properly reviewed.\r\n\r\nIncident Investigation: The procedures to conduct regular audits of the RM prevention program to ensure that the program is in place and working properly.

Once the pipe was opened on both ends a gurgling noise was heard and then ammonia was released from both ends. The quantity of the release was assumed to be the remaining contents in the isolated pipe. One employee was sent to the hospital for medical evaluation. There was also environmental impact.\r\n\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program \r\n\r\nAn emergency response program has been implemented at the Smithfield Middlesboro facility. This program contains procedures describing how the facility will respond to ammonia spills and other emergencies, including\r\nevacuation procedures. This program has been coordinated with the Middlesboro Fire Department.\r\n\r\nThe Emergency Response Program consists of the following elements:\r\n\r\nOrganization Plan and Responsibilities\r\nCommunications Procedures\r\nDetailed Action Plans\r\nFirst Aid Procedures\r\nEmergency Medical Treatment Procedures\r\nEvacuation Plans\r\nDescription of Outside Assistance Available\r\nTraining Programs and Drills\r\nRevision and Update Criteria\r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\r\n\r\nPlanned changes to improve safety include adding procedures to notify nearby residences in the event of an ammonia release to the Emergency Response Plan and installing mitigation system to prevent release from going off-site."
