A key element of this commitment is the safe and proper handling of chemicals. The mill implements controls to prevent accidents or releases of hazardous substances. In the event of an accidental release, mitigation steps are taken to contain, control, and stop the release. The mill is an integrated pulp and paper manufacturing facility located on 1371 acres of property in the southwestern corner of Isle of Wight County, Virginia. One substance, chlorine dioxide, is utilized at the site to bleach pulp. This substance is regulated under 40 CFR Part 68, Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions.International Paper is committed to continuously improve the safety of its processes. One example of this commitment is the elimination of the use of elemental chlorine for bleaching, which was implemented in April 2001. Additionally, ongoing activities, including training, process hazard analysis and auditing, are used to identify ways to continually improve the operation of these processes. As required by the Risk Management Planning Rule, worst case and alternative release scenarios were analyzed. The worst case scenario is prescribed by the rule. For this site, it is an instantaneous spill of the entire contents of the largest chlorine dioxide storage tank (138,760 gallon capacity). The solution would spill into a 1 centimeter deep puddle and evaporate quickly due to high volatility of chlorine dioxide. Alternative releases were also reviewed. The alternative release scenario for this site is a flange leak on delivery piping. This would result in a release of 260 lb of chlorine dioxide over 20 minute period. Mitigation measures considered in this scenario included emergency shutdown systems. Each of these release scenarios has potential off-site consequences. For the alternative release "

      "SummaryText": "scenario, offsite receptors include residences, churches and commercial areas. For the much less realistic worst-case scenario, offsite receptors include residences, schools, churches, commercial areas, a hospital and an airport. The following prevention elements for the chlorine dioxide systems are employed at the mill: 1) Design standards: Design standards are utliized to insure that process safety information is incorporated into the construction and maintenance of these systems. 2) Operating Procedures: Written operating procedures have been developed and are maintained. These procedures define how tasks related to the process operation should be performed. They are used to train operators and serve as guides for appropriate steps to be taken both during normal operations and process upsets. 3) Maintenance: The chlorine dioxide systems are properly maintained. Preventative maintenance is routinely performed on this system. Maintenance on this system is limited to employees and contract personnel who have received specific training on the maintenance of the systems. 4) Training: Personnel are trained in the operating procedures to help insure safe and effective performance of our assigned tasks. 5) Process Hazard Analysis (PHA's): PHA's were conducted on the chlorine dioxide system. PHA's are structured ways to identify and reduce the hazards of a system. Routine review of these PHA's is performed as well. 6) Contractor Management: The mill has a program which establishes criteria for contractors in order to work at the site. 7) Compliance Audits: Compliance audits are conducted to insure compliance with requirements of the regulations. 8) Pre-startup Review: Prior to modifications of affected systems, a pre-startup review is conducted to insure integrity of the system is maintained. 9) Hot Work Permit: For work outside of designated safe areas, a permit system has been implemented to insure that proper safeguards are taken to minimize risk of a fire. 10) Managem"

All employees are encouraged to report any such incident. The facility has a written emergency response plan to mitigate and minimize the effects of any accidental release. Trained response personnel and equipment are on-site 24 hours/day. Training on and drills of the response plan are routinely conducted. The response plan has been communicated to local emergency response officials who have participated in drills at the facility. As defined by this rule, one accidental release has occurred in the past five years. During the five year history, there have been no off--site health or environmental damage from these incidents."
