Regulated chemicals at Big River Resources Boyceville, LLC include pentane (exceeds 10,000 pound threshold) and anhydrous ammonia (exceeds 10,000 pound threshold).\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nBig River Resources Boyceville, LLC is committed to the protection of its employees, the greater community and the environment from hazardous substances used in the ethanol production process, specifically anhydrous ammonia and denaturant, an RMP-regulated flammable mixture.  The ammonia is used for pH control directly in the process feed mixture to fermentation.  The denaturant is added to ethanol to make the ethanol unfit for human consumption. Big River Resource Boyceville, LLC typically uses unleaded gasoline as a denaturant, which is not RMP-regulated; however, the facility, at times, uses natural gasoline, which is an RMP-regulated flammable containing the following RMP-regulated substances: butane, ethane, pentane and propane.

Anyhydrous ammonia is stored on-site and used in the ethanol production process for pH control.  The maximum amount of aqueous ammonia stored is approximately 86,400 pounds.

The maximum amount of denaturant on-site is 100,000 gallons (approximately 667,200 pounds of natural gasoline).  The denaturant is stored in an above ground tank as a liquid and is mixed with the fuel ethanol in the final stage of production; this tank is located in the facility tank farm area, which includes a secondary containment dike.  Big River Resources Boyceville, LLC has evaluated the worst-case and alternative case scenarios as they relate to the regulated substances.  An Emergency Response Program is currently being implemented.
