The facility is covered by the rule because it uses anhydrous ammonia in excess of the regulatory threshold. Anhydrous ammonia is used in the facility's refrigeration system, and is a listed chemical due to toxicity. \n\n\n\nThe facility is submitting an updated Risk Management Plan (RMP) in accordance with the regulatory requirement to fully update the RMP at least once every five years. The most recent full update was April 28, 2009; therefore, this five-year update is due no later than April 28, 2014. The purpose of this project was to prepare the RMP update for the Dodge City facility.\n\n\n\nThe worst-case release scenario is based on the low-side accumulator. The low-side accumulator is the vessel that could potentially hold the greatest amount of ammonia. The analysis of the worst-case release scenario assumes that 69,050 pounds of ammonia are released to the atmosphere over a 10-minute period. The resulting plume was modeled according to the method presented in the EPA's general guidance document for risk management programs, and confirmed by EPA's modeling program RMP*Comp. The distance at which the ammonia concentration in the plume falls below the regulatory endpoint concentration was determined to be 4.7 miles. It was further determined that within 4.7 miles of the facility there is a population of approximately 23,824 people. The public receptors identified within 4.7 miles of the facility are residences, schools, hospitals, recreational areas, and commercial/industrial areas. The Riverside Camp area was the only environmental receptor identified within 4.7 miles of the facility.\n\n\n\nThe alternative release scenario examined a catastrophic release of ammonia from a failure of the high-side receiver.

Residences were the only public or environmental receptors identified within 0.8 miles of the facility.\n\n\n\nIn the past five years there have been no accidents involving ammonia that resulted in any on-site deaths, injuries, or significant property damage; or that resulted in any offsite deaths, injuries, property damage, environmental damage, evacuation, or shelterings in place.\n\n\n\nThe updated report includes updated prevention program review dates and other activities associated with the prevention program. The facility conducts a PHA (Process Hazard Analysis) at least once every 5 years with the most recent PHA completed on 12/09/2013.  An action register of issues called out in the PHA were completed on 02/01/2014.  Preventative maintenance (PM) and mechanical integrity inspections are conducted on a regularly scheduled basis to keep equipment running efficiency and inspect equipment for issues.  The facility reviews standard operating procedures (SOP) at least yearly.  Operators have regularly scheduled training such as SOP training and 40 hour Refrigerator Operator 1 training in by a third party.  The facility uses the Management of Change MOC) process, conducts compliance audits on the refrigeration system, and conducts and reviews incident investigations with refrigeration employees.\n\n\n\nThe facility has a emergency action plan in place to effectively respond to an emergency situation, such as an ammonia release, in an orderly, predetermined manner.  The facility has its own emergency responders that have received 24 hour emergency response training, subsequent 8 hour refresher training and have received medical screening.  The"

      "SummaryText": " trained members coordinate the emergency action plan with the local fire department and LEPC.  Contact information for the local fire department and LEPC are included in the emergency action plan.\n\n\n\nThe facility has a few improvements projects planned.  The facility is replacing the ammonia pipes that were determined by \"non-destructive testing\" to have an elevated risk for failure.  A hot box evaporator replacement project was planned to replace 11 older evaporators that are decreasing in efficiency.  The facility is relocating isolation valves to the facility roof for better access and reduction of hazard during normal operation and emergency situations.  The facility also has plans to replace 9 evaporators with 5 new evaporators as part of a bone cannon project on the fabrication floor.\n\n\n\nThe RMP was modified on November 30th, 2015 due to the addition of the new ODS II project completion.  This box storage building added an additional ammount of ammonia to the system.\n\n\n\nThe RMP was resubmitted on September 30th, 2016 to change the contact information."
