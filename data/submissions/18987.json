      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n \nThe City of Mercedes Sewage Treatment Plant accidental release prevention policy involves a\nunified approach that integrates technologies, procedures, and management practices.  The\nMercedes emergency response policy involves the preparation of a response plan that is tailored\nto each facility and to the emergency response services available in the community.  The policy\nadheres to EPA Prevention Program procedures where applicable, and is in compliance with EPA\nEmergency Response Program requirements.  \n\nThe sewage operations include one facility of concern: The chlorination building located at the\nSewage Treatment Plant, where the chemical of concern is chlorine.\n\nThe City of Mercedes Sewage Treatment Plant is located at Mile 8 North and Mile 1/2 East, in\nMercedes, Hidalgo County, Texas.  The chlorination building at the Sewage Treatment Plant\nconsists of a two walled canopy structure facing south that is located approximately in the middle\nof the facility. Two 1-ton cylinders of chlorine are stored at the facility.  Only one 1-ton container\nis connected to the system.  The 1-ton container is located inside the walled canopy structure.  The\nchlorine container has a manual shutoff valve in case of an emergency and a chlorine alarm will be\ntriggered if a release occurs.  Emergency air supply and power are available.  The facility is\nmanned 8-hours a day, and operators check the chlorination building daily.  Three\nSelf-Contained-Breathing- Apparatus (SCBA) are stored in the office and workroom located\napproximately 300 yards away from the chlorination building, respectively. \n\nThe offsite consequence analysis for the Sewage Treatment Plant includes consideration of two\ndifferent release scenarios for each of the parameters of concern (chlorine): 1) A \"Worst Case\nRelease\"; and 2) an \"Alternative Scenario\".  The Worst Case Release is defined by EPA guidance\nwhich states that \"the owner or operator shall assume that the ... maximum quantity in the la"

The Alternative\nScenario is defined as \"more likely to occur than the worst-case release scenario.\" \n\nAtmospheric dispersion modeling has to be performed to determine the distance traveled by a\nparameter of concern before its concentration decreases to the \"toxic endpoint\".  The toxic\nendpoints are defined by the EPA as 0.0087 mg/L for chlorine. These values correspond to the\nEmergency Response Planning Guidelines Level 2 (ERPG-2) concentrations which are defined by\nthe American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA) as:\n\n\" The maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals could\nbe exposed for up to one-hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious\nhealth effects or symptoms which could impair an individual's ability to take protection action.\"  \n\nThe estimated population potentially affected by the release is defined as the residential\npopulation within a circle with a radius corresponding to the toxic endpoint distance.\n\nThe Worst Case Release Scenario at the Mercedes Sewage Treatment Plant was defined by the\nfollowing conditions:\n\n Failure of one 1-ton container resulting in the total release of 2,000 pounds of chlorine;\n\n Release of the entire amount as a gas in 10 minutes;\n\n     Use of the one-hour average ERPG-2 as the toxic endpoint;\n\n     Consideration of the population residing within a full circle with radius corresponding to\nthe toxic endpoint distance; and\n\n     EPA mandated meteorological conditions, specifically an F atmospheric stability class,\nwind speed of 1.5 m/sec, and air temperature of 77:F.\n\nAtmospheric dispersion modeling for the Worst Case Release scenario resulted in a chlorine toxic\nendpoint distance of 1.3 miles and an estimated residential population potentially affected of\n6,352.
