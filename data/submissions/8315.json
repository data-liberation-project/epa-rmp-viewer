Storage tanks containing flammable or toxic liquids are provided with nitrogen blankets to remove oxygen, vent controls to avoid over or under pressurization, and safety devices to protect the tank from failure.  Structural integrity of vessels, piping systems and tanks is determined by the presence or absence of visible leaks during visual inspections each shift as well as from scheduled non destructive thickness testing at recommended intervals.\nBoth acetaldehyde and vinyl acetate systems and all associated manufacturing processes are covered under the OSHA Process Safety Management rule.  As 'covered' chemicals, their use is evaluated for safety from loading and storage to final processing.  Hazard studies have been performed for all equipment, procedures, and monitoring systems related to the handling of these chemicals.  3V's Process Safety Management program is fully implemented to prevent releases of these substances by incorporating the following features: 1) hazard identification,  2) protective measures, 3) procedures written to emphasize correct handling and operation, 4) control systems, 5) periodic equipment inspection and maintenance, and 6) training of all personnel associated with hazardous processes.  \n\nThe storage systems for acetaldehyde and vinyl acetate are designed to meet NFPA requirements for flammable liquids.  These guidelines assure that the tanks will not over-pressurize under emergency conditions. Some of the specific methods that we use for accident prevention include the following:\n* Inerting - oxygen is purged from tanks, pipes, and process equipment with nitrogen to eliminate the potential for a flammable atmosphere.  Under inert conditions, flammable vapors cannot ignite.\n* Grounding - storage and process systems are grounded and tested to prevent static discharges, which are a potential ignition source.\n*"

This is a testament to our ability to safely handle these materials without risk to offsite populations.\n\nThe Emergency Response Program\n3V Inc. (3V) has a complete Emergency Response Plan (Plan). The purpose of the Plan is to minimize hazards to human health or the environment from fires, explosions, or any unplanned release of hazardous materials to the air, soil, or surface water.  The plan is organized into two sections consisting of general information about the 3V facility, preparedness and prevention, training requirements, how the emergency organization is established, coordinating with outside agencies and implementation of the plan in an emergency situation.  The second section is the working document containing specific information needed in an emergency such as telephone numbers of emergency response personnel and off-site responders, notification and emergency procedures, and lists and locations of safety and emergency equipment.  \n3V's Emergency Response Plan is provided to and reviewed with local emergency response agencies and it is included in the Georgetown County Emergency Response Plan.  In addition, 3V has provided to the LEPC and the local fire department information on the facility's hazardous chemical inventory.  In March 1998, 3V of"

In addition, employees who may become involved with a hazardous material release are trained on how to recognize hazardous materials and/or hazardous situations for purposes of taking defensive measures (alarm, containment, control, and evacuation).  \n\nDrill exercises are planned and scheduled for training of emergency response personnel as necessary to keep these personnel current in their training and proficient in procedures and equipment use.  \nGeorgetown County is a member of an independent, local, community alert network and 3V Inc. is a participant in that effort.  In the unlikely event a hazardous material release were to occur, potentially affected citizens would be notified by means of telephone communications and instructed on what steps to take to protect themselves."

      "SummaryText": "products.  Measured quantities of raw materials are pumped from storage tanks to a reaction vessel via a closed piping system.  Various additives and solid materials are sometimes loaded into the reactors via portals or dump chutes.  The mixture is then reacted by manipulation of temperatures and pressures in the reaction vessel.  The resulting mixture is then transferred to downstream equipment where mechanical operations such as filtering, drying, and packaging are performed.  Any unreacted material is then recovered for reuse or treated and removed.  In general, the storage, transfer, and reaction steps are the most critical in terms of safety.  The majority of our final products are non-hazardous.\n\nTwo of 3V's stored raw materials that receive particular emphasis on safe handling are acetaldehyde and vinyl acetate. Both materials are stored and processed in closed systems with protective alarms and features.  Through careful planning and controls, acetaldehyde has been handled safely for over 3 years.  The vinyl acetate system has been safely handled for over 19 years.\n\nWorst case and alternate release scenarios:\nThe worst case release scenario's for vinyl acetate were considered from the storage tank which contains the largest on site inventory of the substance and from the process vessel which contains a much smaller inventory but at elevated temperature. The storage tank is located outside in a concrete containment structure and the process vessel is located inside a process building.  EPA's model, RMPComp, was used to evaluate the distances to the toxic end points.  A release of the charge to the process vessel resulted in the larger distance to endpoint of the two worst cases evaluated and therefore that scenario was reported.  In either case, even though the endpoints are located beyond the facility boundary, there are no offsite receptors (houses, churches, schools, etc.) located within that distance.  In fact the closest house is more than twice the dis"

Again, RMPComp was used to evaluate the distance to the end point which resulted in an area without any offsite receptors. \nThe worst case release scenario for acetaldehyde was the loss of the maximum inventory in an external storage tank accompanied by a vapor cloud explosion.  Again, the end points of such an event extend beyond the facility boundary but do not reach any receptors. The closest house is more than five times the distance from the facility as the worst case end point.  The alternate release scenario for this material is a release from the same vessel, but assumes that the tank is half full and the failure of the tank is through a 3-inch opening.  In this case the distance to an end point is within the facility boundary. \nAccidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-specific Prevention Steps:\nAll waste management, raw materials and finished products operations are performed with the necessary precautions to prevent accidental ignition or reaction of flammable or reactive materials.  Smoking is prohibited throughout the facility except in limited designated areas.  Hot work must be conducted by permit only and not in the presence of combustible materials.  Process equipment and storage tanks containing flammable liquids are grounded and inerted with nitrogen and equipped with flame arrestors.  Oxidizers and organic peroxides are segregated from combustible and flammable liquids.  Signs are posted at the entrance to the facility prohibiting smoking, matches or open flames.  Facility personnel inspect process vessels, pumps and piping systems routinely for leaks. Temperatures, pressures and levels are monitored at appropriate intervals on tanks and process equipment.
