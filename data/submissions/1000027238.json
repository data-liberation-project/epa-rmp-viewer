Circulating the chilled fluid through the pipes cools the groundwater immediately surrounding the pipes until an underground ice barrier forms around the circumference of the target area.  Water is then pumped out of the isolated zone while groundwater flows around the outside of the freeze wall.  Freeze walls have long been used in the building of tunnels, building foundations and in mining.\r\n\r\nThe FWT cooling package is comprised of two main processes, the refrigeration units and the aqua ammonia circulation system.  Three independent modular refrigeration units each utilize a two-stage cascade refrigeration system to chill aqueous ammonia.  The refrigerants used in this process are anhydrous ammonia (NH3) and carbon dioxide (CO2).  \r\n\r\nThe aqueous ammonia circulation system is a closed loop piping system in which pumps circulate <30% aqueous ammonia from a Surge Tank, through chillers located in the refrigeration modules, though surface circulation piping, through a pattern of  freeze holes, designed to freeze underground water.  The aqua ammonia then returns to the Surge Tank via circulation piping on the surface.\r\n\r\nFWT's RMP regulated substances, and approximate quantities maintained onsite are:\r\n\r\nAnhydrous Ammonia:  12,000 lb\r\nAqueous Ammonia:  1,220,000 lb\r\n\r\n \r\n2.0 Accidental Release Prevention Policies and Procedures\r\n\r\n2.1 Regulatory Requirements\r\nThe inventory of anhydrous ammonia at the FWT site makes the process subject to the OSHA 1910.119 Process S"
