Circulating the chilled fluid through the pipes cools the groundwater immediately surrounding the pipes until an underground ice barrier forms around the circumference of the target area.  Water is then pumped out of the isolated zone while groundwater flows around the outside of the freeze wall.  Freeze walls have long been used in the building of tunnels, building foundations and in mining.\n\n\n\nThe FWT cooling package is comprised of two main processes, the refrigeration units and the aqua ammonia circulation system.  Three independent modular refrigeration units each utilize a two-stage cascade refrigeration system to chill aqueous ammonia.  The refrigerants used in this process are anhydrous ammonia (NH3) and carbon dioxide (CO2).  \n\n\n\nThe aqueous ammonia circulation system is a closed loop piping system in which pumps circulate <30% aqueous ammonia from a Surge Tank, through chillers located in the refrigeration modules, though surface circulation piping, through a pattern of  freeze holes, designed to freeze underground water.  The aqua ammonia then returns to the Surge Tank via circulation piping on the surface.\n\n\n\nFWT's RMP regulated substances, and approximate quantities maintained onsite are:\n\n\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia:  12,000 lb\n\nAqueous Ammonia:  1,220,000 lb\n\n\n\n \n\n2.0 Accidental Release Prevention Policies and Procedures\n\n\n\n2.1 Regulatory Requirements\n\nThe inventory of anhydrous ammonia at the FWT site makes the process subject to the OSHA 1910.119 Process S"

      "SummaryText": "afety Management (PSM) standard.  The requirements of this regulation are focused on preventing major incidents involving hazardous chemicals, such as anhydrous ammonia.  Per PSM requirements, the FWT has implemented (and is regularly audited on) policies and procedures in the following elements:\n\n\n\n1.    Process Safety Information\n\n2.    Process Hazard Analysis\n\n3.    Operating Procedures\n\n4.    Employee Participation\n\n5.    Training\n\n6.    Contractors\n\n7.    Pre-Startup Safety Review\n\n8.    Mechanical Integrity\n\n9.

Trade Secrets\n\n\n\n2.2 Industry Practices, Codes, and Standards\n\nThe design and operation of the FWT's refrigeration units comply with the American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers industry standard ASHRAE 15-2004, \"Safety Standard for Refrigeration Systems\".  This standard is the result of over 80 years of learning and innovation in the refrigeration industry.\n\n\n\nASHRAE-15 sets forth requirements and guidance regarding refrigerant selection and quantity, materials of construction, design parameters, relief systems, safety testing, etc.\n\n\n\nWhere applicable, Shell has applied other industry standards and best practices from such organizations as the American Petroleum Institute, National Fire Protection Association, American Society of Mechanical Engineers, American National Standards Institute, Instrument Society of America, etc.\n\n\n\n2.3 Company Policies\n\nShell's commitment to the safety is expressed at the highest level by Shell's Golden Rules:\n\n\n\n1.    Comply with the law, standards and procedures\n\n2.    Intervene on unsafe or non-compliant actions\n\n3.    Respect our neighbors\n\n\n\nThe Rules provide a framework for how Shell's employees and contractors must behave all the time, in every operation and activity. Shell has implemented a series of requirements based on incident frequency and consequence called the \"Life Saving "

The rules deal with several activities of specifically relevant to safe operations:\n\n\n\n1.    Work with a valid work permit when required\n\n2.    Conduct gas tests when required\n\n3.    Verify isolation before work begins and use the specified life protecting equipment\n\n4.    Obtain authorization before entering a confined space\n\n5.    Obtain authorization before overriding or disabling safety critical equipment\n\n6.    Protect yourself against a fall when working at height\n\n7.    Do not walk under a suspended load\n\n8.    Do not smoke outside designated smoking areas\n\n9.    No alcohol or drugs while working or driving\n\n10.    While driving, do not use your phone and do not exceed speed limits\n\n11.    Wear your seat belt\n\n12.    Follow prescribed Journey Management Plan\n\n\n\nNumerous more focused Shell safety requirements have also been applied in the design, construction, and operation of the FWT, including (but not limited to):\n\n\n\n-    Shell EP Safe Practices Manual for Onshore Producing Operations\n\n-    Shell EP Americas Health, Safety, and Environmental (HSE) Management System \n\n-    SURE Colorado Operations HSE Case\n\n-    Contractor HSE Management Program\n\n-    Hazards and Effects Management Process\n\n-    Engineering Guidelines and General Specifications.\n\n\n\n3.0 Emergency Response Program\n\nThe SURE Colorado Operations Emergency Response Plan defines appropriate mitigation and recovery measures in the event of a variety of types of incidents.  Elements of this general plan include:\n\n\n\n-    Initial Response/Action\n\n-    Notification and Reporting\n\n-    Emergency Contacts and Resources\n\n-    Emergency Roles and Responsibilities\n\n-    Location of Safety Equipment\n\n-    Emergency Situations\n\n-    Emergency Evacuation and Muster Location Maps\n\n-    Media Guidelines\n\n\n\nA section of the Emergency Response Plan specific to FWT is the Ammonia Release Plan, which details the hazards, safety systems, and respo"
