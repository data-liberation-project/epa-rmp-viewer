The facility is a food distribution warehouse that contains both dry grocery and refrigerated areas for perishable items. The refrigerated areas of the warehouse are cooled by an anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system. The properties of ammonia make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions while operating the refrigeration system to prevent employee exposure, and to reduce the threat of exposure to nearby members of the community.\n\nAWG has chosen to follow the EPA's Chemical Accident Prevention Rule, Program Level 3, to prevent a release of ammonia from the refrigeration system. The amount of ammonia estimated to be contained inside the refrigeration system is 16,161 pounds.\n\nAWG complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule, and applicable state codes and regulations to prevent a catastrophic release of ammonia. The ammonia refrigeration system has been constructed according to the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration guidelines (IIAR). The system is maintained by trained operators and process controls are checked and inspected frequently to ensure proper operation. Refrigeration operators are required to complete a training and certification program to operate the ammonia refrigeration system. Other employees receive overview training related to the ammonia system and emergency evacuation instructions.\n\nA Chemical Accident Prevention Program has been developed to help prevent an accidental release. An offsite consequence analysis was completed using a computer model to simulate a release of ammonia from the refrigeration system.\n\nAWG has an Emergency Response Plan to respond to emergencies. The plan was developed in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.120 HAZWOPER Emergency Response Plan. The plan requires employees to evacuate to designated grouping areas in the event of a fire, ammonia release, and other emergency incident. Emergency agencies will be "

Maintenance employees will be available as a resource during an ammonia release emergency.\n\nThis location has not experienced an ammonia release in the last 5 years from the refrigeration system. The last release event occurred in January 2002, which caused no onsite or offsite impacts.\n\nThe potential failures of the refrigeration system, and the safeguards to prevent a catastrophic release of ammonia have been evaluated. An updated Process Hazard Analysis was completed on the refrigeration system on May 3, 2010. Planned changes to improve safety resulting from this analysis are documented in the Process Hazard Analysis report in the Accidental Chemical Release Prevention Program. Also, the guidelines from the IIAR will be followed where applicable, to manage the refrigeration system."
