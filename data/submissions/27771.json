The plant has procedures in place, including both onsite activities and coordination with offsite responders, that must be followed in the event of an HF release.  All personnel involved with handling HF are trained with regard to safety and accident prevention.\n\n?68.155(b) Stationary Source and Substance Handled\n\nThe stationary source subject to 40 CFR Part 68 is the  Toshiba Display Devices plant.  TDD uses diluted HF solutions in their manufacturing process for color picture tubes.  Diluted HF solutions are used in the Black Stripe, Screening, Filming, Aluminizing (BSFA) area, the Funnel Finish, Frit Seal area, and the Salvage Department.  Normally, approximately 8 55-gallon drums of 70% HF are stored in the plant's indoor hazardous materials storage area.  The drum storage area is bermed and has a catch basin at the entrance. The maximum capacity that the plant can store is 32 55-gallon drums. HF is delivered to the plant by truck in 55-gallon plastic drums at a concentration of 70%.  Drums arrive shrink-wrapped together on a pallet, with 4 drums to a pallet.   The delivery truck backs up to the loading dock and containers are unloaded from the truck via forklift.

The nature of the emergency is communicated to the response staff via the facility-wide alarm system.\n\n?68.155(c) Offsite Consequence Analysis\n\nAs a Program 3 Process with one toxic liquid, one worst case release scenario and one alternative release scenario will be addressed for the facility.  The Toshiba Display Devices Plant has chosen to use the US EPA Risk Management Program Guidance for Off-Site Consequence Analysis (40 CFR Part 68), US EPA 550-B-99-009, April 1999, and the RMP*CompTM computer model as a guide to determine off-site consequences.  \n\nThe worst-case release scenario is determined in accordance with the requirements provided in 40 CFR 68.22 and 40 CFR 68.25 (b,c).  For the TDD Plant the worst-case release would result when a 55-gallon drum of 70% HF (greatest amount held in a single vessel) ruptures and its contents escape to the air in 10 minutes.  This results in offsite impacts.  The facility is also required to complete one alternative release scenario that reaches an endpoint offsite.  The alternative release scenario was evaluated in accordance with the guidelines provided in 40 CFR 68.22 and 40 CFR 68.28.  The Process Hazard Analysis team identified an alternative release scenario that results in offsite impacts.  The alternative scenario is a flashing liquid release of HF through a 1/4 inch opening in a drum caused by a forklift puncturing a drum during unloading . \n\n?68.155(d)  Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe Toshiba Display Devices Plant has documented release prevention measures.  These prevention measures include elements such as Process Hazard Analysis, Standard Operating Procedures, Training, Maintenance, Incident Investigation, and Compliance Audits.  \n\nAs mentioned previously, the facility maintains a fully trained staff on call 24 hours per day to respond to hazardous material releases or medical emergencies.

The plan outlines actions required to respond to a chemical release.\n\n?68.155(g)  Safety Improvements\n\nRecommendations for safety improvements were identified in the Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) which was completed per OSHA 29 CFR 1910.119(e) initially in May 1999 and was updated in October 2002.  Recommended improvements were identified in four main categories: Standard Operating Procedures, Maintenance, Training, and Administrative.  Safety improvements will be investigated concerning their impacts on other systems and/or procedures prior to implementation.  Additional recommendations may be made upon review of any accidents and/or when the PHA is updated every five years."
