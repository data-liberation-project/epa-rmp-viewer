Note that the Toxics Worst Case Scenario remains unchanged and an additional alternative release scenario was included for ammonia.\r\n\r\n1.0\tThe Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\r\n\r\nThe ANGUS Chemical Company (ANGUS) owns and operates an organic chemical manufacturing facility (NAICS 325199) at the Town of Sterlington, Louisiana.  ANGUS is located in the northeast corner of Ouachita Parish, near the Town of Sterlington, off of Louisiana Highway 2 on the east bank of the Ouachita River.  Sterlington is a small community of approximately 2,550 inhabitants within the city limits.\r\n\r\nThe ANGUS facility operates 24 hours per day, seven days per week, and it employs approximately 165 full-time employees.  It consists of six separate operating units: a nitroparaffins unit, a nitric acid unit, a nitroparaffins derivatives unit, a crystallization unit, an isopropyl hydroxylamine (IHPA) unit and a hydrogen generation unit.  It also includes a shipping facility that supports the process unit's needs regarding both incoming raw materials and outgoing products.  There is also a pilot plant that provides research and development support to the manufacturing units.\r\n\r\nANGUS is subject to OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations at 29 CFR 1910.119.  Thus, the required Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) of covered processes has been performed and revalidated in compliance with the applicable regulations. \r\n\r\nANGUS is also subject to the US EPA's chemical accident prevention regulations at 40 CFR Part 68, by virtue of storing, processing and/or handling on site chemical substances, above their threshold quantities, as listed at"

ANGUS also manufactures a detonable material, nitromethane.  Although not listed as a regulated substance, ANGUS has chosen to report Nitromethane under the General Duty Clause.  This material, and the unit where it is produced, is also managed under the PSM program.\r\n\r\n2.0\tAccidental Chemical Release Prevention and emergency Response Policies\r\n\r\nThe ANGUS Chemical Company is strongly committed to maintaining high standards of employee, public, and environmental safety and protection.  The prevention of accidental chemical releases is an integral and important part of the ANGUS policies, and it has established a comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers such areas as process design, system installations, operating procedures, maintenance practices, and employee training, as they apply to each one of its operating units and support facilities at the Sterlington location.  \r\n\r\nANGUS ensures the safety of plant operations through the use of process safety management (PSM) techniques, including but not limited to:\r\n\r\n* Periodic process hazard analyses (PHA's) of production, utilities, and shipping operations; \r\n* Strict adherence to Management of Change procedures; \r\n* Strict enforcement of the written standard operating procedures (SOP's); \r\n* Comprehensive and periodic (refresher) training of plant personnel. \r\n* Mechanical integrity programs utilizing predictive and preventive maintenance principles. \r\n* A comprehensive mandatory contractor safety program for contractors. \r\n* An active employee participation program. \r\n* Incidents, including near-misses, are investigated to determine root cause and contributing factors.\r\n\r\n3.0\tEmergency Response Strategy\r\n\r\nANGUS takes a proactive approach toward the prevention of incidents, including accidental chemical releases.

      "SummaryText": "of this approach, ANGUS has developed and implemented a detailed emergency response plan (ERP) that makes it possible to generate a rational, practical, and timely response if an incident does occur.   ANGUS believes that a quick and appropriate response is an important element in the mitigation and minimization of any potential adverse effects on the facility, its personnel, and the local community.\r\n\r\nOther elements in ANGUS' strategy for managing and mitigating emergencies include:\r\n\r\n* The incorporation of emergency response actions into the facility's standard operating procedures. \r\n* The procurement of necessary personal protective equipment (PPE) and emergency response equipment and supplies.\r\n* The development and implementation of an Incident Command System to assure a quick and rational response to emergencies.   \r\n* Ensuring that operating personnel have been thoroughly educated and trained in the appropriate mitigating, corrective, and response actions that must be taken in the event of an accidental release.  \r\n\r\nThe facility's contingency capabilities and incident preparedness are tested at least four times per year to verify the operational readiness of personnel to respond to plant emergencies.\r\n\r\n4.0\tOffsite Consequence Analysis (OCA)\r\n\r\nIn compliance with the requirements of 40 CFR 68.165, an Offsite Consequence Analysis (OCA) was performed for each of the regulated substances present on site to assess the potential consequences of hypothetical major chemical releases.  Worst Release Cases and Alternative Release Cases (WRC and ARC, respectively), as defined in the regulations, were developed for each of the covered toxic and flammable substances, plus the detonable substance. The WRC's showing the largest potential offsite effects were selected (one toxic, one flammable, and one detonable) for entry into the RMP submittal document.

These are briefly mentioned below.\r\n\r\n4.1\tWorst Case Scenarios (WCS's)\r\n\r\nWorst-case scenarios were developed, modeled, and evaluated to identify the one with the greatest distance to the end point for the hypothetical release of one toxic (sulfur dioxide), one flammable (propane) and one detonable (nitromethane) substance.  The results of the toxic and flammable scenarios are outlined within the body of the RPM submittal.  The WCS for nitromethane is maintained in the ANGUS files.\r\n\r\n4.2\tAlternative Release Scenarios (ARS's)\r\n\r\nSimilarly, alternative release scenarios were developed, modeled, and evaluated for each of the toxics (sulfur dioxide, ammonia, and formaldehyde) and one flammable (propane), as called for in the regulation.
