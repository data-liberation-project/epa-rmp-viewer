This includes a 5yr Mechanical Integrity audit performed by a third party to ensure the integrity of the refrigeration system.\n\u2022\tAny modifications to the ammonia system will be carefully evaluated and engineered to confirm the changes made will maintain a safe working system. Prior to startup of any new or modified system, Agropur will conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the changes and modify RMP to incorporate the new or modified system.\n\u2022\tEmployees at Agropur have been part of the development of the RMP and will have a role in the continuous improvement of the program.\n\u2022\tAny incident, accident or near miss associated with the ammonia system will be investigated thoroughly and promptly with a commitment to make improvements to the RMP.\n\u2022\tAs part of the continuous improvement process, Agropur will conduct audits at least once every three (3) years to identify and correct any parts of the RMP that are not functioning up to their standards. These audits are in addition to the continuous improvement process.\n\u2022\tAgropur will qualify all contractors who work on or adjacent to the refrigeration system.  This is to ensure the contractor is qualified both in employee safety and work integrity.  Agropur will ensure its contractors onsite are aware of the hazards associated with the ammonia system to protect all parties (contractors, employees, neighbors). For specific tasks that require an even higher degree of oversight (such as welding, cutting or grinding around the ammonia system components), Agropur will require its employees and contractors to obtain internal permits for hot work that mandate special prevention measures.\n\u2022\tAgropur has developed and implemented an EAP to protect public health, the environment and onsite employees and contractors. Employees have been trained on the aspects of the facility's Emergency Action Plan.\n\u2022\tSystems which are in place to inform the National Response Center, the Local Emergency Planning Committee, and other State Agencies"

      "SummaryText": "The Agropur facility produces cheeses from milk purchased from local farmers.  The storage and processing of milk into cheeses requires the use of Anhydrous Ammonia to provide cooling for various phases of production.  Milk arriving at the facility for processing, as well as cheeses produced must be cooled to maintain quality and product safety.  As a result of this need, the total ammonia charge is over the 10,000-pound threshold and therefore subject to both Process Safety Management PSM and Risk Management Plan RMP requirements.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia while a necessary component of the cheese making industry, poses a threat to employees, contractors, and the public in the event of an uncontrolled release in a significant quantity.  Agropur has recognized the inherent risks involved with the use of anhydrous ammonia and has developed and implemented both a PSM system to protect the onsite employees and a RMP to protect employees, contractors, the public, and the environment in the event of a release.\n\nAgropur's prevention program for ammonia consists of the following elements.\n\u2022\tSafety information for ammonia has been gathered and evaluated to assist Agropur employees in understanding the hazards associated with the process. This information formed a basis for other prevention program elements to minimize the potential for accidental releases.\n\u2022\tA process hazard assessment (PHA) was completed. The purpose of the evaluation was to identify, evaluate and control the hazards of the process.\n\u2022\tWritten standard operating procedures (SOPs) were developed so employees and contractors have access to written instructions for the safe operation and maintenance of the ammonia process.\n\u2022\tEmployees at Agropur have been trained, and will continue to be trained, on the job and in the classroom, on aspects of the prevention program and the emergency action plan (EAP).\n\u2022\tA preventive maintenance system has been developed to assure components of the ammonia system are in good working"
