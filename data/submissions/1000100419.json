The Buckeye CO2 plant Incident Commander is responsible for coordinating the initial emergency actions. A specific Emergency Response Plan for the facility is in place and that plan has been coordinated with local officials. The Emergency Response Program provides the essential planning for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.\r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\r\n\r\nContinued compliance with the RMP Prevention Program, coupled with the Environmental Health and Safety Management Systems, forms the framework for continuous safety improvement. Some of the key components of the safety program are:\r\n- The Management of Change provisions ensure that the potential safety and health impacts of any change made to process chemicals, technology, equipment, or procedures are considered.\r\n\r\n- The Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) provisions serve as a tool to ensure timely evaluation of potential hazards, thereby leading to continual improvements in safety standards.\r\n\r\n- The Mechanical Integrity provisions ensure that process equipment and instrumentation are designed, constructed, installed, and maintained to minimize the risk of hazardous releases, thereby serving as an integral part of the safety program."

These high standards include:\r\n\r\n- Operating in compliance with required environmental permits and regulations.\r\n\r\n- Operating and maintaining the assets in such a manner that unintentional releases are minimized.\r\n\r\n- Operating and maintaining assets in such a manner that the small releases associated with normal operation and maintenance will be minimized to the extent possible.\r\n\r\n- Correcting non-compliance found by regular audits of the facility.\r\n\r\nPrevention Program\r\n\r\nThe Buckeye CO2 plant is operating under the guidelines of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Program. Part of the RMP/PSM Prevention Program involves identifying and taking steps to avoid potential accidental chemical releases. A few examples of the prevention features implemented at this facility include:\r\n\r\n- Providing overpressure relief valves on all pressurized vessels. Additionally, level transmitters and alarms are present on all vessels to prevent overfilling.\r\n\r\n- Testing of vessels and preventive maintenance through the Mechanical Integrity program helps to ensure that structural failures do not occur in process equipment.\r\n\r\n- Minimizing the possibility of an interruption in the combustion of hydrocarbon vapors by having a vapor recovery unit and a pilot-lit flare for emergencies.\r\n\r\n- Installing hydrocarbon gas detectors throughout the facility.\r\n\r\n- Minimizing the possibility of fire by providing a fire water system throughout the process areas.\r\n\r\n- Minimizing the possibility of emergencies by manning the facility continuously.\r\n\r\n- Providing an evacuation alarm system to safely evacuate the facility during emergency situations.\r\n\r\nFive-Year Accident History\r\n\r\nThis Facility had no qualifying incidents within the last 5 years.\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program\r\n\r\nThe Buckeye CO2 plant utilizes the Incident Command System (ICS) to conduct emergency response actions.

(MSP) is committed to managing all operations in a manner that protects the environment and the health and safety of employees, customers, contractors and the public while fully complying with applicable laws and regulations. MSP management goals are achieved through the implementation of the Environmental Health and Safety Management Systems, by the personal commitments of employees and contractors, and by open communication with employees, customers, neighbors, and regulators.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this Risk Management Plan is to provide information about operations at the facility, programs to prevent accidental chemical releases. emergency response plans in the event an accidental release should occur, the five-year accident history of the facility and planned changes to improve safety at the facility.\r\n\r\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances\r\n\r\nThe Buckeye CO2 Plant, located at 40 Texas Camp Road in Lovington, New Mexico, operates a variety of units to extract Natural Gas Liquids (NGLs) from nearby production wells. The boundaries of the stationary source are defined by the external fence surrounding the facility. NGL is a flammable liquid that is stored under pressure and is composed of propane, isobutane, normal butane, isopentane and normal pentane which are regulated flammable hydrocarbons. Refrigerant grade propane is used at the stationary source to provide refrigeration for extracting condensates for the natural gas feed product. Natural Gas processed at the facility contains carbon dioxide (CO2) and the regulated flammable hydrocarbons methane and ethane. H2S is also present in the inlet gas but at concentrations below 1 %.\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n\r\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response programs in place at the facility"
