If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local Fire company, or other authorities, to mitigate the relase and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2.  Facility Information\n\nThe primary activity at this facility is the storage of anhydrous ammonia for resale to farmers for direct application to their fields.\n\nThe maximum quanity stored would be 113,091 pounds of anhydrous ammonia stored in one 12,000 gallon tank and one 12,200 gallon tank.\n\n3.  The worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 57,013 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85 percent capzcity as limite by design standards.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is .79 miles.\n\nThe alternative release scenario based on the most likely potential incident is a relase from a break in a pipe.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is .41 miles.\n\n4.  The accidental release prevention program\n\nThe facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Stroage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\"  of the American National Standards Institute, Inc.  We are also guided by the provisions of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia.\"\n\n5.  The Five-year Accident History\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility, nor to our knowledge, have resulted in offsit deaths, injuries, and evacuations, shelter"

The emergency response program\n\nThis facility has a written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.38 and has provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARE Title III (EPCRA).\n\n7.  Planned changes to improve safety.\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at this facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time, but additional upgrades of the safety equipment are planned in the near future."
