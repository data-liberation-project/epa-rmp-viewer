FACILITY ACCIDENTIAL RELEASE AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICY.\n\n      THE MANAGEMENT AND EMPLOYEES OF TWIN COUNTY SERVICE COMPANY ARE COMMITTED TO \n      THE PREVENTION OF ANY ACCIDENTIAL RELEASES OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA.  IF AN ACCIDENTIAL\n      RELEASE SHOULD OCCUR, THE FACILITY IS PREPARED TO WORK WITH THE LOCAL FIRE DEPT.,\n      OR OTHER AUTHORITIES, TO MITIGATE ANY RELEASE AND MINIMIZE THE IMPACT OF THE RELEASE \n      TO PEOPLE AND THE ENVIRONMWENT.\n\n2.   THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED.\n\n      THE PRIMARY ACTIVITY AT THE FACILITY,  WICH IS LOCATED AT 1763 STATE HIGHWAY 14   MULKEYTOWN, IL,  IS THE STORAGE AND BLENDING OF FERTILIZERS FOR SALE TO FARMERS.  ANHYDROUS AMMONIA IS RECEIVED, STORED, AND DISTRIBUTED FOR DIRECTAPPLICATION AS A CROP PRODUCTION NUTRIENT.  THE STORAGE AND HANDLING SYSTEM CONSIST OF 2 STORAGE TANKS (44,000 GALLONS), LOADING RISERS, ASSOCIATED PLUMBING AND NURSE TANKS.  ACCESS TO THE SITE IS RESTRICTED TO AUTHORIZED FACILITY EMPLOYEES, AUTHORIZED MANAGEMENT PERSONNEL AND AUTHORIZED CONTRACTORS.\n\n       THE MAXIMUM QUANTITY OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA THAT CAN BE STORED WOULD BE 292,000\n       POUNDS, THIS INCLUDES ANHYDROUS AMMONIA  THAT COULD BE STORED IN NURSE TANKS. \n\n3.   THE WORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO AND THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO.\n\n      THE WORSE-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO WOULD BE THE RELEASE OF THE TOTAL CONTENTS OF A\n      STORAGE TANK RELEASED AS A GAS OVER 10 MINUTES.  THE MAXIMUM QUANTITY RELEASED \n      WOULD BE 120,000 POUNDS, WHICH REPRESENTS THE VOLUME OF THE LARGEST STORAGE TANK\n      AS LIMITED BY DESIGN STANDARDS.\n\n      THE DISTANCE TO THE ENDPOINT OF .14 MG/L FOR THE WORST-CASE SCENARIO IS 2.3 MILES.\n\n      THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO  BASED ON THE MOST LIKELY POTENTIAL INCIDENT IS A\n      RELEASE FROM A BREAK IN A TRANSFER HOSE.

EMERGENCY SERVICES WERE CALLED OUT\n      VAPORS WERE EVAPORATING OFF OF THE SEMI-TRANSPORT BLEED OFF. THE PROBLEM WAS \n      QUICKLY RESOLVED WITH A PLUG.\n\n6.
