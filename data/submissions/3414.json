The  Offsite Consequence Analysis- Alternative Scenario for the Seneca Cold Storage is based on potential damage done to the High Pressure Condensate Return Line resulting from the impact of a truck or other vehicle striking the supports.  A rupture to the Return Line would have an offsite impact.\n     The Process Hazard Analysis(PHA) which was performed in 1996 for the 86' System listed potential for a line rupture from a striking of the Evaporative Condenser supports by a truck as:\n\n                         a.

The four factors used in determining the endpoint distance were:\n\n                                                      Quantity of Ammonia=  7,174 lbs.\n                                                                 Release Rate =  2,100 lb./min.\n                                                                  Hole Diameter=  1\n                                                                 Line Pressure=  180 psig.\n\nThe result of Exhibit 4-6 showed a potential toxic endpoint distance in an Urban Setting of .3 miles from the Seneca Cold Storage 86' Engine Room.\n\n\nTRAINING:\n\n     Gartner Refrigeration presents 16 hours of Ammonia Refrigeration Training every three years for maintenance and supervisory personnel.

The Risk Management Program rule states: The worst-case release quantity shall be the greatest amount held in a vessel, taking into account administrative controls that limit the maximum quantity.  The Low Temperature Recirculator(LTR) located inside of the 95' Engine Room is the largest ammonia storage vessel at the Cold Storage Facility and is large enough to store the entire 11,128 lb. charge of ammonia used in the 95' system.  It is possible that a large quantity of liquid ammonia could be stored in the vessel while performing maintenance on another part of the system.  It is also possible, but extremely improbable(-due to level controls and safeties), that all 11,128 lbs. could migrate to the LTR during operation.  The Offsite Consequence Analysis- Worst Case Scenario for the Seneca Cold Storage Facility is based on a rupture to the LTR while it contains 11,128 lbs. of ammonia.  Rupturing of a vessel can result from impact with a lift truck, thermal shock, or tank fatigue.  The rupture of the LTR would have an offsite impact.\n     The Process Hazard Analysis(PHA) which was performed for the 95' system in 1996 listed a rupture to the LTR as:\n                         a.

      "SummaryText": "Seneca Foods Corp.- Cold Storage, Rochester,  MN\n\nINTRODUCTION:\n\n     The Cold Storage Facility stores, packages, and distributes a variety of frozen vegetables.  The facility\noperates two shifts, 5-6 days per week, year round.  Much of the product used at the facility is produced\nat the Seneca Foods Corp.-Process Facility located at 1217 3rd Ave. SE, Rochester,  MN(approximately 8\nblocks north of the Cold Storage Facility).\n     Two ammonia refrigeration systems are used at the Cold Storage Facility- ammonia is a regulated sub-\nstance per 40CFR Part 68 Environmental Protection Agency(Appendix A).  The 1986 constructed system\ncontains 7,174 lbs. of ammonia, and the 1995 constructed system contains 11,128 lbs. of ammonia--total\nbetween the two systems is 18,302 lbs.  The threshold reporting quantity for anhydrous ammonia is 10,000\nlbs., thus Seneca's Cold Storage Facility is required to comply with the EPA's Risk Management Plan(RMP)\nrequirements.  The 86' Engine Room and the 95' Engine Room are separated by approximately 150 yards.\nThere is no mingling of ammonia between the two systems, each system supplies ammonia to specific pieces of refrigeration equipment.  The 18,302 lb. total charge of anhydrous ammonia in the two systems is used to provide refrigerant for cooling the product storage areas, Processing Room, and Loading Dock.  Seneca's Cold Storage Facility has an accidental release prevention program in place which complies with OSHA's 29 CFR 1910.119 Process Safety Management Standard.  The International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration's (IIAR) Guide to the Implementation of Process Safety Management(PSM) for Ammonia Refrigeration was used to implement the PSM program at the Cold Storage Facility.  Parts of the program include:\n                                                                                                                                                                                                      1)  Employee Participation"
