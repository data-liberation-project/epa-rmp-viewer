We\n are commited to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia.  If an emergency were to occur it is our policy to notify Papillion Fire & Rescue and request they respond to the emergency.\n     The primary purpose of this facility is storage of fertilizers for sale to the agricultural sector.  Anhydrous Ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application for sale to farmers.  Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel and authorized contractors.  The maximum intended inventory of our anhydrous ammonia tank is 80,000 pounds.\n     We used RMP Comp to determine the worst case scenario at our facility.  Failure of my largest storage tank when filled to the greatest amount would have off site consequences.  The alternate release scenario is based on the most likely incident to occur which is a break in a transfer hose.\n     The facility complies with EPA'S Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations.  The Facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonis K-61.1\", published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc. and the standards  of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\".\n     We have never had an accident involving anhydrous ammonia that caused death, injuries, property or environmental damage evacuations or shelterings in place.\n     In the event of an emergeny involving our anhydrous ammonia system, it is our policy to notify Papillion Fire & Rescue and request they respond to the energency.\n     Safety improvement is an on-going process ar the facility.
