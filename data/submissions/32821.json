These Regulations deal with the risk involved with the storage, handling, and processing of hazardous chemicals. In complying this way, we promote overall facility, employee, and public safety. Ready Crisp\u00bfs program enables our facility to prevent the occurrence of, and minimize the consequences of, significant releases of toxic substances as well as fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents. Overall, these programs are in place to prevent the potential for accidental injury, illness, death, and to avoid the potential for property and environmental damage. \r\n\r\nReady Crisp\u00bfs safety programs are applied to all activities involving hazardous chemicals including use, storage, handling, or the on-site movement of chemicals. Any group of vessels interconnected and separate vessels which are located such that a hazardous chemical could be involved in a potential release shall be considered a single process. \r\n\r\nReady Crisp\u00bfs safety programs prevent accidents because they focus on the rules, procedures, and best practices that govern processes, activities, and or pieces of equipment. These rules are detailed and revised as necessary. All information is communicated to employees of Ready Crisp through training and documentation.\r\n\r\nReady Crisp is a processing and packaging company that utilizes approximately 12,000 pounds of Anhydrous Ammonia in its refrigeration system to cool the facility\u00bfs production and shipping area\u00bfs.\r\n\r\nIn a Wo"
