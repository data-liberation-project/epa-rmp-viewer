This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, facility trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release. Other safety measures such as fire suppression, ambulatory, or evacuation of the community is coordinated and handled through local emergency response personnel in the community.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\r\n\r\nThe Fryburg Rail Terminal receives crude oil and natural gas liquids (NGLs) via truck or pipeline and transfers the products into railcars for distribution.  Crude Oil storage is located at the site but is not subject to RMP requirements because it considered a naturally occurring hydrocarbon mixture having not entered into a refining process. NGLs at the terminal arrive only via pipeline and are immediately loaded into railcars for transportation, therefore, they are transportation related and not subject to the RMP provisions.  Occasionally propane railcars may be loaded and fail a test for moisture content which requires processing to remove the water from the purity propane.  This dewatering process and associated equipment is subject to the RMP regulations. \r\n\r\nRegulated substances that are currently stored or will be stored at the dewatering process are propane and ethyl mercaptan. \r\n\r\nFor additional detail of the various processes at the Fryburg Rail Terminal see the terminal manager.\r\n\r\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION \r\n\r\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention in place for the process at the facility.

The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\r\n\r\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the facility periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operative.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.  Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.  \r\n\r\nOperating Procedures\r\n\r\nMPLX, L.P. maintains written procedures that address various modes of operations, such as: unit startup; normal operations; temporary operations; emergency shutdown; normal shutdown; emergency operations, and initial startup of a new process.  These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.  The procedures are kept current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.  The operating procedures are centrally located and accessible to all employees.\r\n\r\nTraining\r\n\r\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the Fryburg Rail Terminal has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  New employees receive basic training in facility operations unless they provide written certification that they have the required knowledge, skills and abilities to safely carry out their specific duties and responsibilities. All MPLX employees at the Fryburg Rail Terminal will be trained in PSM/RMP requirement upon hire and prior to working in PSM/RMP processes.  All operatio"

Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.  \r\n\r\nMPLX, L.P. will use one or more of the following techniques to identify hazards: what-if, checklist, what-if/checklist, hazard and operability (HAZOP), failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA), or fault tree analysis (FTA).  HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques and will be utilized for each major process change or renovation.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\r\n\r\nEach PHA will address the following:\r\na) hazards of the process,\r\nb) previous incidents with likely potential for catastrophic consequences,\r\nc) consequences of failure of engineering and administrative controls,\r\nd) engineering and administrative control applicable to the hazards and their inter-relationships,\r\ne) facility siting issues,\r\nf) human factors.\r\n\r\nThe PHA team findings are compiled in a written report and are forwarded to local and corporate management for resolution.  Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned that highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findin"

The basic aspects of mechanical integrity include: training; written procedures; inspections and tests; correcting identified deficiencies; and applying quality assurance measures.  In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process.\r\n\r\nMaintenance personnel receive training on an overview of the process, safety and health hazards, applicable maintenance procedures, emergency response plans, and applicable safe work practices to help ensure that they can perform their jobs in a safe manner.  Job plans/written procedures help ensure that work is performed in a consistent manner and provide a basis for training.  Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels).  If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service (if possible), or a management of change team will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment.\r\n\r\nAnother integral part of the mechanical integrity is quality assurance.
