              "Description": "Grade A Milk Cooler         July 25,2003\n1. Process Description:  Liquid ammonia flows from the king tank, is cooled through the high side tank and then flows through a regular or metered valve on the manifold to the Grade A Milk Cooler through labeled piping at 90-130 psi.  The Grade A Milk Cooler unit is located above the south end of the Grade A dock.\n\nThe Grade A Milk Cooler operates on a simple flood system.  The receiver tank, evaporator and column (that the float switch -- FV1 -- sits on) all fill up to the same level with liquid ammonia. When the float switch senses the ammonia level dropping, it electrically signals the solenoid valve to open, allowing more ammonia into the tank (RCVR 1).  When the level of ammonia reaches the set point, the float switch triggers the solenoid valve to shut off the flow. \n\nThe liquid ammonia in the evaporator fills coiled pipes from the bottom up.  Fans blow air over the coils causing the ammonia inside to boil.  The backpressure regulator is set to maintain about a 28?F temperature in the coil. The air comes into the coil at about 38?F and cools to about 35?F as it passes through to cool the room.\n\nThe ammonia that boils in the evaporator goes back into the receiver tank as ammonia vapor.  It is released through a backpressure regulator (BPR1).  The BPR controls the pressure in the flood system, which in turn controls the temperature in the cooler.  The backpressure regulator releases ammonia vapor into the suction line when the pressure gets to a preset level.  The vapor then returns to the compressor room.\n\nIf the BPR isn't operating correctly and pressure is building up in the receivers and evaporators, the safety-release valves (RV1) will release the excess ammonia vapor into the air outside the plant.\n\nThe ammonia carries a small amount of oil from the compressors.  This oil will collect in low spots or dead legs of the Grade A Milk Cooler system and occasionally need to be drained through the drain valve DV1.\n\nThe Grade A Milk Cooler uses a passive defrost. The liquid valve is turned off four times a day and the coil is allowed to thaw under defrost program controlled by E-drum 120 of HTMR 565.\n\n2. Equipment List:  Milk Cooler by Krack, SN# 430543-01, ID# 33001, Model # DT35-550-FLA-HGU-RH.  Other valves are listed in the valve database.\n\n3. Quantity of Ammonia and Maximum Spill:  The Grade A Milk Cooler system contains 96 pounds of ammonia.  A maximum spill of 20,000 pounds could occur if the system's entire inventory was lost.\n\n4. Head Pressure:    80-150 PSI            \n\n5. System Pressure:  40 PSI\n\n6. Exit Pressure/Vacuum:  26 PSI\n\n7. Desired process temperature: 36 to 40 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\n8. Age of system:  17 years (1983)\n\n9. Number of potentially affected employees:  20\n\n10. Could product be contaminated? Yes, products in the milk cooler could be contaminated.\n\n11. Could property be damaged?  Property damage would be minimal.\n\n12. Operating history:  Operating history for this unit has been good.\n\n13. Consequences of deviation:  Temperatures could rise and damage the product in the cooler.\n\n14. Steps to correct deviation:  See high temp. SOP.\n\n15. What tasks are performed here?  How frequently?  Temperatures are checked three times daily, oil is drained monthly and the solenoid valves are inspected annually.\n\n16. Is equipment accessible?  Yes.\n\n17. How difficult is it to understand and adjust controls?  The controls are straightforward and easy to use.\n\n18. Are signs, labels and codes clear and easy to understand?  Yes.\n\n19. What are the safety/warning systems?  Off temperatures and the odor of ammonia from a leak are the safety/warning systems in place.\n\n20. Can inventory be reduced or material substituted to make this system safer? No.\n\n21. Would functions be better performed through automatic controls or manual procedures?  The automatic controls in place work well.\n\n22. Are piping, instruments or valves redundant?  No.\n\n23. Where is the nearest drain?  Water source?  Ventilation?  A drain is in the floor, water is available on the Grade A dock or in the bottling room and doors can be opened for ventilation.\n\n24. Where are the relief lines?  Relief lines exit through the roof outside.\n\n25. Location of isolation valve: There are individual suction and liquid valves located just outside the outside door of milk cooler. As a last resort, milk cooler can be isolated at manifolds in tank room, but the isolation valves in tank room are shared with several other loads.  Power to the liquid solenoid valve comes from Y1314 of HTMR 565. \n\n26.  Interlocks?  None",

              "Description": "Starter Room Injection (STRI)Date:  6/15/00\n\n1.  Process Description:  Ammonia vapor from a separate tank is feed through a regulator (PR1) and then through three filters.  The first two filters remove any oil or water that may be in the ammonia.  The first filter uses a green filter insert, the second, a red one.  Both filters are equipped with drain valves.  The third filter is a precautionary bacterial filter, though there should be no bacteria in the ammonia vapor.\n\nAfter being filtered, the ammonia enters a box where the pressure is gauged.  This should read 35 psi.  Ammonia can be released back into the Starter Chiller Room (V3), but usually goes through V4 and V5 into a small manifold.\n\nThis manifold sends vapor ammonia to one of four starter tanks or back to the Starter Chiller Room.  The vapor is controlled by four solenoid valves.  All eight solenoid valves are controlled by the TI computer.  The other four solenoid valves release ammonia vapor into water soaked cotton if supply valve leaks or too much ammonia is injected.  This vapor is not released outside the building, but into a pipe stuffed with wetted cotton that absorbs excess ammonia gas.  These cotton pieces should be replaced when saturated.\n\nThe ammonia vapor that is used then gets periodically injected into the active starter tank.  In the tank, bacteria are processing a starter media.  The bacteria are growing, feeding on lactose and creating lactic acid.  This continues until the pH drops to 5.8.  then a small amount of ammonia is injected (pH 13.7).  This raises the pH level in the tank to 6.2 and prevents the bacteria from killing itself by creating too much acid.  The process continues until all the lactose is gone.\n\n2.  Equipment List:  Equipment is limited except for the small pressure manifold and several valves listed in the valve/equipment database.\n\n3.  Quantity of ammonia and maximum spill:  Ammonia quantity is estimated at 20 pounds and a maximum spill of 20,000 pounds (the system's entire inventory) could be lost.

              "Description": " Starter Room Chiller (STTR)Date: 6/9/00\n\n1. Process Description:  Liquid ammonia flows from the King tank, is cooled through the high side tank and then flows through a regular or a metered valve on the manifold to the Starter Room Water/Glycol Chiller at 130 psi through labeled piping.  The Starter Room Chiller must cool the water to 40?F.\n\nThe Starter Room Chiller uses a shell-and-tube heat exchanger.  Ammonia kills starter culture, so water is chilled and, in turn, cools the starter.  The water/glycol mixture is also in a closed system, continually being cooled by the chiller.  \n\nThe Starter Room Chiller works on a flood system, which means the receiver tank, the heat exchanger and the columns (that the float switches ? FV1 and FV2 ? sit on) are all filled up to the same level with liquid ammonia.  When the float switch senses that the ammonia level dropping, it electrically signals the solenoid valve to open, allowing more ammonia into the heat exchanger.  When the level of ammonia reaches the set point, the float switch triggers the solenoid valve to shut off the flow.  Ammonia should not be up to the second float switch, so if it is closed there may be a floodback.\n\nThe liquid ammonia in the heat exchanger fills the shell.  Water runs through the pipes causing the ammonia inside to boil.  This cools the water in the chiller, resulting in refrigeration.  The water/glycol should be cooled to 29-33? from about 53?F.\n\nThe ammonia boils in the heat exchanger and ammonia vapor goes back into the receiver tank.  It is released through a backpressure regulator ( BPR1).  The vapor then returns to the high side tank.  Some vapor goes to the Starter Injection system by way of V5 or V9.  The center stem of the BPR controls the pressure in the flood system, which in turn, controls the temperature of the water.  The bottom stem is turned in for automatic operation and turned out to manually open the valve.  The small regulator mounted off-center is used to adjust the pressure when the solenoid coil on the BPR is de-energized.  \n\nThe ammonia carries a small amount of oil from the compressors.  Occasionally this oil will collect in low spots or dead legs of the Starter Room  Chiller system and need to be drained through drain valves (DV1 and DV2).\n\nThe inputs and outputs for the chiller come from the HTMR 565, base 9 (located in the starter room entry area).\n    WX 774    Water temp. out            X 723        Upper level switch\n    Y 768        Liquid line solenoids        X 722        Lower level switch\n    Y 767        Back pressure regulator/low pressures\n\n2. Equipment List:  Chiller unit, manuf.=Morfab, ID#33015, RES 2532.\n\n3. Quantity of Ammonia and Maximum Spill:  Starter chiller holds 680 pounds of ammonia.  A maximum spill of 20,000 pounds would occur if the system's entire inventory were lost.\n\n4. Head Pressure:    130 PSI            5. System Pressure:  55 PSI\n\n6. Exit Pressure/Vacuum:  30 psi\n\n7. Desired process temperature:  38 degrees Farenheit\n\n8. Age of system:  Two years (1994)\n\n9. Number of potentially affected employees:  25\n\n10. Could product be contaminated?  Ammonia could contaminate water, but is not likely to contaminate product.\n\n11. Could property be damaged?  Property damage would be minimal.\n\n12. Operating history:  Previous system froze up on occasion, but the motor-driven back-pressure regulator is no longer used.  The tubes also ruptured on two occasions.  The new unit has an expansion chamber and dumps hot water to the floor instead of into the system, preventing thermal shock.\n\n13. Consequences of deviation:  If pressure within the heat exchanger drops below 45 PSI, the water can freeze in the tubes.  If this happens, or if the power or water pump fails, the TI drops out the solenoid and pressure and temperature rises to 65 PSI and 45 degrees.\n\n14. Steps to correct deviation:  Adjust the back-pressure regulator.  See high temp. SOP.\n\n15. What tasks are performed here?  How frequently? Oil is drained every two weeks.\n\n16. Is equipment  accessible?  Yes\n\n17. How difficult is it to understand and adjust controls?  The controls are very straightforward.  It takes minimal training to operate this equipment.\n\n18. Are signs, labels and codes clear and easy to understand?  All valves and switches are clearly marked with stainless tags.  All piping and equipment is clearly delineated.\n\n19. What are the safety/warning systems? \n\n20. Can inventory be reduced or material substituted to make this system safer?  No\n\n21. Would functions be better performed through automatic controls or manual procedures? The automatic controls in place work well.\n\n22. Are piping, instruments or valves redundant?  No\n\n23. Where is the nearest drain?  Water source?  Ventilation?  Water is available in the starter chiller room and a drain is in the middle of the room.  Ventilation is provided through vents or by opening the door.\n\n24. Where are the relief lines?  The relief lines exit the starter chiller room through the north side of the wall.\n\n25.  Where are the isolation valves?  There are individual isolation valves in the tank room and there are isolation valves at the unit.",

              "Description": " Grade A Sweet Water Chiller (SWTW)Date: 7/25/03\n\n1. Process Description:  Liquid ammonia flows from the king tank, is cooled through the high side tank and then flows through a regular or a metered valve on the manifold to the Sweet Water Chiller at 130 psi through labeled piping.  The Sweet Water Chiller must cool the water to between 33? and 35? F.\n     The Sweet Water Chiller uses a heat exchanger rather than an evaporator, with its own receiving tank.  Sweet Water is used to chill product in Grade A, the cream tanks in the Cheese factory HTST room, the cream tanks in the butter room and the butter churn.\n     The Sweet Water Chiller works on a flood system, which means the receiver tank, the heat exchanger and the columns (that FV1 and the sight gauges sit on) are all filled up to the same level with liquid ammonia.  When the float switch senses the ammonia level dropping, it electrically signals the solenoid valve to open, allowing more ammonia into the heat exchanger.  When the level of ammonia reaches the set point, the float valve triggers the solenoid valve to shut off the flow.  The Sweet Water Chiller system has two solenoid valves in case one quits working.\n     The liquid ammonia in the heat exchanger fills coiled pipes from the bottom up.  System pressure keeps the ammonia temperature at 20?F.  Water runs over the coils causing the ammonia inside to boil.  This cools the water in the chiller, resulting in refrigeration.\n     The ammonia boils in the heat exchanger and ammonia vapor goes back into the receiver tank.  It is released through a backpressure regulator ( BPR1).  The BPR controls the pressure in the flood system, which in turn, controls the temperature of the water. The back pressure regulator releases ammonia vapor into the suction line when the pressure gets to 30 psi (20?F.).  The vapor then returns to the high side tank.\n\n2.  Equipment List:  No equipment drawings other than the CAD drawing provided.  A list of the valves and switches can be found on the equipment database under SWTW.\n\n3. Quantity of Ammonia and Maximum Spill: The maximum amount of ammonia loss could be up to 20,000 lbs.  This includes the total inventory of our system.  The estimate volume of the chiller unit is about 2000 lbs.\n\n4. Head Pressure: 150 PSI        5. System Pressure: 30 PSI\n\n6. Exit Pressure/Vacuum:  18 PSI    7. Desired process temperature:  33 degrees Farenheit\n\n8. Age of system:  40 years old        9. Number of potentially affected employees:  20\n\n10. Could product be contaminated?  There could be water in the system.\n\n11. Could property be damaged?  No\n\n12. Operating history:  There has been a very good history with this piece of equipment.  An occasional floodback of ammonia could result from a stuck float switch, solenoid valve or backpressor regulator.  This occurance may happen on a once a year frequency.\n\n13. Consequences of deviation:  High water temperatures are one consequence.  An odor may\n\nalso be apparent in case of a leak of ammonia.  The pH of the water would also rise with the contamination of ammonia in the sweet water.  Temperatures can also be affected by not enough ice developement in the unit or too much ice.  The first indicator of trouble would be a warm temperature of skim milk in the silos.  These temperatures are monitored daily.\n\n14. Steps to correct deviation:  1) The temperature is monitored daily to see if we are having problems in this unit.  2) The ice bank in the unit should be checked.  If there is too much or not enough the unit must be brought back into correct temperatures.  3) Check for floodback.  This is ammonia liquor getting back to the surge drum.  To correct this problem check the float switch, loss of power to the solenoid, or if the solenoid valve is closed.  4) Check the back pressure regulator to see if it is operating correctly.  5)  Look for leaks in valve packing around the unit.  6) Breaker for the solenoid switch is found at WP3-22.\n\n15. What tasks are performed here?  How frequently?  1)  Monitor the temperature of the chiller unit daily.  2) Drain the oil and water monthly.  3) Replace solenoid seats yearly.  4)  Clean strainers yearly.  5) Inspect equipment monthly.  6) Monitor water quality weekly.  7) Monitor product temperature daily.\n\n16. Is equipment accessible?  Yes.\n\n17. How difficult is it to understand and adjust controls?  The controls are very straight forward.  The only controls are the back pressure regulator, the float switch, and the solenoid valve.  It takes minimal training to operate this unit.\n\n18. Are signs, labels and codes clear and easy to understand?  All valves and switches are clearly marked with stainless tags.  All piping and equipment is clearly delineated.\n\n19. What are the safety/warning systems?  The temperatures that are monitored daily will give us warning if they are not in range and the odors of ammonia leaking are the safety systems that are in place.\n\n20. Can inventory be reduced or material substituted to make this system safer?  No.\n\n21. Would functions be better performed through automatic controls or manual procedures?  The automatic controls in place work very well.\n\n22. Are piping, instruments or valves redundant?  There is an extra solenoid valve that is redundant in the system.\n\n23. Where is the nearest drain?  Water source?  Ventilation?  There is water right to the chiller unit.  It is ventilated because it is in an outside environment.  Drains are very close in the milk receiving area.\n\n24. Where are the relief lines?  The relief valves and lines run from the chiller unit overhead to the roof.  All ammonia released would go to the atmoshpere or be captured in plant wastewater system.\n\n25. Location of isolation valve: There are individual suction and liquid valves located on roof of sweetwater unit. As a last resort, sweetwater unit  can be isolated at manifolds in tank room, but the isolation valves in tank room are shared with several other loads  (Ice Cream Ingredient Cooler, Milk Cooler, IC Mix Tank and Cream Tank 1 and 2).  Power to the liquid solenoid valve comes from Y1771 of HTMR 565.",

              "Description": " Whey Plant Glycol Chiller (WLCH)Date: 5/9/03\n\n1. Process Description:  Liquid ammonia flows from the king tank, is cooled through the high side tank and then flows through a regular or a metered valve on the manifold to the Whey Plant Glycol Chiller at  90-130 psi through labeled piping.  The Whey Chiller must cool the glycol to between 25? and 35? F. when operating.  The glycol is used to cool jackets of whey storage tanks and inlet air to fluidizer.\n\nThe Whey Chiller uses a heat exchanger, rather than an evaporator, with its own receiving tank.  Ammonia cools a glycol solution which is pumped through jackets in the whey crystalizers, one silo and one air coil.\n\nThe Whey Chiller works on a flood system, which means the receiver tank, the heat exchanger and the columns (that the float switches ? FS1 and FS2 ? sit on) are all filled up to the same level with liquid ammonia.  When the FS 1 senses that the ammonia level dropping, it electrically signals the solenoid valve to open, allowing more ammonia into the heat exchanger.  When the level of ammonia reaches the set point, FS1  triggers the solenoid valve to shut SV2 off the flow.\n\nShould SV2 leak and level of ammonia raise to height of FS 2, the FS2 removes power from SV1 to prevent liquid flood back to system.\n\nThe liquid ammonia in the heat exchanger fills a shell from the bottom up.  Glycol liquid runs through tubes inside the shell.  The ammonia in the shell is colder (typically its 24?F) than the glycol in the tubes, the ammonia in the shell absorbs heat from the glycol and boils.  The glycol becomes colder.  Typically, the glycol comes into the heat exchanger at about 35? F. and leaves at about 32?F.\n\nThe ammonia boils in the heat exchanger and ammonia vapor goes back into the receiver tank.  It is released through a backpressure regulator ( BPR1).  The BPR controls the pressure in the flood system, which in turn, controls the temperature of the glycol. The back pressure regulator releases ammonia vapor into the suction line when the pressure gets to its preset level.  The vapor then returns to the compressor room.\n\nIf the BPR isn?t operating correctly and pressure is building up in the receivers and evaporators, the safety-release valves (RV1 and RV2) will release the excess ammonia vapor into the air outside the plant.\n\nThe ammonia carries a small amount of oil from the compressors.  Occasionally this oil will collect in low spots or dead legs of the Whey Chiller system and need to be drained through drain valves (DV1).\n\n2. Equipment List:  No original drawings were available for the whey chiller.  Valves are listed in the valve database.\n3. Quantity of Ammonia and Maximum Spill: Ammonia volume for the Whey Chiller is 546 pounds.  Up to 20,000 pounds could be lost if the system's entire\ninventory were spilled.\n\n4. Head Pressure:    150 PSI (MAX)\n\n5. System Pressure:  40 PSI\n\n6. Exit Pressure/Vacuum:  26 PSI\n\n7. Desired process temperature:  26 F\n\n8. Age of system:  5 year (1995)\n\n9. Number of potentially affected employees:  10\n\n10. Could product be contaminated?  A leak could cause glycol to be contaminated, but it is unlikely any product would be contaminated.\n\n11. Could property be damaged?  The unit is located outside; minimal property damage would occur with a leak.\n\n12. Operating history:  This unit has a very good operational history.  It has had no problems.\n\n13. Consequences of deviation:  Product would not be sufficiently cooled, slowing the whey drying process.\n\n14. Steps to correct deviation:  The temperature is monitored daily to see if we are having problems in this unit.  If the whey becomes warm to hot, this could be the problem 1) pump failure 2) lack of NH3 in exchanger 3)wrong pressure.\n\n15. What tasks are performed here?  How frequently?  Temperatures are are monitored continously.\n\n16. Is equipment accessible?  Yes.\n\n17. How difficult is it to understand and adjust controls?  The controls are straightforward and easy to use.  It would take minimal training to operate this unit.\n\n18. Are signs, labels and codes clear and easy to understand?  Yes.\n\n19. What are the safety/warning systems?  \nWonderware sounds alarm when temperature deviates and if FS fails to cycle.\n\n20. Can inventory be reduced or material substituted to make this system safer? No.\n\n21. Would functions be better performed through automatic controls or manual procedures?  The automatic controls in place work well.\n\n22. Are piping, instruments or valves redundant? No.\n\n23. Where is the nearest drain?  Water source?  Ventilation?  The unit is\n\n24.  Location of isolation valves:  There is a liquid and suction valve at the receiver at the Whey Plant and there is a regular and metered liquid isolation valve on the liquid manifold in the tank room and a suction isolation valve on the intermediate suction manifold in the tank room.  Valves in the tank room also affect CS-4.  There is also a liquid and suction isolation valve on the roof between CS-3 and CS-4 that does not affect CS-4.  The liquid solenoid gets its power from Y57 of the Whey Plant T.I.",

Sometimes equipment in blocked by gift inventory.  At minimum, a ladder is needed.\n\n17. How difficult is it to understand and adjust controls?  The controls are straightforward and easy to use.  It takes minimal training to operate this unit.\n\n18. Are signs, labels and codes clear and easy to understand?  Yes.\n\n19. What are the safety/warning systems?  A red light signals when liquid ammonia is entering the system.\n\n20. Can inventory be reduced or material substituted to make this system safer? No.\n\n21. Would functions be better performed through automatic controls or manual procedures? The automatic controls in place work well.\n\n22. Are piping, instruments or valves redundant? No.\n\n23. Where is the nearest drain?  Water source?  Ventilation?  No drain is relatively nearby.  Water is available on the Grade A dock and ventilation can be obtained by opening the door and using fans.  (Supervac fans are best.)  Unit is close to production areas, so use caution when ventilating.\n\n24. Location of isolation valves? There is a regular liquid isolation valve, a hot gas isolation valve and a suction isolation valve in the tank room, but the liquid and suction valves also shut off other units.  The liquid valve in tank room is shared by Ice Cream Machines and the suction valve is shared with the Spiral Freezer, Ice Cream Storage, and Ice Cream Sharp.  There is a single valve in tank room for hot gas that is not shared by other units.  There is a liquid, suction, and hot gas isolation valve at evaporator surge tank on the roof. The liquid solenoid gets its power from Y-33 of compressor room T.I.\n\n25.  Interlocks?  Emergency shutdown buttons on each entrance to compressor room will shutdown liquid supply to ENTIRE system.  Best method is to isolate on roof, next best is to isolate in tank room.",

              "Description": "Compressor and Tank Room                       January 2004\n1. Process Description: The Compressor Room has three high side and three low side compressors.  Both sides function differently in the ammonia system.\n\nThe high side compressors remove saturated gas from the high side tank (at 28 psi) and heat it and build it to 90-130 before sending it out to the Condensing Towers to become liquid again.  The low side compressors apply a 7-13? vacuum to refrigeration units used for freezing (e.g. the Ice Cream Machine, Freezer, Spiral Freezer, and Sharp Room), drawing vapor ammonia through the low side tank.  The low side compressors then re-pressurize the vapor ammonia to about 28 psi and dump it into the high side tanks as saturated gas.  Here, the high side tanks again take over, as noted above.\n\nThe compressors have preset running temperatures and parameters and current running levels can be read from the gauges or digital readouts.  If the compressors need to be started, see SFOP102-104 for Compressor Start-Up.\n\nAn oil heating system maintains the compressor?s temperature.  Oil temperature set point is 130? and the compressor will not work if the temperature is below 95? or above 155?.  Ammonia keeps the oil below 155? by cooling the oil in a shell and tube heat exchanger on a flood system with a receiver tank mounted near the ceiling.  The ammonia vapor goes back into the condensers as saturated gas.\n\nLow side compressor 1 is directly ammonia cooled, rather than using a heat exchanger to maintain temperature.  Ammonia flows to these compressors from the manifold and is returned to the high side tank.\n\nRelief valves are also located on each compressor.  Each of these valves is on a tree, so that one can be worked on while the other is still running.\n\nThe Tank Room contains three tanks and three manifolds.  The tanks include a high side and low side tank as well as a smaller transfer tank.  One manifold channels liquid ammonia out to each system through either a metered or regular valve while the other two are suction manifolds for gas returning from the high side and low side units.\n\nThe high side tank has a large coil, called an intercooler, inside it.  Liquid ammonia flows from the receiver, through this coil to the liquid distribution manifold.  This coil is submerged in liquid ammonia at 15?F. This cools the liquid inside before going to the refrigeration units and cools the vapor going to high side compressors.\n\nThe low side tank collects gaseous ammonia from the freezer units and transfers it to the low side compressors.  The transfer tank is used to mitigate\nflood backs.\n\n2. Equipment List:  Intercooler by WE Stone, SN# 6977, ID# 33021; Lowside Liquid Trap by R&Y, SN# 1182, ID# 33019; Highside Liquid Trap by R&Y, SN# 11037, ID# 33017; Screw Compressor #1 by FES, SN# 1652101, ID# 33071, Model 100-ME; Screw Compressor #2 by FES, SN#2052305, ID#33072, Model 180-ME; Screw Compressor #3 by FES, SN# KT-0099, ID# 33073, Model 23M; Screw \n\nCompressor #4 by FES, SN# 2052529, ID# 33074, Model 180; Screw Compressor #5 by FES, SN# 2013550, ID# 33075, Model 270 ME; Screw Compressor #6 by FES, SN# 2013548, ID# 33076, Model 270 LE.\n\n3. Quantity of Ammonia and Maximum Spill:  Ammonia volume for these areas is 3500 pounds.  A maximum spill could result in 20,000 pounds of ammonia being lost.\n\n4. Head Pressure:    80-130 PSI        \n\n5. System Pressure: Varies (13\" vacuum to 26 PSI)\n\n6. Exit Pressure/Vacuum:  80-130 PSI\n\n7. Desired process temperature: N/A\n\n8. Age of system:  Varies (1979-84)\n\n9. Number of potentially affected employees:  20\n\n10. Could product be contaminated? Product would not likely be contaminated.\n\n11. Could property be damaged?  Property damage would be minimal.\n\n12. Operating history:  Operational history has been generally good.\n\n13. Consequences of deviation:  Biggest consequence is improper pressures.  Compressors will shut down if oil temperature is too hot (170 degrees), too cold (90?F), if discharge pressure gets above180 PSI, oil pressure too high or too low, suction pressure too high or too low.  If low side accumulator gets above 40% compressors 1,2, and 6 will shut down.  If high side accumulator gets above 40%, then all compressors shut down.  If compressors don?t run, we have no refrigeration \n\n14. Steps to correct deviation:  Run different compressors if pressure needs adjusting.  For high oil temperature, check the Smith pump is pumping and moving ammonia through the thermosyphon receiver.  Liquid NH3 in the compressor will cause low oil temperature; boil it out with a heater.  High discharge pressure can be caused by malfunctioning condenser fans and/or pumps or by air in system.  High levels in accumulators are caused by liquid flooding back from one of the field units.  Consult operating manuals for compressors compressor problems.  Consult flood back SOP for high levels in accumulators. \n\n15. What tasks are performed here?  How frequently? Inspect three times daily, oil drained daily, oil changed yearly.\n\n16. Is equipment accessible?  Yes.\n\n17. How difficult is it to understand and adjust controls?  Controls are relatively easy to use and understand.\n\n18. Are signs, labels and codes clear and easy to understand?  Yes.\n\n19. What are the safety/warning systems?  Compressors are equipped with alarms and will go off when operation limits are exceeded. \n\n20. Can inventory be reduced or material substituted to make this system safer? No.\n\n21. Would functions be better performed through automatic controls or manual procedures?  The automatic controls in place work well.\n\n22. Are piping, instruments or valves redundant?   Compressors are redundant on high side.  All three low side compressors are needed for ice cream production, but are redundant when we are not making ice cream. \n\n23. Where is the nearest drain?  Water source?  Ventilation?  A drain is in the floor and water is located just outside the door.  The room is well ventilated with exhaust fans.\n\n24. Where are the relief lines?  Relief lines go from the manifold to the outside.\n\n25. Location of isolation valve: There are isolation valves for each component in compressor room and tank room. .  If compressor room cannot be accessed the only alternative is to isolate at condensers and at each suction valve in tank room or suction valve at each unit.\n\n26.  Interlocks?   The lowside compressors (1,2, and 6) will shut down if low side accumulator level reaches 50%.  All compressors will shut down if intermediate accumulator (high side tank) reaches a level of 50%.  There are emergency shut down switches at each entrance to tank room.",

              "Description": "ASRS Compressor Room                   January 2004\n1. Process Description: The Compressor Room has three high side Frick XRF 150 HP compressors.\n\nThe compressors remove saturated gas from the low-pressure receiver  (at 35 psi) and compress it to 120-130PSIG before sending it to the condenser on the roof to become liquid again. \n\nThe compressors have preset running temperatures and parameters and current running levels can be read from the gauges or digital readouts.  If the compressors need to be started, see SFOP102-104 for Compressor Start-Up.\n\nThe compressors temperature is maintained by an oil heating/cooling system.  Oil temperature set point is 130? and the compressor will not work if the temperature is below 95? or above 155?.  Ammonia keeps the oil below 155? by cooling the oil in a shell and tube heat exchanger on a flood system with a receiver tank mounted near the ceiling.  Electric heaters maintain the oil temperature at 115? F when the compressor is not operating.  The ammonia vapor formed by oil cooling goes to the condenser as saturated gas.\n\nRelief valves are also located on each compressor.  Each of these valves is on a tree, so that one can be worked on while the other is still running.\n\nThere are three liquid vessels in the compressor room.  The thermo-siphon vessel is near the ceiling on the east wall.  This vessel collects liquid from the condenser and acts as a steady supply of ammonia for oil cooling.  The overflow from the thermo-siphon vessel drains into the high-pressure receiver, where it is stored until it is required for use in the system.  Part of liquid is forced by system pressure to the penthouse units.  The liquid that heads for the penthouses passes through an intercooler coil submerged in the low pressure receiver to sub-cool the liquid and to aid oil cooling for the compressors.  The rest of the liquid that leaves the high-pressure receiver is delivered to the low-pressure receiver.  The liquid in the low-pressure receiver is circulated by an ammonia pump through the units in zone 7 and 8.\n\nThe low-pressure receiver has a large coil, called an intercooler, inside it.  Liquid ammonia flows from the receiver, through this coil to the penthouse units.  This coil is submerged in liquid ammonia at 22?F. This cools the liquid inside before going to the refrigeration units and cools the vapor going to high side compressors.\n\n2. Equipment List:  Intercooler by; Thermosyphon vessel by Nickell, SN 49917;                                              \nHigh Pressure Receiver by Nickell, SN 49919; Low-pressure receiver by Nickell, SN 49916.  Screw Compressor #1 by Frick SN# 0159TFMNTHACO3.   Model XRF 68E 150HP.  , Screw Compressor #2 by Frick SN# 0161TFMNTHACO3.   Model XRF 68E 150HP. Screw Compressor #3 by Frick SN# 0160TFMNTHACO3.  All compressors are Model XRF 68E 150HP., \n\n3. Quantity of Ammonia and Maximum Spill:  Ammonia volume for these areas is about 5000 pounds.  A maximum spill could result in 13,000 pounds of ammonia being lost.\n\n4. Head Pressure:    110-130 PSI        \n\n5. System Pressure: 35 PSI\n\n6. Exit Pressure/Vacuum:  80-130 PSI\n\n7. Desired process temperature: N/A\n\n8. Age of system:  (March 2000))\n\n9. Number of potentially affected employees:  20\n\n10. Could product be contaminated? Product would not likely be contaminated.\n\n11. Could property be damaged?  Property damage would be minimal.\n\n12. Operating history:  Operational history has been very good.\n13. Consequences of deviation:  Biggest consequence is improper pressures.  Compressors will shut down if oil temperature is too hot (170 degrees), too cold (90?F), if discharge pressure gets above180 PSI, oil pressure too high or too low, suction pressure too high or too low.  If low-pressure receiver gets above 50%, then all compressors shut down.  If compressors don?t run, we have no refrigeration \n\n14. Steps to correct deviation:  Run different compressors if pressure needs adjusting.  Liquid NH3 in the compressor will cause low oil temperature; boil it out with a heater.  High discharge pressure can be caused by malfunctioning condenser fans and/or pumps or by air in system.  Liquid flooding back from one of the penthouse units causes high levels in low-pressure receiver.  Consult operating manuals for compressors compressor problems.\n\n15. What tasks are performed here?  How frequently? Inspect three times daily, oil drained daily, oil changed yearly.\n\n16. Is equipment accessible?  Yes.\n\n17. How difficult is it to understand and adjust controls?  Controls are relatively easy to use and understand.\n\n18. Are signs, labels and codes clear and easy to understand?  Yes.\n\n19. What are the safety/warning systems?  Compressors are equipped with alarms and will go off when operation limits are exceeded. Room is equipped with Manning 250 ppm and 2% ammonia sensors that send alarm and shut off compressors at 250 ppm and operate emergency exhaust fan at 2% ammonia level in air.  There is an emergency vent valve box on west outside wall that can be used to vent all ammonia pressure to roof.\n\n20. Can inventory be reduced or material substituted to make this system safer? No.\n\n21. Would functions be better performed through automatic controls or manual procedures?  The automatic controls in place work well.\n\n22. Are piping, instruments or valves redundant?   Compressors are redundant.  Our loads only infrequently require two compressors. \n\n23. Where is the nearest drain?  Water source?  Ventilation?  Water is not readily available and there are no drains in the floor an.  The room is well ventilated with an exhaust fan and an emergency exhaust fan will come on if ammonia sensor detects 2% ammonia atmosphere.\n\n24. Where are the relief lines?  Relief lines go from the manifold to the outside.\n\n25. Location of isolation valve: There are isolation valves for each component in compressor room. There is an emergency shutdown button by door in maintenance shop that will shut down main liquid supply and compressors.  If compressor room cannot be accessed the only alternative is to isolate at condenser and at refrigeration unit.\n\n26.  Interlocks?  Compressors are interlocked with high low-pressure receiver level, atmospheric ammonia level above 2% in compressor room, and with emergency stop button in maintenance shop.",

              "Description": " Condensing Towers         Date:  06/06/00\n\n1.  Process Description:  Ammonia vapor exits the compressors and is pushed into the condensers at about 110 psi.  Ammonia vapor from the thermosiphon oil cooling system also goes into the condenser.  The two vapor lines feed two sections of the condenser. \n\nThe vapor lines feed tube nests inside the condenser.  There is a circulating pump, which sprays water through a network of nozzles designed to keep all the tubes wet.  The pump runs all the time.  There are three large fans which blow air through the tubes.  There is one motor, which powers two of the fans, and one motor to power the other.   The water that evaporates on the outside surface of the tubes does the main cooling.  When the ammonia inside the tubes cools enough, the ammonia vapor condenses to a liquid state. The speed of the fans is controlled to maintain a pressure of 110PSIG in the condenser.  The liquid ammonia drains from the condenser, it first fills the thermosiphon vessel near the ceiling on the east wall of the compressor room.  The over-flow from the thermosiphon vessel drains into the high-pressure receiver where it is stored until required for the ammonia system.  The condenser is equipped with relief valves, which will vent the ammonia to atmosphere if the pressure gets above 250PSIG.  Sight glasses on the high-pressure receiver reveal the ammonia level.  It should be kept The second sight glass. Wonderware will also monitor tank level.\n\nThe condenser has a third cooling circuit, which is used to cool glycol, which is used to cool the oil for the air compressor in the ASRS.\n \n2.  Equipment List:  Frigid Coil/Imeco Model XLP XL-745 Evaporative Condenser  S/N 38822AIR, S.O. #212604.\n\n3.  Quantity of Ammonia and Maximum Spill:  Condenser volume totals 1000 pounds.  A maximum spill would be 13,000 pounds, the system's entire inventory.\n\n4.    Head pressure:  110 PSI            \n\n5.  System pressure:  110 PSI\n\n6.    Exit pressure/vacuum:  110 PSI        \n\n7.  Desired process temperature:  about 150?F in and about 70?F out.\n\n8.  Age of system:  Manufactured 10/99.  Put into operation 3/2000.\n\n9.  Number of potentially affected employees; 20\n\n10.  Could product be contaminated?  It is not likely that product could be contaminated.\n\n11.  Could property be damaged?  Property damage would be minimal.\n\n12.  Operating history:  This unit has a good operating history.\n\n13.  Consequences of deviation:  High head pressure.\n\n14.  Steps to correct deviation:  If head pressure gets too high, purge the system.  Clean sump pump in condensers once a year.  Check if algae are growing on top of the condensers, as it can cause high head pressure.  Check the water nozzles.  Ammonia will not be cooled if the nozzles are plugged.\n\n15.  What tasks are performed here?  How frequently?  Mud is flushed out of the condensers twice annually.  Fans are lubed and checked monthly.\n\n16.  Is equipment accessible?  Yes.\n\n17.  How difficult is it to understand and adjust controls?  Controls are straightforward and relatively easy to use.\n\n18.  Are signs, labels and codes clear and easy to understand?  Yes.\n\n19.  What are the safety/warning systems?  The compressors shut down if head pressure is too high.\n\n20.  Can inventory be reduced or material substituted to make this system safer?  No.\n\n21.  Would functions be better performed through automatic controls or manual procedures?  The automatic controls in place work well.\n\n22.  Are piping, instruments or valves redundant?  No.\n\n23.  Where is the nearest drain?  Water source?  Ventilation?  Condensers are located outside and a hose is available for water.\n\n24.    Where are the relief lines?  Relief valves are all outside, located on each leg of the compressor.\n\n25.    Location of isolation valve: The condensers are divided into two sections or legs.\nEach section can be isolated individually.",

              "Description": " Zone 1 (Penthouse 1)Date:  8/12/00\n\n1.  Process Description:  Penthouse 1 is the first penthouse you reach as you step out on the roof.  Liquid ammonia flows from the high pressure receiver tank and is cooled as it passes through the intercooler coil within the low pressure receiver/suction trap. The ammonia then goes to the roof and enters the pipe run that is west of the penthouses in the piping labeled HPL. The flow is controlled by a Hansen ?? HS4A solenoid valve (Y826) that is controlled by Alarm program 25.  Alarm program 25 uses a 4-20 milliamp signal generated  the information from the Hansen LB-1 liquid level controller (WX809).  The alarm program is written to maintain a level of 18-28% in the level column on the surge drum.  At this level, the coils are flooded with ammonia and we have our best heat transfer.  There are two separate coils serviced by the same controls.  Three 3HP/1140 RPM fans draw air through each coil.  As the air passes through, a portion of the heat it contains is absorbed by the ammonia.  This causes the ammonia to boil and change to a vapor.  This vapor makes it?s way back to the compressor by way of a 2? Hansen HA4AJ electrically controlled back pressure regulator.  This regulator is controlled by Loop 2 of ENG_ASRS PLC program.  WY801 is the 4-20 milliamps signal that controls the regulator to maintain the ammonia pressure and the proper point so that the inlet air is at its setpoint.  If the temperture falls too far below its setpoint, the back pressure regulator solenoid de-energizes  and the pressure goes to a higher level.  \nThere are a pair of safety relief valves that will vent ammonia to the atmosphere if the pressure gets above 150 PSI.\nThe ammonia carries a small amo    unt of oil from the compressors.  Occasionally this oil will collect in low spots or dead legs of the Zone 1 system and needs to be drained through drain valves 11 and 12.\n    There is no provision for automatic defrost.\n2.  Equipment List:  The evaporator was placed here the early part of 2000.      It is a Frick/Imeco Model S-1250-RTFA-H-603-84-FL-HGC-IP.  It has a rated capacity of 49.6 tons at a refrigerant temperature of 26?F and a temperature difference of 10?F.  There are 6 3HP/1140 RPM motors that drive 36? fans to provide 67,800 cfm of air flow through the units.\n\n3.  Quantity of Ammonia and Maximum Spill:  The quantity of ammonia in this system is an estimated 460 pounds.  In a worst-case scenario, we could lose 13,000 pounds, the entire inventory of the ASRS ammonia system.\n\n4.  Head pressure:  80-150 PSI        5.  System pressure:  40 PSI\n\n6.  Exit Pressure/Vacuum:  35 PSI    7.  Desired process temperature:  43oF\n\n8.  Age of system:  1 years\n\n9.  Number of potentially affected employees:  15\n\n10.  Could product be contaminated?  There could be some product damage of cheese, but not likely because the packaging materials used with cheese have excellent resistance to ammonia infiltration. \n\n11.  Could property be damaged?  Very minimal structural damage could result from a spill.\n\n12.  Operating history:  There has been a very good history with this piece of equipment. \n\n13.  Consequences of deviation:  This Zone will warm up if the air flow is restricted by ice or if the solenoid valve, the liquid level detector or back pressure regulator do not function correctly.  If here is a leak of ammonia in this system, it would be detected by one of the Manning 25ppm ammonia sensors located in the refrigerated space.\n\n14.  Steps to correct deviation:  The temperature is monitored daily to see if there are problems in this unit.  If the cold storage unit becomes warm, follow these procedures.  1)  If there is restricted air flow through the coils, defrost the coils by turning off the ammonia and running the unit until it is clear of ice.\n2)  Warm temperatures may also occur because the solenoid valve, the liquid level detector or back pressure regulator do not function correctly.  Use normal trouble-shooting methods to determine which component is at fault and proceed accordingly.  Be sure to refer to repair SOP?s if it should become necessary to open up ammonia system.\n\n15.  What tasks are performed here?  How frequently?  Temperature is monitored continuously, while oil and water are drained monthly.  Strainers are cleaned yearly and equipment is inspected weekly.  Bearings are lubed every six months.\n\n16.  Is equipment accessible?  Yes, very accessible.\n\n17.  How difficult is it to understand and adjust controls?  The controls are straightforward.  It takes minimal training to operate this unit. \n\n18.  Are signs, labels and codes clear and easy to understand?  All valves and switches are clearly marked with tags.  All piping and equipment are clearly delineated.\n\n19.  What are the safety/warning systems?  The temperatures that are monitored daily and will give us warning if they are not in range.  There are ammonia detectors that give us a warning if the level reaches 25 ppm anywhere in the refrigerated space. \n\n20.  Can inventory be reduced or material substituted to make this system safer?  No,\n\n21.  Would functions be better performed through automatic controls or manual procedures?  The automatic controls in place work very well.\n\n22.  Are piping, instruments or valves redundant?  No, there is no redundancy.\n\n23.  Where is the nearest drain?  Water source?  Ventilation?  There is no water source on the roof.  There are storm drains connected to the evaporator fans.  The units are outside so ventilation is not a concern.  The fans can be shut off at the penthouse, at penthouse #2 and at the control panel in the Compressor Room.  \n\n24.  Where are the relief lines?  There are relief valves which is vent ammonia to the atmosphere on the roof. \n\n25.  Location of isolation valve?  There is an isolation valves for all zones on the high pressure receiver in the compressor room.  It is the valve labeled ?King valve? and is the valve farthest south on the high pressure receiver. There are also isolation valves at the unit on the roof.  The liquid solenoid gets its power from Y826 of ENG_ASRS PLC.",

              "Description": "\n Zone 2 (Penthouse 2)Date:  8/12/00\n\n1.  Process Description:  Penthouse 2 is the second penthouse you reach as you step out on the roof.  Liquid ammonia flows from the high pressure receiver tank and is cooled as it passes through the intercooler coil within the low pressure receiver/suction trap. The ammonia then goes to the roof and enters the pipe run that is west of the penthouses in the piping labeled HPL. The flow is controlled by a Hansen ?? HS4A solenoid valve (Y866) that is controlled by Alarm program 26.  Alarm program 26 uses a 4-20 milliamp signal generated  the information from the Hansen LB-1 liquid level controller (WX849).  The alarm program is written to maintain a level of 18-28% in the level column on the surge drum.  At this level, the coils are flooded with ammonia and we have our best heat transfer.  There are two separate coils serviced by the same controls.  Three 3HP/1140 RPM fans draw air through each coil.  As the air passes through, a portion of the heat it contains is absorbed by the ammonia.  This causes the ammonia to boil and change to a vapor.  This vapor makes it?s way back to the compressor by way of a 2? Hansen HA4AJ electrically controlled back pressure regulator.  This regulator is controlled by Loop 3 of ENG_ASRS PLC program.  WY841 is the 4-20 milliamps signal that controls the regulator to maintain the ammonia pressure and the proper point so that the inlet air is at its setpoint.  If the temperture falls too far below its setpoint, the back pressure regulator solenoid de-energizes  and the pressure goes to a higher level.  \nThere are a pair of safety relief valves that will vent ammonia to the atmosphere if the pressure gets above 150 PSI.\nThe ammonia carries a small amo    unt of oil from the compressors.  Occasionally this oil will collect in low spots or dead legs of the Zone 1 system and needs to be drained through drain valves 11 and 12.\n    There is no provision for automatic defrost.\n2.  Equipment List:  The evaporator was placed here the early part of 2000.      It is a Frick/Imeco Model S-1250-RTFA-H-603-84-FL-HGC-IP.  It has a rated capacity of 49.6 tons at a refrigerant temperature of 26?F and a temperature difference of 10?F.  There are 6 3HP/1140 RPM motors that drive 36? fans to provide 67,800 cfm of air flow through the units.\n\n3.

Exit Pressure/Vacuum:  35 PSI    7.  Desired process temperature:  38oF\n\n8.  Age of system:  1 years\n\n9.  Number of potentially affected employees:  15\n\n10.  Could product be contaminated?  There could be some product damage of cheese, but not likely because the packaging materials used with cheese have excellent resistance to ammonia infiltration. \n\n11.  Could property be damaged?

WY881 is the 4-20 milliamps signal that controls the regulator to maintain the ammonia pressure and the proper point so that the inlet air is at its setpoint.  If the temperture falls too far below its setpoint, the back pressure regulator solenoid de-energizes  and the pressure goes to a higher level.  \nThere are a pair of safety relief valves that will vent ammonia to the atmosphere if the pressure gets above 150 PSI.\nThe ammonia carries a small amo    unt of oil from the compressors.  Occasionally this oil will collect in low spots or dead legs of the Zone 1 system and needs to be drained through drain valves 11 and 12.\n    Because the temperature set-point of this unit is 38?F., it is necessary to defrost the unit.  There is a HGD (hot gas defrost) line and an additional 10 valves that are not on Zone 1 and 2.  When the unit goes into defrost (the time is determined by V901 and 973), Event Drum 1 takes over operation of the unit.  The drum first shuts off the liquid supply to the unit, then shuts off the fans.  Then hot gas is applied to the unit.  The Hansen HS4A solenoid valve (Y909) opens and hot gas is routed to the coils.  The pilot valve (Y910) closes 4 Hansen HCK-2 gas-operated valves that isolate the surge drum from the coils.  The hot gas flows through the coils and its only way to get back to the compressor is through a Hansen HA4AK defrost relief regulator which is set for 75 PSI so that coils will reach a temperature of 45?F.  Any frost or ice on the coils will melt and drain into the pan.  After about 10 minutes of hot gas, the hot gas valve (Y909) closes and the  bleed solenoid (Y911) opens for 5 minutes to gently remove the pressure from the coils.  After 5 minutes, the vent valve and the pilot valve close and the unit returns to it?s normal state of operation.\n    Control comes from Profibus node 8 unit located in penthouse 3.\n2.  Equipment List:  The evaporator was placed here the early part of 2000.      It is a Frick/Imeco Model S-1250-RTFA-H-603-84-FL-HGC-IP.  It has a rated capacity of 49.6 tons at a refrigerant temperature of 26?F and a temperature difference of 10?F.  There are 6 3HP/1140 RPM motors that drive 36? fans to provide 67,800 cfm of air flow through the units.\n\n3.  Quantity of Ammonia and Maximum Spill:  The quantity of ammonia in this system is an estimated 460 pounds.  In a worst-case scenario, we could lose 13,000 pounds, the entire inventory of the ASRS ammonia system.\n\n4.  Head pressure:  80-150 PSI        5.  System pressure:  40 PSI\n\n6.  Exit Pressure/Vacuum:  35 PSI    7.  Desired process temperature:  38oF\n\n8.  Age of system:  1 years\n\n9.  Number of potentially affected employees:  15\n\n10.  Could product be contaminated?  There could be some product damage of cheese, but not likely because the packaging materials used with cheese have excellent resistance to ammonia infiltration. \n\n11.  Could property be damaged?  Very minimal structural damage could result from a spill.\n\n12.  Operating history:  There has been a very good history with this piece of equipment. \n\n13.  Consequences of deviation:  This Zone will warm up if the air flow is restricted by ice or if the solenoid valve, the liquid level detector or back pressure regulator do not function correctly.  If here is a leak of ammonia in this system, it would be detected by one of the Manning 25ppm ammonia sensors located in the refrigerated space.\n\n14.  Steps to correct deviation:  The temperature is monitored daily to see if there are problems in this unit.  If the cold storage unit becomes warm, follow these procedures.  1)  If there is restricted air flow through the coils, defrost the coils by turning off the ammonia and running the unit until it is clear of ice.\n2)  Warm temperatures may also occur because the solenoid valve, the liquid level detector or back pressure regulator do not function correctly.  Use normal trouble-shooting methods to determine which component is at fault and proceed accordingly.  Be sure to refer to repair SOP?s if it should become necessary to open up ammonia system.\n\n15.  What tasks are performed here?  How frequently?  Temperature is monitored continuously, while oil and water are drained monthly.  Strainers are cleaned yearly and equipment is inspected weekly.  Bearings are lubed every six months.\n\n16.  Is equipment accessible?  Yes, very accessible.\n\n17.  How difficult is it to understand and adjust controls?  The controls are straightforward.  It takes minimal training to operate this unit. \n\n18.  Are signs, labels and codes clear and easy to understand?  All valves and switches are clearly marked with tags.  All piping and equipment are clearly delineated.\n\n19.  What are the safety/warning systems?  The temperatures that are monitored daily and will give us warning if they are not in range.  There are ammonia detectors that give us a warning if the level reaches 25 ppm anywhere in the refrigerated space. \n\n20.  Can inventory be reduced or material substituted to make this system safer?  No,\n\n21.  Would functions be better performed through automatic controls or manual procedures?  The automatic controls in place work very well.\n\n22.  Are piping, instruments or valves redundant?  No, there is no redundancy.\n\n23.  Where is the nearest drain?  Water source?  Ventilation?  There is no water source on the roof.  There are storm drains connected to the evaporator fans.  The units are outside so ventilation is not a concern.  The fans can be shut off at the penthouse, at penthouse #4 and at the control panel in the Compressor Room.  \n\n24.  Where are the relief lines?  There are relief valves which is vent ammonia to the atmosphere on the roof. \n\n25.  Location of isolation valve?  There is an isolation valves for all zones on the high pressure receiver in the compressor room.  It is the valve labeled ?King valve? and is the valve farthest south on the high pressure receiver.  There are also isolation valves for each line at the unit on the roof.  The liquid solenoid gets its power from Y826 of ENG_ASRS PLC.  The main hot gas valve gets its power from Y428 of ENG_ASRS PLC.",

              "Description": " Zone 4 (Penthouse 4)Date:  8/12/00\n\n1.  Process Description:  Penthouse 4 is the fourth penthouse you reach as you step out on the roof.  Liquid ammonia flows from the high pressure receiver tank and is cooled as it passes through the intercooler coil within the low pressure receiver/suction trap. The ammonia then goes to the roof and enters the pipe run that is west of the penthouses in the piping labeled HPL. The flow is controlled by a Hansen ?? HS4A solenoid valve (Y946) that is controlled by Alarm program 28.  Alarm program 28 uses a 4-20 milliamp signal generated by the information from the Hansen LB-1 liquid level controller (WX929).  The alarm program is written to maintain a level of 18-28% in the level column on the surge drum.  At this level, the coils are flooded with ammonia and we have our best heat transfer.  There are two separate coils serviced by the same controls.  Three 3HP/1140 RPM fans draw air through each coil.  As the air passes through, a portion of the heat it contains is absorbed by the ammonia.  This causes the ammonia to boil and change to a vapor.  This vapor makes it?s way back to the compressor by way of a 2? Hansen HA4AJ electrically controlled back pressure regulator.  This regulator is controlled by Loop 5 of ENG_ASRS PLC program.  WY921 is the 4-20 milliamps signal that controls the regulator to maintain the ammonia pressure and the proper point so that the inlet air is at its setpoint.  If the temperture falls too far below its setpoint, the back pressure regulator solenoid de-energizes  and the pressure goes to a higher level.  \nThere are a pair of safety relief valves that will vent ammonia to the atmosphere if the pressure gets above 150 PSI.\nThe ammonia carries a small amo    unt of oil from the compressors.  Occasionally this oil will collect in low spots or dead legs of the Zone 4 system and needs to be drained through drain valves 11 and 12.\n    Because the temperature set-point of this unit is 38?F., it is necessary to defrost the unit.  There is a HGD (hot gas defrost) line and an additional 10 valves that are not on Zone 1 and 2.  When the unit goes into defrost (the time is determined by V904) , Event Drum 2 takes over operation of the unit.  The drum first shuts off the liquid supply to the unit, then shuts off the fans.  Then hot gas is applied to the unit.  The Hansen HS4A solenoid valve (Y949) opens and hot gas is routed to the coils.  The pilot valve (Y950) closes 4 Hansen HCK-2 gas-operated valves that isolate the surge drum from the coils.  The hot gas flows through the coils and its only way to get back to the compressor is through a Hansen HA4AK defrost relief regulator which is set for 75 PSI so that coils will reach a temperature of 45?F.  Any frost or ice on the coils will melt and drain into the pan.  After about 10 minutes of hot gas, the hot gas valve (Y949) closes and the  bleed solenoid (Y951) opens for 5 minutes to gently remove the pressure from the coils.  After 5 minutes, the vent valve and the pilot valve close and the unit returns to it?s normal state of operation.\n    Control comes from Node 009 of Profibus which is located within Penthouse 4.\n2.

              "Description": " Zone 5 (Penthouse 5)Date:  8/12/00\n\n1.  Process Description:  Penthouse 5 is the fifth penthouse you reach as you step out on the roof.  Liquid ammonia flows from the high pressure receiver tank and is cooled as it passes through the intercooler coil within the low pressure receiver/suction trap. The ammonia then goes to the roof and enters the pipe run that is west of the penthouses in the piping labeled HPL. The flow is controlled by a Hansen ?? HS4A solenoid valve (Y986) that is controlled by Alarm program 29.  Alarm program 29 uses a 4-20 milliamp signal generated  the information from the Hansen LB-1 liquid level controller (WX969).  The alarm program is written to maintain a level of 18-28% in the level column on the surge drum.  At this level, the coils are flooded with ammonia and we have our best heat transfer.  There are two separate coils serviced by the same controls.  Three 3HP/1140 RPM fans draw air through each coil.  As the air passes through, a portion of the heat it contains is absorbed by the ammonia.  This causes the ammonia to boil and change to a vapor.  This vapor makes it?s way back to the compressor by way of a 2? Hansen HA4AJ electrically controlled back pressure regulator.  This regulator is controlled by Loop 6 of ENG_ASRS PLC program.  WY961 is the 4-20 milliamps signal that controls the regulator to maintain the ammonia pressure and the proper point so that the inlet air is at its setpoint.  If the temperture falls too far below its setpoint, the back pressure regulator solenoid de-energizes  and the pressure goes to a higher level.  \nThere are a pair of safety relief valves that will vent ammonia to the atmosphere if the pressure gets above 150 PSI.\nThe ammonia carries a small amo    unt of oil from the compressors.  Occasionally this oil will collect in low spots or dead legs of the Zone 5 system and needs to be drained through drain valves 11 and 12.\n    Because the temperature set-point of this unit is 38?F., it is necessary to defrost the unit.  There is a HGD (hot gas defrost) line and an additional 10 valves that are not on Zone 1 and 2.  When the unit goes into defrost (the time is determined by V991), Event Drum 3 takes over operation of the unit.  The drum first shuts off the liquid supply to the unit, then shuts off the fans.  Then hot gas is applied to the unit.  The Hansen HS4A solenoid valve (Y969) opens and hot gas is routed to the coils.  The pilot valve (Y990) closes 4 Hansen HCK-2 gas-operated valves that isolate the surge drum from the coils.  The hot gas flows through the coils and its only way to get back to the compressor is through a Hansen HA4AK defrost relief regulator which is set for 75PSI so that coils will reach a temperature of 45?F.  Any frost or ice on the coils will melt and drain into the pan.  After about 10 minutes of hot gas, the hot gas valve (Y989) closes and the  bleed solenoid (Y991) opens for 5 minutes to gently remove the pressure from the coils.  After 5 minutes, the vent valve and the pilot valve close and the unit returns to it?s normal state of operation.\n    Control comes from node 10 of Profibus unit which is located in penthouse 5.\n2.  Equipment List:  The evaporator was placed here the early part of 2000.      It is a Frick/Imeco Model S-1250-RTFA-H-603-84-FL-HGC-IP.  It has a rated capacity of 49.6 tons at a refrigerant temperature of 26?F and a temperature difference of 10?F.  There are 6 3HP/1140 RPM motors that drive 36? fans to provide 67,800 cfm of air flow through the units.\n\n3.  Quantity of Ammonia and Maximum Spill:  The quantity of ammonia in this system is an estimated 460 pounds.  In a worst-case scenario, we could lose 13,000 pounds, the entire inventory of the ASRS ammonia system.\n\n4.  Head pressure:  80-150 PSI        5.  System pressure:  40 PSI\n\n6.  Exit Pressure/Vacuum:  35 PSI    7.  Desired process temperature:  38oF\n\n8.  Age of system:  1 years\n\n9.  Number of potentially affected employees:  15\n\n10.  Could product be contaminated?  There could be some product damage of cheese, but not likely because the packaging materials used with cheese have excellent resistance to ammonia infiltration. \n\n11.  Could property be damaged?  Very minimal structural damage could result from a spill.\n\n12.  Operating history:  There has been a very good history with this piece of equipment. \n\n13.  Consequences of deviation:  This Zone will warm up if the air flow is restricted by ice or if the solenoid valve, the liquid level detector or back pressure regulator do not function correctly.  If there is a leak of ammonia in this system, it would be detected by one of the Manning 25ppm ammonia sensors located in the refrigerated space.\n\n14.  Steps to correct deviation:  The temperature is monitored daily to see if there are problems in this unit.  If the cold storage unit becomes warm, follow these procedures.  1)  If there is restricted air flow through the coils, defrost the coils by turning off the ammonia and running the unit until it is clear of ice.\n2)  Warm temperatures may also occur because the solenoid valve, the liquid level detector or back pressure regulator do not function correctly.  Use normal trouble-shooting methods to determine which component is at fault and proceed accordingly.  Be sure to refer to repair SOP?s if it should become necessary to open up ammonia system.\n\n15.  What tasks are performed here?  How frequently?  Temperature is monitored continuously, while oil and water are drained monthly.  Strainers are cleaned yearly and equipment is inspected weekly.  Bearings are lubed every six months.\n\n16.  Is equipment accessible?  Yes, very accessible.\n\n17.  How difficult is it to understand and adjust controls?  The controls are straightforward.  It takes minimal training to operate this unit. \n\n18.  Are signs, labels and codes clear and easy to understand?  All valves and switches are clearly marked with tags.  All piping and equipment are clearly delineated.\n\n19.  What are the safety/warning systems?  The temperatures that are monitored daily and will give us warning if they are not in range.  There are ammonia detectors that give us a warning if the level reaches 25 ppm anywhere in the refrigerated space. \n\n20.  Can inventory be reduced or material substituted to make this system safer?  No,\n\n21.  Would functions be better performed through automatic controls or manual procedures?  The automatic controls in place work very well.\n\n22.  Are piping, instruments or valves redundant?  No, there is no redundancy.\n\n23.  Where is the nearest drain?  Water source?  Ventilation?  There is no water source on the roof.  There are storm drains connected to the evaporator fans.  The units are outside so ventilation is not a concern.  The fans can be shut off at the penthouse, at penthouse #4 and at the control panel in the Compressor Room.  \n\n24.  Where are the relief lines?  There are relief valves which is vent ammonia to the atmosphere on the roof. \n\n25.  Location of isolation valve?  There is an isolation valves for all zones on the high pressure receiver in the compressor room.  It is the valve labeled ?King valve? and is the valve farthest south on the high pressure receiver.  There are also isolation valves for each lint at the unit on the roof.  The liquid solenoid gets its power from Y986 of ENG_ASRS PLC. The main hot gas solenoid gets its power from Y428 of ENG_ASRS PLC.",

              "Description": " Zone 7 (Picking Area)Date: 8/12/00\n\n1.    Process Description: Zone 7 is the picking area that surrounds the southwest corner of the automatic pallet racking area.  5 evaporator units mounted on the ceiling cool it.  These evaporators work with a pumped-liquid overfeed system.  The liquid comes from the low-pressure receiver/suction trap in the southeast corner of the compressor room.  Alarm 4 of ENG_ASRS is set up to maintain a lever of 20-25% in the low-pressure receiver.  When level drops below 20%, Y445 opens a Hansen 2 ?? HS4A solenoid valve and holds it open until level reaches 25%.  One of two Cornell 2CBS-3-4 ammonia pumps forces liquid to the units.  When the temperature for the inlet air rises above the set point, a Hansen ?? HS4A solenoid valve opens a lets liquid flow through the coils.  The flow is controlled by a ?? hand expansion valve.  This valve is adjusted to provide optimum heat transfer through the coils.  As the liquid passes through the coils, it absorbs heat and some of the liquid turns to vapor.  The mixture of liquid and vapor returns to the low pressure receiver in the compressor room, where the vapor separates and goes on the compressors.  The liquid remains in the low-pressure receiver until it goes through the pump again.  The liquid valve stays open until the inlet temperature drops below the set point.\nThe coil units are set up for one defrost a day.  When the unit defrost, the liquid valves shuts off.  After 4 minutes, a Hansen 1? HS4A solenoid valve opens to supply hot gas to the pan coil and a Hansen H6N pilot valve.  The pilot valve closes a 1 ?? Hansen HCK-2 suction check which isolates the coil from the suction line.  The only way the hot gas can get back to the compressor is through a Hansen ?? HA4AK defrost relief regulator.  This regulator is set to maintain a pressure of 75 PSIG so that coil will reach and pan will reach a temperature of 45?F. to melt any frost that might have accumulated.\n        Controls for units 4 and 5 comes from Node 3 of Profibus which is located in upstairs electrical room of ASRS.  Controls for units 1, 2 and 3 come from Node 12 of Profibus which is located on south wall of loading dock area.\nOutput Table\n\n        Liquid Valve        Hot Gas Valve    Pilot Valve    Fans\nUnit 1        Y1056            Y1058            Y1057        Y434\nUnit 2        Y1059            Y1061            Y1060        Y435    \nUnit  3        Y1062            Y1064            Y1063        Y436    \nUnit  4        Y439            Y441            Y440        Y437\nUnit  5        Y442            Y444            Y443        Y438\n\n\n2.  Equipment List: The evaporators were placed here the early part of 2000.  They are Frick/Frigid Coil  Model ATRB-384W-1/2-LRB-HGU-PWDC (Series 450, wide body).  Each is rated at 10.2 tons at a refrigerant temperature of 24?F and a temperature difference of 10?F.  There are 3 ? HP/1140 RPM motors that drive 24? fans to provide 14,435 cfm of airflow through the units.\n\n3.  Quantity of Ammonia and Maximum Spill: The quantity of ammonia in each coil is an estimated 181 pounds (905 pound for entire zone).  In a worst-case scenario, we could lose 13,000 pounds, the entire inventory of the ASRS ammonia system.\n\n4.  Head pressure:  80-150 PSI        5.  System pressure:  40 PSI\n\n6.  Exit Pressure/Vacuum:  35 PSI    7.  Desired process temperature:  38oF\n\n8.  Age of system:  1 years\n\n9.  Number of potentially affected employees:  15\n\n10.  Could product be contaminated?  There could be some product damage of cheese, but not likely because the packaging materials used with cheese have excellent resistance to ammonia infiltration. \n\n11.  Could property be damaged?  Very minimal structural damage could result from a spill.\n\n12.  Operating history:  There has been a very good history with this piece of equipment. \n\n13.  Consequences of deviation: This Zone will warm up if the air flow is restricted by ice, if the fans fails, if the ammonia pump fails or if the solenoid valve does not function correctly.  If there were a leak of ammonia in this system, it would be detected by one of the Manning 25ppm ammonia sensors located in the refrigerated space.\n\n14.  Steps to correct deviation: The temperature is monitored daily to see if there are problems in this unit.  If the cold storage unit becomes warm, follow these procedures.  1) If there is restricted airflow through the coils, defrost the coils by turning off the ammonia and running the unit until it is clear of ice or activate a defrost cycle.\n2) Warm temperatures may also occur because the solenoid valve, the fans or the ammonia pump do not function correctly.  Use normal trouble-shooting methods to determine which component is at fault and proceed accordingly.  Be sure to refer to repair Sop?s if it should become necessary to open up ammonia system.\n\n15.  What tasks are performed here?  How frequently?  Temperature is monitored continuously.  Strainers are cleaned yearly and equipment is inspected weekly.  Bearings are lubed every six months.\n\n16.  Is equipment accessible?  Yes, but only from 24ft. scissors lift.\n\n17.  How difficult is it to understand and adjust controls?  The controls are straightforward.  It takes minimal training to operate this unit. \n\n18.  Are signs, labels and codes clear and easy to understand?  All valves and switches are clearly marked with tags.  All piping and equipment are clearly delineated.\n\n19.  What are the safety/warning systems?  The temperatures that are monitored daily and will give us warning if they are not in range.  There are ammonia detectors that give us a warning if the level reaches 25 PPM anywhere in the refrigerated space. \n\n20.  Can inventory be reduced or material substituted to make this system safer?  No,\n\n21.  Would functions be better performed through automatic controls or manual procedures?  The automatic controls in place work very well.\n\n22.  Are piping, instruments or valves redundant?  No, there is no redundancy.\n\n23.  Where is the nearest drain?  Water source?  Ventilation?  There is no water source in the room.  There are drains connected to the evaporator fans and floor drains.  The room is ventilated very well.  The fans can be shut off at the units, at the upstairs electrical room, and at the control panel in the maintenance shop. \n\n24.  Where are the relief lines?  There are relief valves which is vent ammonia to the atmosphere on the roof. \n\n25.  Location of isolation valve?  There are isolation valves at each unit.  All the units (Zone 7 and 8) can be isolated by turning off the pump, closing the valves in pump discharge lines, closing the by-pass valve on liquid line from the pump, and closing the 8? suction stop that is at the top of the low-pressure receiver in the compressor room.  If it is not possible to isolate an individual unit, the best thing to do would be to shut off pumps and reset compressors to bring system pressure down to 5? vacuum.",

What are the safety/warning systems?  The temperatures that are monitored daily and will give us warning if they are not in range.  There are ammonia detectors that give us a warning if the level reaches 25 PPM anywhere in the refrigerated space. \n\n20.  Can inventory be reduced or material substituted to make this system safer?  No,\n\n21.  Would functions be better performed through automatic controls or manual procedures?  The automatic controls in place work very well.\n\n22.  Are piping, instruments or valves redundant?  No, there is no redundancy.\n\n23.  Where is the nearest drain?  Water source?  Ventilation?  There is no water source in the room.  There are drains connected to the evaporator fans and floor drains.  The room is ventilated very well.  The fans can be shut off at the units, at the upstairs electrical room, and at the control panel in the maintenance shop. \n\n24.  Where are the relief lines?  There are relief valves which is vent ammonia to the atmosphere on the roof. \n\n25.  Location of isolation valve?  There are isolation valves at each unit.  All the units (Zone 7 and 8) can be isolated by turning off the pump, closing the valves in pump discharge lines, closing the by-pass valve on liquid line from the pump, and closing the 8? suction stop that is at the top of the low-pressure receiver in the compressor room.  If it is not possible to isolate an individual unit, the best thing to do would be to shut off pumps and reset compressors to bring system pressure down to 5? vacuum.",

              "Description": "Ice Cream Machines   January 2004\nProcess Description:  Liquid ammonia flows from the King tank, is cooled through the high side tank and then flows through a regular valve near the liquid manifold to the Ice Cream Machines at 90-130 psi through labeled piping. \n\nThere are three Ice Cream Machines with chilling units that can each be operated independently and a hot gas defrost system.  A solenoid valve controls the flow of ammonia into each chiller.\n\nThe chiller works on a flood system, with the level of each barrel controlled by a liquid sensor.  The chillers are constantly flooded with ammonia and a backpressure regulator controls the temperature.\n\nThe liquid ammonia is maintained at a level that keeps the outside of the product barrel flooded with ammonia.  There is a current sensor that monitors the current of the main drive motor.  The current varies depending on how hard we freeze the mix going through the barrel.  There is a backpressure regulator in each machine that keeps the mix temperature at the proper temperature and consistency.\n \nAfter boiling, ammonia vapor goes back into a receiver tank in the machine.  It is released through a backpressure regulator. The BPR controls the pressure in the flood system, which in turn, controls the temperature in the freezer. The backpressure regulator releases ammonia vapor into the suction line when the pressure gets to its preset level.  The vapor then returns to the compressor room.  \n\nThe ammonia carries a small amount of oil from the compressors.  Occasionally this oil will collect in low spots or the dead leg of the Ice Cream Machine system and need to be drained through the drain valve.\n\nThe Ice Cream Freezer?s hot gas defrost system runs through and exits through the backpressure regulators.\n\n2. Equipment List:  No original drawings available for the Ice Cream Machine.  Valves are listed on the valve database.  Each Ice cream machine is a Hoyer KFC2000 and operating controls come from an Allen Bradley PLC in each machine.\n\n3. Quantity of Ammonia and Maximum Spill: The ammonia volume for the ice cream machine is 225 pounds.  Up to 20,000 pounds of ammonia could be lost if the whole system's inventory leaked out.\n\n4. Head Pressure:  80-130 PSI        \n\n5. System Pressure:  0-10\" vacuum\n\n6. Exit Pressure/Vacuum:  13\" vacuum\n\n7. Desired process temperature:  18-22 degrees Fahrenheit\n\n8. Age of system:  Approximately 3 years.  (1997)\n\n9. Number of potentially affected employees:  5\n\n10. Could product be contaminated?  It is unlikely product would be damaged unless there were also a leak in the ice cream product piping.\n\n11. Could property be damaged?  Property damage would be minimal.\n\n12. Operating history:  The operating history for this unit has been good.\n\n13. Consequences of deviation: The chiller will have poor freezing ability; air may leak into the system.\n\n14. Steps to correct deviation:  Replace: See high temp. SOP.\n\n15. What tasks are performed here?  How frequently?  Oil is drained automatically each day as part of CIP process.  Maintenance tasks are scheduled according to hours of operation. Internal software prints notice to screen when procedures need to be performed.\n16. Is equipment accessible?  Yes.\n\n17. How difficult is it to understand and adjust controls?  The controls are straightforward and easy to use.\n\n18. Are signs, labels and codes clear and easy to understand?  Yes.\n\n19. What are the safety/warning systems?  Off temperatures or the smell of ammonia from a leak are the warning/safety systems in place.\n\n20. Can inventory be reduced or material substituted to make this system safer? No.\n\n21. Would functions be better performed through automatic controls or manual procedures? The automatic controls in place work well.\n\n22. Are piping, instruments or valves redundant? \n\n23. Where is the nearest drain?  Water source?  Ventilation?  Drains, water and ventilation (exhaust fans, doorway) are all available in the room where the machines operate.\n\n24. Where are the relief lines?  Relief lines exit outside to the roof.\n\n25. Location of isolation valve: There is a liquid, suction and hot gas isolation valve on each machine. There is a liquid isolation valve in the tank room near the liquid manifold.  This valve also isolates liquid from Butter Freezer.  There is a suction isolation valve on the low side suction manifold. There is hot gas isolation valve on the roof between the ice cream room and the ice cream storage freezer. There is also a hot gas isolation valve in compressor room. It is about 10? above the floor near the opening between the compressor room and the tank room. (this valve shuts off hot gas to Ice Cream machines, Ice Cream Sharp, Ice Cream storage, and Spiral Chiller)\n\n26.  Interlocks?  None",

              "Description": " ACCU-COOLER (ACLR) Date:5/9/03\n1.  Process Description: Two flooded evaporators used to cool cheese roller-store.  Back-pressure regulators control pressure/temperature in each unit, set for 40PSI/26?F.  Each unit has separate float switch/solenoid valve to control liquid level.  Both units defrost together with own daily water defrost, controlled by EDRUM 6 of NH3545 PLC.  Liquid ammonia flows from the king tank, is cooled through the high side tank and then flows through a regular or metered valve on the manifold to the Accu-Cooler at 90-135 psi through labeled piping.  The Accu-Cooler room temperature must be between 29oF and 36oF.\n\nThe liquid ammonia running to the Accu-Cooler system enters Side 1 and Side 2 (evaporators) simultaneously.  Both sides run seperately and can be shut down independently without affecting the other.\n\nA solenoid valve (SV1, SV3) controls the flow of ammonia into the receiver tank (RCVR1, RCVR2). \n\nTanks and evaporators work on a flood system, which means the receiver tanks, the evaporators and the columns (that the float switches--FV1, FV2--sit on) are all filled up to the same level with liquid ammonia.  When the float switch senses that the ammonia level is dropping, it electricly  signals the solenoid valve to open, allowing more ammonia into the tank (RCVR1, RCVR2).  When the level of ammonia reaches the set point, the float valve triggers the solenoid valve to shut off the flow.\n\nThe liquid ammonia in the evaporators fills coiled pipes from the bottom up.  The temperature of the ammonia is regulated at about 26?F.  Fans blow air over the coils causing the ammonia inside to boil.  The air typically comes into the units at around 38?F and leaves at about 32?F.\n\nThe ammonia in the evaporators goes back as ammonia vapor into the receiving tank and is released through a back pressure regulator (BPR1, BPR2).  The BPR controls the pressure in the flood system, which, in turn, controls the temperature in the Accu-Cooler.  The back pressure regulator releases ammonia vapor into the suction line when the pressure gets to its preset level.  The vapor then returns to the compressor room.\n\nIf the BPR isn't operating correctly and pressure is building up in the receivers and evaporators, the safety-release valves (RV1, RV3, RV4) will release the excess ammonia vapor into the air outside the plant.\n\n2.  Equipment List:  The permit number for unit 1 is 195330, unit 2 is 195680;  the type for both is UPV, the manufacturer is R and Y, it was installed in 1990, the NB# for unit 1 is 10523-1 and for unit 2 is 10523-2.  A listing for valves, switches and regulators can be found on the equipment list database under ACLR.  Y159 is #1 liquid valuve on wonderware, Y164 is #2 liquid valve on wonderware, WX248 is accucooler room temp on w/w, Y166 is Fan #1, Y161 is Fan #2, Y160 is BPR1 and Y165 is BPR2.\n\n3.  Quantity of Ammonia and Maximum Spill:  The maximum amount of ammonia loss could be up to 20,000 lbs. This includes the total inventory of our system.  The estimate volume of the chiller unit is about 300 to 600 lbs.\n\n4.  Head Pressure:  90-130 PSI        5.  System Pressure:  30 PSI\n\n6.  Exit Pressure/Vacuum:  28 PSI        7.  Desired Process temperature:  32oF\n\n8.  Age of system:  10 years old    (1990)    \n\n9.  Number of potentially affected employees:  20\n\n10.  Could product be contaminated?  There could be a slight contamination of oil or water in the system.\n\n11.  Could property be damaged?  Very minimal structural damage.  However, we could lose a day's worth of cheese due to ammonia penetration in the blocks.\n\n12.  Operating history:  There has been a very good history with this piece of equipment.  An occasional floodback of ammonia could result from a stuck float switch, solenoid valve or back pressor regulator.  This occurence may happen about once a year.  Oil and water collect in the ammonia and are drained from the system once every three months.\n\n13.  Consequences of deviation:  A day's worth of cheese product could potentially be lost.\n\n14.  Steps to correct temperature deviation:  The temperature is monitored continuously by wonderware.  If the unit becomes warm, possible causes of temperature deviation.\n    a) Restricted flow of ammonia to system- check operation of solenoid valve and float switch.\n    b) Malfunction of back pressure regulator ? check to see is system is maintaing        proper    pressure (40PSI in west and east unit).\n    c) Frosted coils are restricting air flow ? defrost if needed, check back pressure \n    regulator.\n    d) Check operation of fans.\n    \nIn the event of a leak, evacuate system and repair or replace leaking component.\n        \n\n1)Shut off the flow of ammonia to the Accu-cooler by closing the manifold valve in the compressor room.  This valve is clearly marked on the manifold.  Once the level of liquid ammonia is at the proper level, the system can be evacuated repaired and put back online.  In case of emergency, turn off the solenoid valves by dumping the power to it.  The power can be found in the TI cabinet in the compressor room:  unit 1 is #1-Y159 Base 2, Slot 4.  The power for unit 2 is #2 Y-164 Base 2, Slot 5.\n\n\n2)The preventative maintenance is to clean strainers yearly, replace relief valves every 5 years and inspect equipment.\n\n15.  What tasks are performed here?  How frequently?  1)  Monitor the temperature of the Accu-cooler 3 times daily.  2)  Drain the oil every 3 months.  3)  Replace solenoid valves yearly.  4)  Clean strainers yearly.  5)  Inspect equipment every months.  6)  Lube bearing, check belts, fans every 6 months.\n\n16.  Is equipment accessible?  Yes\n\n17.  How difficult is it to understand and adjust controls?  The controls are very straightforward.  It takes minimal training to operate this unit.\n\nAre signs, labels and codes clear and easy to understand?  All valves and switches are clearly marked with stainless tags.  All piping and equipment is clearly delineated.\n\n19.  What are the safety/warning systems?  The temperatures that are monitored daily will give us warning if they are not in range and the odor of ammonia are the sarfety systems in place.  Wonderware monitors temperature and valve cycling and will give us an alarm if there are problems.\n\n20.  Can inventory be reduced or material substituted to make this system safer?  No\n\n21.  Would functions be better performed through automatic controls or automatic precedures?  The automatic controls in place work very well.\n\n22.  Are piping, instruments or valves redundant?  No\n\n23.  Where is the nearest drain?  Water source?  Ventilation?  There is water right next to the accu-cooler.  There are drains in the compactor room.  Ventilation would be very slow through the cold storage room area.\n\n24.  Where are the relief lines?  The relief valves and lines run from the Accu-cooler overhead to the roof area.  All ammonia released would go to the atmosphere or be captured in plant wastewater system.        \n\n25.  Location of isolation valves.  There is a liquid and suction isolation valve on each accucooler unit and there is a regular and metered isolation valve for both units on the liquid manifold and a suction isolation valve for both units on the intermediate suction manifold.  Y159 and Y164 of NH3545 are power sources for solenoid valves.",

              "Description": "Ice Cream Spiral   January 2004\n1.  Process Description:  Liquid ammonia flows from the King tank and is cooled through the high side tank.  It then flows through a regular or metered valve on the manifold to the Spiral Freezer through labeled piping at 90-130 psi.  The Spiral Freezer must be kept between -17o and -38oF when Ice Cream is being chilled.\n\nThe Spiral Freezer has a single evaporator.  Two solenoid valves (SV1 and SV2) control the flow of ammonia into the receiver tank (RCVR1). A Hansen electronic level control maintains a 25%-50% level of liquid ammonia in the receiver. There is also a level switch (FVI) which shuts off ammonia flow if the Hansen malfunctions. There are also two liquid pumps that pump liquid ammonia continuously through the coils.  This is called an \"overfeed system.\"  It keeps the coils wet and maximizes the heat transfer in the evaporator. Only one pump operates at a time.\n\nLow-side system pressure causes the liquid ammonia temperature to be about  -40?F to -50?F.  Fans blow air over the coils causing the ammonia inside to boil.  This cools the air flowing through the coil.  The ammonia boils in the evaporators and liquid mixed with vapor goes back into the receiver tank. The vapor then returns to the low side tank.  Relief valves (RV1 through RV4) provide and outlet if pressure builds too much.\n\nThe ammonia carries a small amount of oil from the compressors.  Occasionally this oil will collect in low spots or the dead leg of the Spiral Freezer system and needs to be drained through the drain valves (DV1 through DV3).\n\nThe Spiral Freezer has a combination of hat gas/hot water defrost system that runs twice a week. The defrost is controlled by solenoid valves SV4 through SV6, check valves CV5 through DV7 and BPR2.  The sequencing of these valves is controlled by EDRUM10 of NH3545 PLC.\n\n2.  Equipment List:  UPV by Morfab, ID #44910, NB #4373.  Valves are listed in the database.\n\n3.  Quantity of ammonia and maximum spill:  Total volume for the Spiral Freezer is 2,400 pounds.  Up to 20,000 pounds of ammonia, the company's entire inventory could be lost as a result of the spill.\n\n4.    Head pressure:  80-140 pounds            \n\n5.  System pressure:  15\"\n\n6.  Exit pressure/vacuum:  10-15 inches\n\n7.  Desires process temperature:  -17o to -38oF\n\n8.  Age of system:  6 years (1994)\n\n9.  Number of potentially affected employees:  30\n\n10.  Could product be contaminated?  Some product could be damaged in a major spill.\n\n11.  Could property be damaged?  Property damage would be minimal.\n\n12.  Operating history:  Operational history for this unit has been good.  Occasionally there are some defrost problems.\n\n13.  Consequences of deviation:  Temperature could be altered, affecting the quality of the products in the ice cream.\n\n14.  Steps to correct deviation:  See High Temperature SOP.\n\n15.  What tasks are performed here?  How frequently?  Temperatures are checked three times per day.  Oil is drained monthly.\n\n16.  Is equipment accessible?  Sometimes equipment is blocked by gift inventory.  At minimum, a ladder is needed.\n\n17.  How difficult is it to understand and adjust controls?  The controls are straightforward and easy to use.  It takes minimal training to operate this unit.\n\n18.  Are signs, labels and codes clear and easy to understand?  Yes.\n\n19.  What are the safety/warning systems?  A red light signals when liquid ammonia is entering the system.\n\n20.  Can inventory be reduced or material substituted to make this system safer?  No.\n\n21.  Would functions be better performed through automatic controls or manual procedures?  The automatic controls in place work well.\n\n22.  Are piping, instruments or valves redundant?  Yes, dual pumps at the receiver.\n\n23. Where is the nearest drain?  Water source?  Ventilation?  No drain is relatively nearby.  Water is available on the Grade A dock and ventilation can be obtained by opening the door and using portable fans  (Supervac fans are best.).\n\n24.    Where are the relief lines?  Because this system operates on a continuous vacuum, relief valves are not necessary.\n\n25.    Location of isolation valve: There are individual labeled isolation valves in the tank room.  The liquid valve is shared by Ice Cream Sharp and Ice Cream Storage.  The suction valve is shared by the Butter Freezer, Ice Cream Sharp and Ice Cream Storage There is also a liquid isolation valve at the unit behind the spiral freezer.  There is also a liquid and suction isolation valve on the roof, near the southwest corner of Ice Cream Storage.   There is a hot gas isolation valve in the area behind the coils, in the overhead of ice cream dock about 3 feet outside roll up door (this valve also shuts off hot gas to Ice Cream Machines, Ice Cream Sharp and Ice Cream Storage.).  There is also a valve to shut off hot gas in the compressor room in the aisle between the two banks of compressors, about 10 feet above the floor, about 6 feet from doorway into tank room.  (this valve shuts off hot gas to Ice Cream machines, Ice Cream Sharp, Ice Cream storage,  and Spiral Chiller) Power for the liquid solenoid comes from Y517 in T.I. cabinet in spiral anteroom.\n\n26.    Interlocks?  None",

              "Description": " Cream Tanks (CRMT)   Date: 6/6/00\n\n1. Process Description:  Liquid ammonia flows from the king tank, is cooled through the high side tank and then flows through a regular or a metered valve on the manifold to the Cream Tanks at 80-130 psi through labeled piping.  The Cream Tanks? temperature must be between 38? and 40?F.\n\nThe liquid ammonia running to the Cream Tank system can enter RCVR 1 or RCVR 2 simultaneously.  Both sides run separately and can be shut down independently without affecting the other.  \n\nSolenoid valves (SV1, SV2) control the flow of ammonia into the receiver tanks (RCVR1, RCVR2) and then into the two cream tanks.\n\nThe receivers and cream tanks work on a flood system, which means the receivers, cream tank chillers, and the columns (that the float switches ? FV1, FV2 ? sit on) are all filled up to the same level with liquid ammonia.  When the float switch senses that the ammonia level dropping, it electrically signals the solenoid valve to open, allowing more ammonia into the tank (RCVR1, RCVR2).  When the level of ammonia reaches the set point, the float switch triggers the solenoid valve to shut off the flow.  There is also a REFRIGERATION ON/OFF switch for each tank on the electrical cabinet door on west wall of room which shuts off ammonia flow in the tank.  Ammonia is also shut off when the tanks are in CIP mode.\n\nThe liquid ammonia in the cream tank chillers fills a jacket between the outer and inner skins of the tank from the bottom up.  The back pressure regulator is set to maintain a temperature of about 33?F in the jacket.  Product heats the jacket causing the ammonia inside to boil. This cools the product, resulting in refrigeration.  \n\nThe ammonia that boils in the cream tank coils goes back as ammonia vapor into the receiver tank and is released through a back pressure regulator (BPR1, BPR2).  The BPR controls the pressure in the flood system, which, in turn, controls the temperature in the Cream Tanks. The back pressure regulator releases ammonia vapor into the suction line when the pressure gets to its preset level.  The vapor then returns to the compressor room.\n\nIf the BPR isn?t operating correctly and pressure is building up in the receivers and evaporators, the safety-release valves (RV1 and RV2) will release the excess ammonia vapor into the air outside the plant.\n\nThe ammonia carries a small amount of oil from the compressors.  Occasionally this oil will collect in low spots or dead legs of the Cream Tanks' system and need to be drained through drain valves (DV1 and DV2).\n\n2. Equipment List:  West Cream Tank Receiver=Morfab #33011, S/N# RES 1560; East Cream Tank Receiver=Morfab #3302, S/N# RES 1559.  Other valves listed on valve database.\n\n3. Quantity of Ammonia and Maximum Spill:  Ammonia in Cream Tanks is 200 pounds.  A maximum spill could reach 20,000 pounds if the system's entire inventory were lost.\n\n4. Head Pressure:  80-120            \n\n5. System Pressure:  35 PSI\n\n6. Exit Pressure/Vacuum:  26 PSI\n\n7. Desired process temperature:  38 degrees Fahrenheit\n\n8. Age of system: 16 years (1984)\n\n9. Number of potentially affected employees:  150\n\n10. Could product be contaminated?  Product could be contaminated if a jacket broke.\n\n11. Could property be damaged?  Property damage would be minimal.\n\n12. Operating history:  Operating history for this unit has been good.\n\n13. Consequences of deviation:  Off temperatures and the subsequent reduction in raw product quality.\n\n14. Steps to correct deviation:  Switches to turn off the solenoid valves are on top of the milk receiving panel.\n\n15. What tasks are performed here?  How frequently? Oil drain every two weeks.\n\n16. Is equipment accessible?  Yes.\n\n17. How difficult is it to understand and adjust controls?  The controls are straightforward and easy to use.\n\n18. Are signs, labels and codes clear and easy to understand?  Yes.\n\n19. What are the safety/warning systems?  Off temperatures and the odor of ammonia from a leak are the safety/warning systems in place.\n\n20. Can inventory be reduced or material substituted to make this system safer? No.\n\n21. Would functions be better performed through automatic controls or manual procedures? The automatic controls in place work well.\n\n22. Are piping, instruments or valves redundant? No.\n\n23. Location of isolation valve: The suction and discharge can be isolated in the tank room, but these lines are shared with several other loads. There are isolation valves for each tank accessible from roof of milk receiving office. Solenoid valve of tank 1 is Y1289 of HTMR 565, and tank 2 solenoid valve is Y1291. There is an additional isolation valve to shut off liquid to both units accessible from top of sweetwater tank.",

              "Description": " Cold Storage #1 (CS1)Date 6/7/00\n\n1.    Process Description:  Liquid ammonia from the king tank flows and is cooled through the high side tank and then flows through a regular or metered valve on the manifold to Cold Storage #1 through labeled piping.  The ammonia is between 28-35 degrees at 80-130 lbs. of pressure.  Cold Storage #1 must be kept at a temperature of 40F.\n\nThe liquid ammonia running to the Cold Storage #1 system enters Side 1 evaporator.  (At one time there were two evaporators for CS1, but unit 2 developed an ammonia leak in an inaccessible part of evaporator and has been isolated from system.\n\nA Solenoid valve (SV2) controls the flow of ammonia into the receiver tank (RCVR1).\n\nThe tank and evaporator work on a flood system, which means the receiver tanks, the evaporator and the column (that the float valves?FV1, and the sight gauges00SG1sit on) are all filled up to the same level with liquid ammonia.  When the Float valve senses the ammonia level dropping, it electrically signals the solenoid valve to open, allowing more ammonia into the tank (RCVR1).  When the level of ammonia reaches the set point, the float valve triggers the solenoid valve to shut off the flow.  There is also a thermostat that shuts off the flow of ammonia when the temperature is below 40?F.\n\nThe liquid ammonia in the evaporator fills coiled pipes from the button up.  The ammonia is maintains at about 28?F.  Fans blow air over the coils, causing the ammonia inside to boil.  The air typically enters around 46?F and leaves at about 39?F.\n\nThe ammonia boils in the evaporator and the ammonia vapor goes back into the receiver tank and is released through a backpressure regulator 0BPR1).  The BPR controls the pressure in the flood system, which in turn controls the temperature in the warehouse.  The backpressure regulator releases ammonia vapor into the suction line when the pressure gets to its preset level.  The vapor then returns to the compressor room.\n\nIf the BPR is not operating correctly and pressure is building up in the receivers and evaporator, the safety-release valves (RV1) will release the excess ammonia vapor into the air outside the plant.\n\nThe ammonia carries a small amount of oil from the compressors.  Occasionally this oil will collect in low sports or dead legs of the Cold Storage #1 system and needs to be drained through drain valves (DV1, DV3, ).\n\n\n\n2.    Equipment List:  The main pieces of equipment are Northwest Baker Evaporator FM 2000.  Manufacturer #349.  There is one receivers and a number of valves and switches, which are, identified in the equipment database under Cold Storage #1 or (CS #1).\n\n3.    Quality of Ammonia and Maximum Spill:  The maximum amount of ammonia loss could be up to 20,000 lbs.  This includes the system?s total inventory.  The estimated volume in the evaporator units is 360 lbs. apiece.\n\n4.  Head Pressure:  90-130 PSI        5.  System Pressure:  35 PSI\n\n6.  Exit Pressure/Vacuum:  18 PSI    7.  Desired process temperature:  40F\n\n8.  Age of system:  25 + years old    9.  Number of potentially affected \n                             employees:  100\n\n10.    Could product be contaminated?  There could be some product damage of cheese and some retail products that are stored in this area.\n\n11.    Could property be damaged?  Very minimal structural damage could result from a spill.\n\n12.    Operating history:  There has been a very good history with this piece of equipment.  In October of 1996, there was a leak in the sight glass area.  About once a year there is an occasional problem with the defrost.  The evaporator coils ice up and airflow is restricted through the coils.  This causes a warming of the temperature in CS #1.\n\n13.    Consequences of deviation:  The could storage unit will warm up if the air \nflow is restricted by ice.  If there is leak in the sigh glass, then one may find a slight NH3 smell around these units.  A loss of less than 5 lbs. of NS3 may occur here.\n\n14.    Steps to correct deviation:  The temperature is monitored daily to see if we are having problems in this unit.  If the cold storage unit becomes warm, follow these procedures:\n\n1)    The coils can be defrosted manually by running warm water over them.  Once the coils have been defrosted in, the backpressure regulator should be adjusted up ? of a turn.\n2)    If the sigh glass has a leak, the sight column can easily be isolated by shutting V9 and V10 on unit #1.\n3)    The next procedure is to ventilate towards the compactor room.  There are large ventilation fans in the old package room that can be used for this.\n4)    Evacuate area if there is a major leak.\n\n \n15.    What tasks are performed here?  How frequently?  1) Monitor the temperature of the cold storage unit 3 times a day.  2) Drain the oil and water monthly.  3) Replace the solenoid valves yearly.  4) Clean strainers yearly.  5) Inspect equipment every 6 months 6) Lube bearing and replace belts every 3 months.\n\n16.  Is equipment accessible?  Yes, very accessible.  Extra lighting may be necessary.\n\n17.  How difficult is it to understand and adjust controls?  The controls are very straightforward.  It takes minimal training to operate this unit.\n\n18.    Are sign, labels and codes clear and easy to understand?  All valves and switches are clearly marked with stainless tags.  All piping and equipment is clearly delineated.\n\n19.    What are the safety/warning systems?  The temperatures that are monitored daily will give us warning if they are not in range and the odor of ammonia are the safety system that are in place.\n\n20.    Can inventory be reduced or material substituted to make this system safer?  No\n\n21.    Would functions be better performed through automatic controls or manual procedures?  The automatic controls in place work very well.\n\n22.    Are piping, instruments or valves redundant?  No, each unit is separate; there is not redundancy.\n\n23.    Where is the nearest drain? Water source? Ventilation?  There is water in the compactor room.  There are drains at the Evaporator.  The ventilation would be to push the air towards the compactor room then to the atmosphere.\n\n24.    Were are the relief lines?  The relief valves are plumbed to the outside.\n\n25.    Location of isolation valve?  There are individual labeled isolation valves for cold storage #1 in the tank room.  There are also isolation valves at the units in CS #1.  The liquid solenoid gets its power from Y105 of NH3545 PLC.",

              "Description": "  Cold Storage #3 (CS3)Date:  6/7/00\n\n1.  Process Description:  Liquid ammonia flows from the king tank, is cooled through the high side tank and then flows through a regular or a metered valve on the manifold to Cold Storage #3 through labeled piping at 130 psi.  Cold Storage #3 must be kept between 40o and 43oF.\n\nThe ammonia system in Cold Storage #3 is differing from all the other refrigeration units in that it does not work on a flood system.  Cold Storage #3 uses a thermo-expansion valve (TV1 through TV6) for each of the six evaporators.\n\nThe thermo-expansion valve meters NH3 into the coils at a rate which allows ammonia to vaporize in the coil.  This cools the outside air, resulting in refrigeration.  Bulbs on the expansion valve going into the coil and on the evaporator coming out of the coil, control the rate of ammonia going in and coming out and should be set on a 10? differential.\n\nOne solenoid valve allows liquid ammonia into the main line for Cold Storage #3.  The temperature valves open to each evaporator to allow more liquid ammonia in when the warehouse temperature gets too high.  A single backpressure regulator (BPR1) controls the amount of ammonia vapor let out of the Cold Storage #3 system and into the suction line.  The vapor then returns to the compressor room.\n\n2.  Equipment list:  No equipment drawings are available, though switches and valves will be listed on the equipment database under CS3.\n\n3.  Quantity of Ammonia and Maximum Spill:  This system holds 52 pounds of ammonia.  the maximum spill is 20,000 pounds, the plant's total volume.\n\n4.  Head pressure:  80-140 PSI        5.  System pressure:\n\n6.  Exit pressure/vacuum:  40 PSI    \n\n7.  Desired process temperature:  Less than 40oF\n\n8.  Age of system:  25 + years\n\n9.  Number of potentially affected employees:  20 \n\n10.  Could product be contaminated?  Cheese and butter could suffer some contamination.\n\n11.  Could property be damaged?  A spill would cause minimal structural damage.\n\n\n12.  Operating history:  There has been a very good history with these six evaporators.  Nothing has needed replacement in the last 12 months.  Occasionally, the expansion valves and thermostat need adjusting.\n\n13.  Consequences of deviation:  A warm cold storage warehouse is the main consequence.  This could damage product in the warehouse.\n\n14.  Steps to correct deviation:  The temperature is monitored three times daily to see if there are problems.  Check to see if oil has gotten on the bulb, affecting its ability to sense temperature.  If this is the case, pull the sensor and wipe off the oil.  If just one evaporator is frozen and the room is cold, turn the liquid ammonia off to that particular unit at the site and wait for it to defrost.  Or, shut off the Cold Storage #3 at the manifold and let the whole system defrost.  If the room is already warm and there is no time to wait for a defrost, cycle a defrost through the system off the TI.  In case of an emergency, the solenoid valve can be shut off at the TI at Base 1, Slot 14, #Y-112.\n\n15.  What tasks are performed here?  How frequently?  The temperature of the warehouse is monitored three times per day and equipment inspected every three months.\n\n16.  Is equipment accessible?  Evaporator units are not very accessible when pallets of product are stacked underneath them.\n\n17.  How difficult is it to understand and adjust controls?   The controls are straightforward.  It takes minimal training to operate this unit.\n\n18.  Are signs, labels and codes clear and easy to understand?  All valves and switches are marked with stainless steel tags.  All piping and equipment are clearly delineated.\n\n19.  What are the safety/warning systems?  The temperatures that are monitored throughout the day, as well as the smell of leaking ammonia, are the safety/warning systems in place.\n\n20.  Can inventory be reduced or material substituted to make this system safer?  No.\n\n21.  Would functions be better performed through automatic controls or manual procedures?  The automatic controls in place work very well.  The defrost is on a manual activation schedule to save wear on equipment and also to save warming and cooling of equipment only for times when it is necessary.\n\n22.  Are piping, instruments or valves redundant?  No.  Each evaporator unit is designed so it can be isolated individually.\n\n\n23.  Where is the nearest drain?  Water source?  Ventilation?  There is no floor drain in Cold Storage #3.  Water is available from a hose faucet in the shipping room.  To ventilate the area, open the doors leading to the shipping dock and outside.\n\n24.  Where are the relief lines?  Due to the nature of the thermo-expansion valve design, there are no relief valves.  This room is soon to become dry storage and refrigeration units  will be removed.\n\n25.  Location of isolation valve?  There are individual labeled isolation valves for cold storage #3 in the tank room.  There are also isolation valves at the units in CS #3.  The liquid solenoid gets its power from Y112 of NH3545 PLC.",

              "Description": "Cold Storage #4 (CS4Date: 5/9/03\n\n1. Process Description:  Liquid ammonia flows from the king tank, is cooled through the high side tank and then flows through a regular or metered valve on the manifold to Cold Storage #4 through labeled piping between 90-130 psi.  Cold Storage #4 needs to be kept between 42? and 44?F.\n\nCold Storage #4 has six evaporators, each with its own receiving tank.  Each of the six systems also have their own solenoid and float switches.  There are three back pressure regulators which each maintain the pressure in a pair of evaporators.  Each pair of evaporators constitutes a refrigeration zone.  Zone one is the zone closest to the door between Cold Storage #3 and #4.   Zone 3 are the unit farthest from the door.\n\nThe tanks and evaporators work on a flood system, which means the receiver tanks, the evaporators and the columns (that the float valves ? FV1 through FV6 ? sit on) are all filled up to the same level with liquid ammonia.  When the float valve senses that the ammonia level dropping, it electrically signals the solenoid valve to open, allowing more ammonia into the tank (RCVR1 through RCVR6).  When the level of ammonia reaches the set point, the float valve triggers the solenoid valve to shut off the flow.\n\nThe liquid ammonia in the evaporators fills coiled pipes from the bottom up.  The back pressure regulator is set to maintain a coil temperature of 29?F.   Fans blow air over the coils causing the ammonia inside to boil.  Typically, air comes into the coil at about 43?F and leaves at about 40?F.\n\nThe ammonia boils in the evaporators and ammonia vapor goes back into the receiver tank.  It is released through a back pressure regulator ( BPR1, BPR2 and BPR3).  The BPR controls the pressure in the flood system, which in turn, controls the temperature in the warehouse. The back pressure regulator releases ammonia vapor into the suction line when the pressure gets to its preset level.  The vapor then returns to the compressor room.\n\nIf the BPR isn?t operating correctly and pressure is building up in the receivers and evaporators, the safety-release valves (RV1 through RV6) will release the excess ammonia vapor into the air outside the plant.\n\nThe ammonia carries a small amount of oil from the compressors.  Occasionally this oil will collect in low spots or dead legs of the Cold Storage #4 system and need to be drained through drain valves (DV1 through DV6).\n\n2. Equipment List:  W.E. Stone Evaporator #s 33410, 33420, 33430, 33440, 33450, 33460.  NB# 7024-(2-6). ST# X6436-83, X6435-83, X6434-83, X6433-83, X6432-83; AWP=150, SV=150, L=48, W=13.  Other valves, switches listed on equipment list labeled CS4.\n\n3. Quantity of Ammonia and Maximum Spill: The Cold Storage #4 system holds 604 lbs.  The maximum spill would result in losing the 20,000 lbs., the whole plant's inventory.\n\n4. Head Pressure:  90-130 PSI        \n\n5. System Pressure:  40 PSI\n\n6. Exit Pressure/Vacuum:  40 PSI    \n\n7. Desired process temperature: 42-43 degrees Fahrenheit\n\n8. Age of system:  14 years (built in 1982)\n\n9. Number of potentially affected employees:  20\n\n10. Could product be contaminated?  Yes, cheese could possibly be damaged in a major spill.\n\n11. Could property be damaged?  Property damage would be minimal.\n\n12. Operating history:  Cold Storage #4 has a pretty good record.  Ocassionally, there are defrost problems, when a poor defrost job leaves water and eventually ice on the machine.  Currently only three of the six units are running because of the time of year.  This may change with the seasons.  The hand valve packings also may leak.  These can be easily tightened.\n\n13. Consequences of deviation:  Consequences range from a warming of the room to a floodback to an ammonia odor to an evacuation.  Cheese may be damaged if the room warms up too much or if a major leak occurs.\n\n14. Steps to correct deviation:  Tighten hand valve packings if they are leaking.  Check the solenoid valves, regulators and float switches.  If a system is frozen, close the liquid line at the individual unit to allow ammonia to be removed from the system.  If necessary and/or available, start another unit while the first one is defrosting.\n\n15. What tasks are performed here?  How frequently?  1) Check the temperature three times daily.  2) Inspect units and drain oil every three months.\n\n16. Is equipment  accessible?  Yes, there is a catwalk between each of the evaporators allowing for easy access.\n\n17. How difficult is it to understand and adjust controls?  The controls are easy to understand.  It would take minimal training to operate these units.\n\n18. Are signs, labels and codes clear and easy to understand?  All valves and switches are clearly marked with stainless tags.  All piping and equipment is clearly delineated.\n\n19. What are the safety/warning systems?  The temperatures that are monitored daily will give us warning if they are not in range and the odors of ammonia leaking are the safety systems that are in place.\n\n20. Can inventory be reduced or material substituted to make this system safer?  No. Extra units that are not presently needed are already turned off.\n\n21. Would functions be better performed through automatic controls or manual procedures?  The automatic controls in place work very well.  The defrosts are controlled manually.\n\n22. Are piping, instruments or valves redundant?  No, although there are enough evaporators in the room so that are not all of them have to be running to maintain proper room temperature.\n\n23. Where is the nearest drain?  Water source?  Ventilation?  Drains, water and ventilation are all available at the evaporators.\n\n24.    Where are the relief lines?  Relief lines are located outside on the roof.\n\n25. Location of isolation valve: There are liquid and suction isolation valves in the tank room. These valves also isolate the glycol chiller at the Whey Plant. There are also isolation valves for liquid and suction at each evaporator. There is no hot gas going into CS-4. Liquid solenoids are Y290, Y291, Y296, Y297, Y302, Y303 of the NH3545 PLC  and are located on base 3, which is in the cabinet located near the west door of Cold Storage 4,",

              "Description": " Cheese Factory Glycol Chiller(GLCH)       Date: 6/6/00\n\n1. Process Description:  Liquid ammonia flows a valve near ceiling in tank room that is tapped off line going into high side accumulator/intercooler through labeled piping. The Glycol Chiller has a RTD (resistive temperature device) which controls the position of glycol valve and keeps the temperature at of whey to 44?F .\n\n The Glycol Chiller uses a heat exchanger rather than an evaporator, with its own receiving tank.  Ammonia cannot come into contact with food product, so glycol is chilled which in turn cools the whey in one section of the whey pasteurizer in the R.O. room. A cooling tower on the roof is used in another section of whey pasteurizer to pre-cool whey.\n\nThe Glycol Chiller works on a flood system, which means the receiver tank, the heat exchanger and the columns (that the float switch -- FV1 -- sit on) are all filled up to the same level with liquid ammonia.  When the float switch senses  the ammonia level dropping, it electrically signals the solenoid valves to open, allowing more ammonia into the heat exchanger.  When the level of ammonia reaches the set point, the float switch triggers the solenoid valve to shut off the flow.\n\nThe liquid ammonia in the heat exchanger fills one side of plates from the bottom up.  The back pressure regulator is set to maintain the ammonia temperature at about 24?F.  Glycol liquid runs through the other side causing the ammonia on the other side to boil.  Typically, the glycol comes into heat exchanger at 43?F and leaves at 34?F.  These temperatures vary somewhat depending on the time of year.  If the outside temperature is warmer, we do not get the same pre-cooling of the whey by the cooling tower circuit.\n\nThe ammonia boils in the heat exchanger and ammonia vapor goes back into the surge drum.  It is released through a back pressure regulator ( BPR1).  The temperature of the whey is controlled by the flow of glycol.  The more flow the cooler the temperature.\n\nIf the BPR isn?t operating correctly and pressure is building up in the receivers and evaporators, the safety-release valves (RV1 and RV2) will release the excess ammonia vapor into the air outside the plant.\n\nThe ammonia carries a small amount of oil from the compressors.  Occasionally this oil will collect in low spots or dead legs of the Glycol Chiller system and need to be drained through drain valves (DV1).\n\n2. Equipment List:  The main piece of equipment is a plate and frame heat exchanger.  NH3 on one side, glycol-water mix on the other side.  The valves and switches are listed in the equipment data base under GLCH.\n\n3. Quantity of Ammonia and Maximum Spill: The maximum amount of ammonia loss could be up to 20,000 lbs.  This includes the system's total inventory.  The estimate volume of the chiller unit is about 2000 lbs.\n\n4. Head Pressure:  90-150 PSI     (MAX)    \n\n5. System Pressure:  40 PSI\n\n6. Exit Pressure/Vacuum:   28 PSI    \n\n7. Desired process temperature:  44 degrees Fahrenheit\n\n8. Age of system:  3 years old  (1997)\n\n9. Number of potentially affected employees:  6\n\n10. Could product be contaminated?  There could be a slight contamination of glycol or water in the system.\n\n11. Could property be damaged?  Very minimal structural damage could result from a spill.\n\n12. Operating history:  There has been a very good history with this piece of equipment.  An occasional floodback of ammonia could result from a stuck float switch, solenoid valve or back pressure regulator.  This occurrence may happen about once a year.  Oil and water collect in the ammonia and are drained from the system once a month. This unit has been inspected and should be replaced within two years.\n\n13. Consequences of deviation:  Warm to hot whey product is the consequence of a deviation.  This causes production problems in processing of the whey.  The warm whey is the result.  If the chiller unit were to break, we would loose up to 20,000 pounds of ammonia.  A loss of this magnitude would result in a shutdown of the ammonia system throughout the plant.\n\n14. Steps to correct deviation:  The temperature is monitored continuous to see if we are having problems in this unit.  If the whey becomes warm, follow these procedures.  \n\n1)    Improper pressure in receiver by outside door of tank room-check solenoid valve or adjust pressure. \n2)    Cooling tower in roof above retail pump or fan problem ? check the pump pressure and fan operation. \n3)    3) Liquid to unit outside can be shut off by HPL ammonia valve which does not come off liquid manifold, but comes off line going to intercooler.  \n\nValve is close to ceiling, near outlet side of low pressure suction manifold.  There are 2 intermediate suction valves on intermediate su7ction manifold also.  Electrical power to NH3 solenoid comes from Y187 which is in slot 8, base 2 of compressor room T.I.\n\n15. What tasks are performed here?  How frequently?  1)  Monitor the temperature of the chiller unit daily 2)  Drain the oil and water weekly 3)  Clean strainers yearly 4)  Inspect equipment daily.\n\n16. Is equipment  accessible?    Yes, most is outside by outside door of tank room.  Heat exchanger is outside by outside door of tank room.\n\n17. How difficult is it to understand and adjust controls?  The controls are very straight forward.  It takes minimal training to operate this unit.\n\n18. Are signs, labels and codes clear and easy to understand?    All valves and switches are clearly marked with stainless tags.  All piping and equipment is clearly delineated.\n\n19. What are the safety/warning systems?  The temperatures that are monitored daily will give us warning if they are not in range and the odor of ammonia are the safety systems that are in place.\n\n20. Can inventory be reduced or material substituted to make this system safer?  No.\n\n21. Would functions be better performed through automatic controls or manual procedures?  The automatic controls in place work very well.  The only manual procedure is to turn the glycol pump off and on.\n\n22. Are piping, instruments or valves redundant?  No.\n\n23. Where is the nearest drain?  Water source?  Ventilation?  There are NO drains, part of unit is outside, part is tank room.  There are two ventilation systems in the room.\n\n24. Where are the relief lines?  The relief valves and lines run from the chiller unit overhead to the roof area.  All ammonia released would go to the atmosphere.\n\n25.  Location of isolation valve.  There is a isolation valve for liquid near ceiling of tank room between intermediate and low side accumlator and a liquid isolation on receiver by back door of compressor room.  There is a suction isolation valve on this same receiver and two isolation valves on intermediate suction manifold. The liquid solenoid is powered by Y187 of compressor room T.I.",

              "Description": "Ice Cream Ingredient Cooler       January 2004\n1. Process Description:  Liquid ammonia flows from the king tank, is cooled through the high side tank and then flows through a regular or a metered valve on the manifold to the Ice Cream Cooler at 90-130 psi through labeled piping.  The Ice Cream Cooler (Ingredients Cooler) must be kept between 40? and 43?F.\n\nThe ammonia system in the Ice Cream Cooler, like Cold Storage #3, is different from the other refrigeration units in that it does not work on a flood system.  The Ice Cream Cooler uses a thermo-expansion valve (TV1) to control ammonia flow to its evaporator.  \n\nThe liquid ammonia flows through coiled pipes from the bottom up.  Fans blow air over the coils causing the ammonia inside to boil.  This cools the outside air, resulting in refrigeration.\n\nOne solenoid valve allows liquid ammonia into the main line for Ice Cream Cooler.  The temperature valve opens to the evaporator to allow more liquid ammonia in when the warehouse temperature gets too high.  A backpressure regulator (BPR1) controls the amount of ammonia vapor let out of the Ice Cream Cooler system and into the suction line.  The vapor then returns to the compressor room.\n\n2. Equipment List:  No original design drawing available, though equipment includes an evaporator and valves listed in the equipment/valve database.\n\n3. Quantity of Ammonia and Maximum Spill: Estimated quantity of ammonia is 40 pounds.  A maximum of 20,000 pounds could be leaked if the system's entire inventory was lost.\n\n4. Head Pressure:    80-150            5. System Pressure:  40\n\n6. Exit Pressure/Vacuum: 26\n\n7. Desired process temperature:  40-43 degrees Fahrenheit\n\n8. Age of system:  17+ years (1980)\n\n9. Number of potentially affected employees:  40\n\n10. Could product be contaminated?  Ice cream ingredients could be damaged if a major spill occurred.\n\n11. Could property be damaged?  Property damage would be minimal.\n\n12. Operating history:  The cooler occasionally freezes up.\n\n13. Consequences of deviation:  This results in a temperature change, which, over a long period of time, may affect the product in the cooler.\n\n14. Steps to correct deviation:  See high temp. SOP.\n\n15. What tasks are performed here?  How frequently?  Temperatures are checked three times per day.\n\n16. Is equipment accessible?  Yes.\n\n17. How difficult is it to understand and adjust controls?  The controls are straightforward and easy to use.\n\n18. Are signs, labels and codes clear and easy to understand?  Yes.\n\n19. What are the safety/warning systems?  High temperatures or the odor of ammonia from a leak are the safety/warning systems currently in place.\n\n20. Can inventory be reduced or material substituted to make this system safer? No.\n\n21. Would functions be better performed through automatic controls or manual procedures?  The automatic controls in place work well.\n\n22. Are piping, instruments or valves redundant? No.\n\n23. Where is the nearest drain?  Water source?  Ventilation?  A drain is located in the floor.  Water and ventilation can be obtained from the Grade A dock.\n\n24. Where are the relief lines?  There are no relief lines.\n\n25.  Location of isolation valves?  There are isolation valves in the tank room, but they are shared by the Sweetwater chiller, Cream Tanks, IC Sharp (liquid only), IC Mix Tank, and Milk Cooler.  There are individual isolation valves inside the room.  In addition, there are isolation valves where the ammonia is tapped off the shared suction and liquid lines.  These valves are in the overhead space just inside the roll-up door to GA/Ice Cream Dock.",

              "Description": "Ice Cream Freezer    January 2004\n1. Process Description:  Liquid ammonia flows from the King tank, is cooled through the high side tank and then flows through a regular or a metered valve on the manifold to the Ice Cream Freezer at 130 psi through labeled piping.  The Ice Cream Freezer must be kept between -25? and -18?F.  The Ice Cream Freezer refrigeration unit is on the roof above the Grade A hallway next to the Freezer.\n\nThe Ice Cream Freezer has two evaporators and a hot gas defrost system.  A solenoid valve (SV1) controls the flow of ammonia into the receiver tank (RCVR1).\n\nThe tanks and evaporators work on a flood system, which means the receiver tanks, the evaporators and the columns (that the float switch ? FV1 ? sits on) are all filled up to the same level with liquid ammonia.  When the float switch senses that the ammonia level dropping, it electrically signals the solenoid valve to open, allowing more ammonia into the tank (RCVR1).  When the level of ammonia reaches the set point, the float switch triggers the solenoid valve to shut off the flow.\n\nThe liquid ammonia in the evaporators fills coiled pipes from the bottom up.  Fans blow air over the coils causing the ammonia inside to boil.  This cools the outside air, resulting in refrigeration.  The ammonia boils in the evaporators and ammonia vapor goes back into the low side tank.  \n\nThe ammonia carries a small amount of oil from the compressors.  Occasionally this oil will collect in low spots or the dead leg of the Ice Cream Freezer system and need to be drained through the drain valve (DV1).\n\nThe Ice Cream Freezer?s hot gas defrost system runs through solenoid valves (SV2 and SV3) and is regulated by a check valves (CV1, CV2, CV3, CV4).\n\nThere is also a heating system under the floor of the freezer.  This keeps the floor from freezing and moving around.  It is very important that the pump and floor sensors are checked each shift.\n\n2. Equipment List:  Surge Pot=R & Y UPV #33006, ST#X7178-89, NB#2821; valves listed on the valve database.\n\n3. Quantity of Ammonia and Maximum Spill: Total volume for the Ice Cream Freezer is 352 pounds.  Up to 20,000 pounds of ammonia could be lost if the system's entire inventory spilled.\n\n4.

              "Description": "  Ice Cream Mix Chiller (ICMX)Date: 7/25/03\n\n1. Process Description:  Liquid ammonia flows from the king tank, is cooled through the high side tank and then flows through a regular or a metered valve on the manifold to the Ice Cream Mix Chiller at 90-130 psi through labeled piping.  The Ice Cream Mix Chiller must be 38?F.  when operating.\n\nThe Ice Cream Mix Chiller has one chilling unit.  A solenoid valve (SV1) controls the flow of ammonia into the receiver tank (RCVR1).\n\nThe tank and chiller works on a flood system, which means the receiver tank, the chiller and the column (that the float switch ? FV1 ? sits on) are all filled up to the same level with liquid ammonia.  When the float switch senses that the ammonia level dropping, it electrically signals the solenoid valve to open, allowing more ammonia into the tank (RCVR1).  When the level of ammonia reaches the set point, the float switch triggers the solenoid valve to shut off the flow.\n\nThe liquid ammonia in the evaporators fills a separate jacket in the from the bottom up.  Ice cream product contacts the skin of the jacket and heat is transferred from the product, causing the ammonia to to boil and the product to become cold.\n\nAfter boiling in the tank, the ammonia vapor goes back into the receiver tank.  It is released through a back pressure regulator (BPR1).  The BPR controls the pressure in the flood system, which in turn, controls the temperature in the tank. The back pressure regulator releases ammonia vapor into the suction line when the pressure gets to its preset level.  The vapor then returns to the compressor room.\n\nThe ammonia carries a small amount of oil from the compressors.  Occasionally this oil will collect in low spots or dead legs of the Ice Cream Mix Chiller and need to be drained through the drain valve (DV1).\n\n2. Equipment List:  No equipment drawings available.  Besides the chiller and surge drum, there are several valves listed in the equipment/valve database.\n\n3. Quantity of Ammonia and Maximum Spill: Volume for this unit is 200 pounds.  Maximum spill could be 20,000 pounds if the system's entire inventory was lost.\n\n4. Head Pressure:    80-120 PSI            5. System Pressure:  35 PSI\n\n6. Exit Pressure/Vacuum: 26 PSI\n\n7. Desired process temperature: 38 degrees Farenheit  \n\n8. Age of system:   Tank 13 years (1987), Surge Drum and Valves 1 year  (July 2002)\n\n9. Number of potentially affected employees:  45\n\n10. Could product be contaminated?  It is unlikely product would be contaminated unless there was also a leak in the ice cream product piping.\n\n11. Could property be damaged?  Property damage would be minimal.\n\n12. Operating history:  \n\n13. Consequences of deviation:  Deviation would result in a temperature change that would hurt the ice cream making process.\n\n14. Steps to correct deviation:\n\n15. What tasks are performed here?  How frequently?  Temperature is monitored by operator when in use.  Oil is drained by maintenance staff monthly.\n\n16. Is equipment accessible?  Equipment is barely accessible -- a ladder must be used.\n\n17. How difficult is it to understand and adjust controls?  The controls are straightforward and easy to use.\n\n18. Are signs, labels and codes clear and easy to understand? Yes.\n\n19. What are the safety/warning systems?  A change in the temperature or the odor of ammonia that may be leaking are the safety/warning systems in place.\n\n20. Can inventory be reduced or material substituted to make this system safer? No.\n\n21. Would functions be better performed through automatic controls or manual procedures? The automatic controls in place work well. \n\n22. Are piping, instruments or valves redundant? No.\n\n23. Where is the nearest drain?  Water source?  Ventilation?  There is a drain in the floor and water readily available in the ice cream make room.  The room is also equipped with an additional large exhaust fan.\n\n24. Where are the relief lines?  Relief lines run to the outside.\n\n25.  Where are the isolation valves? There are individual isolation valves for liquid and vapor at the receiver on the roof.  There are isolation valves in the tank room, but they are shared by  Sweetwater chiller, Cream Tanks, IC Mix Tank, and Milk Cooler.  .  In addition, there are isolation valves where the ammonia is tapped off the shared suction and liquid lines.   The suction valve and the liquid valve is in the overhead near Ice Cream office.  The liquid solenoid is controlled by Y2283 of HTNR 555 PLC>",

The ammonia then flows through regular or metered valves on the manifold to the Ice Cream Sharp Room through labeled piping at 90-130 psi.  The Ice Cream Sharp Room must be between 24o and 0oF.\n\nThe Ice Cream Sharp has one evaporator and a hot gas defrost system.  A solenoid valve (SV1) controls the flow of ammonia into the receiver tank (RCVR1).\n\nThe tank and evaporator work on a flood system.

When the float switch senses a drop in the level of ammonia, it electrically signals the solenoid valve to open, allowing more ammonia into the tank (RCVR1).  When the level of ammonia reaches the set point, the float switch triggers the solenoid valve to shut off the flow.  Analog alarm program 3 also shuts off the liquid flow it the temperature in the room is below set point.  If the run/idle switch on the panel in the spiral anteroom is in run, the set point is -35?F.  If the switch is in idle, the set point is 0?F.\n\nThe liquid ammonia in the evaporator fills coiled pipes from the bottom up.  Fans blow air over the coils causing the ammonia inside to boil.  System pressure maintains temperature in the coil at -30?F. to ?50?F.  Air blowing through the coil gives up heat as it passes through and cools the room.\n\nThe ammonia boils in the evaporator and ammonia vapor goes back into the receiver tank.  The vapor then returns to the compressor room.\n\nThe safety-release valves (RV1 and RV2) will release the excess ammonia vapor into the air outside the plant if pressure should get over 150 psi.\n\nThe ammonia carries a small amount of oil from the compressors.  Occasionally this oil will collect in low spots of the dead leg of the Ice Cream Sharp Room system and needs to be drained through the drain valve (DV1).\n\nThe Ice Cream Sharp Room's hot gas defrost system runs through solenoid valves (SV3 and SV4) and is regulated by check valves (CV1 and CV2).  The sequencing of valves is controlled by EDRUM 5 of NH3545 PLC.    \n\n2.  Equipment List:  ID #33003.  Valves are listed in the valve database.\n\n3.  Quantity of ammonia and maximum spill:  The Ice Cream Sharp Room's volume is 352 pounds.  A maximum spill could result in a loss of 20,000 pounds, the system's entire inventory.\n\n4.

      "SummaryText": "Production of superior dairy products requires the use of some chemicals that could pose a risk to both employees and the public if handled improperly, spilled, or released catastrophically.  The Tillamook County Creamery Association recognizes the duty to protect the safety and health of employees, the community, and our customers.  Therefore, the Tillamook County Creamery Association has developed, and implemented, a Risk Management Plan for anhydrous ammonia.  The purpose of this plan is to keep safe operation a Company priority through establishing policy, identifying risks, documenting maintenance, and tracking compliance with established standards.\n\nThis plan is a living collaborative effort developed by employees, maintenance engineers, and management.  Joanne Breuer, Tillamook County Creamery Association's Safety Director, has been appointed plan manager and will consult with employees on a regular basis regarding the conduct and development of Process Hazard Analyses (PHA) and plan modification. \n\nThe Tillamook County Creamery Association produces natural cheddar cheeses that are aged 90 to 720 days.  Proper aging requires precise temperature control and extensive refrigeration.   As is common in the industry, TCCA uses an anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system in all cheese storage areas.  Approximately 20,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia is contained in the refrigeration system.  It is the intent of the Risk Management Plan to identify and prepare for a worst-case release of anhydrous ammonia.  This plan applies to all ammonia refrigeration units, lines, tanks, and compressors located throughout the facility.  The ammonia is designed in accordance with Oregon Mechanical Code and IIAR Minimum Safety Criteria for a Safe Criteria for a Safety Ammonia Refrigeration Bulletin No. 109.  The design also incorporates ammonia detection systems in the main ammonia compressor/tank room and the ASRS main compressor room.  Further, there are ventilation systems in the c"

      "SummaryText": "ompressor rooms for general ventilation and either automatic or manual ventilation ammonia gas release evacuation system.  To add to the ventilation system portable Supervac fans can be set-up during a release to flush the area and exhaust to the outside.  \n\nThe worst-case scenario identified in the Risk Management Plan is the catastrophic loss of 20,000 pounds of ammonia within 10 minutes.  Such a catastrophic release will have off-site consequences that will require notification, and potential evacuation of nearby residences.  Anhydrous ammonia is a colorless gas or liquid with a readily detectable odor at 0.7ppm.  Ammonia gas is a severe irritant to eyes, skin and respiratory tract.  Exposure to concentrations of 2,500 to 6,500 ppm, which could occur in a worst-case scenario, can cause corneal irritation, shortness of breath, bronchospasms, chest pains, and pulmonary edema, which may be fatal.  Contained in the plan are procedures to mitigate the off-site consequences and procedures to implement resident notification.\n\nAn alternate, more likely, scenario identified in the Risk Management Plan is the release of 1 to 5 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.  A release of 1 to 5 pounds of anhydrous ammonia still presents a risk to employees and visitors.  However, such a release does not have the off-site consequences identified in the worst-case scenario, and will not require notification or evacuation of nearby residences.  Maintenance policy and training have been developed to facilitate immediate resolution of any ammonia leak, before it can develop into a worst-case scenario.  Within the plan are procedures to evacuate employees while repairing the leak. \n\nThe Risk Management Plan also outlines a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) program.  This program identifies each component of the ammonia refrigeration system and evaluates the potential ammonia release risk.  An important item of the PHA program is a \"What-If Analysis\" of each component.  The intent of the \"What-If Analy"

      "SummaryText": "sis\" is to identify ways in which ammonia could be released, and develop a response to minimize the magnitude of the release.  \n\nDevelopment of a Risk Management Plan is a proactive effort by the Tillamook County Creamery Association to protect both the employee, and the community from future releases of ammonia.  While small releases of ammonia do occur, there has not been a release of a reportable amount of ammonia in the past 5 years.  \n\nAnother important aspect of the Risk Management Plan is the Emergency Response Program.  The Emergency Response Program is a written action plan outlining the response of the Tillamook County Creamery Association HAZMAT team to any release of ammonia from the refrigeration system.  The Emergency Response Plan was developed in coordination with Tillamook County Fire Department, Oregon State Police, Tillamook County Ambulance, 911 Emergency Center, and the Tillamook County General Hospital.  Key issues outlined in the plan include: escape routes, decontamination procedures, medical duties, post evacuation procedures, and reporting requirements.  All of the agencies involved in the Emergency Response Program train regularly, and participate in periodic ammonia release drills.\n\nControl over entrance into the facility:  TCCA requires all visitors and vendors to check in at main entrance and or at the plant office for vendors.  The property is fenced on two sides and entrance into the plant ammonia rooms from the outside takes a maintenance staff key.  The main ammonia tank has a locking valve installed.\n\nThe Risk Management Plan developed by the Tillamook County Creamery Association is a dynamic document.  This plan is updated annually, or whenever any component of the ammonia refrigeration system changes.  TCCA is committed to reducing the likelihood of an ammonia release.  To improve process safety, and protect employees and the public, improvements to the ammonia refrigeration system will be implemented when identified."
