      "SummaryText": "The NutraSweet Company (NSC), a wholly owned subsidiary of NutraSweet, owns and operates an aspartame manufacturing facility in Augusta, GA. The facility is located at 1762 Lovers Lane. The facility consists of an L-phenylalanine plant and two aspartame plants that were originally constructed in 1984. Overall, the facility employs 137 full-time and 123 contract employees.\n\nThe NSC is committed to operating the Augusta site in a manner that is safe for its workers, the public, and the environment. As a part of this commitment, NSC has established a system to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility. One component of this system is a Risk Management Program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at the Augusta site and that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) regulation 40 CFR part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule). One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit a Risk Management Plan (RMP) describing the Risk Management Program at the Augusta site.  This document is intended to satisfy the RMP Plan requirement of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of the Risk Management Program at the Augusta Plant.\n\nThe risk management program at the Augusta site consists of the following four elements:\n\n*A hazard assessment to help understand (a) the potential offsite consequences of hypothetical accidental releases and (b) accidents that have occurred during the last five years associated with the use of substances regulated by the RMP rule (regulated substances).\n*A prevention program to help maintain and safely operate the processes containing more than a threshold quantity of a regulated substance (covered processes).\n*An emergency response program to help respond to accidental releases of regulated substances from covered processes.\n*A risk management system that assigns responsibility for specific elements of the RMP program.\n\nInformati"

      "SummaryText": "on further describing these elements is provided in this RPM Plan.\n\nAlthough the risk management program at the Augusta Plant helps provide assurance that the facility is maintained and operated in a safe manner, it is only one component of the safety program. In fact, the Augusta site has a comprehensive safety program in place with many levels of safeguards against release of hazardous substances and injuries and damage from a release of a hazardous substance. OSHA had previously audited all of the PSM regulated processes at this site, including the chemical governed by RMP, for admission into the Voluntary Protection Plan (VPP) program. The agency has awarded \"Star\" status, the highest rating, to the Augusta site and \"Best practice in OSHA\" status to the PSM program. More recently, May 2008, the site was recertified as a \"Star\" site. These awards, our ongoing programs, and our certification letter stating full compliance with RMP regulations, demonstrates our commitment to the safety and health of our employees and the community. \n\nNSC prevents releases of the hazardous substances used at the facility. When a hazardous substance is used at the NutraSweet Plant, the equipment is carefully designed, built and operated to reduce the likelihood of an accidental release. Industry and government standards are closely adhered to in the design, construction, and operation of the equipment.\n\nThe NutraSweet Company limits damage from a release, if such a release occurs by employing the use of an onsite Emergency Response Team (ERT). The ERT members receive formal training in fire fighting, HAZMAT, and emergency medical technicians (EMT) first responder. In addition, the ERT has developed site-specific procedures for each piece of emergency equipment and the personnel who operate it. In addition, ERT members work with the local fire department and with the Richmond County Emergency Management Association (EMA) to help prevent injuries and/or environmental damage if a releas"
