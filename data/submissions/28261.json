The Facility Policy\n\n     The owners, management, and employees of Grand River Ag, Cameron Coop, are committed to the \n     prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur,   \n     the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department and other authorities, to mitigate any  \n     release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2.  Facility Information\n\n     The primary activity at this facility is buying, selling and storing of grain and retailing farm supplies\n     including storage and sale of fertilizer to farmers.\n\n     Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application to the soil for crop\n     production purposes.\n\n     The maximum quantity stored would be 83,000 pounds.\n\n3.  The worst case release scenario and the alternative release scenario\n\n     a.  The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a 1,450 gallon tank\n     released as a gas over 10 minutes, the maximum quantity release would be 6,400 pounds.  The \n     distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is .42 miles.\n\n     b.  The alternative release scenario based on the most likely potential incident is a release from a break\n     in a transfer hose.  The distance to the endpoint (a point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is .46 miles.\n\n4.  The accidental release prevention program\n\n     We have implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of\n     Anhydrous Ammonia, published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc. and the standards of \n     the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111 \"Storage and  \n     handling of anhydrous ammonia\" and Missouri fertilizer laws.\n\n5.  The Five-year Accident History\n\n    "

There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that:\n     have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility, nor to our knowledge\n     have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or\n     environmental damage.\n\n6.  The emergency response program.\n\n     We have:\n\n     a.  A written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 16-910.38.\n\n     b.  Provided state and local authorities the emergency planning a community right-to-know information\n     as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).\n\n     c.  A written emergency response program, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.120\n     including pre-emergency planning and employee training.\n\n7.  Planned changes to improve safety.\n\n     Safety improvement is an on-going process at our facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to\n     assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia\n     safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
