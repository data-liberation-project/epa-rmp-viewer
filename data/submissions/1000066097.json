Planned changes to improve safety; and\n\n?    Management Program\n\n\n\nII.    Menasha's Policies To Protect Health, Environment, and Safety\n\nRisk management and safety are important concerns at Menasha; this RMP formalizes and documents these activities. Menasha is committed to conducting its operations in a safe and responsible manner and to reducing risks to human health and to the environment. It is Menasha policy to comply with all applicable federal, state, and local rules and regulations. \n\n\n\nThis RMP has identified potential hazards and has taken steps to design and maintain a safe facility in order to prevent releases, and minimize the consequences of accidental releases, which could occur. This RMP addresses potentially catastrophic chemical releases that could result in immediate harm and acute health effects to offsite receptors (public and environmental). Menasha has developed an Emergency Action Plan that contains procedures designed to maximize the safety of all employees, contractors, and"

Facility Identification\n\nThe Menasha facility is located at 550 West North Frontage Road in Bolingbrook, Illinois. The NAICS code for the facility is 322211 - Corrugated and Solid Fiber Box Manufacturing. \n\n\n\nThe facility uses ammonia for refrigeration, and is regulated under 40 CFR Part 68, the EPA RMP Rule. There is one (1) refrigeration system onsite that is used for cold storage. \n\n\n\nThe amount of ammonia currently present in the refrigeration system is approximately 18,800 pounds.  The refrigeration system is used to cool the storage coolers and freezers. \n\n\n\nAn aerial photo identifying the site location is included as Appendix A. \n\n\n\nIV.    Hazard Assessment - Worst Case Scenarios (WCS)\n\nAppendix B consists of the RMP*Submit Printout and contains additional information on the worst-case scenario.  Appendix C consists of the offsite consequence analysis data and maps for the worst case release scenario. \n\n\n\nV.    Hazard Assessment - Alternative Release Scenarios (ARS)\n\nAppendix B consists of the RMP*Submit Printout and contains additional information on the alternative release scenario.  Appendix D consists of the offsite consequence analysis data and maps for the alternative release scenario. \n\n\n\n \n\nVI.    General Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nA prevention program is in place to minimize the risk of hazardous chemical releases in accordance with the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (29 CFR 1910.119) and the EPA Risk Management Program.   However, as discussed throughout this document Menasha is continuously improving this program. \n\n\n\nThis prevention program covers those processes that handle ammonia above the threshold quantity for both PSM and RMP rules. The first audit of the PSM program will be conducted on or before September 12, 2020, in compliance with the requirement to conduct PSM audits every three years.  The elements of the PSM / Program 3"

Employee Participation - Menasha has developed a site-specific employee participation plan that ensures employees and their representatives are consulted when conducting and developing process hazard analyses and other information required to be developed under the PSM/RMP regulation.  In addition, the employee participation program will ensure employees and their representatives have access to process hazard analyses and all other information required to be developed under PSM/RMP.  \n\n?    Process Safety Information - Menasha maintains a site-specific PSI program that ensures information pertaining to the hazards, technology, and equipment of the process are properly developed and maintained. \n\n?    Process Hazard Analysis - Menasha has developed a site-specific PHA program that ensures a PHA is conducted initially, at a minimum of every five (5) years, and whenever a change is significant enough to require a change in PSI.  In addition, this program ensures PHAs are conducted in accordance with OSHA and EPA regulations and ensures findings and recommendations of PHAs are properly documented. Menasha conducted an initial PHA study for the ammonia refrigeration system on September 8, 11, and 12, 2017.\n\n?    Operating Procedures - Menasha has updated a site-specific procedure that ensures operating procedures provide clear instruction for different phases of process operations and ensures they are properly maintained.  Menasha developed initial operating procedures for the refrigeration system during August 28, 29, 30, and September 1, and 7, 2017.  \n\n?    Training - Menasha has developed a site-specific training procedure that ensures employees operating the ammonia process have the knowledge to safely operate the process, are aware of the potential hazards of the process, and understand the causes of process problems.\n\n \n\n?
