(PCT).  PCT\u0092s mission is to revolutionize plastic waste into a renewable resource and to do so by operating in a safe and environmentally responsible manner.  PCT is committed to being a responsible member of any community in which it operates.  Achieving consistently high production in manufacturing is not a goal, it is an outcome of the pursuit of safe and reliable operations.  Goal Zero is the name of the safety culture PureCycle has adopted at the Ironton site to drive safe, reliable, and environmentally responsible operations. Goal Zero is about keeping people, the surrounding community, and the environment safe, always.  PCT\u0092s Goal Zero culture can be summarizes via the 3 elements listed below:\n1. A commitment to always follow the rules.\n2. A belief that it is possible to work incident free every day. \n3. A requirement to report and learn from all incidents.\nPCT\u0092s commitment to safe and environmentally sound operations is documented within the Goal Zero program.  All PCT Team Members are trained on the Goal Zero safety culture to ensure accountability and commitment throughout all levels of the PCT organization. \nPCT\u0092s Goal Zero safety culture extends throughout the Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Program for the Ironton PCT site.  As part of the Goal Zero safety culture, PCT affirms to employees, customers, and the community to conduct business with respect and care for the environment.  As part of Goal Zero, PCT believes that all safety and environmental incidents are preventable with the goal of zero incidents.

Through the Accidental Release Prevention program as documented within this report and each PCT site\u0092s Emergency Preparedness and Response procedure (referenced within this report), PCT aims to promote open discussion with employees, visitors, customers, and the community with respect to process operations, including raw materials used and how PCT products are made, and the impacts of such activities on safety, health, and the environment.\n\n1.2 Description of the Ironton Site, Site Processes, and Prioritization of EHS\n\n1.2.1 Description of the Physical Site\nThe Ironton PCT Site is located at 1125 County Road 1A (\u0093CR 1A\u0094) in Ironton, Lawrence County, Ohio.  It is located approximately 100 miles south of Columbus, Ohio near the Ohio River across from the State of Kentucky.\nThe Ironton PCT site consists of approximately 26 acres of land, which is a portion of a former Dow Chemical foam extrusion plant.  This site includes three existing buildings that PCT reused.  \nAn active Norfolk Southern Corporation (\u0093NSC\u0094) railroad mainline forms the northern boundary of this site.  To the south, the Ironton PCT site extends to the boundary of the wooded area around 38.575\u00ba latitude.  \nThe Ironton PCT site is comprised of generally level terrain. Per FEMA Flood Insurance Rate Map 39087C0208D, this site is in Flood Zone X, an area outside the 100-year floodplain within an area of 0.2 percent annual chance of flood hazard. \nHighway access to the Ironton PCT site is convenient over national highways, state routes and county roads.  Access to this site will be from U.S. Route 52 via existing access road from CR 1A.  Rail access is serviced by NSC.  The NSC mainline abuts the northern boundary of the site and a new eastern rail spur will facilitate transport of finished product."

      "SummaryText": "1.2.2 Description of Site Processes and Stationary Source\nCommercial operations at the Ironton PCT site make use of a new, advanced recycling technology taking scrap polypropylene (plastic #5) and recycling it into an ultra-pure recycled plastic.  This process eliminates odors, color, and contaminants from plastic via the following stages:\n\u0095\tMelting & Filtration\n\u0095\tExtraction\n\u0095\tMixing & Settling\n\u0095\tFiltration\n\u0095\tPurification\n\u0095\tSeparation\n\u0095\tExtrusion & Pelletization\nIn simple terms, PCT collects and prepares waste plastic as a raw material, purifies the recycled plastic material, and produces pellets of plastic that can be reused repeatedly without compromise to the end user.\nThe key benefits of PCT\u0092s commercial scale operations at the Ironton site are the following:\n\u0095\tAll unit operations are well-known and commercially available.\n\u0095\tPCT utilizes a solvent-based purification process in which there are no chemical reactions.\n\u0095\tProcess operating conditions are comparable to current polyolefin (polypropylene and polyethylene) production conditions.\nThe solvent used in PCT\u0092s commercial process is near critical and supercritical butane.  Butane is used throughout commercial operations at the Ironton site as evident in the process flow diagram above.  Butane is flammable.  As commercial process operations at the Ironton site contain > 10,000 pounds of butane in storage and in the interconnected process, the commercial process at the Ironton site is covered by OSHA\u0092s Process Safety Management (PSM) standard and EPA\u0092s Risk Management Plan (RMP) rule.  The characteristics and hazards of butane are described on the following page.\n\n1.2.3 Characteristics and Hazards of Supercritical Butane and Safeguards Applied\nSupercritical fluids are those that exist at pressures and temperatures that exceed the critical pressure and critical temperature.  In the supercritical state, fluids are compressible.  Close to the critical point, the fluid density (and hence solubility parameter) and tr"

      "SummaryText": "ansport properties (diffusivity and viscosity) can be dramatically varied from gas-like to liquid-like values by relatively small variations in pressure and/or temperature.  Near critical and supercritical butane is used as the solvent in PCT\u0092s commercial process.\nButane is a highly flammable, colorless, easily liquefied gas that vaporizes at room temperature.  Butane in air has a very low Minimum Ignition Energy (MIE).  When flammable mixtures, such as butane vapor in air at certain concentrations, locate an ignition source, fire can occur.  As such, unintended butane releases at the Ironton PCT site have the potential to result in fire which can subsequently lead to personnel injury and environmental impact.\nTo minimize the potential for leaks of butane at PCT\u0092s Ironton site, inherently safe design, pressure relief systems, Basic Process Control System (BPCS) interlocks, Safety Instrumented System (SIS) interlocks, administrative controls, and extensive operator training have been included.  To minimize the potential for fire should butane leakage occur, flammable gas detectors have been located throughout process operations at Ironton.  These flammable gas detectors have been equipped with alarms that will alert the control room as well as local audible and visual alarms set at 10% of the lower explosive limit (LEL) to provide notification well before any release reaches the flammable/explosive range.  In addition, where necessary, interlocks have been added to automatically take the process to a safe state should 40% of the LEL be reached.  Finally, flame detectors (fire-eyes), sprinklers, and automatic deluge systems have been located throughout process operations to prevent catastrophic consequences.\n\n1.2.4 Worst Case Scenario(s) and Alternative Release Scenario(s)\nThe Ironton site used the EPA\u0092s RMP*Comp program to calculate the distance to an endpoint for the worst-case scenarios (WCS) and alternate release scenarios (ARS).

      "SummaryText": "roughs of the process such that they are familiar with the Ironton site before there is a need to respond to an emergency.  This pre-planning will ensure that Team Members at the Ironton site are aware of the preferred method of notifying the local Fire Department (e.g., activation of any of the manual pull switches, deluge, or sprinkler system automatically sounds an audible alarm and alerts the local Fire Department).  This pre-planning also ensures that members of the local Fire Department are familiar with the stationary source, the hazards of butane, the resources available at the stationary source, and the locations of site resources that can be used to address a fire.\nThe Ironton site has developed the Emergency Preparedness and Response Plan within IRO-SAF-PRC-3000 [4] to respond to releases of butane and other emergencies.  The Ironton site maintains emergency response equipment and personal protective equipment (PPE) for use by Team Members responding to emergencies and members of the local Fire Department.  The emergency response equipment is included in the mechanical integrity program and requires testing, inspection, and preventive maintenance as per RAGAGEP (recognized and generally accepted good engineering practices).  An annual emergency drill will be held at the Ironton site with participation from offsite responding agencies such as the local Fire Department and PCT Team Members to work together to resolve a given scenario (e.g., release of butane).  This pre-planning activity also ensures that members of the responding agency(ies) are familiar with butane storage and usage at the Ironton site, the hazards of butane, the resources available at the stationary source, and the locations of site resources that can be used to address such an emergency situation.  Such exercises also clearly identify the capabilities and limitations of the responding agency(ies).  Copies of the drill records, including recommendations and critiques, are review and main"

PCT Team Members are trained on the Emergency Preparedness and Response Plan when initially hired, when the plan is revised, and when the Team Member\u0092s responsibilities are changed.  All PCT Team Members will receive annual refresher training on the Emergency Preparedness and Response Plan.  In addition, contractors are trained on the Emergency Preparedness and Response Plan such that they understand alarms providing notification of potential emergency situations, how to appropriately respond to such situations, evacuation routes, and muster site locations.\n\n1.6 Planned Changes to Improve Safety\nStudies associated with prevention program elements such as PHAs, incident investigation, management of change, and compliance audits are regularly conducted at the Ironton Site to verify designs and to identify potential hazards.  Recommendations may be developed as a result of these studies and as a result of equipment inspections, safety meetings, review of industry experience, techno"
