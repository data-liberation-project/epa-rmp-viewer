      "SummaryText": "The Midland Wastewater Treatment Plant uses chlorine for disinfection of wastewater. This regulated substance stationary source is located in the disinfection building (blg. #9200) at the south end portion of the wastewater treatment plant property. The maximum volume stored at the facility is 8000 pounds.  The Midland WWTP approach to handling this chemical is safety first.  Annual safety training is performed by a contracted safety consultant and plant management for all operations and maintenance staff.  In addition to in-house training the chlorine supplier is required to supply a training seminar on chlorine safety and handling for all parties that are members in the Saginaw-Midland Water Supply Corporation.  Each year the majority of our staff attends this training.  The Midland WWTP also has implemented a two man procedure for connecting and disconnecting cylinders and receiving shipments of chlorine.  These procedures require a worker to perform the tasks using appropriate PPE and a safety person observing the tasks and carrying emergency communication.  The connection procedures can not be performed unless management is on site.  During this process the safety observer communicates each step of the process to management via radio transmission and the procedure can be observed by management via security camera.  This facility complies with the OSHA Process Safety Management rules and have incorporated accidental release prevention program that includes a chlorine leak alarm system in both the chlorination room and the tank room of the disinfection building, security cameras in the chlorination room and the tank room, and emergency shutoff valve actuator system for the online cylinder.  The emergency shutoff system is activated automatically by the chlorine leak alarm system if an alarm is triggered or by manual controls that are located outside of the building and at the control panel in the administration building.

      "SummaryText": "e disinfection building have been designated as secured areas and only authorized personnel have access.  The chlorine feed and alarm system is inspected three times per day and the alarm system is tested and calibrated monthly.  Video observation of the chlorination room and tank room is displayed 24 hours per day in the control room of the administration building.  Currently there are no changes planned for this program.  The emergency response program utilizes the City of Midland Fire Department and the Midland County LEPC.  Activation of the emergency response plan would take place under a release scenario or system leak alarm.  Midland WWTP has no history in regards to any type of accidental release scenario.  The emergency response plan and the on-site emergency plan for the Midland WWTP is included in the Risk Management Plan manual for the City of Midland WWTP."
