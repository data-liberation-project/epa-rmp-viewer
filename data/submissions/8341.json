Box 100\nMilroy, Mn. 56263\n\nFor further information contact; David Labat, General Manager.\n\nRisk Management Plan-Executive Summary\n\nThe Facility Policy.\n\n     The owners, management, and employees of the Farmers Coop of Milroy are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, the local First Responders and other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\nFacility Information.\n\n     The primary activity at this facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers, storage of pesticides and custom application, all for sale to farm customers.\n     Anhydrous ammonia is received by tanker truck, stored and distributed to, or picked up by farmers.\n     The maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia stored would be 375,000 pounds in storage and nurse tanks\n\nThe worst-case release scenario and the alternate release scenario.\n\n     The worst- case release scenario would be the release of the total of a 30,000 gallon storage tank of anhydrous ammonia in ten minutes time with the maximum quantity released being 132,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the storage tank at 85% capacity as limited by design standards. the distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 PPM) is 1.21 miles.\n     The alternate release scenario is based on a most likely potential incident, which could be a release from a break in a 3-inch piipe lasting two minutes. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 PPM) is .78 miles.\n\nThe accidental release prevention program.\n\n     This facility has implemented the rules and provisions of Minnesota Code of Agency Rules; \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\", 1513.0010-1513.1100.\n\nThe five year accident history.\n\n     There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past fi"
