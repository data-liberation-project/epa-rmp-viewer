As a consequence, there is no report documented in Section 6, Five Year Accident History of the RMP report.\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program: \r\nThe ARLANXEO, USA LLC, Orange site maintains a detailed emergency response plan. A trained emergency brigade and a hazardous material response team are maintained on site.  Disaster drills are conducted on site at least once a year and the site participates in local area emergency response drills.  In addition, the ARLANXEO, USA LLC, Orange Plant participates in the Orange County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and Regional Mutual Aid Committees. The response time for the local emergency management team is less than fifteen minutes to the plant. There are warning lights and signs on the roads leading to the plant to warn motorists in the event of a plant emergency.  The signs are activated by the local Police Department and maintained by the LEPC."

Safety and environmental recommendations from employees, whether made during formal sessions like Process Hazard Analyses (PHA) or upon observation of a potential hazard, are investigated with corrective actions developed, implemented and tracked to completion in order to prevent future occurrence.\r\n\r\nSignificant safety improvements occurring over the last five years include a Health, Safety and Environmental Management System, upgrades in fire protection deluge systems, updated emergency response drills and training, implementation of PHA action items, and implementation of facility siting and building improvement projects.  All non-essential personnel are located away from potential areas for overpressure scenarios or explosion hazards.\r\n\r\nLeak Detection Systems:\r\nThe site maintains a third party on-site Leak Detection and Repairs (LDAR) program. Detected leaks are reported on routine basis and necessary repairs are conducted to avoid major release incidents. There are hydrocarbons detectors located throughout the plant and are inspected and tested at least once a year. In addition, emergency shut-off valves and excess flow check valves are installed in discharge lines of major vessels throughout the plant, and are periodically inspected and tested to avoid catastrophic releases. \r\n\r\n5 Year Accident History: \r\nARLANXEO, USA LLC, Orange site maintains exceptional safety, health and environmental record.

The EPDM (Keltan) Manufacturing Unit was shut down on May 10, 2020. All the unit hydrocarbons and chemicals have been removed from the site and the storage tanks have been safed out. For additional safety, a fence has been erected around the perimeter of the EPDM manufacturing area and only authorized personnel are allowed with a key entry.\r\n\r\nOther changes include a project to install a new Boiler #5 project which includes a 2,000 gallons Ammonia storage tank. The maximum operating level is 85% or 1,700 gallons. This change is documented in Section 3 of the Alternative Toxic Release scenario section. \r\n\r\nFacility:\r\nThe ARLANXEO, USA LLC, Orange site is located in the industrial chemical road, Farm Road 1006 of Orange, Texas. The facility had four operating units, Cobalt Butadiene Rubber (CoBR), Lithium Butadiene Rubber (LiBR), EPR (Keltan) and Therban Rubber manufacturing units, until closure of the EPDM (Keltan) manufacturing unit on May 10, 2020. Therefore, the site now has three manufacturing units supported by a common Utilities department.\r\nThe site now produces three basic types of polymerized synthetic rubber with variations of each type.  These include two different types of polybutadiene rubber and hydrogenated nitrile butadiene rubber. The synthetic rubber produced from the site is used by customers to fabricate consumer products such as tires, hoses, timing belts and several automotive parts. The Utilities area of the plant supplies water, steam, electricity, compressed air, cooling water, potable water, process water and refrigeration for the polybutadiene production units. The Orange site Utiltiies department also supplies steam to a neighbor Chevron Chemical plant.\r\n\r\nHydrocarbons are used as monomers and solvents in the units.  ARLANXEO, USA LLC, Orange Plant inventories all the hydrocarbons used in the plant. There are now two"
