Operating HCC in a safe and environmentally protective manner are values held above all others.  HCC is focused on preventing serious process-related incidents that might affect plant personnel, visitors, the community or the environment.  The HCC process safety management (PSM) program demonstrates this focused commitment.  The HCC PSM program involves the application of management systems to control process hazards through programs, procedures, audits, evaluations, and training that considers safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  \n\nContinuous improvement in safety and environmental performance will be achieved through the Employee Safety Process, Tenets of Operation and Responsible Care?.  Although the management systems for chemical process operations target continuous improvement in the storage, use, and manufacturing of regulated substances, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain a process-related incident in the event one should occur.  \n\nSafety and environmental incidents are to be reported, investigated, root cause determined, and actions taken to avoid similar incidents in the future.  Investigations will be conducted with the objective of determining the causes and prevention of future incidents.\n\nThe knowledge that is gained from accident/incident reports, maintenance records, case histories, and trend analysis of incidents will provide basic information and changes that can be used to help further prevent catastrophic events.  As a tool to help manage this knowledge, Chevron Phillips Chemical Company has implemented a Knowledge Management System (KMS).  This corporate computer based system assists in tracking and sha"

The plastic resin manufacturing processes utilize various regulated flammable chemicals such as ethylene, propylene, 1,3-butadiene, isobutane, propane, and pentane to produce plastic resin.  The specialty chemical manufacturing process utilizes the regulated flammable chemicals such as ethylene, 2-methylpropene and propane to produce a specialty chemical.\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT RESULTS\n\nThe worst-case scenario (WCS), associated with flammable substances at HCC, is an instantaneous loss of the contents of the largest 1,3-butadiene storage vessel.  This WCS assumes the entire inventory of the vessel is released, vaporizes and ignites, resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  Although there are several controls to prevent such a release and to manage the consequences (e.g. periodic inspections of storage vessels, remotely-activated valves used to isolate and limit the release, and the release detection system connected to a plant-wide Emergency Alarm System), no credit for mitigation was taken into account in evaluating the scenario.  The maximum distance to the 1-psi endpoint for this WCS will result in off-site impacts of our industrial neighbors. EPA's OCA Guidance Reference Equations were used to determine if the WCS would result in an off-site impact (distance to 1-psi endpoint). \n\nThe alternative case scenario (ARS), associated with flammable substances, at HCC is the separation of a 3-inch unloading arm of an isobutane railcar during operation.  The ARS assumes the active and passive safety systems are functional and the Emergency shutdown system isolates the release.  The maximum distance to the 1-psi endpoint for this WCS will no"

HCC is an OSHA PSM regulated facility.  Therefore, the elements of the HCC PSM program / OSHA PSM standard, which essentially mirror the prevention program requirement of the EPA's RMP standard, have been in place since 1992.\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nThe intent of employee participation is to ensure that HCC employees are informed, consulted and involved in all aspects of process safety management.  Employees have access to information developed to comply with the PSM standard in the HCC Central Office Building Library.  Examples of employee participation range from reviewing process safety information and Standard Operating Procedures to serving on Process Hazard Analysis teams.  \n\nHCC also utilizes other processes such as company communication tools and the Employee Safety Process to keep employee participation evergreen and provide periodic reminders to the employees that their process safety concerns and suggestions are welcome. \n\n\nProcess Safety Information (PSI)\n\nHCC compiles and maintains written process safety information to enable both the employer and employee the ability to effectively identify and understand the hazards posed by the process.  Written PSI provides employees with a baseline of information to identify hazards of the chemicals used or produced in the process, information about the technology of the process, and information about the equipment in the process.  This PSI provides the foundation for performing the unit Process Hazards Analysis, developing operating procedures, and determining the applicability of management of change.

PHAs are performed on existing and new units in all of HCC's nine covered processes.  The Checklist and Hazard and Operability Study (HAZOP), or other appropriate equivalent methodologies, were used to perform the PHAs on each covered process at HCC.  A PHA results in action items (findings/recommendations) that identify and address perceived potential hazards.  The action items are prioritized for management and employee resolution utilizing the scheme below:\n\nHCC additionally uses an Independent Protection Layer (IPL) Analysis methodology (commonly referred to as Layers of Protection Analysis or LOPA) to integrate process risk management into a unified, comprehensive program and identify Safety Instrumented Systems (SIS) in accordance with ANSI/ISA S84.01-1996 and IEC 61511.  \n\nIPLs can be viewed as ?lines of defense? against a potential incident.  IPLs often decrease the frequency of the potential incident.  Independent Protection Layers (IPLs) are systems used to mitigate serious environmental and process safety risk, identified during the process hazard analysis.  IPLs include specific and identified standard operating procedures, alarms with operator response, safety instrumented systems, emergency shutdown systems, and protective devices.\n\nIPL Analysis is part of the PSM program and is considered to be of the same importance as Process Hazards Analysis (PHA).  Action items are managed and tracked to completion\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nWritten standard operating procedures (SOP) provide clear instructions for the safe operations and control of the process and associated equipment.  SOP's are readily accessible to operations personnel "

SOPs also address safety and health considerations and information on Safe Work Practices.  Revisions to SOP's may be prompted as a result of management of change, process hazard analysis, an annual review of SOP's or input from employees using the SOP?s.\n\nTraining\n\nHCC has implemented a comprehensive training program for HCC employees especially those involved in operating a process.  Operator Training has been developed to equip operators with the knowledge and skill necessary to safely and proficiently perform their job duties.  This training emphasized specific safety and health hazards, emergency operations including shutdown, and safe work practices applicable to the employee's job tasks.  Written tests, oral tests, observation, demonstration and peer evaluations are utilized to verify the training.\n\nRefresher training/certification is provided every three years to operations personnel on the operating units for which they are responsible.  Training in safe work practices is given to employees during new employee safety orientation, annual safety training, special classes and monthly safety meetings.  \n\nContractors\n\nContract employees at HCC provide labor for general maintenance or repairs, turnarounds, major renovations, construction, demolition, equipment installation or specialty work on or adjacent to covered processes.  Thus, their actions may have an influence on process safety.
