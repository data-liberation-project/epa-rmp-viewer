Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at Dow Chemical are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities encompass Manufacturing foam plastic insulation.  We have one regulated substance present at our facility.  This substance is a pentane blend that includes cyclopentane (40 -70%) and Isopentane [Butane, 2-methyl-] (30-60%).  Pentane blend is used as a blowing agent.\n\n\n\n3.    The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-58 Standard, 1998 Edition.    The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nDow Chemical maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses is Checklist.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a re"

The most recent PHA/update was performed on 03/04/2008.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Dow Chemical maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes. Reviews are performed on an annual basis.\n\nTraining\nDow Chemical has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Refresher training is provided at least every year and more frequently as needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nDow Chemical carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nHot Work\nDow Chemical requires the issuance of hot work permits for welding, cutting, and other spark producing procedures on or near the covered process.\n\nManagement of Change\nWritten procedures are in place at Dow Chemical to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures.  At the present time, all the plant procedures follow this process. Process operators, maintenance personnel or any "

Reviews concerning this matter were completed prior to 12/31/02. These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits\nDow Chemical conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented. The compliance audit was conducted on 07/22/2009.  These audits are carried out at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\nIncident Investigation\nDow Chemical promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\n\nEmployee Participation\nDow Chemical truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.  Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  In addition, our employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP rule, including information resulting from process hazard analyses in particular.\n\nContractors\nOn occasion, our company hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities.

Dow Chemical has a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related the contractor's work and the processes.  Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.\n\n4.    Five-year Accident History\nThe Charleston Site has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last 5 years.  Due to our stringent release prevention policies, there has been no accidental release during this period.\n\n5.    Emergency Response Plan\nThe Charleston Site carries a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials.  The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas.\n\nTo ensure proper functioning, our emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced.  In addition, the plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within our processes that would require a modified emergency response.\n\nThe Local Fire Department and Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) receive copies of our emergency plan. \n\n6.    Planned Changes to Improve Safety\nSeveral developments and findings have resulted from the implementation of the various elements of our accidental release prevention program. Installation of a trans flow valve with dual relief devices to allow for yearly testing of the relief devices is a major step we implemented to improve safety at our facility. This change was implemented on 11/03/2003. We also installed additional fencing to improve security around the storage tank and unloading areas. The fencing was installed on 1/10/2003."
