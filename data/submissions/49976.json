The facility is complying with OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) standard, and EPA's\nRisk Management Program rule. The purpose of these regulations is to ensure that the covered process\n(aerosol packaging) is designed, operated and maintained safely. Compliance with these regulations helps to\nprevent releases from this process. Additionally, these regulations require development of procedures to\nminimize releases in the event that they do occur, and to outline appropriate emergency response steps to take\nin the event of a release.\n\nFACILITY DESCRIPTION AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES: APG, located at 2730 Middlebury\nStreet, Elkhart, Indiana, offers full service custom packaging for various consumer product industries, such as\npharmaceutical, household, cosmetic, personal care, and automotive care. The products packaged for these\nindustries consist of liquids, semi-liquid creams, lotions, and aerosols. Some of the types of products that APG packages include: hair mousse, cooking sprays, household cleaners, tire cleaners, air fresheners, breath\nspray, etc. Many of these products are aerosols and use a flammable gas like propane to pressurize the\ncontainers so that the desired product can be sprayed from the aerosol cans. The regulated chemicals used as\npropellants in the aerosol packaging process are:\n\nButane (CAS No. 106-97-8);\nDifluoroethane (CAS No. 75-37-6):\nDimethylether (Methyl ether) (CAS No. 115-10-6);\nIsobutane (CAS No. 75-28-5);\nPropane (CAS No. 74-98-6);\n\nAdditionally, the following chemicals are not normally present at the facility, but may be utilized as propellants\nshould product specifications require:\nPentane (CAS No. 109-66-0); and\nIsopentane (CAS No. 78-78-4).\n\nProcess equipment includes propellant storage tanks, a tank farm for ingredients, filling, packaging, and\nwareh"

This Risk Management Plan includes all processes performed at the North and Main\nPlant (properties on the north side of Middllebury Street) and aerosol packaging performed at the HCI facility\n(properties on the south side of Middlebury Street.) The HCI process contains more than a threshold quantity of\na regulated substance ONLY when a tanker of propellant is used to feed directly to the aerosol packaging\nprocess. Due to the nature of the operations, involving variable types and quantities of regulated substances,\nthis Risk Management Plan involves Predictive Filing.\n\nRELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM: APG maintains a Process Safety Management program for its\naerosol packaging process operation and maintenance. The PSM program has been incorporated as both\npolicy, and most importantly, procedure in everyday operations and maintenance of the aerosol packaging\nprocess. Some of the safety measures that are in place to ensure the safety of APG employees and the\nsurrounding community include:\nGas dectection systems are installed in areas where there is a potential for hazardous levels of flammable\ngas to accumulate.\nState of the art explosion suppression systems have been installed in all areas where flammable gas is\ntransferred to aerosol containers. These systems are designed to detect and extinguish an ignition before a\ncatastrophic explosion can occur.\nAll storage tanks that store hazardous materials are inspected on a periodic basis.\nPeriodic inspections are performed to ensure that all process equipment is adequately grounded. This\nreduces the chance of hazardous static electricity discharge that could ignite flammable vapors.\nTankers are equipped with emergency shutdown capability, adding to the safety of the unloading process.\nPressure relief valves are installed on the storage tanks and piping systems.\nStandardized operating procedures are utilized for unloading and handling of flammable materials.\nVentilation systems are installed to prevent the accumu"

The plan addresses fire, explosion, spills and releases of chemicals, severe weather, and other\ncriteria. The plan details actions to be taken by APG for such emergencies, safety equipment,\ncommunication responsibilities, and coordination with off-site responders. The APG emergency response\nprogram is based on the OSHA requirements for Emergency Action Plans (29 CFR 1910.38 and 1910.119),\nRCRA Contingency Plan (40 CFR 265.5) and HAZWOPER (29 CFR 1910.120). We have trained our\nemployees for emergency response action and maintain a written response plan. The plan has been\ncoordinated with the Elkhart Fire Department and Elkhart County Local Emergency Planning Committee\n(LEPC).\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY: The facility is continually working to improve safety in all areas.\nThe facility encourages input from operation and maintenance personnel, as well as vendor and agency\ninspectors, and responds to address potential improvements. The facility places a high emphasis upon training\nof personel in the areas of safety and environmental awareness, compliance, and response."
