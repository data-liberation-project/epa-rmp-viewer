This tank holds approximately 111,000 lbs. of propane when 88% full.  The Worst Case Scenario as required by EPA, assumes that the tank's contents are fully released as a vapor cloud followed by ignition.\n\n4.1.2  The vapor cloud explosion model, Archie, predicted the propane vapor cloud explosion endpoint (1 psi overpressure) may extend to 0.38 miles from the point of release (See: Appendix B).  Approximately 10 people, in the surrounding community, according to Landview Census data, reside within the radius to the explosion endpoint of 1 psi-overpressure.  There are no other public or environmental receptors within the radius to the explosion endpoint.\n\n4.2  Alternate Case Scenario (ACS)\n\n4.2.1  The Alternate Case Release Scenario for Crider Poultry, Inc. - Stillmore was selected to involve three of the four relief valves lifting on the propane storage tank.  Propane was estimated to have a flow rate from the relief valves (each having an inner orifice diameter: 2.5 inches) of approximately 2,589 lbs./min., determined from an EPA propane relief valve discharge table.  The overpressure scenario condition was estimated to be relieved in approximately 5 minutes.  The resulting vapor cloud could contain approximately 12,945 lbs.\n\n4.2.2  The vapor cloud explosion model, RMPComp, predicted the propane vapor cloud explosion endpoint may extend to 0.12 miles from the point of release (See: Appendix B).  Approximately 5 people, in the surrounding community, according to Landview Census data, reside within the radius to the explosion endpoint of 1 psi overpressure.  There are no other public"

Approximately 111,000 lbs. of propane is contained in the storage vessel on site.  The EPA requires a Risk Management Plan be developed and maintained when the total amount of anhydrous ammonia or propane exceeds the threshold quantity of 10,000 lbs.  No other substances, in quantities subject to EPA RMP certification requirements, are located at the Crider Poultry, Inc. - Stillmore facility.\n\n3.0  Ammonia Worst Case and Alternate Case Release Scenarios ('68.155(c)).\n\n3.1  Worst Case Scenario (WCS)\n\n3.1.1 The new high pressure receiver (installed in June 1999), located outside the new equipment room, contains the largest quantity of anhydrous ammonia, on site, on a predictable worst case basis.  This tank is typically 15 to 30% full during normal"

During plant shutdown or partial operations, this tank holds approximately 10,600 lbs. of anhydrous ammonia when 50% full, under an internal pressure and temperature of approximately 114 psig and 70 0F.  The Worst Case Scenario as required by EPA, assumes that the tank's contents are fully released as a gas/vapor over a 10-minute period.\n\n3.1.2  The dispersion model, Degadis, predicted, with a wind speed of 3 mph and atmospheric stability class F, the anhydrous ammonia release may travel 2.0 miles from the point of release (See: Appendix B).  Approximately 220 people, in the surrounding community, according to Landview Census data, reside within the radius to the toxic endpoint (level of concern = 200 ppm, anhydrous ammonia).  There are residences, one school, and one church within the radius to the toxic endpoint.  (See: Section 9.0)  There are no environmental receptors within the radius to the toxic endpoint. \n\n3.2  Alternate Case Scenario (ACS)\n\n3.2.1  The Alternate Case, more likely, Release Scenario for Crider Poultry, Inc. - Stillmore was selected to involve a relief valve release on a condenser located above the new equipment room.  Anhydrous ammonia (at approximately 150 psi and 77 0F) was estimated to have a flow rate from the relief valve (inner orifice diameter: 0.75 inches) of approximately 71 lbs./min., determined from an ammonia gas release table.  It is estimated that the relief valve could be isolated, or the overpressure condition corrected, in approximately 10 minutes by trained operators on site, with a corresponding anhydrous ammonia quantity released of approximately 710 lbs.\n\n3.2.2  The air dispersion model, Degadis, predicted, with a wind speed of 6 mph and atmospheric stability class D, that the anhydrous ammonia release may travel approximately 0.18 miles.  Approximately 5 people, in the surrounding community, according to Landview Census data, reside within the radius to the toxic endpoint (level of concern = 200 ppm, anhydro"
