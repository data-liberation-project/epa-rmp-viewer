This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances:\nThe China Draw Gas Delivery Point is a storage and sales facility located in Culberson County, Texas. The plant is designed to remove any liquids from the incoming natural gas stream, store NGLs on location in pressurized storage tank, to be transported by truck. The gas exits the facility to a metering skid for sales. The NGL storage tanks contain the largest inventory of regulated flammable substances under the RMP Rule and are considered towards determining the worst-case flammable release scenario for the facility. There are no public receptors within the distance to endpoint from the worst-case flammable release scenario for the facility. Moreover, there are no regulated toxic substances under the RMP Rule that are stored at the facility.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention and Chemical-Specific Steps:\nThis facility was built in accordance with the appropriate mechanical and electrical company and industry codes for gas processing plants. Written programs and procedures cover all critical equipment and all affected employees are well trained in the safe operation of this facility.\n\nFive-Year Accident History:\nThe GDP facility has had no release of a regulated substance in the past five years where exposure to the substance, its reaction products, overpressures generated by explosion involving the substance, or radiant heat from a fire involving the substance resulted in one or more offsite deaths, injuries, or response"
