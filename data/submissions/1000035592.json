      "SummaryText": "of U.S. Hwy 93 and approximately 4.8 miles northwest of the intersection of Highway 93 and Interstate 15. The site is located in Clark County about 20 miles northeast of Las Vegas.  Las Vegas Power Company, LLC, owns the 90-acre site which is within Section 5, Township 18 South, Range 63 East.  Except for a power plant on adjacent property to the south, the site is surrounded by undeveloped industrial zoned properties.  Federal lands managed by the Bureau of Land Management are present to the west of the property boundary.  Further west of the federal lands is the Desert National Wildlife Range. The facility currently stores anhydrous ammonia, a regulated toxic substance under RMP and CAPP regulations, in a steel bulk storage tank.  \n\n\n\nAmmonia is required to be used at the Apex Generating Station as Best Available Control Technology (BACT) for the reduction of nitrogen oxides (nitric oxide and nitrogen dioxide) created during the combustion of natural gas and exhausted from the two Combustion Turbine Generators (CTG) and two HRSG duct burners.  Ammonia vapor is drawn from the top of the storage tank and diluted with air, and injected into the two SCR units to reduce the NOx emissions.\n\n\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is stored in a 15,228-gallon capacity storage tank.  Because the storage tank is restricted from being filled to more than 80 percent, the maximum inventory of the anhydrous ammonia at the Apex Generating Station is 12,182 gallons or approximately 62,130 pounds.  The safety systems for the ammonia process include the following:\n\n\n\n  1. Excess flow valves.  Excess flow check valves protect against tank failure by shutting off flow in the event of a downstream leak.  \n\n\n\n  2. Ammonia detectors.  Four permanently mounted ammonia detectors are located at the ammonia storage tank and both flow control skids have a permanently mounted ammonia detector and local alarm horn. The detectors will activate a local alarm horn and an audible and visual signal on the fire alarm "

Written self-evaluations are used to verify that an employee understands the training material before the process work can be resumed. \n\n\n\nTraining documentation includes:  date of most recent review or revision to the training program, type of training required and the type of competency testing used to ensure staff understands the training.  Ongoing employee training records are maintained.  \n\n\n\nContractors\n\n\n\nThe Apex Generating Station has procedures and policies in place that ensure that only contractors with good safety programs are selected to perform work on and around the ammonia process.  Contractors are properly informed of the hazards, access limitations to these process areas, and "

The Apex Generating Station sets minimum contractor safety performance requirements for work in process areas, holds contractor safety briefings before allowing them near or in the process area, controls access to the process areas, and evaluates the contractor's performance.\n\n\n\nPre-Startup Safety Review and Mechanical Integrity Program\n\n\n\nApex Generating Station ensures that a pre-startup safety review is completed for any new regulated process at the plant, or for significant modifications to an existing covered process that requires a change in the process safety information.  Apex Generating Station maintains the mechanical integrity of process equipment to help prevent equipment failures that could endanger workers, the public, or the environment.  We believe that this program is the primary line of defense against a release.  The maintenance staff addresses equipment testing and inspection, and preventative maintenance schedules.  Our mechanical integrity program includes the following:\n\n\n\n  1. Written procedures for maintaining mechanical integrity through inspection and testing of process equipment, based on instructions of equipment vendors, industry codes, and prior operating experience\n\n\n\n  2. Implementation of written procedures by performing inspections and tests on process equipment at specified intervals\n\n\n\n  3. Training of maintenance personnel in safe work practices such as lockout/tagout, line or equipment opening, and avoidance and correction of unsafe conditions\n\n\n\n  4. Procedures specifying orientation training requirements for contract maintenance employees, as well as requiring contractors to use plant-developed maintenance procedures for process areas\n\n\n\nHot Work Permits and Management of Change \n\n\n\nApex Generating Station requires employees and contractors to employ safe work practices when performing 'hot work' in, on, or around the regulated processes.

Apex Generating Station provides a system and approach to maintain and implement management of changes or modifications to equipment, procedures, chemicals, and processing conditions.  This system allows our employees to identify and review safety hazards or provide additional safety, process, or chemical information before the proposed change is implemented.\n\n\n\nInternal Compliance Audits\n\n\n\nInternal compliance audits are conducted every 3 years to verify compliance with the programs and procedures contained in the RMP.  Apex Generating Station assembles an audit team that includes personnel knowledgeable in the Risk Management Program rule and in the regulatory process.  This team evaluates whether the prevention program satisfies the requirements of the RMP rule and whether the prevention program is sufficient to help ensure safe operation.  The results of the audit are documented, recommendations are resolved, and appropriate enhancements to the prevention program are implemented.\n\n\n\nIncident Investigation\n\n\n\nApex Generating Station investigates all incidents that could reasonably have resulted in a serious injury to personnel, the public, or the environment, so that similar accidents can be prevented.  Apex Generating Station trains employees to identify and report any incident that requires investigation.  An investigation team is assembled and the investigation is initiated within 48 hours of any incident.  The results of the investigation are documented, recommendations are resolved, and appropriate process enhancements are implemented.  Information found during the investigation is reviewed by appropriate staff and is added to, or used to revise operating and maintenance procedures.  Information from audits and any resulting changes in operating procedures are passed onto the training unit for their inclusion in existing training programs, if warrante"

The details of accidental releases are required for accidents that have caused at least one of the following:\n\n\n\n  1. Onsite deaths, injuries, or significant property damage\n\n\n\n  2. Known offsite deaths, injuries, property damage, environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place\n\n\n\nApex Generating Station has not had an accident related to the covered process in the previous 5 years.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program Summary\n\n\n\nApex Generating Station has established a written emergency response plan that is followed by the employees to help safely control accidental releases of hazardous substances.  This program has been coordinated with the Clark County Fire Department, the City of Las Vegas Fire Department, and Office of Emergency Management, members of the Local Emergency Response Planning Committee (LEPC).  This program includes emergency evacuation routes, required emergency notifications, and staff responsibilities in the event of an emergency.  Emergency procedures are also reviewed once per year. \n\n\n\nPlan To Abate Hazards\n\n\n\nDuring the process hazard analyses, additional risk reduction measures were recommended to improve safety, minimize the likelihood and mitigate the effects of an ammonia release at the Apex Generating Station.  A table was used as a  plan to abate hazards identified in the process hazard analysis.  The table includes a description or cause of the hazard, the consequences of the hazard, recommended risk reduction measures, proposed action items to implement the recommendations, a scheduled implementation date, and an actual implementation date.  The table also describes action items for the development of the prevention program and emergency response elements.\n\n"
