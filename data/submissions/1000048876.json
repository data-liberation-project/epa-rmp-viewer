Process safety information and operations/maintenance procedures are documented on-site.  Periodic functions such as process hazard analyses, employee emergency response and process operations training, management of change reviews, and process safety inspections are conducted on a regular basis.  Audits of the overall RMP will be conducted on a regular basis to assure compliance with EPA regulations.\r\n\r\nFive Year Accident History\r\nCHS - Rochelle (formerly Illinois River Energy, LLC) does not have a history of accidents which may have caused death, injuries, environmental or property damage, ev"

      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\r\nCHS - Rochelle (formerly Illinois River Energy, LLC) operates a fuel ethanol plant located in Rochelle, Ogle County, Illinois.  The plant is permitted to produce 133 million gallons of denatured ethanol per year.  In accordance with the United States Environmental Protection Agency's Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions at Title 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 68, CHS - Rochelle has completed a Risk Management Plan (RMP) for covered processes that contain an RMP listed toxic or flammable substance at a quantity exceeding the corresponding program applicability threshold. \r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\nCHS - Rochelle is committed to the protection of its employees, the community and the environment from hazardous substances used in the ethanol fuel production process specifically pentane as a constituent of the natural gasoline used as the ethanol denaturant to make the fuel ethanol unfit for human consumption.  It is the policy of CHS - Rochelle to comply with all applicable federal, state, and local laws.  In the event of an emergency, including an accidental release of natural gasoline, it is the policy of CHS - Rochelle to notify the National Response Center, Illinois Emergency Management Agency, and the Local Emergency Planning Committees for Ogle County, Illinois, and to evacuate all non-essential employees and all visitors from the facility.\r\n\r\nRegulated Substances Handled\r\nThe facility produces fuel grade ethanol from corn and a process by-product known as dry distillers grain with solubles, which is used as a livestock feed.  The fuel ethanol production process requires use of a denaturant (natural gasoline) which is reported to contain up to 30 percent pentane, up to 30 percent isopentane, and up to 5 percent butane, which are RMP regulated flammable substances.  The maximum amount of natural gasoline on-site is estimated to be approximately 1,032,075 pounds (lbs) including approximately 30"
