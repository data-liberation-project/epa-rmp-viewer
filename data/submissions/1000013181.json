The Cedar Bayou Plant is located on the north side of Interstate 10 between Cedar Bayou and Sjolander Road, and is situated on approximately 1,000 acres.  The plant was initially built by Gulf Oil and began operating in 1963.  In 1984, it became part of Chevron through the Chevron-Gulf merger, and is currently part of the Chevron Phillips Chemical Company, LP, as the result of a joint venture.\n\nThe plant produces simple olefins, including ethylene and propylene, and derivatives including polyethylene resins, normal alpha olefins, and polyalphaolefins.  These products are primarily intermediates which our customers use to produce finished consumer products such as plastics and packaging, biodegradable detergents, synthetic lubricants and hydraulic fluids, and waxes.  Chemicals used at the facility that exceed the RMP threshold quantity include flammable mixtures which may contain Methane, Ethylene, Butene, Hexene, Ethane, Methanol, Propane and Propylene; and toxics such as boron trifluoride, aqueous ammonia, chlorine and titanium tetrachloride.  \n\n\nACCIDENT PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nProcess Safety Management at the Cedar Bayou plant complies with the requirements of both the OSHA PSM standard and EPA RMP regulation.  As detailed in site procedure EHSPP 11.12 RMP Overview, the Cedar Bayou plant manages all aspects of process safety through employee participation at all levels in the organization.  Each element of the PSM and RMP standards is assigned to a responsible organizational position to maintain the systems that ensure compliance with regulatory requirements and management of that aspect of process safety.

This ICP includes procedures on responding to hazardous material releases, both large and small, and coordination with on- and off-site responders. \n \nThe Cedar Bayou plant became an OSHA STAR worksite in the Voluntary Protection Program (VPP) in 1997. The site was recertified to STAR status by OSHA in 2000, 2004, and 2008.  This voluntary program is a partnership between OSHA and industry to recognize and encourage excellence and continuous improvement in safety programs.  STAR certification represents the highest form of recognition OSHA can give a company for outstanding safety performance.\n\nChemical specific preventions for flammable chemical mixture OCAs containing 1,3 butadiene might include: pressure relief valves, hydrocarbon area detectors, remote valves to isolate the process, and administrative controls on tank levels.  \nChemical specific preventions for Boron Trifluoride toxic OCAs include: connecting only one tube of a tube trailer at a time, providing video camera surveillance of the tube trailer area, remote-operated valves to isolate the trailer and reduce the amount released, manual BF3 alarms in the unit to notify personnel in the immediate area of a release, and a water deluge system with remote activation to minimize the release footprint (BF3 is drawn to water).  A large capacity truck is used to minimize tubing connections and to decrease truck traffic on roadways.\nChemical specific preventions for titanium tetrachloride toxic OCAs include: an operator in attendance during the entire titanium tetrachloride unloading process can isolate the system remotely while the catalyst supervisor audits the unloading process.  Unloading hoses are designed for a higher pressure service than the system would normally require.  These stainless steel braided hoses are provided with additional support to pre"

There are four chlorine sensors located at all four quadrants of the chlorine cylinder pad which initiate a chlorine alarm in the Waste Treatment and main utilities/1592 control rooms.  In addition, lights flash and horns sound in the area of the chlorine cylinders.  An automatic shut-off valve is mounted on the chlorine cylinder after installing the hose during change-out of the cylinder.  The valve will close automatically if there is a chlorine leak detected.  The valve can also be manually closed from the Waste Treatment control room for the cooling tower chlorine cylinder and from the main utilities control room for the clarifier cylinder.  The valve is tested each time a cylinder is changed.  After changing the cylinder, all connections are checked for leaks. Cylinders are connected at the vapor valve and not the liquid valve.  Vapor releases would be smaller than liquid releases.  Cylinders have been located outside of areas with fire threat potential, and are protected against vehicle impact with concrete and metal posts.\nChemical specific preventions for aqueous ammonia toxic OCAs include:  the containment basin is designed for full volume release; the tank vent space is vented back to the delivery truck during unloading process to minimize air emissions; and an operator is in attendance during unloading operation and can block in the truck if needed.  The ammonia tank is filled by an overhead line with a dip tube into the vessel.
