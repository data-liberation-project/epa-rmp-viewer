KCMO WTPA?s prevention program, safety information, hazard reviews, operating procedures, training, maintenance, compliance audits, and incident investigations are continuously updated.  Every employee of the KCMO WTP remains aware of the potential for chlorine and anhydrous ammonia releases and disturbance of the systems.  \n\n\n\nIn an emergency, the KCMO WTPA?s first consideration is the safety of personnel and the community.  The second consideration is the protection of property, equipment, and the facility.  The KCMO WTP maintains emergency response procedures that allow KCMO WTP personnel to respond to releases when possible.  The KCMO WTP relies on the Hazardous Materials (HazMat) Division of the Kansas City, Missouri Fire Department as well as Emergency Response Teams from private industries to assist in responding to emergency situations.\n\n\n\nAll associates are trained to recognize releases of chlorine or anhydrous ammonia and to activate the alarms and emergency response procedures immediately.\n\n\n\nThe KCMO WTP: Chlorine and Anhydrous Ammonia\n\nThe KCMO WTP is located at 1 NW Briarcliff Road in Kansas City, Missouri.  The plant uses chlorine and anhydrous ammonia to treat water.  The KCMO WTP has the capacity to store anhydrous ammonia in one process, and chlorine in two separate processes.  Since these chemical quantities exceed the Risk Management Plan (RMP) thresholds, these toxic substances must be addressed in the RMP.  The KCMO WTP does not store or use any other toxics or flammables above threshold quantities that are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) through 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 68. \n\n\n\nAccidental Rele"

The hazard review team consisted of plant management, process operation and maintenance personnel, and consulting process design engineers.  The team analyzed the hazards associated with the chlorine and anhydrous ammonia processes using the checklist and what-if techniques.  The hazard review team documented recommendations and set a schedule for implementation.\n\n\n\nThe KCMO WTP has adopted written Standard Operating Instructions (SOIs) that provide system descriptions, specifications, and operating procedures for the chlorine and anhydrous ammonia systems.  The procedures address initial startup, normal operations, normal and emergency shutdown, inspections, temporary operation, restart-up, and consequences of deviation.  Additionally, SDSs are included in the SOIs.\n\n\n\nThe KCMO WTP has a training program with guidelines for conducting regular, structured plant training for associates, including operators and maintenance personnel.  Records of the training program, including content of the course, course manual, examination, and record of attendance are maintained.   \n\n\n\nPreventive maintenance, inspection, and equipment testing is performed to ensure safe operations at the KCMO WTP.  The maintenance program includes a preventive maintenance schedule based on manufacturerA?s recommended instructions.  "

      "SummaryText": "The KCMO WTP and maintenance contractors continually assess the compliance status of the chlorine and anhydrous ammonia facilities through facility inspections and preventative maintenance.\n\n\n\nThe compliance audit process will be performed at least once every three years to ensure that the RMP procedures and practices are adequate and being followed.  To complete a compliance audit, the KCMO WTP must demonstrate that documentation, employeesA? knowledge (interviews), and the physical facility (through inspection) comply with 40 CFR Part 68.\n\n\n\nThe RMP incident investigation program outlines the RMP investigation process.  If the chlorine or anhydrous ammonia incident is reportable, the employee completes an Incident Report form and submits it to the Safety Officer.  The Safety Officer is responsible for making sure the Incident Report Forms are completed.  An Incident Investigation Team investigates how the incident occurred and determines whether errors can be corrected by instituting general or specific safeguards for the process or whether it is necessary to institute additional training for the employees. \n\n \n\nThe Five-Year Accident History\n\nKansas City Missouri Water Treatment Plant has had no releases in the past five years that resulted in an injury or off-site exposure related to either chlorine or anhydrous ammonia.\n\n \n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nThe KCMO WTP developed The One Plan, an Integrated Contingency Plan, as its emergency response program.  In a chlorine or anhydrous ammonia release, The One Plan provides associates direction and guidance to recognize a release, shutdown operations, and initiate emergency response operations.  In an emergency, the Hazardous Materials (HazMat) Division of the Kansas City, Missouri Fire Department will be called immediately after notifying the Plant Manager, followed by the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC), the Missouri Department of Natural Resources (DNR) Environmental Emergency Response Office, and the N"

Every employee of the KCMO WTP remains aware of the potential for chlorine and anhydrous ammonia releases and disturbance of the systems.  The KCMO HazMat does annual training on site, and evacuation drills are conducted annually.  \n\n\n\nIn an emergency, The One Plan is first consideration in the safety of personnel and the community.  The second consideration is the protection of property, equipment, and the facility.  In an actual or potential emergency, the area of the emergency will be secured, the Emergency Coordinator will be notified, and the source will be assessed for corrective measures.  Evacuation procedures include sounding an alert via telephone, cellular phone, radio, or intercom system; gathering at assembly areas where roll call will be taken; shutting down designated equipment; and posting security personnel to isolate the area.  The public will be contacted through the Fire Department or the KCMO HazMat.  The Plant Manager will fill out the report form and submit it to the proper authorities.  The One Plan includes emergency and first aid procedures, training requirements, and program review and update procedures. \n\n\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nTo improve safety, the KCMO WTP made changes based on the Hazard Review conducted for the chlorine and anhydrous ammonia systems.  The review prompted a list of recommendations that were implemented.  The most significant change to improve safety is the implementation of The One Plan in which all personnel and visitors are trained in the emergency response plan and take part in annual drills.\n\n\n\nIn 1999, the KCMO WTP completed construction of a new chlorine storage and feed facility equipped with a scrubber capable of scrubbing a 60,000 pound chlorine release.
