The purpose of the PSM/RM Program is to make safe operations and accident prevention systematic throughout the facility. The PSM/RM Prevention Program contains thirteen elements, tied together by a management system to ensure development, implementation, and integration of the Program requirements.These thirteen elements consist of the following:  Employee Participation, Process Safety Information, Process Hazard Analysis, Pre-Startup Safety Review Program, Standard Operating Procedures, Training, Management of Change, Mechanical Integrity, Hot Work Permits, Contractor Qualifications, Incident Investigation, Compliance Audits, and Trade Secrets.\n\nReddy Ice corporate management and Reddy Ice-East Point management are committed to operating safe and compliant facilities for the protection of its employees, the public, and the environment. Reddy Ice facilities are designed with multiple safeguards pertinent to the anhydrous ammonia process, including engine room ventilation, failsafe controls that shut down the compressors if operating limits are exceeded, the capability of shutting down the entire system if required, and computerized PLC controls in some facilities. Ammonia detection units/alarms are installed to notify employees or offsite personnel in the event of an ammonia release. Administrative controls are in place, which limit the utilization of vessels at between 25% and 50% of their maximum intended capacities.\n\nThe company has also developed an Emergency Action Plan that includes procedures for notification of emergency authorities/agencies and the public, evacuation of personnel, and first responder duties by trained refrigeration personnel.",

The facility maintains approximately 28,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant for ice making and cold storage. \n\nThe refrigeration operation consists of two standard design ammonia systems consisting of compressors, condensers, storage tanks, ice makers, and freezer vaults. Each system has numerous protective controls including motor overload, high temperature and pressure, low suction pressure, low oil pressure, high and low liquid level cutouts, and pressure safety relief valves on all applicable equipment. Ammonia detectors and alarms are installed throughout the plant. \n\nAnhydrous ammonia, when properly used, has proven to be a safe and reliable refrigerant. The sharp odor of ammonia provides its own warning agent. Practically all accidents involving anhydrous ammonia can be avoided through the facility's program of proper training; knowledge of the equipment and procedures; and conducting preventive maintenance on all ammonia equipment. Reddy Ice has instituted administrative and engineering controls as well as training programs on the corporate level to prevent such accidents.\n\nThe facility has multiple safeguards pertinent to the anhydrous ammonia process. These include an ammonia detection and alarm system, exhaust purge fans, controls which shut down the compressors if operating limits are exceeded, and the capability of shutting the entire system down if required. Administrative controls are in place that limit the utilization of vessels to approximately 25% to 50% of their intended capacities.\n\nThe company has developed an emergency action plan that includes procedures for notification of emergency authorities/agencies and the public, evacuation of personnel, and first responder duties by trained refrigeration personnel.\n\nRISK MANAGEMENT PREVENTION PROGRAM 3\nBased on the Reddy Ice-East Point facility's ammonia inventor"

This accident prevention program is a way to make safe operations and accident prevention systematic throughout the facility. Reddy Ice corporate management and Reddy Ice-East Point management are committed to operating a safe and compliant facility for the protection of its employees, the public, and the environment. A Combined Process Safety Management/Risk Management (PSM/RM) Program has been developed to meet the accidental release prevention requirements of both EPA's Risk Management Program (40 CFR Part 68) and OSHA's Process Safety Management Standard (29 CFR 1910.119) under the Clean Air Act. The Combined PSM/RM Program contains thirteen elements, establishing requirements for employee participation, safety information, hazard analysis, pre-startup safety review, standard operating procedures, employee training, management of change, mechanical integrity/preventive maintenance, hot work permits, contractor qualifications, release incident investigation, compliance audits, and trade secrets. These elements are tied together by a management system to ensure plant-wide development, implementation and integration of all the Program requirements.\n\nMANAGEMENT SYSTEM\nA management system has been developed to oversee the implementation of the PSM/RM Program elements. The plant manager has been identified as PSM/RM Program Coordinator, with overall responsibility for developing, implementing and integrating the Program requirements. Under the PSM/RM Program, various responsibilities have been assigned to other individuals. The plant engineer is responsible for portions of the program closely tied to the refrigeration equipment and operation. A rotating safety committee is selected each month to present a safety meeting and address any safety issues brought up by employees during the month.\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT\nAs required by "

      "SummaryText": "the Risk Management Program regulations, the Reddy Ice-East Point facility has conducted a hazard assessment including offsite consequence analyses (OCAs) for potential accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. The OCAs describe the potential offsite exposure to surrounding areas from an accidental release. Worst-case and alternative release scenarios from facility, company, and industry history were studied and calculated using the EPA RMP*Comp modeling program, and the potentially affected offsite population and facilities were identified.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nThe Reddy Ice-East Point facility has had one release since 2004 that would potentially require reporting as part of a five-year accident history. In September 2004, a ceiling-mounted refrigeration unit fell, causing a less than 200-pound release and resulting in approximately $26,000 in physical damage.\n\nEMERGENCY PLANNING AND RESPONSE\nThe Reddy Ice-East Point facility operates under an Emergency Action Plan (EAP) that includes procedures for: notifying plant personnel, the public, and local emergency responders; emergency evacuation/response procedures; use of emergency alarms and equipment; employee training in evacuation and response procedures; first aid for ammonia exposure; and periodic review and updating of the emergency action plan. The plan is reviewed regularly for verification of data, and revised and updated as necessary to reflect changes in facility operations and personnel.\n\nAs required, the facility has coordinated emergency response activities with the Fulton County LEPC and the East Point Fire Department, and has appropriate mechanisms in place to notify emergency responders if needed. The ammonia inventory is verified and reported annually to the state and local authorities, and the plant is incorporated into the community emergency response plan developed under 42 USC.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES\nThe Reddy Ice-East Point facility operates an ongoing program of facility preventive and predic"
