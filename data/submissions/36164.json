Hydrocarbon detectors with alarms\n\nRelease Containment/Control\n\nAutomatic Emergency Feed Shutdowns;\nAutomatic and manual sprinkler systems;\nCentralized alarm system;\nFully trained emergency response team;\nCommunications systems (e.g. radio, emergency phones, PA system, emergency call procedures);\nFire water system (e.g. hydrants, monitors, hose stations, backup firewater systesm); and,\nDiking and burn pits for pyrophoric liquids.\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nNo releases of regulated substances have occurred in the last five years that have resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or know deaths, injuries, evacuations, shelting-in-place, property damage, or environmental damage off site. \n\nEmergency Response Program Information\n\nPPC maintains a written Emergency Response Plan (ERP), which aims to protect employees, public health, and the environment.  The purpose of the ERP is to minimize the impact on the facility and surrounding areas in the event of an emergency situation.   The plan consists of procedures for responding to emergencies such as fires or flammable vapor releases, medical emergencies, hurricanes, tornadoes, power outages, radiological emergencies and bomb threats.  The plan addresses all aspects of emergency response including"

      "SummaryText": "LDEQ Facility ID 30922\n\nExecutive Summary\n\nThe Pinnacle Polymers Company (PPC) Garyville Facility is committed to operating in a manner that is safe for PPC workers, the public, and the environment.  It is PPC's policy that in the conduct of its activities it will strive to protect and promote the health and safety of its employees, customers, and others who may be affected by these activities, and to limit adverse effects on the physical environment in which its activities are carried out.  As part of this policy, PPC has established systems to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility.  One part of these systems is a risk management program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at PPC and complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) rule 40 CFR part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule), and the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality regulation (LAC 33:III, Chapter 59).  One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit a risk management plan (RMPlan) describing the risk management program at PPC.  This document is intended to satisfy the RMP Plan executive summary requirement of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program at PPC.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nPPC is committed to the safety of the general public and PPC employees and to the preservation of the environment.  One primary portion of this commitment is the prevention of accidental releases hazardous substances in and around the facility.  PPC utilizes engineering controls, Inspection programs, and detailed procedures as a means to prevent accidental releases.  In the event of a release, the facility has an emergency response team trained to contain, mitigate, monitor and stop the release.   Additionally, the emergency response team is fully staffed and trained for fire fighting, medical emergencies, and other emergency situat"

In addition to handling the emergency, the facility has also established a wide variety of communication systems to alert the community in the event of a significant release.  In conjunction with the local emergency planning committee (LEPC), the facility has ability to notify the local community through cable override systems, radio broadcasts, and other methods available to the LEPC.\n\nThe PPC Executive Vice President has overall responsibility for the development and implementation of the risk management program.  However, the specific responsibilities for certain aspects of that program have been delegated to other personnel who report to the Executive Vice President either directly or through other management personnel.  Those relationships are depicted on the plant organization chart.  Specific responsibility for the implementation of the process safety management (PSM) and accident prevention program has been delegated to the Environmental, Health & Safety Manager.  The plant's emergency response program, including compliance with the RMP aspects of that effort, is also the responsibility of the Environmental, Health and Safety Manager.\n\nPPC REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nPPC is a manufacturer of polypropylene and is located in Garyville, Louisiana.  The PPC process contains propylene, which is a flammable substance that EPA has specifically listed in the RMP rule and is present in the process above the EPA threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds.  Toxic substances used or stored at PPC do not meet or exceed the listed threshold quantities.\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe following is a summary of the of the accident prevention program in place at the PPC.  Because the processes at the facility that are regulated by the EPA's RMP regulation are also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) process safety management (PSM) standard, and because the OSHA PSM requirements are ver"

      "SummaryText": "y similar to the EPA RMP requirements, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements. The PSM program at this facility has been extended by PPC, where necessary, to satisfy EPA's Program Level 3 accident prevention program requirements.\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nPPC encourages employees to participatein all facets of process safety management and accident prevention.   PPC consults with empolyees on the conduct and development of Process Hazard Analyses (PHAs) and the development of the elements of OSHA;s Process Safety management (PSM) standard.  Empolyees have access to all information created as part of PPC's PSM and accident prevention programs.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nPPC completes a compilation of written Process Safety Information before conducting any PHA required by the OSHA PSM standard.  The compilation of written process safety information is to enable PPC and the empolyees involved in operating the process to identify and understand the hazards posed by those processes involving highly hazardous chemicals.  This Process Safety Information includes information pertaining to the hazards of the highly hazardous chemicals used or produced by the process, to the technology of the process, and to the equipment in the process.\n\nInformation pertaining to the hazards of the highly hazardous chemicals in the process consists of the following:\na) Toxicity information;\nb) Permissible exposure limits;\nc) Physical data;\nd) Reactivity data;\ne) Corrosivity data;\nf) Thermal and chemical stability data; and,\ng) Hazardous effects of inadverten mixing of different materials that could foreseeably occur.\n\nThe above chemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is normally provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs).\n\nInformation pertaining to the technology of the process includes the following:\n\na) Process chemistry;\nb) Maximum intended inventory;\nc) Safety upper and lower limits for such"
