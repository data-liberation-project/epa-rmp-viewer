Therefore, Sulfur Dioxide is not regulated by 40 CFR 68.\n\nThe maximum quantity of Chlorine which may be stored at the SS - Pollution Control Plant is 8,000 pounds.  Chlorine is regulated by 40 CFR 68 - Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions.\n\nThe City of Siloam Springs certifies that they have had no reportable chemical release accidents withine the last five (5) years.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario considered is a full 2,000 pound container of chlorine released in 10 minutes.  The distance to worst-case toxic endpoint is 2.23 miles.  Calculations by RMP Comp with Mitigation  considered is that containers are in enclosed space in direct contact with outside air - shed w/1 side open.\n\nThe alternative release scenario considered, is a full 2,000 pound cnotainer released through a broken 5/16 in container valve in 133 minutes.  The distance to alternative toxic endpoint is 0.20 miles.  Calculations by RMP Comp with Mitigation considered is that containers are in enclosed space in direct contact w/ outside air - shed w/1 side open.\n\nThere are public receptors:  Residencies, Schools, Hospitals, Prison/ Correctional Facilites, Recreation Areas and Major Commercial, Office, or Industrial Areas within the worst case toxic endpoint.  Therefore SS - Pollution Control Plant Program Level is Program 2.\n\nThere are public receptors:  Schools and Residences within the alternative release toxic endpoint.
