Employees who may work as members of the first responders may return as a first responder to assist in mitigating the situation. \n\n\nThere are no improvements, repairs, or upgrades needed or expected in the near future.  \n\nThe plant is inspected annually by the Kansas Department of Agriculture and is maintained according to all local, state and federal rules and regulations.\n\nThere are no current plans to upgrade the facility.  As the state adopts more current ANSI standards we will budget needed improvements and make the necessary changes."

If an accidental release should occur, the facility id prepared to work with the local fire department or authorities to mitigate and release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.  The General Manager of this company is a member of the local volunteer fire department, which helps insure a clear line of communication.\n\nThe primary activity at the storage of anhydrous ammonia is for the sale to farmers.  Ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application for crop production nutrients.  The maximum quantity stored would be  131,070   in 1-30,000 gallon tanks. There are a total of 20-1,000 gallon tanks that can hold a total of 87,380# when filled to the maximum level of 85%.   This allows for a total of 310,199#.  The maximum quantity handled would be the unloading of a semi trailer holding 41,000 pounds.  \n\nThe worst-case scenario and the alternative case scenario have been removed from the summary at the request of the EPA.  This is due to security concerns.  The figures for distance to endpoint and population have been given to the first responders as part of th RMP.  Population data was achieved by calling the Harper County Courthouse.  \n\nThe facility is included in the company training plan, with a goal of annual training for all employees.  This training includes safety information, hazards, operating procedures and the maintenance of an NH3 plant.  Goggles and gloves are stressed for all employees who are involved in loading nurse tanks.\n\nThe Anthony Farmers Coop reports having one NH3 related accident at this facility in the last five years.  A faulty valve caused an employee to be burned on the arm and face with Anhydrous Ammonia.  The employee was treated and released.  The incident happened in 2001.  All employees were notified on what happened and reminded to check"
