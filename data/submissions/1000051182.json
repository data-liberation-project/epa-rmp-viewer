Each tank has a nominal capacity of 36,000 gallons each (maximum fill capacity of 32,400 gallons).  There are three n-butane storage tanks within the Don A. Campbell 1 process fence line.  There is one n-butane storage tank within the Don A. Campbell 2 process fence line.  The tanks are typically operate near empty, leaving room to fully evacuate the content of a single OEC during major plant maintenance activity.  The capacity of three tanks is necessary to contain the n-butane from one OEC.  Some of the storage capacity at Don A. Campbell 1 is utilized to evacuate n-butane from the OEC at Don A. Campbell 2.  To facilitate that transfer, there are liquid and vapor n-butane transfer lines between the two processes.\n\n\n\nThe maximum total projected amount of n-butane to be stored within the Don A. Campbell 1 process is 530,878 pounds (reflects the inventory in the operational OEC and one storage tank containing two, full truck-loads of n-butane which is approximately 18,000 gallons). The maximum total projected amount of n-butane to be stored within the Don A. Campbell 2 process is 531,633 pounds (reflects the inventory in the operational OEC and one storage tank containing two, full truck-loads of n-butane which is approximately 18,000 gallons).   The use of n-butane in a process in a quantity greater than 10,000 lbs requires compliance with PSM (29CFR1910.119), RMP (40CFR68) and CAPP (Nevada Administrative Code 459.952 to 459.95528).  Don A. Campbell 1 has had n-butane on site since 2013 and Don A.

These safe work practices apply to both employees and contractors.\n\n\n\nMaintenance Procedures: A Mechanical Integrity Program (MIP) has been initiated at the Don A. Campbell\n\nfacility. The MIP adopted a maintenance concept for periodic preventative and corrective maintenance of the OEC systems. The preventative maintenance tasks include visual inspection, lubrication of rotating parts, system cleaning, replacing liquids and filters, and periodic tests to verify that the system is in proper operating condition. Preventative maintenance tasks and procedures are scheduled to be undertaken over a series of maintenance intervals.\n\n\n\nAlarm system maintenance is determined using a combination of regulatory requirements, manufacturer's recommendations, plant operating experience and best practices.
