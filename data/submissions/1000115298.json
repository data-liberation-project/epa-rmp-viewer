This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the refinery\u0092s processes. The objective is to implement effective controls to prevent releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, the refinery's trained personnel will respond to control, contain, and mitigate the release. \n\nTorrance Refining Company addresses all aspects of the business that can impact safety, health and process safety performance.  Torrance Refining Company encompasses all elements of OSHA's Process Safety Management standard and EPA's Risk Management Program.\n\n2.1.2\tSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\nTorrance Refining Company LLC is located in Torrance, California, U.S.A., operates a variety of processes to produce petroleum products (e.g. propane, butane, gasoline products, jet fuels, diesel fuels, asphalt and coke) from crude oil. The refinery contains a threshold quantity of several regulated flammable substances, and one toxic substance, modified hydrofluoric acid (MHF).  Anhydrous ammonia is also in use in one process, but in quantities less than the threshold quantity of 10,000 lbs.\n\nIn accordance with 40 CFR 68.150, in 2014 the refinery prepared a 5-year update to the previous Risk Management Plan (RMP).  The refinery contains a total of eleven covered processes for the purpose of this report. Each process is listed below along with the category of regulated materials contained within the process:\n\nProcess 1:\tDIB Butane Processing - Flammables\nProcess 2:\tFuel Gas Treatment \u0096 Flammables \nProcess 3:\tMHF Alkylation \u0096 Flammables, Toxics (HF Acid)\nProcess 4:\tHydrocracker - Flammables\nProcess 5:\tHydrotreater - Flammables\nProcess 6:\tNorth Coker - Flammables\nProcess 7:\tOil Movem"

The Torrance Refinery Process Safety Management System consists of 19 elements. These 19 elements address the various requirements of the EPA Risk Management Program. All 19 elements have a system plan which shapes the methodology, standards, and practices for that specific element.\n\nThe following shows the framework the Process Safety Management System at the refinery has to address each element of the General Accidental Release Prevention Program:\n\n\u0095\tManagement Leadership, Commitment, and Accountability\n\u0095\tPersonal Safety Program\n\u0095\tOccupational Health \n\u0095\tWork Permits \n\u0095\tManagement of Change \n\u0095\tRisk Assessment and Management\n\u0095\tFacility Design and Construction\n\u0095\tOperating Procedures\n\u0095\tMaintenance Procedures\n\u0095\tCritical Equipment\n\u0095\tMechanical Integrity\n\u0095\tRegulatory Compliance\n\u0095\tEmergency Preparedness\n\u0095\tCommunity Awareness \n\u0095\tInformation & Documentation\n\u0095\tIncident Investigation & Analysis\n\u0095\tAssessment & Improvement\n\u0095\tTraining\n\u0095\tPersonnel\n\nEmployee Participation\nThe refinery encourages employees to participate in process safety management and accident prevention. Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling operating and maintenance procedures to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team. Employees have access to information created as part of the refinery accident prevention program. \n\nProcess Safety Information\nThe refinery keeps a variety of documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment desi"

Specific groups within the refinery are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to date process safety information.\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment consideration, is provided in safety data sheets (SDSs). This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals. For specific process areas, the refinery has identified Operating Envelopes: i.e., documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters such as temperature, level, pressure, flow and compositions. The refinery ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using computerized process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective systems both passive and active (e.g., automated shutdown systems, alarm systems, pressure relieving systems, dikes, pressure vessel design, and technology).\n\nInformation about the design and construction of process equipment includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment. This information, in combination with maintenance procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA) \nThe refinery has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled. Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nThe refinery primarily uses the Guide Word Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) study that is an adaptation of widely used industry methodologies to perform these evaluations.

These analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating experience and engineering expertise on the process to be evaluated. The PHA team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process, as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\nSafeguard Protection Analysis\nIn addition to the Guide Word Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) study during Process Hazard Analysis, the PHA team performs a Safeguard Protection Analysis to determine the effectiveness of existing individual safeguards, the combined effectiveness of all existing safeguards for each failure scenario in the PHA, the effectiveness of safeguards recommended in the PHA, and effectiveness of additional or alternative safeguards that may be needed.\n\nThe refinery primarily uses Layer of Protection Analysis (LOPA) for risk assessment and reduction.\n?\nOperating Procedures\nThe refinery maintains procedures that address modes of process operations, such as:\n\u0095\tStartup\n\u0095\tShutdown\n\u0095\tNormal\n\u0095\tTemporary\n\u0095\tEmergency Operations\n\nThese procedures are used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a consistent basis for training of new operators.

New employees receive basic training in refinery operations. After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with an experienced operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks. After employees demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstrations) they have adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.\n\nTraining is also provided for each employee involved in maintaining the ongoing integrity of process equipment. This training includes an overview of the refining process and its hazards. Training is provided on specific procedures applicable to the employee's job tasks to assure that the employees can perform the job tasks in a safe manner.\n\nContractors \nThe refinery uses contractors to supplement its workforce.
