The plan addresses fire, explosion, spills or releases of toxics, severe weather, and other criteria. The plan details response actions by facility personnel for such emergencies, safety and emergency equipment, communication responsibilities, and coordination with off-site responders, as well as notification of federal and state agencies. The plan includes Emergency Response to Chlorine, specifically addressing incidents involving the chlorination process.  The plan has been coordinated with the Racine Fire Department.\r\n\r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY:  \r\nThe facility personnel continually review the plant processes for improvements in safety, quality, and performance, and, the facility is periodically inspected by regulatory agencies for compliance with permit and regulatory requirements. Input from these sources is addressed as quickly as possible."

      "SummaryText": "SAFETY AND ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY:\r\nRacine Water Utility is committed to safety and environmental excellence. This commitment is embraced by each member of our team, no matter what position or area. Our active role includes an obligation to point out any deficient safety or environmental practices that are observed anytime, anywhere. Positive reinforcement will be our primary motivation tool to benchmark satisfactory performance. Safety hazards or environmental concerns are exposed and relayed to team members without fear of reprisal or resentment. Great safety and environmental records are a team effort.\r\n\r\nFACILITY DESCRIPTION AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES:  \r\nThe Racine Utilities Water Utility is located at 100 Hubbard Street, Racine, Wisconsin, 53402.  Among the processes required for proper treatment of potable water is the chlorination process.  The chlorination process adds chlorine gas to process water to reduce bacteria. Chlorine is received in ton containers. The chlorination process has a designated area for storage and process activities.  The process has been designed in accordance with all local, state, and federal codes and requirements. The process has a gas detection system that alarms should the concentration of chlorine reach 1.0 parts per million. The chlorination process is maintained and operated by personnel certified by the State of Wisconsin as Surface Water Treatment Plant Operators.\r\n\r\nGENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM:\r\nThe facility has implemented a Process Safety Management program for its chlorination process operation and maintenance. The PSM Program has been incorporated as both policy, and most importantly, procedure in everyday operations and maintenance of the chlorination process. Among the many safety features present at the facility are:\r\n\r\nChlorine detection and alarm.\r\nEyewash and safety showers.\r\nPersonal protective equipment, including emergency respirators.\r\nEmergency leak repair kits.\r\nEmergency communication systems."
