      "SummaryText": "The accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at the facility:\n\nAshland Distribution Company (Ashland) relies on numerous programs to ensure early identification of and proper response to potential emergencies, including: \n\n     Training and drills in emergency preparedness, hazardous materials training, disaster response \n     and control, first-aid, and fire-and-rescue techniques; \n\n     Frequent auditing of all preparedness programs, safety training and education; and\n\n     Regular review, follow-up, and maintenance of all company operations and equipment.  \n\nOur facilities regularly invite local fire departments and emergency responders to tour and inspect our plants, participate in joint emergency drills and gain familiarity with our operations.  Many of our employees are members of Local Emergency Planning Committees.  Our facilities have written emergency preparedness plans that are updated regularly.  \n\nAshland facilities typically host open houses every 3 to 5 years as an opportunity for neighbors to learn about our commitment to safety.  Ashland makes an effort to support our communities through sponsorship of local activities and participation in many local organizations.\n\nA description of the facility and the regulated substances handled:  \n\nThis facility is a chemical distribution warehouse.  The regulated substance arrives via rail car, is stored in an above-ground storage tank, is repackaged into drums, is transferred to storage, and subsequently loaded for shipment.  The regulated substance handled is pentane.  \n\nFor more information, visit our web site at www.ashdist.com or contact the Plant Manager.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario:\n\nThe USEPA RMP regulations require the worst-case release scenario to assume that the entire contents of the largest vessel are released.  This event is unlikely and has never occurred at our facility.  Based on our analysis using USEPA-approved methods, the worst-case release scenario for pentane co"

There were no specific administrative controls or mitigation measures considered in the analysis to limit the distance reported.\n\nThe alternative-case release scenario:\n\nThe USEPA RMP regulations require an analysis of the alternative-case release scenario.  The alternative-case release scenario represents an accidental release that is more reasonable than the worst-case, but is still highly unlikely to occur.  Based on our analysis using USEPA-approved methods, the alternative-case release scenario for pentane would only impact offsite industrial and commercial receptors.  There were no specific administrative controls or mitigation measures considered in the analysis to limit the distance reported.\n\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps:\n\nThis facility is operated in strict accordance with the USEPA prevention program requirements.  A written management system is in place along with written operating procedures.  Our management system procedures ensure rigorous training for operations employees, numerous management checks and balances, and strict attention to changes in the operations with a thorough review and examination of potential incidents that could lead to an accidental release.  Ashland maintains a 24-hour corporate emergency reporting system that can speedily coordinate emergency response with management and quickly communicate key first aid or medical information to local health care providers.  This facility has emergency medical treatment information readily available for use in an emergency.  \n\nFive-year accident history: \n\nWe have never had a release of pentane that have resulted in or could have resulted in an offsite impact.\n\nThe emergency response program:\n\nOur employees will not respond offensively to releases of hazardous materials, but will rely on local emergency responders in the event of a release.

We make changes to improve safety based on comments and information developed within our organization and the industry.  Toward continuous improvement, we are looking at ways to minimize risk through process improvement and re-design.
