This philosophy involves making each and every employee and contractor accountable for their own safety as well as that of the community around them.  As a company we follow a close adherence to all applicable federal, state, and local laws to ensure a safe and healthy environment for all.\n\n\n\nEmployees who enter the Henderson Gas Plant complete a thorough training, both in the classroom and on-the-job, that enables them to address emergency issues as they arise.  This preparation includes standard operational, emergency operational, and release prevention training.  In addition, periodic refresher courses help to keep operators' problem solving abilities up to date and in sync with our recurring safety improvements.  Our regular internal audits provide an excellent checks and balances system for monitoring these high standards that we set.\n\n\n\nThe Henderson Gas Plant, located in rural Rusk County, Texas, operates a variety of processes to recover petroleum products (e.g., natural gas, propane, butane, condensate) from field gas.  The Henderson Gas Plant consists of a cryogenic processing unit, a front end amine treating unit, a glycol dehydration unit, and outlet compression.  As inlet gas enters the plant it flows through an inlet separator where pipeline liquids consisting of water and hydrocarbon condensate are dropped out and sent to condensate or produced water storage tanks.  The separated gas then flows to the amine treating unit for CO2 removal.  The gas then flows to a glycol dehydration unit.  From the glycol dehydration unit, the partially dried process gas flows to a mol sieve regenerator for further dehydration prior to entering the cryogenic process unit.  In the cryogenic processing unit, the gas flows through a series of exchangers,"

The recovered NGLs pass through a 30,000 gallon NGL surge tank prior to sales via pipeline.  The facility consists of multiple small lube oil, waste oil, condensate and fuel tanks and their associated piping, valves, pumps, and compressors on site that support the compressor station as well as the NGL tanks.  As such, the Henderson Gas Plant is classified as a Program 3 RMP facility.\n\n\n\nThe purpose of the Risk Management Plan (RMPlan) is to provide information about our operations at the facility, our programs to prevent accidental chemical releases, our emergency response plans in case an accidental release should occur, our 5-year accident history, and our planned changes to improve safety at the facility.  \n\n\n\n&#8195;\n\nWorst Case and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\n\n\nAs specified by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) RMP Regulations, our worst-case release scenario for the flammable mixture would be the loss of all of the liquids in our largest vessel causing a vapor cloud explosion.  For the flammable mixture at the Henderson Gas Plant, this would involve our 30,000 gallon NGL surge tank (92,789 pounds).  For propane at the Henderson Gas Plant, this would involve our 18,000 gallon propane tank.  Such scenarios are highly unlikely; however, using the EPAs RMP*Comp calculations, the distance at which the resulting vapor cloud explosions could cause an overpressure of 1 psi would be approximately 0.4 miles (approximately 2,100 feet) for the flammable mixture and 0.3 miles (approximately 1,585 feet) for propane.  An overpressure of 1 psi is the EPA's threshold for measurable impacts. \n\n\n\nThe alternative release scenarios, characterized as a more likely scenario that would involve offsite consequences are calculated to reach approximately 0.3 miles (approximately 1,585 feet) fo"

These distance calculations are also based on the EPAs RMP*Comp, which is known to be highly conservative and should over predict any potential release from such a scenario.  We have selected the alternative release scenario based on a release from our 30,000 gallon NGL surge tank and our 18,000 gallon propane tank due to a four inch puncture of the tanks and a release of 92,789 pounds of NGL in 3 minutes and 76,142 pounds of propane in 4 minutes, resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  These incidents could occur if a truck backs into the tanks or piping is broken off of the tanks in the event that a truck drives off while load lines are still connected.  Additionally, these sceanrios would also account for any potential releases from process piping including flanges, joints, welds, valves, and valve seals.  Any releases from vessels including drains, bleeds, cracks, seal failures, plug failures, overfiling, overpressurization, and venting would also be accounted for in these scenarios.   As a method of preventing such events, signs are posted in conspicuous locations to provide constant reminders to the drivers about proper unloading techniques.\n\n\n\nEnbridge has discussed these potential hydrocarbon releases with its employees and with local emergency response officials in Henderson County, thereby further reducing the possibility of any impact on the public.  \n\n\n\nPrevention Program\n\n\n\nBelow is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the Henderson Gas Plant.

Employee involvement will help to ensure that all perspectives regarding PSM are considered, and that the best ideas are implemented.  Open communications are encouraged between supervisors and employees regarding all safety and health issues.  Henderson Gas Plant strongly promotes employee imvolvement in safety issues through existing programs.  These programs include Unit Safety Teams (which are made up of a cross section of employees and supervision), regularly scheduled safety meetings, tail-gate safety meetings, Hazard Communication, Safety Suggestion Forms, and special training programs (Emergency Response Training, First Aid, etc.). \n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information:  Complete and accurate written process safety information (PSI) concerning process chemicals, process technology, and process equipment is essential to an effective PSM and RMP program and to completing and maintaining a process hazard analysis (PHA).  The PSI will be useful to the operators; the team performing the PHA; those in charge of training; contractors; those conducting pre-startup safety reviews; and those in charge of updating the emergency preparedness plans.  Process safety information is readily available to all employees.  Henderson Gas Plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the process.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.

The facility primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) method analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.  Periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.  \n\n\n\nOperating Procedures:  Henderson Gas Plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, normal shutdown, and initial startup of a new process.  These procedures provide guidance for experienced operators and also provide the basis for training new operators.  Operating procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.  The review and certification process involves both operators and technical staff.  \n\n\n\nTraining:  In addition to training on operating procedures, the facility has a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating the process.

This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented.  Changes are reviewed to ensure that adequate controls have not been compromised by the changed.  Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on the change.  \n\n\n\nIncident Investigation:  Henderson Gas Plant promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in or reasonably could have resulted in a fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury.  The goal of each investigation is to gather the facts, determine the root cause, and develop corrective action to prevent the reoccurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a reoccurrence, and forwards these results to the business management team for resolution.  \n\n\n\nCompliance Audits:  To help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, the Henderson Gas Plant periodically conducts an audit to determine whether procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being "

      "SummaryText": "implemented.  Compliance audits are conducted at least every 3 years.  Both hourly and staff personnel participate as audit team members.  The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to Henderson Gas Plant management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are retained.  \n\n\n\nFive-year Accident History\n\n\n\nNo incident resulting in onsite or offsite impacts from a hydrocarbon release has occurred at the Henderson Gas Plant within the last five years.  Although we take pride in that record, we also place daily emphasis on our prevention and safety programs to ensure this record continues.  \n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\n\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving our natural gas liquid extraction, LP-Gas handling and storage facility, it is our policy to follow our Emergency Response Plan, which is linked with the Rusk County Emergency Management District Emergency Response Plan.  Activation of this emergency response plan sets in motion a pre-planned series of events that notify all area emergency response agencies.  Emergency response agencies are notified on the 911 system and directly.  The 911 call is channeled through the Rusk County Sheriff's Department.  All agencies and personnel respond to predetermined staging areas with representatives from each agency reporting to the Central Command Post (CP).  A contingency plan is developed and executed using trained industry personnel along with other emergency response personnel from responding agencies, as needed. \n\n\n\nRusk County LEPC Chairperson\n\nMr. James Pike\n\n115 N.

This plan and our emergency response policy have also been discussed with the local fire departments and members of the fire departments have thoroughly inspected our facility.  \n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nDiligent compliance with our RMP Prevention Program forms the framework on which we will continue to improve the level of safety at the Henderson Gas Plant.  Some of the key components of the safety improvements we expect to achieve are as follows:\n\n\n\n?    The Management of Change provisions ensures that we consider the potential safety and health impacts of any change we make to process chemicals, technology, equipment or procedures.  \n\n?    The Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) provisions serve as a tool to ensure continual evaluation of potential hazards, thereby leading to continual improvements in our safety standards.  \n\n?    The Mechanical Integrity provisions ensure that process equipment and instrumentation are designed, constructed, installed and maintained to minimize the risk of hazardous releases, thereby serving as an integral part of our safety program.  \n\n?    Internal and third party compliance audits will ensure we maintain and increase our level of safety protection.\n\n\n\nWe encourage all interested citizens or community organizations to learn more about our latest information on emergency response for the county.  We plan to diligently integrate our response capabilities and personnel with those of the county on an ongoing basis.  \n\n&#8195;\n\n"
