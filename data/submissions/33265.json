Our headquarters is located in Fairlawn, Ohio with many locations throughout the United States. We have been improving feed performance since 1927. Our facility in St. Gabriel is located on 23 acres, on Hwy. 30 in Iberville Parish. We utilize Ethylene Oxide and Trymethylamine to produce a liquid, nonhazardous product called Choline Chloride.\n\nAs a member of ACC, Bioproducts is committed to providing a safe work place for our employees and being an environmentally responsible member of the community. The key to this is preventing releases. We will accomplish this by hiring and training highly skilled employees, utilizing state of the art process control systems and, above all, prioritizing our actions based on the potential impacts to our employees and surrounding residents. In addition to the process control system and specially designed equipment and safety systems, we utilize air monitors to alert us to any leak that may occur, enabling us to apply water deluge systems to mitigate the leaks and take other necessary actions.\n\nSince initial start-up of operations we have had no RMP chemical releases. In the unlikely event of a serious release, our operating personnel are fully hazmat trained to respond quickly and decisively. Following OSHA's Process Safety Management guidelines is a key element of our program. Our commitment to protecting the environment, our employees and surrounding residents will continue to be an intergral part of our operating philosophy and goal of continuous improvement."
