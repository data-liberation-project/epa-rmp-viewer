To ensure proper treatment of the wastewater prior to discharging to the savannah river, chlorine is injected into effluent flow to disinfect and kill pathogen that may be contained in the effluent flow. The disinfection feed rates varies from 100 lbs. per day to 700 lbs. per day, depending on the effluent quality and demand. The chlorine control system has been upgraded with four additional cylinder mounted vacuum regulators. These units will stop chlorine gas flow if there is a break in the supply line, mitigating offsite impact.\n\nThere are several chlorine leak detector in the chlorine system located in the process area and storage site perimeters, when a chlorine leak is detected, the leak detectors activates visual and audible alarms to alert the plant personnel.\n\nResponsibilities:\nThe Treatment Administrator has overall responsibility for ensuring that the Process Management Plan is followed, reviewed and updated.\n\nThe Operation Superintendent will be responsible for Employee Involvement, Employee Training, Emergency Preparedness, Compliance Audits, Process Hazard Analysis, Management  Changes, Process Safety Information, Operating Procedures and Practices.\n\nThe Maintenance Superintendent will be responsible for Contractors, Pre-startup Safety, Mechanical Integrity, Monthly Maintenance Scheduling and Non- routine Work Authorization.\n\nTo reduce the risk and magnitude of potential releases, written procedures for the safe handling and operation of the chlorination system have been implemented as well as system upgrades. \n\nIn addition, work performed on equipment subject to cause a release requires a minimum of two personnel; personnel are also required to wear Self Contained Breathing Apparatus (SCBA) throughout the course of work associated with chlorination equipment. Any major work performed on the chlorination system is limite"
