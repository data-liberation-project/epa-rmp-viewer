Raw materials received in drum and bulk quantities are batch blended and packaged for sale. Both liquid and aerosol products are produced.  Facility SIC Code is 2899.  TCC is strongly committed to employee and community safety.  The facility's design features and operational procedures are intended to eliminate or minimize the chance of unauthorized releases of hazardous chemicals into the workplace or the environment.\n\nThe regulated chemicals utilized by this facility are butane, propane, and ethyl ether.  The butane and propane are utilized in a mixture as a propellant gas for aerosol products.  Ethyl ether is used in certain product formulations in mixtures with the propellant.  Primary elements of the propane/butane propellant and ethyl ether systems include bulk storage tanks, transfer pumps, blend tanks, aerosol charging stations, and the associated piping.\n\nThe aerosol propellant gas is a mixture of propane and butane and is stored onsite in an aboveground tank identified as tank A-60.  The maximum quantity onsite is 115,600 lbs (85% of tank capacity).  The design and construction of the tank, pump, and transfer system is in accordance with applicable rules and guidelines of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME), the Liquid Petroleum Gas Division of the Texas Railroad Commission, the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA), and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA).  The system is monitored and operated by employees of Technical Chemical Company who have been trained in facility safe operating procedures and the facility emergency response procedures.\n\nEthyl ether is stored onsite in three aboveground tanks identified as tanks A-16, A-61 and A-62.  Maximum inventory of these tanks (85% capacity) is 60,945 lbs, 125,375 lbs and 125,375 lbs., respectively.  The maximum quantity of ethyl ether that could be stored o"

The design and construction of the tanks, pumps, and transfer system is in accordance with applicable rules and guidelines of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME), the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA), and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA).  The system is monitored and operated by employees of Technical Chemical Company who have been trained in facility safe operating procedures and the facility emergency response procedures.\n\nPropellant and ether are mixed in a closed pressure vessel system located in the tank farm.  The tank farm is equipped with concrete secondary containment structures.  The blended product is then transferred via welded piping to the filling/charging operation located on the south side of the production building.  The charging operation is continuously monitored by area detectors which are designed to identify the presence of explosive gas in the atmosphere.  At 20% of the atmospheric lower explosive limit (LEL), these detectors activate an emergency ventilation system.  At 40% of the atmospheric LEL, these detectors shut down aerosol charging and transfer activity and isolate the blend tank.  The system is equipped with automatic and manual emergency shutdowns at the bulk tank locations, and there is a fire suppression system located in the aerosol charging area.  The facility has developed procedures for unloading aerosol propellant gas and ethyl ether, and for operation and maintenance of the system to minimize the possibility of an accidental release.  The release prevention program for the system incorporates the elements required by OSHA 1910.119 (Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals).\n\nThe facility emergency action plan includes notification and alarm procedures to evacuate the facility and notify the local fire department, the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC), the State Emergency Response"
