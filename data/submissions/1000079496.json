The plant receives and stores chemicals used primarily for the manufacture of synthetic latex rubber, which is used to make many consumer goods. The Orange Plant is subject to the EPA's RMP regulation as it stores and uses flammable materials covered under the RMP regulation. In particular, the plant uses pure 1,3-Butadiene and mixtures containing one percent or greater of 1,3-Butadiene. The plant does not use or store any toxic substances in excess of their respective thresholds defined in the USEPA RMP rule.\n\nFour RMP covered processes were identified at the plant, each handling in excess of the RMP threshold of 10,000 pounds of 1,3-Butadiene or 1,3-Butadiene mixtures. Based on criteria outlined in the RMP regulation, the covered processes at the Orange Plant are Program Level 3 process.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION\n\n\n\nThe facility is committed to meeting all safety, health and environmental regulations.  This includes the implementation of a Process Safety Management (PSM) program that complies with the OSHA PSM Standard and the requirements for a Program Level 3 facility in the USEPA RMP Rule. Additionally, the operations are ISO 9002 certified, which results in a continual improvement of the plant safety program.  The application of the PSM and ISO programs ensures rigorous training for operations and maintenance employees, numerous management checks and balances, and strict attention to changes in the operations with a thorough review and examination of potential hazards that could lead to accidental releases. \n\nThe facilities accidental release prevention program includes the twelve elements of a RMP Program Level 3 prevention program:\n\n     ?    Process Safety Information\n\n     ?    Process Hazard Analysis\n\n     ?    Operating procedures\n\n     ?    Training\n\n     ?    Mechanical Integrity\n\n     ?    M"
