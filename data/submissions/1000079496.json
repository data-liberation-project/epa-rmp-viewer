The plant receives and stores chemicals used primarily for the manufacture of synthetic latex rubber, which is used to make many consumer goods. The Orange Plant is subject to the EPA's RMP regulation as it stores and uses flammable materials covered under the RMP regulation. In particular, the plant uses pure 1,3-Butadiene and mixtures containing one percent or greater of 1,3-Butadiene. The plant does not use or store any toxic substances in excess of their respective thresholds defined in the USEPA RMP rule.\n\nFour RMP covered processes were identified at the plant, each handling in excess of the RMP threshold of 10,000 pounds of 1,3-Butadiene or 1,3-Butadiene mixtures. Based on criteria outlined in the RMP regulation, the covered processes at the Orange Plant are Program Level 3 process.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION\n\n\n\nThe facility is committed to meeting all safety, health and environmental regulations.  This includes the implementation of a Process Safety Management (PSM) program that complies with the OSHA PSM Standard and the requirements for a Program Level 3 facility in the USEPA RMP Rule. Additionally, the operations are ISO 9002 certified, which results in a continual improvement of the plant safety program.  The application of the PSM and ISO programs ensures rigorous training for operations and maintenance employees, numerous management checks and balances, and strict attention to changes in the operations with a thorough review and examination of potential hazards that could lead to accidental releases. \n\nThe facilities accidental release prevention program includes the twelve elements of a RMP Program Level 3 prevention program:\n\n     ?    Process Safety Information\n\n     ?    Process Hazard Analysis\n\n     ?    Operating procedures\n\n     ?    Training\n\n     ?    Mechanical Integrity\n\n     ?    M"

The facility has conducted process hazard analyses for the covered processes, which are updated whenever major changes occur or at a minimum frequency of every five years.  The plant implements management of change and prestart-up safety review programs to ensure that changes to the system are evaluated and implemented to minimize the risk of an accidental release.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nOur facility has written emergency response plans that are updated regularly.  Firestone Polymers relies on numerous programs to ensure early identification of and proper response to potential emergencies, including: \n\n\n\n   1. Training and drills in emergency preparedness, disaster response and control, first-aid, and fire-and-rescue techniques; \n\n   2. Frequent auditing of all preparedness programs; safety training and education; and,\n\n   3. Regular review, follow-up, and maintenance of all company operations and equipment.  \n\n   4. Response to major releases include alarms, the activation of a Plant Emergency Operating Center, trained Firestone emergency response personnel and community emergency responders are notified as appropriate.\n\n\n\nEmergency response at the plant is coordinated with the local fire department and emergency responders.

      "SummaryText": "  The facility has emergency medical treatment information readily available for use in an emergency.\n\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nThe facility has not had any accidental releases from covered processes that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage in the last five years.\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nFirestone is committed to improvement in safety for its workers, the public and the environment.  The Firestone Polymers - Orange Plant has programs to identify opportunities for improvement in these areas:\n\n   1. Risk Assessment - application of a formal Risk Assessment program. Evaluation and countermeasures using risk based priority for conditions identified.\n\n   2. OSHA Challenge Program - working with a designated OSHA Challenge Administrators to improve the safety and health management programs at the facility.\n\n   3. Improve Facility Siting - Implementation of facility siting improvements identified during the 2015 Facility Siting Study and documented in the written Mitigation Plan.  These include, but are not limited to developing and enforcing policies and practices that address housing of personnel located in buildings intended for occupancy, posting \"Not for Occupancy\" on the buildings not intended for occupancy and utilizing the Management Of Change (MOC) program to identify situations that would require a facility siting re-evaluation."
