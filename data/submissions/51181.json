              "Description": "All covered processes at Faustina are Level 3 since they are all covered by the PSM regulation.  Common PSM procedures are applicable to all processes, including employee participation plan for the facility, Management of Change, Incident Investigation and Hot Work permit procedures, common plant alarm system and emergency response systems, common contractor and maintenance programs, and compliance audits that review all covered processes.  Operating and maintenance procedures, including training plans, have been rewritten to meet the needs of PSM and RMP standards.   Employees served as subject matter experts in the development of the new procedures. They also participate in annual procedure reviews and updates.  HAZOP methology was used in conducting all PHAs in covered processes.  The ammonia storage area has an earthen dike surrounding the large storage tank.",

The raw materials used in this process include molten sulfur, phosphate rock, natural gas mixtures (flammable), air and steam.  In the ammonia plant, a catalytic reaction involving natural gas, steam and air is used to manufacture anhydrous ammonia with carbon dioxide as a by-product.  Some of the anhydrous ammonia produced is then separated and stored for use in the granulation plants. In the granulation plants, phosphoric acid is reacted with the anhydrous ammonia to produce granular monoammonium phosphate and / or diammonium phosphate.  Chlorine is used for water treatment in the cooling towers associated with the utilities area.\n\nRegulated toxic substances involved in these processes include: anhydrous ammonia, and chlorine, which exceed the threshold quantities at the Faustina facility. Regulated flammable substances involved in these processes that exceed threshold quantities include the flammable gas mixtures reacted and generated in the ammonia plant. \n\nAnhydrous ammonia is stored in a large refrigerated storage tank surrounded by a dike.  In addition to the anhydrous ammonia manufactured in the facility's ammonia plant, the Faustina facility also receives anhydrous ammonia via an underground commercial pipeline, as well as by ship and barge at the facility's river dock on occasion.  Chlorine is brought into the facility in multiple cylinders by trucks.  These cylinders are then individually connected to the process. Natural gas is received at the facility by an underground commercial pipeline that is connected by piping to the ammonia plant.\n\n\n3. General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\nAnhydrous ammonia, chlorine and flammable mixtures are regulated as highly hazardous chemicals under OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) standard.  Based on the quantities of these substances present at the Faustina facility, the Faustina facility is subject to OSHA's P"

The Faustina facility has fully implemented OSHA's PSM standard requirements and is using this program as its RMP Prevention Program. A brief summary of the facility's PSM program is as follows:\n\nMosaic Fertilizer, LLC, Faustina facility encourages all employees to participate in all facets of process safety and accident prevention and has an employee participation plan that documents the many ways employees are involved in these processes.\n\nMosaic Fertilizer, LLC, Faustina facility also has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards through the use of process hazard analysis techniques.\n\nMosaic Fertilizer, LLC, Faustina facility periodically revalidates its process hazard analyses to incorporate regulatory changes, new developments (such as lower toxicity standards and technology improvements), and offsite consequences.  These revalidations occur every five years and the findings along with their resolutions are kept for the life of the process.  The revalidation process is currently underway.\n\nMosaic Fertilizer, LLC, Faustina facility has well-established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition.  The basic aspects of this program include: (1) Conducting training; (2) Developing written procedures; (3) Performing inspections and tests in accordance with recognized standards; and (4) Correcting identified deficiencies and applying quality assurance measures.\n\nMosaic Fertilizer, LLC, Faustina facility also has procedures in place to ensure continuation o"

The storage vessel is constantly monitored by operators for ammonia leaks and has continuous monitoring electronic leak detection equipment with control room alarm monitoring the annular space between the double wall for ammonia leaks.  Typically, the vessel operates significantly below maximum capacity.  In the event of a long-term compressor outage, the anhydrous ammonia could be flared; sent to another ammonia producer in nearby Ascension Parish; or consumed in the granulation plants.  In the event of a vessel rupture, there is a dike completely surrounding the vessel sufficiently high to contain its entire contents with a margin of safety.  There is also an internal dike within the main dike that would keep smaller spills from spreading out to the maximum area of the dike thus reducing spill evaporation.  A series of relief valves connected to a flare also protect the tank from overpressure.\n\nOther smaller pressurized anhydrous ammonia storage vessels in the ammonia plant have relief valves that are piped directly to a flare system or vented to atmosphere.  Other ammonia relief valves are placed such that a discharge is elevated and would be significantly diluted before reaching areas affecting people.  There are also automated shutdown systems for the anhydrous ammonia manufacturing plant at the site.\n\nChlorine cylinders are provided by vendors who are required to maintain and inspect their mechanical integrity prior to shipping.

Five -Year Accident History\n\nThe five-year accident history includes a review of all accidental releases of regulated substances held above threshold quantities in covered processes that resulted in on-site deaths, injuries, or significant property damage, or known off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering-in-place, property damage, or environmental damage.  On October 11, 2006, the Ammonia Plant experienced an explosion and fire incident resulting from a process vessel failure.  The vessel and associated piping contained 16,450 lbs of process gas which included 2405 lbs of ammonia.  It is conservatively estimated that 5% - 15% of the released ammonia remained unburned, resulting in 120 lbs - 361 lbs of ammonia being released into the atmosphere.  No injuries resulted from this incident.  St. James EOC was contacted by local citizens indicating property damage.  A follow-up investigation into the calls and/or complaints as a result of the incident is being conducted.  The accident resulted in approximately $3,500,000 of onsite property damage.\n\n\n5. Emergency Response Program\n\nMosaic Fertilizer, LLC, Faustina facility maintains a written emergency response program that is in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment.
