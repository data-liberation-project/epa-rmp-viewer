      "SummaryText": "The Guadalupe Blanco River Authority has operated the Luling Water Treatment Plant since 1978 without a reportable release of any hazardous substance.  The hazardous chemical chlorine, used at the plant for disinfection of potable water is of such quanities that require compliance with the rules.\n\nG.B.R.A. recognizes the need for care and hazards in handling of chlorine.  Chlorine handling has been addressed in the GBRA Safety Manual, the Job Safety Analysis,  the Emergency Operations Plan,  The Preventive Maintenance Program and the annual Safety Audit.  Training has been conducted annually with advanced training occurring every two years.  Training is conducted on practice one-ton cylinder purchased for this specific purpose.  Leak detection monitors are located at the Luling Water Treatment Plant that activates an audible and visible alarm.  Personnel required to repair leaks have access lt level \"A\" chemical suits, self contained breathing apparatus (SCBA), and required chlorine leak repair kit.\n\nEven with all of the care currently provided, the completion of the Risk Management Plan demonstrates the need for some improvements.  GBRA will have mock drills that include the Luling Fire Department and other response personnel.  The Compliance Audit Checklist will be added to the annual safety audit.  Additional items defined in the Hazard Review Checklist that require attention will be corrected.\n\nThe worst case scenario for chlorine is 1.9 miles.  The impact of this is to a mostly urban area.  The Luling Water Treatment Plant is manned 16 hours per day with chlorine alarms implemented into SCADA system, with automatic dial-out capabilities in case of chlorine leak.\n\nThe alternate release scenario is 1.5 miles.  This scenario does not assume that repairs would be made to the leaking container, nor do they include active mitigation efforts."
