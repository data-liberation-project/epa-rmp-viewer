      "SummaryText": "The purpose of the Risk Management Plan (RMP) and Ammonia Process Safety Management (PSM) programs are to prevent accidental releases of ammonia that could cause harm to the public and the environment from short?term exposures.  The intent of this program is to reduce the risks for accidents, and improve safety for workers, employees and the community.  This Plan identifies the actions implemented by Wilbur?Ellis to reduce the risk of an accidental release of ammonia.  \n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance / Hazard Assessment\nThe program documents the Hazard Assessment in: \n - Source Description Introduction\n - Off-site Consequence Analysis for Worst Case and Alternative Release Scenario\n - Five Year Accident History\n\nGPS Step 2 RMP/PSM Program Documents (Accident Prevention Program)\nA list of the program documents is provided in Section 3. The program documents include U.S. EPA Program Level 3 Accident Prevention Program elements. \n\nAccidental Release Prevention / Emergency Action Plan\nThe Emergency Action Plan (EAP) is discussed in Section 4, and the written EAP is maintained in the GPS library and at the Branch. This branch is \u0093Non-Responding\u0094 and therefore coordinates emergency response planning with the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and Local Emergency HazMat Response Team. \n\nRisk Considerations\n\nAlthough the storage and use of ammonia has inherent potential risks, and worst-case release scenarios can potentially reach the community; Wilbur-Ellis has recognized these potential risks and structured its safety programs to make the worst-case type of event non-credible.  In addition to the safety practices of the company and plant personnel to make this worst-case event non-credible, it should also be recognized that there are inherent analysis assumptions that make the results of the atmospheric dispersion analysis appear worse than what would be expected during such an event.\n\nIn addition to the use of conservative analysis assumptions that ove"

The safety management process, branded Guiding People to Safety (GPS), is designed to be implemented in four steps. \n\nStep 1 defines the foundational and fundamental elements of a strong safety program and positive safety culture. Steps 2-4 provide guidelines for each safety program that describe methods for effective implementation. The GPS program includes measures for tracking progress and success and for addressing opportunities for improvement within the process and individual safety programs.  These measures include action tracking software to facilitate timely corrections of deficiencies and recommended improvements identified during inspections, audits, and hazard analyses.\n\nWilbur-Ellis is committed to preventing incidents cultivating a positive safety culture throughout the company.  The mission of our Environmental Health, Safety and Security (EHSS) team is to drive effective results in reducing incidents and employee injuries by combining the GPS process with a positive safety culture."
