Operating Procedures\n\n\n\nSendero maintains written Operating Procedures of the covered process that address primary operations mandated by OSHA, EPA, Good Engineering Practice and manufacturers. These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators. Procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current accurate by management.
