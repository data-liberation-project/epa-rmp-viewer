Facility Policy.\n\n     The owners, management and employees of Farmers Coop Association (Keota) are\n     committed to providing a safe workplace free of accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.\n     Health, safety, and environmental compliance are a fundamental part of every employee's\n     job.  It is facility protocol to adhere to applicable Federal, State, and local laws and to implement\n     appropriate controls to prevent accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an\n     accidental release were to occur, the facility would respond in accordance with its Emergency Action\n     Plan and is prepared to work with local fire department, the Local Emergency Planning Committee\n     and other authorities to control and mitigate the release and minimize the impact of the release\n     to employees, the environment, and general public.\n     \n2.  Facility Information.\n\n     The primary activity at the facility is the storage and handling of fertilizers for direct sale to\n     farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application.  Anhydrous  \n     ammonia is stored at the facility in two storage tanks of 12,800 gallons and 26,000 gallons.  These\n     tanks are located across the road from the office.  Anhydrous ammonia is also stored in sixty-six\n     1000 gal wagons that are stored next to the storage tanks.  The maximum quantity of Anhydrous\n     ammonia would be 455,000 pounds.\n\n3.  Worst-Case Scenario and Alternate Release Scenerio.\n\n     a.     The worst case scenerio would be the release of the total contents of a storage\n              tank released as gas over a period of ten minutes.\n              Anhydrous Ammonia -   The maximum quantity released would be 112,710 pounds,\n             which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85 percent capacity as\n             lim"

The alternate release scenerio, based on the five-year history (or the most\n             likely potential incident), is as follows:\n   \n             Anhydrous Ammonia -  The alternate release scenerio is a release from a break in a\n             3-inch transfer hose for 2 minutes before an automatic or manual shut-off intervenes\n             and stops the flow of ammonia.  The maximum quantity released would be 110,500\n             pounds.  The distance to the endpoint (point of pispersion to 200 ppm) is 1.6 miles.\n\n4.  Accidental Release Prevention Program.\n\n     1) Safety Equipment: The facility was designed and constructed in accordance with applicable\n     Federal and State of Iowa regulations.  All plans and procedures maintained at the facility are\n     periodically reviewed by facility management for safety updates and changes.  Material Safety\n     Data Sheets, equipment specifications and codes and standards used to build and operate\n     the anhydrous ammonia equipment are maintained at the facility.\n\n     2) Hazard Review: Facility management conducts reviews of the hazards associated with the\n     handling and storage of anhydrous ammonia.  The reviews identify the opportunity\n     for equipment malfunctions or human errors that could cause an accidental release, the safeguards\n     used to control hazards and prevent releases, and the steps used to detect or monitor releases.\n     The results of the reviews are documented and problems idenified are addressed in a timely manner.\n\n     3) Operating Procedures: The facility maintains written procedures for the handling and storage of\n     anhydrous ammonia.  The procedures generally follow the provisions of the\n     Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) standard 29 CFR 1910.111,\"Storage and\n     Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\".

The written procedures are reviewed by facility management on a regular \n     basis and revised as necessary.\n\n     4) Training: All employees at the facility that handle anhydrous ammonia participate in a training\n     program.  Training of all employees consists of classroom type instruction (e.g. reading safety\n     information, operating procedures, response measures followed by a written test) and on-the-job\n     supervision.  All employees are trained annually.  The training program is reviewed by facility\n     management on a regular basis and revised as necessary. \n\n     5) Maintenance: The facility maintains written equipment inspection and maintenance procedures.\n     Storage and transfer/process equipment inspections are performed by qualified personnel on\n     an annual basis and are documented.  Equipment maintenance procedures follow either instructions\n     furnished by equipment vendors, Federal or State regulations, or Industry Codes.  The written\n     procedures are reviewed by facility management on a regular basis and revised as necessary.\n\n     6) Compliance Audits: As required by the RMP rule, compliance audits will be performed at least\n     every three (3) years.  The audit will be documented and conducted by a person knowledgeable\n     in the safe handling and storage of anhydrous ammonia.  Corrective actions required as a result \n     of each compliance audit will be performed and documented.\n\n     7) Incident Investigation: Facility management will investigate each incident that results, or could have\n     reasonably resulted in a catastropic release of anhydrous ammonia.  The investigation\n     will be performed to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as corrective actions to\n     prevent the release from reoccuring.  Investigation reports will be maintained "
