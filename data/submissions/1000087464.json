Health, safety, and environmental compliance are a fundamental part of every employee's job.  It is facility protocol to adhere to applicable Federal, State, and local laws and to implement appropriate controls to prevent accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release were to occur, the facility would respond in accordance with its Emergency Action Plan and is prepared to work with the local fire department, the Local Emergency Planning Committee, and other authorities to control and mitigate the release and to minimize the impact of the release to employees, the environment, and the general public.\r\n\r\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled:  The primary activity at this facility (the stationary source) is the storage, handling, and mixing of fertilizers for direct retail sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, mixed, and distributed for direct application as crop production nutrients.  The maximum stored quantity of anhydrous ammonia at the facility is 280,000 pounds stored in two separate 30,000-gallon storage tanks.  The maximum fill level of each tank is 85% of the total tank capacity.  This facility is loaded by transport truck, therefore the maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia handled would occur when the on-site storage tank is at the maximum fill level of 85%.  Each tank is fitted with emergency shut-off valves that can be activated from several locations, both at the tanks or outside the fenced area.\r\n\r\nNPK (nitrogen - phosphorus - potassium)-grade fertilizers are manufactured by combining anhydrous ammonia, water, and other raw materials to achieve the proper ra"

The other sources of phosphorus and potassium are added to this solution in the amounts desired to achieve the proper NPK ratio, such as 5-10-10, 16-4-4, and 7-22-5.\r\n\r\nSlow release fertilizers are manufactured by combining water, anhydrous ammonia, and other raw materials.  This process is done at an elevated temperature to form a certain molecular structure.  Ammonia is used in this process as a reactant.\r\n\r\nLiquid anhydrous ammonia is sold for direct application to fields by farmers. \r\n\r\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps:  This facility complies with EPA's accidental release prevention requirements and applicable State and local codes and regulations.  The following sections 1 through 7 briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program for the primary activity at this facility, which is the handling and storage of anhydrous ammonia.  Sections 8 through 19 briefly describe the release prevention program elements for the liquid fertilizer manufacturing process.\r\n\r\n1) Safety information:  The facility was designed and constructed in accordance with applicable Federal and State regulations.  All plans and procedures maintained at the facility are periodically reviewed by facility management for safety updates and changes.  Safety Data Sheets (SDS), equipment specifications and the codes and standards used to build and operate the anhydrous ammonia equipment are maintained at the facility.\r\n\r\n2) Hazard Review:  Facility management conducts reviews of the hazards associated with the handling and storage of anhydrous ammonia.
