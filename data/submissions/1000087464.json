Health, safety, and environmental compliance are a fundamental part of every employee's job.  It is facility protocol to adhere to applicable Federal, State, and local laws and to implement appropriate controls to prevent accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release were to occur, the facility would respond in accordance with its Emergency Action Plan and is prepared to work with the local fire department, the Local Emergency Planning Committee, and other authorities to control and mitigate the release and to minimize the impact of the release to employees, the environment, and the general public.\n\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled:  The primary activity at this facility (the stationary source) is the storage, handling, and mixing of fertilizers for direct retail sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, mixed, and distributed for direct application as crop production nutrients.  The maximum stored quantity of anhydrous ammonia at the facility is 280,000 pounds stored in two separate 30,000-gallon storage tanks.  The maximum fill level of each tank is 85% of the total tank capacity.  This facility is loaded by transport truck, therefore the maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia handled would occur when the on-site storage tank is at the maximum fill level of 85%.  Each tank is fitted with emergency shut-off valves that can be activated from several locations, both at the tanks or outside the fenced area.\n\n\n\nNPK (nitrogen - phosphorus - potassium)-grade fertilizers are manufactured by combining anhydrous ammonia, water, and other raw materials to achieve the proper ra"
