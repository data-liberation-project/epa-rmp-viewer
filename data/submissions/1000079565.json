The Program summarizes the management administrative, procedural, and technical controls that work together to minimize the risk to the site personnel, contractors, visitors, and the community and environment at large of hazardous chemical releases.  The Risk Management Plan (RMP) is organized to correspond with the specific US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) RMP, Program 3 of 40 CFR 68, definitions and requirements of Subpart G, including the following:\r\n\r\nIntroduction\r\nVan Drunen policies to protect health, environment, and safety\r\nFacility identification and regulated substances covered processes\r\nHazard Assessment\r\nPrevention Program summary\r\nFive-Year accident history\r\nEmergency Response Plan summary\r\nEmergency Communications\r\nSpill reporting/Environmental Release Procedures\r\nPlanned changes to improve safety\r\nManagement Program\r\n\r\n1.1.1  Van Drunen Farms Policies to Protect Health, Environment, and Safety\r\nVan Drunen is committed to conducting facility operations in a safe and responsible manner and to reducing risks to human health and to the environment.  This RMP for ammonia refrigeration operations at the facility has been developed in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements and is consistent with the risk management and safety practices important to Van Drunen.\r\n\r\nThis RMP has identified potential hazards associated with ammonia refrigeration system and associated processes at the facility.  Van Drunen  has taken steps to design and maintain a safe facility in order to prevent releases, and minimize the consequences of potential accidental releases.  RMPs address potentially catastrophic chemical releases that could result in immediate harm and acute health effects to offsite receptors (public and en"

This RMP includes the Facility's Emergency Response Plan (ERP) that contains procedures which are designed to maximize the safety of all employees, contractors, and visitors in the event of an emergency and also guard against environmental consequences.\r\n\r\n1.2  Facility Identification and Registration\r\nThe Van Drunen Farms facility is located at 1300 East Summit Street in Crown Point, Indiana.  The facility operations include freeze drying, roasting, office space, research, packaging, steam drying, storage, equipment maintenance.  The facility, which manufacturers freeze-dried vegetables and fruits, uses anhydrous ammonia for refrigeration and within freeze drying processes.  Based on the identified operations, this facility is regulated under 40 CFR Part 68, the EPA RMP rule.  Per 40 CFR 68, the facility has been registered with the EPA via completion of the online registration as documented within the records provided in Appendix A.\r\n\r\nThere is one anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system onsite.  The system capacity is approximately 16,400 pounds, which is above the threshold planning quantity of 10,000 pounds.  The ammonia receiver tank, which is the largest capacity vessel, is identified as Vessel LTR1.  This vessel is located inside the main building in the engine room. The safety data sheet (SDS) for anhydrous ammonia is provided for reference in Appendix B.\r\n\r\n1.3  Accident History\r\nVan Drunen Farms has not had an accidental anhydrous ammonia release, which resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage onsite, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage in the last 5 years.   There have not been any reportable releases of hazardous materials at the subject facility. \r\n\r\n1.4  Certification\r\nVan Drunen Farms is committed to the implementation of the procedures outlined in this RMP and any supporting Plans and Programs.
