The Emergency Response Plan (Plan) is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of this PSM/RMP document.  This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n1.) To save lives.\n2.) To minimize and avoid injuries.\n3.) To protect the environment.\n4.) To minimize property damage.\n\nAWMA/SERRA maintains a safety committee whose members are the designated emergency coordinators for the facility.  The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, chlorine health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year.  This Plan was be reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM, RMP, and CalARP regulations, and to ensure that the plan is kept current.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nThe 3A Treatment Plant of South East Regional Reclamation Authority (SERRA) is located at 26801 Camino Capistrano in the city of Laguna Niguel.  The facility is located at the north end of Camino Capistrano adjacent to Interstate 5.  The immediate area is primarily commercial and residential areas. \n\nThe chlorine system at the 3A Treatment Plant is used for the wastewater treatment.  The 3A Treatment Plant uses chlorine to regulate odor, to control filament, and to disinfect during several wastewater treatment processes:  1) headwork, 2) return activated sludge (RAS), 3) plant process water, and 4) recycled water.   Chlorine is contained in one ton containers at the facility.  Chlorine gas is transferred from the one ton containers to the chlorinators through a vacuum regulator.  The chlorinators then distribute the chlorine gas to the injectors placed throughout the facility.  The"

This building is located on the southeast side of the property.\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT SUMMARY\n\nWorst Case Release Result Summary\n\n Scenario Description: Release of the maximum quantity of chlorine that can be stored in a vessel - 8,000 pounds in 10 minutes.  Although, the only one one-ton container is used at a time at the 3A Treatment Plant, four one-ton containers are connected.  One entire manifold is active and the other is kept in stand-by status.  As the chlorine pressure in the on-line manifold drops, the strength of the vacuum opens the valve of the standby manifold, allowing the flow of chlorine to remain continuous.  Therefore, in the event of a release upstream of the chlorinators, the total quantity released could be four one-ton containers (8,000 lbs.).  The most pessimistic meteorological conditions were used: 1.5 meters/second wind speed, and F stability.  Reference table from the EPA's RMP Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants was used to determine the distance for the toxic point of 3 ppm.  This release reaches off-site and may affect both population and environmental receptors.\n\nAlternative Release Result Summary\n\n Scenario Description: A release of chlorine gas from 5/16 inch diameter leak.  The release rate of chlorine due to the pressure of the tank is 5.2 pounds per minute.   The meteorological conditions used were 3 meters per second wind speed, and D stability.  Reference table from the EPA's RMP Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants was used to determine the distance for the toxic point of 3 ppm.  This release reaches off-site and may affect population receptors.

      "SummaryText": "ne system at the 3A Treatment Plant has many safety features.  Much of the safety of the system is inherent in the policies and procedures that govern the operation of the system.  For example, the AWMA/SERRA treatment processes operate in accordance with OSHA's Process Safety Management regulation and the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program.\n\nIn the event that the primary engineering or administration controls at the 3A Treatment Plant fail and result in a release of chlorine, there are several mechanisms in the plant to minimize the impact:  1) chlorine sensors / detectors, and 2) alarms.  The chlorine sensors that trigger audible and visual alarms are located in the chlorinator room and the chlorine storage room.  Once a chlorine concentration of 0.2 ppm is detected, the sensors triggers the main computer system to notify the chlorine release.  The ventilation system also starts to circulate fresh air into the chlorinator room.\n\nIn addition, common industry standards, policies, and procedures are utilized to ensure safe practices are being performed.  This includes common practices recommended by the Chlorine Institute.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe accident history researched back five years to June 1994 shows that the AWMA/SERRA's facility has not had an accidental release or \"near miss\" of chlorine.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe AWMA/SERRA has an emergency response plan in effect at the facility.

The AWMA/SERRA performs periodic emergency evacuation drills to enhance the emergency response skills of its personnel.\n\nThe Emergency Response Plan is reviewed and updated by the AWMA/SERRA Water Reclamation Plant responsible person, Mr. Michael Wilson at least once a year.  This Plan will be review and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM, RMP, and CalARP regulations, and to ensure that the plan is kept current.\n\nThe AWMA/SERRA has coordinated emergency response efforts withe the local fire department,  Orange County Fire Department.  In the case of a chlorine-related emergency, its is the policy of AWMA/SERRA to evacuate the employees and to allow the fire department to respond to the emergency (potentially with the assistance of trained facility personnel).\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThe Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) provided the mitigation measures outlined below to improve safety at the 3A Treatment Plant of AWMA/SERRA.  The PHA was comprised of one session that included a HAZOP study, a Plant Walkthrough, a \"What-if\" analysis, and a series of checklists.    The changes will be completed by December 1, 1999.\n\nR04 Examine the applicable code requirements to determine the proper application for the exhaust fans during normal/daily operation (i.e. temperature controlled, always on, etc.).\n\nR05 Develop operating procedure for evacuating chlorine from the pipe line for maintenance service.\n\nR06 Conduct an emergency evacuation drill like other facilities.\n\nR07 Consider installing audible alarm along with existing visual chlorine alarm that functions to notify an operator of a chlorine release.
