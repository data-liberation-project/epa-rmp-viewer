      "SummaryText": "The Mapleton facility property consists of 7.5 acres of land that was a part of the original Witco Corporation Plant site.  Approximately 17 employees operate this 24 hours per day, 5 days a week facility operations that manufactures a product line of Metal Organic materials that are usee in the manufacture of plastics.  The main products manufactured in the Metal Organics Plant are aluminum alkyls.  These Products are pyrophoric in mature and require specialized equipment and procedures for safe handling.  On May 20, 1999, our plant as a part of Witco Corporation joined with our neighboring facilities al group Lonza to present 10 Community Action Program (CAP) Committee members present, and about 10 members of the Mapleton Community.  The plan was well received.  All questions were answered.  The event was covered by the news media with a small article that appeared in the local paper the next day.  In our opinion, this event meets the Public Meeting requirement set for in the new \"Site Security and Fuels Regulatory Act\", Public Meetings and other Notifications Law, PL-106-40 (August 5, 1999).  This document provides a breif overview of our manufactiring processes that utilize those chemicals that fall under the EPA's RMP regulations.  The Mapleton production facilities fall under the Level 3 Processes.  The Crompton Facility uses two flammable chemcicals that fall under this program.  The Flammable materials are Ethylene and Ethyl Chloride.  General Acciental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Prevention Steps:  Crompton Corporation compiles with OSHA's PSM rule and EPA's RMP rule.  We participate in CMA's Responsible Care program.  We take a systemic, proactive approach to preventing accidental releases of flammable chemicals.  Our management system addresses each of the key features of successful prevention programs."
