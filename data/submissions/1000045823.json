It is our belief that those things that contribute to safe operations also improve quality and reduce costs.   This commitment to safety can be seen in the investment of resources made for accident prevention.   These efforts include extensive employee training and a systematic approach to safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.   Our policy is to implement effective controls to prevent foreseeable releases of dangerous substances.  To supplement these controls, additional safeguards are provided to reduce the impact of a release should one occur in spite of all precautions.   Plant employees and managers are trained to take appropriate action in an emergency to protect the welfare of the public, our employees and the surrounding environment.\n\n\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nAkzoNobel Surface Chemistry's Fort Worth Plant is a specialty surfactant manufacturing facility located at 611 East Northside Drive in Fort Worth, Texas.  The plant is situated on approximately 5 acres in north Fort Worth.  The immediate area surrounding this plant is natural gas wellhead to the north, industrial development including Ferro Corporation and residential zoned areas lie to the west, commercial/residential-zoned areas to the south, and the Trinity River to the east.\n\n\n\nSpecialty surfactant manufacturing has been conducted at this location since 1974.  This facility makes a variety of specialty surfactants that are used in industrial and agricultural applications throughout the world.  The plant is operated 24 hours per day, seven days per week.

Both product's manufacture are carried out in two reactors vessels especially suited for this type of operation.    The finished products are  water-based surfactants with highly efficient dispersant properties.   Specific applications include agricultural product formulations to retard sedimentation of water dispersible granules such as herbicides, insecticides, and fungicides.    \n\n\n\nIn the same unit, formaldehyde is diluted in water to a concentration less than 1% and blended with another water based surfactant to abate an unusually strong odor.

The facility's use of regulated substances in a process equal to or greater than the listed threshold quantities are listed below.  The processes themselves use relatively small quantities of formaldehyde but are subject to regulation due to their connection to the larger storage tank.

The management of change program uses a quantitative risk assessment to determine the significance of the change.   This risk level assessment determines the levels of authorization required to approve the action.   Design review checklists are used to evaluate different types of changes to prevent new hazards being created or equipment changes which are not suited to the service as it exists in the process.
