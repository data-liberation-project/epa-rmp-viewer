This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n    To save lives.\n\n    To minimize and avoid injuries.\n\n    To protect the environment.\n\n    To minimize property damage.\n\n\n\nAmericold maintains an emergency action (safety) committee whose members are the designated emergency coordinators for the facility.  The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year.  This Plan will be reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations, as well as to incorporate any facility changes. \n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nThe Americold, Watsonville (Plant #80553) facility chills and stores a variety of food products in their cold storage warehouse.  The refrigeration process, consisting of piping, valves, and equipment, cycles ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration for cold storage rooms.  Changes in pressure are directly related to changes in temperature.  For example, lowering the ammonia pressure lowers its temperature.  Low pressure (cold) liquid ammonia provides refrigeration by removing ambient heat.  Removal of ambient heat causes the liquid ammonia (contained within the system) to vaporize.  Heat is later removed from the ammonia as it is condensed back into a liquid.  Typical ope"

      "SummaryText": "rating conditions range from vacuum (approximately 6\" Hg) on the low pressure side of the system to 150-160 psig on the high side.\n\n\n\nAnhydrous ammonia (CAS #7664-41-7) is used as the refrigerant in the refrigeration process.\n\n\n\nThe total ammonia inventory is above the Threshold Quantity for Accidental Release Prevention.\n\n\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT SUMMARY\n\nWorst Case Release Result Summary\n\nDiscussion removed per regulation\n\n\n\nAlternative Case Release Result Summary\n\nDiscussion removed per regulation\n\n\n\nThe facility operates in accordance with the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) guidelines and standards including the following:\n\n\n\nIIAR Bulletin 107, \"Suggested Safety and Operating Procedures When Making Ammonia Refrigeration Tie-ins\"\n\nIIAR Bulletin 109, \"Minimum Safety Criteria for a Safe Ammonia Refrigeration System\"\n\nIIAR Bulletin R1, \"A Guide to Good Practices for the Operation of an Ammonia Refrigeration System\"\n\n\n\nIn addition, the AmeriCold Logistics, Inc. Plant 80553 has implemented a Process Safety Management program for compliance with the OSHA 1910.119 regulation since 4-1-91.\n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere have been no RMP reportable releases of ammonia at this facility over the last five years   \n\n\n\nEMERGENCY ACTION PROGRAM\n\nAmericold, Watsonville (Plant #80553) has an Emergency action Program in place.  The facility has an Emergency action Team that is trained to First Responder Operations Level on an annual basis.  All Emergency action Team members are fit tested and respiratory trained annually.   \n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nDuring the update of the Process Safety Management program at this facility, the Process Hazard Analysis study  generated mitigation measures that would improve safety at the Americold facility located at 750 West Riverside Drive in Watsonville, California.  These action items were entered into a management plan and are being addressed.\n\n\n\n"
