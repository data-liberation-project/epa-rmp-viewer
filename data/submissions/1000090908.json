Additional information for the incident is provided in the RMP Data Elements.\n\t\n\t\n\tEmergency Response Program\n\t\n\tThe facility will continue to conduct emergency response preparedness activities and coordinate any necessary emergency response actions with the Beatrice Rural Fire Department and the Gage County Sheriff Department.  As appropriate, also involved in emergency response for the facility would be the Beatrice Hazardous Materials Team, Beatrice Community Hospital and Health Center, the Nebraska State Patrol, Norris Public Power, and Tall Grass Energy (natural gas supplier).  The KFB Plant Manager is responsible for coordinating the emergency actions.  A specific Emergency Response Plan for the facility is in place and that plan has been coordinated with local officials, along with evacuation procedures, regular drilling, and training.  The Emergency Response Program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.\n\t\n\t\n\tPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\t\n\tCompliance with the RMP Prevention Program forms the framework for continuous safety improvement.

The facility is regulated under the Program Level 3 Prevention Program requirements.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n  \nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response programs in place at the facility are part of the protective performance standards adopted by KFB.  These high standards include:\n\n-\tOperating in compliance with required environmental permits and regulations.\n-\tOperating and maintaining assets in such a manner that unintentional releases are minimized.\n-\tOperating and maintaining assets in such a manner that the small releases associated with normal operation and maintenance will be minimized to the extent possible.\n-\tCorrecting non-compliance found by regular audits of the facility.\n\n\nPrevention Program\n\nKFB is operating under the guidelines of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Program.  Ongoing analysis of the potential hazards of the process, detailed training of employees, and emphasis on safety have helped minimize the potential for chemical release incidents over the last 5 years.  A few examples of accident prevention features implemented at this facility include:\n\t\t\n-\tInstalled a safety instrumented system (SIS) in the ammonia plant that is activated during abnormal process conditions to ensure safe operation of the process. \n-\tInstalled an emergency natural gas generator to provide power to critical equipment in the ammonia plant and loading & storage.\n-\tUtilizing Forward-looking Infrared Cameras (FLIR) to detect ammonia leaks.\n-\tProvided a low-amp trip system to shut down ammonia loading pumps during product movement, in order to prevent a release of ammonia.\n-\tInstalled ammonia detectors to help ensure that an ammonia release is detected and terminated as soon as possible.\n-\tInstalled low-pressure trip switches on ammonia loading hoses to stop product transfer in the event of a hose rupture.\n-\tPro"

      "SummaryText": "KOCH FERTILIZER BEATRICE, LLC\n\nBeatrice, Nebraska\n\t\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nFOR \nTHE RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAM\n\n\nIntroduction and Policies\n\nKoch Fertilizer Beatrice, LLC (KFB) is committed to managing all operations in a manner that protects the environment and the health and safety of employees, customers, contractors and the public while fully complying with applicable laws and regulations.  KFB\u2019s management philosophy goals are achieved through the implementation of the EH&S Management System, by the personal commitments of employees and contractors, and by open communication with employees, customers, neighbors, and regulators. \n\nThe purpose of this Risk Management Plan is to provide information about operations at the facility, programs to prevent accidental chemical releases, emergency response plans in the event of an accidental release, the five-year accident history of the facility, and planned changes to improve safety at the plant.\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nKFB produces anhydrous ammonia and urea-ammonium nitrate (UAN), which are loaded on truck for distribution.  The plant also has the capability to inject ammonia into a pipeline for transfer to a neighboring facility.\n\nThe manufacturing portion of the facility consists of an ammonia unit and a UAN unit.  The ammonia unit uses natural gas, air, and water to produce ammonia.  UAN solution is produced by manufacturing urea in liquid form and combining it with liquid ammonium nitrate, which is made by neutralizing nitric acid with ammonia.  Carbon dioxide, a by-product of the ammonia manufacturing process, is liquefied in the facility\u2019s CO2 plant and sold to third party entities, used in the UAN plant, or vented to the atmosphere.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is the only toxic substance regulated under the Risk Management Program (RMP) that is present at KFB in amounts above threshold quantity.  An RMP-regulated flammable mixture consisting of methane and hydrogen is found in the ammonia production proce"
