KFB's management philosophy goals are achieved through the implementation of the EH&S Management System, by the personal commitments of employees and contractors, and by open communication with employees, customers, neighbors, and regulators. \n\n\n\nThe purpose of this Risk Management Plan is to provide information about operations at the facility, programs to prevent accidental chemical releases, emergency response plans in the event of an accidental release, the five-year accident history of the facility, and planned changes to improve safety at the plant.\n\n\n\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nKFB produces anhydrous ammonia and urea-ammonium nitrate (UAN), which are loaded on truck for distribution.  The plant also has the capability to inject ammonia into a pipeline for transfer to a neighboring facility.\n\n\n\nThe manufacturing portion of the facility consists of an ammonia unit and a UAN unit.  The ammonia unit uses natural gas, air, and water to produce ammonia.  UAN solution is produced by manufacturing urea in liquid form and combining it with liquid ammonium nitrate, which is made by neutralizing nitric acid with ammonia.  Carbon dioxide, a by-product of the ammonia manufacturing process, is liquefied in the facility's CO2 plant and sold to third party entities, used in the UAN plant, or vented to the atmosphere.\n\n\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is the only toxic substance regulated under the Risk Management Program (RMP) that is present at KFB in amounts above threshold quantity.  An RMP-regulated flammable mixture consisting of methane and hydrogen is found in the amm"

The facility is regulated under the Program Level 3 Prevention Program requirements.\n\n\n\nThis RMP update is required under the RMP rule because it has been five years since the most recent update was submitted to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n  \n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response programs in place at the facility are part of the protective performance standards adopted by KFB.  These high standards include:\n\n\n\n-  Operating in compliance with required environmental permits and regulations.\n\n-  Operating and maintaining assets in such a manner that unintentional releases are minimized.\n\n-  Operating and maintaining assets in such a manner that the small releases associated with normal operation and maintenance will be minimized to the extent possible.\n\n-  Correcting non-compliance found by regular audits of the facility.\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevention Program\n\n\n\nKFB is operating under the guidelines of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Program.  Ongoing analysis of the potential hazards of the process, detailed training of employees, and emphasis on safety have helped minimize the potential for chemical release incidents over the last 5 years.  A few examples of accident prevention features implemented at this facility include:\n\n        \n\n-  Installed a safety instrumented system (SIS) in the ammonia plant that is activated during abnormal process conditions to ensure safe operation of the process. \n\n-  Installed an emergency natural gas generator to provide power to critical equipment in the ammonia plant and loading & storage.\n\n-  Utilizing Forward-looking Infrared Cameras (FLIR) to detect ammonia leaks.\n\n-  Provided a low-amp trip system to shut down ammonia loading pumps during product movement, in order to prevent a release of ammonia.\n\n-  Installed ammonia dete"

As appropriate, also involved in emergency response for the facility would be the Beatrice Hazardous Materials Team, Beatrice Community Hospital and Health Center, the Nebraska State Patrol, Norris Public Power, and Tall Grass Energy (natural gas supplier).  The KFB Plant Manager is responsible for coordinating the emergency actions.  A specific Emergency Response Plan for the facility is in place and that plan has been coordinated with local officials, along with evacuation procedures, regular drilling, and training.

Some of the key components of the safety program are:\n\n    \n\n-  The Management of Change provisions ensure that the potential safety and health impacts of any change made to process chemicals, technology, equipment or procedures are considered.\n\n-  The Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) provisions serve as a tool to ensure timely evaluation of potential hazards, thereby leading to continual improvements in safety standards.\n\n-  The Mechanical Integrity provisions ensure that process equipment and instrumentation are designed, constructed, installed and maintained to minimize the risk of hazardous releases, thereby serving as an integral part of the safety program.\n\n\n\nSpecific actions that will be taken in the future to improve the level of safety at the facility include:\n\n\n\n-  Installing safety instrumented systems (SIS) on the UAN plant and evaluating SIS for the loading & storage unit that activates during abnormal process conditions to ensure safe operation of the process.\n\n-  Evaluating safety isolation valves to minimize the duration and volume of release on ammonia pumps. \n\n-  Internal compliance audits will ensure that the level of safety protection at the facility is periodically evaluated for improvements.\n\n-  An ongoing dialogue with the Gage County Emergency Management Director or his designate will ensure a constant state of readiness to respond to any potential emergencies, as well as a means to implement improvements as the need develops.  \n\n\n\nAll interested citizens or community organizations are encouraged to contact the Gage County Emergency Management Director for the latest information on emergency response for the county.
