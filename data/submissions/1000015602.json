              "Description": "Rich Products Corporation - Hilliard Facility's ammonia refrigeration system contains equipment to minimize the potential of an ammonia release.  The Facility has in place the following controls for the ammonia refrigeration system:  preventative maintenance procedures, automatic alarm systems, ammonia detectors and ventilation, process safety information tracking logs, automatic system shutdown capabilities, periodic leak and pressure testing, periodic visual inspections, control valves, refrigeration hand service valves for manual operation, solenoid valves, pressure relief valves, computer generated work orders for maintenance and hot work permits.  The ammonia refrigeration system is run through a programmable logic controller (PLC).  The PLC is used for system monitoring, data trending/logging, and operator set point entry.  System monitoring is provided through a variety of displays that show equipment status, temperature and pressure readings, current operating settings and various other parameters.  The displays provide the operator with continuous and up to date status of the ammonia refrigeration system.  Please note that setpoints can only be changed by authorized Associates (i.e., it requires a password to change equipment setpoints).\n\nThe Facility's administrative procedures are as follows:  periodic training for Associates, compliance audits, pre-startup safety checks, process hazard analysis to address what-if scenarios and the measures taken to mitigate a release, screening of all contractors performing work on the ammonia refrigeration system per OSHA and USEPA regulations, and management of change procedures.\n\nCompressors have the following safeguards:  pressure and temperature gauges on suction and discharge piping, high and low temperature alarms and shutdown, high and low pressure alarms and shutdown, high and low level oil alarms and shutdown, high and low oil temperature alarms and shutdown, high and low oil pressure alarms and shutdown, thermosyphon oil cooling, discharge stop/check valve, suction valve (i.e., combination stop/check/strainer valve), electronic overload protection with alarm and shutdown, and pressure relief valves.\n\nThe intercooler has the following safeguards:  dual pressure relief valves, high and low level alarms and shutdown, continuous level controller, and liquid level sight glasses.\n\nLow pressure recirculator for cold storage has the following safeguards:  high and low level alarms and shutdown, continuous level controller, and two pumps with constant flow regulator, minimum flow orifice and differential pressure switch.\n\nLow pressure recirculator for spiral freezers has the following safeguards:  high and low level alarms and shutdown, continuous level controller, and two pumps with constant flow regulator, minimum flow orifice and differential pressure switch.\n\nEvaporative condenser has the following safeguards:  dual pressure relief valves for each coil circuit, liquid level indicator, water pump startup and shutdown, and high pressure over ride.\n\nHigh pressure receiver has the following safeguards:  dual pressure relief valves, level column with level indicator and level sight glasses, and high and low level alarms and shutdown.\n\nEvaporators have the following safeguards:  high and low level alarms and shutdown, temperature controls, liquid level gauge, pressure relief valves, high and low pressure alarms and shutdown, emergency stop switch, and pressure and temperature gauges on suction and discharge piping.\n\nThe purger has the following safeguards:  pressure relief valve, check valves, shutoff valves, metering valves, water bubbler, and liquid level control valves.",

      "SummaryText": "Rich Products Corporation - Hilliard Facility produces donuts which are frozen for shipment by using an ammonia refrigeration system (system).  The system contains approximately 44,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia which is liquified under pressure.\n  \nRich Products Corporation - Hilliard Facility endeavors to eliminate accidents and health hazards to Associates, customers, and the community by having in place procedures to provide Associates educational training, safe working conditions, and the means to increase awareness of potential dangers both on and off the job. Rich Products Corporation - Hilliard Facility's objective is to prevent unwanted releases of ammonia into locations that could potentially expose Associates and others to serious hazards.  An effective program requires a systematic approach to evaluating the entire system.  Workplace and process safety are major concerns to management and Associates alike.  The prevention and mitigation of unwanted releases of ammonia into locations that could expose Associates and the community to serious hazards is of primary concern.   \n\nRich Products Corporation - Hilliard Facility has developed this program in accordance with OSHA Title 29 CFR 1910.119, and the USEPA Title 40 CFR Part 68.  The program is designed to inform all Associates of the hazards of ammonia, procedures for the safe use of ammonia, and the steps taken for the safety of Associates in the event of a release or spill (i.e., emergency response plan, management of change procedures, preventative maintenance program, associate training, etc.).  \n\nRich Products Corporation - Hilliard Facility has not had an accidental release over the last five years.\n\nRich Products Corporation - Hilliard Facility has an emergency response program written to comply with OSHA 29 CFR 1910.119 (n), OSHA 29 CFR 1910.38, and USEPA 40 CFR 68.95.  \n"
