      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nSource and Process Description.\n\nThe main operation at New Orleans Cold Storage is the warehousing and distribution of frozen bulk\nfoodstuff.  The facility consists of several cold storage rooms that are cooled by a main refrigeration system. \nAn additional \"blast\" unit is used to maintain one room at very low temperatures (-30 degrees F.)\n\nBoth refrigeration units utilize Anhydrous Ammonia (100% conc.) as the system coolant.  The main\nrefrigeration unit has a maximum capacity of 10,000 pounds of ammonia.  The blast unit has a maximum\ncapacity of 9,000 pounds.  At this facility, both systems are interconnected, therefore, the distance to the\ntoxic endpoint is calculated using 19,000  pounds of ammonia.\n\nSummary of Major Hazards.\n\nThe primary hazard associated with a release of Anhydrous Ammonia is exposure of persons and sensitive\nenvironmental areas to toxic levels of ammonia vapor.  Anhydrous Ammonia is a toxic gas that is also a\ncorrosive irritant to eyes, skin, respiratory tract and mucous membranes.  Contact of evaporating liquid with\nskin will freeze the tissue, then produce a caustic burn.  However, the burn hazard should be considered\nsecondary to the toxic effects from exposure to the gas.\n\nThe toxic endpoint for Anhydrous Ammonia has been determined to be 200 parts per million (ppm).  It is\ndefined as the concentration that almost all persons can withstand for one hour without permanent adverse\neffects.  However, aggravation of existing respiratory and skin diseases may occur at concentrations below\nthe toxic endpoint.\n\nExplanation of How Releases are Prevented\n\nThe primary mitigation system for this facility is the Engine Room enclosure.  Although a catastrophic\nrelease would have ample opportunity to be vented to the atmosphere, the engine room enclosure would\nprovide a significant degree of isolation in the more likely release scenario.   An active countermeasure to\nany leaks or releases is the ammonia sensors in the engine room.  If "

This includes a daily inspection of\ncompressors, pumps and associated equipment, and a weekly, monthly and annual inspection, testing and\nmaintenance schedule that is rigidly followed, ensuring a well-maintained physical plant.\n\nAll operating procedures have been recently reviewed/revised and all personnel responsible for the proper\noperation of the refrigeration units have received refresher training in the procedures.  These elements of\nthis program will further reduce the possibility of an accidental release caused by human error.\n\nSteps Taken to Address Hazards.\n\nThe primary methods for generating recommendations are through periodic review and/or revision of\nProcess Hazard Analyses (PHAs), incident investigations and operational procedures review (Management\nof Change). These reviews provide a means for continuous improvement.\n\nAs an example, in response to a recommendation from an incident investigation report from another facility,\ntwo sets of impervious body suits and self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) are positioned at all NOCS\nfacilities.  All facility engineers are trained in the use of this equipment as an enhanced way of personnel\nrescue, and rapid  release response and control.\n\nResponse Action in the Event of a Release.\n\nUpon initial discovery of a leak or release, whether by sensor and alarm or personnel, a rapid and decisive\nresponse is critical to minimizing the potential impacts to off-site populations and other sensitive areas.
