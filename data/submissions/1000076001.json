This commitment is strongly supported by senior management and is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as employee training and in considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our facility. The facility does not anticipate having any type of uncontrolled release.  However, if an uncontrolled release does occur, the personnel at the facility will evaluate the situation, take actions within the capabilities of the plant, and notify the necessary outside agencies.\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe Makena plant is a cryogenic natural gas processing plant which extracts hydrocarbon liquids from raw natural gas streams.  The raw natural gas streams are delivered via pipeline to the plant from the local gathering system.  After extraction of the hydrocarbon liquids, residue gas and these liquids are sold as products.  Products are transported from the plant via pipeline and truck.  There are no listed toxic substances which exceed their respective threshold quantities stored at this facility.\n\n\n\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\n\nSeveral storage vessels within the plant process were evaluated for the worst case release scenario.  Results of the worst case release scenario indicate that the process is subject to RMP Program Level 1 requirements.  \n\n\n\nThe scenario involves a vapor cloud explosion involving 268,104 pounds of a flammable mixture from the Condensate Storage Drum The entire inventory of this vessel is assumed to release and ignite, resulting in a vapor cloud explosion and impacting an area wi"

One other vessel produced a 0.5-mile radius when modeled in RMP Comp; however, the Condensate Storage Drum is the largest vessel at the site. \n\n\n\nThe facility is not located within a populated area; therefore, the WCS would not affect a public receptor and is considered part of a Program 1 process.  A consideration of the 0.5-mile radius has been incorporated into our notification and emergency response planning.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThis plant is regulated by 29 CFR 1910.119 (Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals - PSM), 1910.38 (Employee Emergency Plans), as well as other federal, state and local regulations which are in place to reduce the potential for the release of Highly Hazardous Chemicals.\n\n\n\nThis plant has implemented the PSM elements to facilitate accidental release prevention.  Process safety information, consisting of technical standards, specifications and levels, promotes safe process design and operation.  Process hazard analysis evaluates hazards against safeguards needed to mitigate likelihood of an accidental release. Process changes are managed through the management of change procedure, by considering the impact that a change will have on the rest of the process.  For new or significantly changed processes, a pre-startup safety review is conducted as a final check to enable safe start up.  \n\n\n\nThe employee participation program promotes the development of necessary expertise, experiences, judgment, and proactive initiative within the workforce.  A comprehensive training program ensures that employees are knowledgeable about the processes they are responsible to operate and control.  Operating procedures explain correct startup, operation and shutdown procedures for various equipment in the process.  The hot work program is in place to promote safety of job"

This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment. This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nOutrigger Energy has conducted a PHA to ensure that hazards associated with the various processes at the Makena Gas Plant are identified and controlled. Within the PHA, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.  The Company primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations. The HAZOP methodology utilizes a systematic nodal approach to assess potential process deviations and associated risks.\n\n\n\nThe analyses are conducted using a team of people with operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. The team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process, as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when it believes such measures are necessary. Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team. This ranking is measured against the Outrigger Energy risk matrix to ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive appropriate attention.  \n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nOutrigger Energy maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup,"

These procedures shall be annually certified as current and accurate. The procedures will be kept current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.\n\n\n\nThe operating procedures are used to communicate safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety. Examples of these include (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) pipe break procedures for hazard mitigation before process piping or equipment is opened, (4) a permit and procedure to control spark producing activities (i.e., hot work), and (5) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space. These procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, Outrigger Energy has developed a comprehensive training program for the employees involved in operating a process. New employees receive basic training in gas plant operations if they are not already familiar with such operations. After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.
