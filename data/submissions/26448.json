Our continuing work to prevent accidents and releases from occurring, as well as our preparations to respond to accidents if they should occur, help to ensure the safety of our employees and the public as well as protection of the environment.  This Risk Management Plan amends the Risk Management Plan for the Philadelphia Plant prepared in 1999.  The Amendment was required to reflect the revised Worst Case Scenario of the chemical compound Nitric Acid (90%).  The 1999 Risk Management Plan included a Worst Case Scenario analysis for Oleum (20%).  The use of Oleum (20%) has been discontinued at the Philadelphia Plant.  Both compounds are RMP regulated chemicals.  Rohm and Haas Company is making additional information available to the public in connection with this RMP.  This summary, prepared pursuant to 40 CFR ?68.115, provides an overview of the many risk management activities at the Philadelphia Plant and includes:\n\n1.0    Introduction\n2.0    General Facility Information\n3.0    Regulated Substances\n4.0    Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policy\n5.0    The General Accident Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps  \n6.0    Five Year Accident History\n7.0    Emergency Response Program \n8.0    Worst Case and Alternative Case Release Scenarios\n9.0    Planned Changes to Improve Safety \n\nThe EPA?s Risk Management Program\n\nIn a series of rules promulgated between 1994 and 1998, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency established the Risk Management Program (RMP) under Clean Air Act ' 112(r).

For example, the plant complies with OSHA?s Process Safety Management (PSM) rule, which is nearly identical to EPA?s Risk Management Program (RMP) rule. Additionally, the Plant follows corporate and plant-specific safety standards, which in some cases are more stringent than the OSHA general safety standards.  The following items are part of our ongoing program to prevent releases and incidents:  \n\n1)     Employee Participation ? Employees are involved in many activities to continuously improve plant safety.  Employees participate in safety committees, job safety analysis, audits, design and pre-startup safety reviews, process hazard analysis, training, procedure development and monthly safety meetings.\n\n2)    Process Hazard Analysis - Various process hazard analysis techniques are used to identify and analyze the potential hazards associated with the chemicals and processes we use. Corrective action plans are developed and implemented as part of the analyses and updated a minimum of every five years. Safety systems are designed into the processes.  These are designed to create several layers of protection, so that if one system fails other systems will maintain the process in a safe state.  Examples include:\n \n4    Redundant safety systems and instrumentation\n4    Automatic shutdown devices that are triggered if critical safety equipment malfunctions\n4    Secondary containment for storage tanks\n4    Alarm systems and automatic shutdown devices for critical control parameters\n4    Pressure relief devices to prevent overpressurization\n4    Fire protection systems\n4    Operator surveillance of unloading operations\n4    Permit system to control work in hazardous areas\n4    Work preplanning and safety reviews\n\n3)    Operating Procedures ?

These audits review accident prevention activities to ensure the requirements of the programs are being met. \n\n6.0    Five Year Accident History\n\nThe RMP rule requires each company to include a description of all accidental releases from covered processes that result in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on-site, or known off-site deaths, injury, evacuation, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.  The Rohm and Haas Philadelphia plant has had no events meeting this criteria during the last five years.\n\n\n7.0    Emergency Response Program \n\nThe facility maintains an up-to-date emergency response plan which is coordinated with the Philadelphia Fire Department and the Philadelphia Local Emergency Planning Committee (PLEPC). The plan has been designed to meet the requirements of all relevant regulations requiring emergency response plans, and is intended to prevent and mitigate the consequences of a hazardous material spill, protect the well-being of Rohm and Haas employees, the surrounding community, and the environment, and serve as a reference to responders in the event of an emergency.  The Rohm and Haas Philadelphia Plant?s emergency response plan specifically includes a spill or release of Nitric Acid.  Copies of the plant?s emergency response plan have been provided to the Philadelphia Fire Department, the local hospital, the PLEPC, and the State and Federal Environmental Protection Agencies.  \n\nA trained on-site incident commander is assigned the responsibility of coordinating the Plant response to any incident which may occur.

Plant and Community Sirens are tested monthly, and plant evacuation drills are held annually.  All plant employees are trained on the relevant aspects of the emergency response plan.  \n\n\n 8.0    Worst Case and Alternative Case Release Scenarios\n\nThe RMP rule provides detailed requirements that define a worst case scenario (WCS), namely a release of the entire contents of the largest storage vessel occurring under very stable weather conditions and at a low wind speed that results in the greatest distance to an ?endpoint?  In general terms, the distance to the ?endpoint? is the distance a toxic vapor cloud will travel before dissipating to the point that serious injuries from short-term exposures will no longer occur.  EPA notes that the worst case scenario is designed principally to support a dialogue between the source and the community on release prevention, and not to serve as the sole or primary basis for emergency planning.  Based on previous history, in addition to the several layers of protection in place, the worst-case scenario is highly unlikely to actually occur.\n\nThe RMP rule also defines the alternate release scenario (ARS). Unlike the worst case scenario, the ARS can be limited by active mitigation safeguards, such as alarms, automatic shutdowns, and operator interventions.  According to EPA, an ARS is a more useful communication tool for the public and first responders and for emergency response preparedness and planning. \n\nThe WCS and ARS include administrative and mitigation measures which will act to limit the distances for each reported scenario.  Please refer to section 5.0 for Administrative controls.  Mitigation measures include the following:  Deluge system, remote fire monitor nozzle, containment dike system with sumps and drains, and safety interlock systems.\n\nWorst Case Scenario:  Rohm and Haas Philadelphia ha"

It assumes the loss of the entire inventory of a 2,000 gallon (22,440 pound) storage tank inside a containment dike over a ten minute period.  This scenario takes the following passive mitigation systems into account:\nA containment dike that will contain tank contents, a bermed tankwagon loading/unloading station, and below grade sumps and drains to the chemical sewer within the dike area.\nThese passive mitigation systems would all act to reduce a spill pool area such that the vaporization rate to the atmosphere would be significantly reduced.  The PHAST dispersion model was used to determine the toxic endpoint of this release, and such a release could have a significant off-site impact.  The PHAST dispersion model has identified a toxic endpoint distance of 0.9 miles.  This release could affect the surrounding community which includes: residences, schools, recreation areas, major commercial, office, and industrial areas, and Interstate 95 depending on the weather conditions and the wind direction.  \n\nBecause of the plant controls, procedures, and training, this worst case event is considered highly unlikely.  \n\n\n Alternate Release Scenario:  Rohm and Haas Philadelphia has identified one ARS based on the RMP definition. \n\n\nAlternate Release Scenario (ARS) - Nitric Acid (Toxic Liquid)\n\nRohm and Haas Philadelphia has identified one Alternate Release Scenario for Nitric Acid.  This scenario was chosen after reviewing process hazard analysis, the plant spill history, and discussing alternatives with knowledgeable and experienced unit personnel.  The scenario we have identified is more credible than that described in the worst case, but is still highly unlikely given the multiple levels of protection and extensive employee training.

The tank truck unloading operation is constantly attended by an operator per DOT regulations.  It is assumed that the release would be physically detected by the operator and stopped within 10 minutes.  The release would be contained in a sloped and diked area as the tank truck, storage tank and piping are all within a diked area.  This containment would reduce the pool area, thereby reducing the Nitric Acid vaporization rate.  The unloading area is equipped with a deluge system and a remote fire monitor nozzle to assist with mitigation. The PHAST dispersion model was used to determine the toxic endpoint.  The PHAST dispersion model has identified a toxic endpoint distance of 0.1 miles.  This release could affect plant employees, and the employees of the Frankford Arsenal to the north, depending on the weather conditions and the wind direction. There are no residences or environmental receptors within the alternate release toxic endpoint circle.  \n\n\n9.0    Planned Changes to Improve Safety \n\nThe plant focus on safety is strong throughout the Rohm and Haas Company.
