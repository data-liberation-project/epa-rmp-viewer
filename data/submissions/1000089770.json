      "SummaryText": "OVERVIEW OF FACILITY AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nThe JP Oil Gas Plant processes natural gas from crude oil production wells by removing ethane and Natural Gas Liquids (NGLs) from the produced natural gas.   The gas plant inlet receives produced field gas that first dehydrates the gas using a cold separator followed by a glycol/hydrocarbon separator.  The fluids from the separation processes are sent back to either the crude oil wash tank or to the water system.  The dry gas is next sent to a De-ethanizer tower, where the extracted ethane is sent to the sales gas line.  The remaining gas is then processed by the De-butanizer tower, with the extracted butane being sent to crude oil storage tanks and blended back into the crude oil.  The remaining gas components are stored in a Liquid Petroleum Gas vessel to be shipped via truck.\n\n\n\nThe produced natural gas, ethane-stream, and NGLs are defined as hazardous chemicals due to the fire and explosion characteristics and have a flashpoint less than 150 degrees Fahrenheit.  The volume of speciated propane (45,449 lbs) and butane (15,886 lbs) in the 18,000-gallon NGL vessel exceed the threshold quantity for the CAL-ARP program.\n\n\n\nThe NGL vessel has a worst-case vapor cloud explosion distance of 0.3 miles (0.6 kilometers), based on the results using the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) RMP*Comp model.  The proximity of residential dwellings is within the 0.3 mile explosion radius and triggers a program 3 level under OSHA's PSM applicability.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nProcess safety management is the proactive identification, evaluation and mitigation or prevention of chemical releases that could occur as a result of failures in processes, procedures, or equipment.  The written Process Safety Management (PSM) addresses hazardous chemicals to prevent unwanted releases.  A release from the JP Oil Gas Plant could result in an explosion which could expose employees, contractors a"

Using this approach, the process design, process technology, process changes, operational and maintenance activities and procedures, nonroutine activities and procedures, emergency preparedness plans and procedures, training programs, and other elements that affect the process were all considered in the evaluation.\n\n\n\nThe PSM plan has been developed in accordance with the Risk Management Plan (RMP - CalEMA & U.S. EPA) and Process Safety Management (Cal/OSHA) requirements. \n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION\n\nProcess safety management is the proactive identification, evaluation and mitigation or prevention of chemical releases that could occur as a result of failures in processes, procedures, or equipment.\n\n\n\nThe process safety management plan reviews the hazardous chemicals associated with the JP Oil Gas Plant that have the potential to cause a catastrophic incident. The Process Management Safety Plan is used to aid employers in their efforts to prevent or mitigate episodic chemical releases that could lead to a catastrophe in the workplace and possibly in the surrounding community as required by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) standard and California Accidental Release Prevention (Cal-ARP) program.\n\nAny incident or near-miss will be thoroughly investigated to identify the chain of events and causes so that corrective measures can be developed and implemented. Accordingly, PSM requires the investigation of each incident that resulted in, or could reasonably have resulted in, a catastrophic release of a hazardous chemical in the workplace.\n\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere have not been any accidents at the JP Oil Gas Plant.  \n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe Emergency Response Plan details emergency situations that may occur and addresses the"

Emergency response situations and procedures to be followed are documented in the Emergency Response Plan.\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThe audit team, through its systematic analysis, documents areas that require corrective action as well as where the process safety management system is effective. This provides a record of the audit procedures and findings and serves as a baseline of operation data for future audits. It will assist in determining changes or trends in future audits.\n\n\n\nCorrective action is one of the most important parts of the audit and includes identifying deficiencies, and planning, following-up, and documenting the corrections. The corrective action process normally begins with a management review of the audit findings. The purpose of this review is to determine what actions are appropriate, and to establish priorities, timetables, resource allocations and requirements, and responsibilities. In some cases, corrective action may involve a simple change in procedures or a minor maintenance effort to remedy the problem. Management of change procedures need to be used, as appropriate, even for a seemingly minor change. Many of the deficiencies can be acted on promptly, while some may require engineering studies or more detailed review of actual procedures and practices. There may be instances where no action is necessary; this is a valid response to an audit finding. All actions taken, including an explanation when no action is taken on a finding, need to be documented.\n\n\n\nThe employer must assure that each deficiency identified is addressed, the corrective action to be taken is noted, and the responsible audit person or team is properly documented. To control the corrective action process, the employer should consider the use of a tracking system. This tracking system might include periodic status reports shared with affected levels of management, specific reports such as completion of a"
