As such, the information, procedures, policies, and documentation that make up this program must be made easily accessible. To accomplish this elements have been organized in a way that is consistent with the corporate organization, how frequently different elements are accessed, and who needs to refer to the program.  The order of elements within this organization is not the same as they are listed in the regulations, and in some cases portions of elements may be found in more than one location.   \n\n\n\n1.THE CARGILL MEAT SOLUTIONS CORPORATION, RISK & PROCESS SAFETY MANAGEMENT PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThis is to inform all interested persons, including employees, that Cargill Meat Solutions Corporation has updated their unified Risk & Process Safety Management Program. The program is in compliance with California's Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program (in California CCR Title 19, Chapter 4.5 Program Level 3 Elements. At the Federal level, Title 40 CFR Part 68), and California OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) of Acutely Hazardous Materials standard (in California CCR Title 8, Section 5189"

This program has been prepared to address the risks involved with the presence of anhydrous ammonia, which is contained within our refrigeration systems. \n\n\n\nOur program promotes overall plant, worker, and public safety. The program enables our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of anhydrous ammonia. Overall, the program is designed to prevent accidental fatalities, injuries and illnesses and avoid physical property damage.\n\n\n\nOur company has an exemplary safety record, one that we are quite proud of. Our company has many policies and procedures in place to promote overall plant, worker and public safety. We have: \n\n(1) prepared a unified program based on the PSM plan to meet CalARP obligations as well; \n\n(2) reorganized the program so that it meshes more closely with general Cargill Meat Solutions Corporation business practices; and \n\n(3) reviewed plan documentation forms and responsibilities. \n\nThe unified Risk & Process Safety Management Plan sets forth rules, procedures and practices that will help our employees protect themselves and our neighbors.\n\n\n\n\n\n2.    DESCRIPTION OF AMMONIA SYSTEM\n\nThe Cargill Meat Solutions Corporation is a commercial beef slaughter house and processing facility. The Main Processing System provides refrigeration capacity to the Kill Floor area, Offal Storage rooms, Chill Coolers and Boning Rooms. The Kill Floor is cooled by two packaged roof mounted ACUair blower coil units. There are four Carcass Coolers and two Offal Storage rooms that are cooled by ceiling mounted fan coil units. There are five Boning Rooms that are cooled by a combination of three packaged roof mounted ACUair blower coil units and ceiling mounted fan coil units. A computer system provides substantial control and alarm capability. \n\n\n\nHigh pressure liquid from a high pressure receiver is "

From there, low pressure liquid is piped to each cold room, where it passes through a solenoid valve and hand expansion valve and into evaporator coils. Low temperature liquid circulates through the evaporator coils. Low pressure and temperature gas and overfeed liquid passes through regulators or check valves and is returned to one of two pumped liquid recirculators located in the engine room. The residual liquid is separated from the gas in the accumulator and the suction gas is piped to the screw compressors which elevate the temperature and pressure of the gas. The high pressure discharge from the compressors is sent to water cooled evaporative condensers where the high pressure gas ammonia is liquefied and returned to a thermosyphon vessel and from the thermosyphon vessel it returns to the high pressure receiver. High pressure liquid from the thermosyphon vessel is supplied to the oil coolers on each screw compressor. High temperature liquid is evaporated in the oil cooler and a combination of high temperature gas and liquid is returned to the thermosyphon vessel by thermosyphon action. Excess liquid from the liquid recirculators is pumped to a transfer vessel where the liquid transfers into the high pressure receiver by gravity. \n\n\n\nThe Kill Floor, Offal rooms, and two Chill Coolers were new facilities built from 1999 to 2001. The other Chill Coolers the Boning areas were remodels of an existing meat processing facility. This work was done from 2001 to 2004. All areas are served by a new ammonia refrigeration system designed and installed by professional refrigeration engineers in accordance with industry standards at the time.

In addition, ammonia detectors are located throughout the facility, and will shut down equipment if ammonia is detected.

Therefore, the main facility is treated as a single process.\n\n\n\nWest Coast Grinding is a beef grinding and packaging facility located on the Cargill Meat Solutions Corporation property.

The Main Processing System contains a total charge of approximately 30,000 lb, while the West Coast Grinding system contains approximately 4,800 lb. It is extremely important that the systems are maintained and operated in a safe and efficient manner. Management is committed to making sure that all employees are made aware of the potential danger of an ammonia leak.\n\n\n\nOur refrigeration personnel monitor the ammonia refrigeration system/process and keep an active journal of all procedures and transactions that pertain to ammonia.

New employees are made aware of the potential risk of ammonia in an employee orientation meeting. During these meetings we also discuss preventative measures, such as evacuation, in order to be prepared for a release.\n\n\n\n4.

PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nOur company has an outstanding safety record, one that we are quite proud of. Many policies and procedures have been implemented to promote overall plant, worker and public safety. Nevertheless, Cargill Meat Solutions Corporation continually strives to improve in all areas, including safety. Preparation of this Risk & Process Safety Management Program has been the primary recent improvement, and implementation of the program is our plan for improved safety in the near future.\n\n\n\nThe Risk & Process Safety Management Program has been written so that program elements are aligned with Cargill Meat Solutions Corporation business practices rather than the order presented in the law. Thus, Safe Operating Procedures are grouped together for the benefit of our system operator. Safe Operating Policies are grouped together so that appropriate office staff may administer them. The Emergency Action Plan is now separated out and distributed widely through the plant for easy reference. \n\n\n\nThe Risk & Process Safety Management Program documentation forms and company policy forms pertaining to employee, contractor, and community safety have been carefully reviewed so as to prevent unnecessary complexity and redundancy. Our operator assisted in the writing of Standard Operating Procedures, and they are presented in a format that is easy to use. \n\n\n\nFor the future, Cargill Meat Solutions Corporation now thinks of the Risk & Process Safety Management Program as a living document. It is an interactive framework that guides safe action for Cargill Meat Solutions Corporation employees, but allows for feedback and continual improvement.
