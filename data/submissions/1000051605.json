The residual liquid is separated from the gas in the accumulator and the suction gas is piped to the screw compressors which elevate the temperature and pressure of the gas. The high pressure discharge from the compressors is sent to water cooled evaporative condensers where the high pressure gas ammonia is liquefied and returned to a thermosyphon vessel and from the thermosyphon vessel it returns to the high pressure receiver. High pressure liquid from the thermosyphon vessel is supplied to the oil coolers on each screw compressor. High temperature liquid is evaporated in the oil cooler and a combination of high temperature gas and liquid is returned to the thermosyphon vessel by thermosyphon action.

This program has been prepared to address the risks involved with the presence of anhydrous ammonia, which is contained within our refrigeration systems. \r\n\r\nOur program promotes overall plant, worker, and public safety. The program enables our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of anhydrous ammonia. Overall, the program is designed to prevent accidental fatalities, injuries and illnesses and avoid physical property damage.\r\n\r\nOur company has an exemplary safety record, one that we are quite proud of. Our company has many policies and procedures in place to promote overall plant, worker and public safety. We have: \r\n(1) prepared a unified program based on the PSM plan to meet CalARP obligations as well; \r\n(2) reorganized the program so that it meshes more closely with general Cargill Meat Solutions Corporation business practices; and \r\n(3) reviewed plan documentation forms and responsibilities. \r\nThe unified Risk & Process Safety Management Plan sets forth rules, procedures and practices that will help our employees protect themselves and our neighbors.\r\n\r\n\r\n2.\tDESCRIPTION OF AMMONIA SYSTEM\r\nThe Cargill Meat Solutions Corporation is a commercial beef slaughter house and processing facility. The Main Processing System provides refrigeration capacity to the Kill Floor area, Offal Storage rooms, Chill Coolers and Boning Rooms. The Kill Floor is cooled by two packaged roof mounted ACUair blower coil units. There are four Carcass Coolers and two Offal Storage rooms that are cooled by ceiling mounted fan coil units. There are five Boning Rooms that are cooled by a combination of three packaged roof mounted ACUair blower coil units and ceiling mounted fan coil units.

New employees are made aware of the potential risk of ammonia in an employee orientation meeting. During these meetings we also discuss preventative measures, such as evacuation, in order to be prepared for a release.\r\n\r\n4.\tFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\nCargill Meat Solutions Corporation has not had any accidental releases in the last five (5) years.\r\n\r\n5.\tEMERGENCY ACTION PLAN\r\n\r\nCargill Meat Solution's emergency action and response program has been developed to satisfy the following requirements:\r\n\r\n\u00bf\tCal/OSHA's Emergency Action Plan - Title 8 CCR \u00a73220\r\n\u00bf\tU.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) Emergency Action Plans - Title 29 CFR \u00a71910.38\r\n\u00bf\tCal/OSHA's Process Safety Management [Emergency Response Program Requirements] - Title 8 CCR \u00a75189(n)\r\n\u00bf\tU.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) Process Safety Management [Emergency Planning and Response Requirements]- Title 29 CFR \u00a71910.119(n)\r\n\u00bf\tCalifornia Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program [Emergency Response Program Requirements] - Title 19 CCR, Division 2, Chapter 4.5 \u00a72765.1-2765.2\r\n\u00bf\tUSEPA Risk Management Program [Emergency Response Program Requirements] - Title 40 CFR \u00a768.95\r\n\u00bf\tCalifornia Hazardous Materials Business Plan (HMBP) [Emergency Response Plans and Procedures] - Title 19 CCR, Division 2, Chapter 4 \u00a72731\r\n\r\nSeveral facility employees are trained in Level 2 Hazardous Response.

Many policies and procedures have been implemented to promote overall plant, worker and public safety. Nevertheless, Cargill Meat Solutions Corporation continually strives to improve in all areas, including safety. Preparation of this Risk & Process Safety Management Program has been the primary recent improvement, and implementation of the program is our plan for improved safety in the near future.\r\n\r\nThe Risk & Process Safety Management Program has been written so that program elements are aligned with Cargill Meat Solutions Corporation business practices rather than the order presented in the law. Thus, Safe Operating Procedures are grouped together for the benefit of our system operator. Safe Operating Policies are grouped together so that appropriate office staff may administer them. The Emergency Action Plan is now separated out and distributed widely through the plant for easy reference. \r\n\r\nThe Risk & Process Safety Management Program documentation forms and company policy forms pertaining to employee, contractor, and community safety have been carefully reviewed so as to prevent unnecessary complexity and redundancy. Our operator assisted in the writing of Standard Operating Procedures, and they are presented in a format that is easy to use. \r\n\r\nFor the future, Cargill Meat Solutions Corporation now thinks of the Risk & Process Safety Management Program as a living document. It is an interactive framework that guides safe action for Cargill Meat Solutions Corporation employees, but allows for feedback and continual improvement. Through the Risk & Process Safety Management Program Cargill Meat Solutions Corporation will continue to profit while maintaining overall plant, worker and public safety."
