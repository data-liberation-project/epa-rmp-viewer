Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThis facility handles chlorine and ammonia (anhydrous), which are considered hazardous materials.  The properties of both materials make it necessary to observe safety precautions in handling to prevent human exposure and to reduce the threat to the facility's workers and nearby members of the community.  It is the facility's policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and State of California rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the safe procedures used to handle chlorine and ammonia; the safety devices and system designed and constructed into the facility; and the training of the pertinent personnel.\n\n2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nChlorine gas is used at three locations in the CSDS facility-at the digest scrubber for order control of the scrubbed gases and at the two dryer scrubbers to oxidize the odor-causing compounds in the scrubbed gases.  Chlorine is delivered by the supplier for storage on a covered area on a concrete slab.  A one-ton cylinder is changed approximately once a month at the digest scrubber and every 10 days at each of the two dry scrubbers.  When the gas flow at each site falls to zero, the empty container is returned to the storage area with the forklift and a full container is brought back to the site.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is used at the CSDS facility to charge the central refrigeration system, provide product cooling during processing in silos and tanks, produce ice for a ice bank used for the chilled water generation for process uses, and provide cooling and freezing areas in the cold storage warehouse.  The majority of the anhydrous ammonia equipment is located in and around the Mechanical Equipment Room and the cold storage warehouse. The system is totally contained and the only losses of ammonia requiring delivery of makeup quantities are from small fugitive emissions at valve stems and pump"

Operation of the system is automatic through controllers that sense level, temperature, and pressure at various points in the system.\n\nThe receipt, storage, and handling of the subject substances are considered as part of one complete process.\n\n3a.  Worst Case Scenario\n\nThe one-ton chlorine cylinder is the largest vessels in the chlorine system.  The Worst Case release scenario to be modeled assumes that the full 2000 pounds of chlorine are released over a ten-minute period resulting in a release rate of 200 pounds per minute.  The distance to the endpoint of .0087 mg/l for the Worst Case release scenario is 1.3 miles.  This chlorine release will extend beyond the boundaries of the stationary source.\n\nThe total charge of ammonia in the system is approximately 10 tons.  The Worst Case release scenarios to be modeled assumes that 20,000 pounds of ammonia are released over a ten-minute period resulting in a release rate of 1100 pounds per minute.  The distance to the endpoint of .14 mg/l for the Worst Case release scenario is 1.5 miles.  This ammonia release will extend beyond the boundaries of the stationary source.\n\n3b.  Alternative Release Scenario\n\nThe Alternative Release scenario for the one-ton cylinder of chlorine assumes a release from a leaking valve at the connector, resulting in the release of 2 pounds of chlorine over a one-hour period.  The distance to the endpoint of .0087 mg/l for the Alternative Release scenario for chlorine is .1 mile.  This release will not extend beyond the boundaries of the stationary source.  \n\nThe Alternative Release scenario for the anhydrous ammonia system assumes a release from a ruptured disk/relief valve failure, resulting in the release of 2 pounds of ammonia over a one-hour period.

This release will not extend beyond the boundaries of the stationary source.  \n\n3c.  Administrative Controls\n\nAdministrative controls to limit the distances for each reported scenario exists to restrict to a minimum the amount of chlorine and ammonia released, if a release were to occur, and preferably to not have a release occur.  This administrative control is inherent in the operational procedures for the chlorine and ammonia systems and the training provided to the chlorine and ammonia operators.\n\n3d.  Mitigation Measures\n\nMitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario exists to restrict to a minimum the amount of chlorine and ammonia released, if a release were to occur, and preferably to not have a release occur.  The mitigation measures are based upon the design, inspection, testing, and maintenance of the chlorine and ammonia systems and its related equipment and components.\n\n4. General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe facility complies with all applicable federal and state codes and regulations.  There are safety meetings and safety training.  The Process Safety Management (PSM) program implemented at the facility for the ammonia related activities and equipment represents one of the facility's main active commitments to an accidental release prevention program.\n\n5. Five Year Accident History\n\nThere have been no incidents involving the release of ammonia or chlorine within the past five years at the facility.\n\n6. Emergency Response Program\n\nThe Emergency Response Program is based on alerting personnel at the facility of the need to evacuate the facility and await the arrival of responders from the City of Stockton Fire Department at the evacuation assembly location if a release occurs that causes the evacuation to be initiated.

Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThere are commitments made under the Process Hazard Analysis element of the Process Safety Management (PSM) that are being implemented at this time for the next year.  \nCurrent applicable codes and regulations are reviewed as part of the PSM to determine if other commitments need to be made to achieve increased operational safety for the regulated process system.  These commitments will be prevention and mitigation measures for accidental releases of the regulated substance."
