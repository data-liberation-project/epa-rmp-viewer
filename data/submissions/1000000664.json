THE OWNER, MANAGEMENT, AND EMPLOYEES OF GAVILON FERTILIZER \nARE COMMITTED TO THE PREVENTION OF \nANY ACCIDENTAL RELEASE OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA.  IF AN \nACCIDENTAL RELEASE SHOULD OCCUR, THE FACILITY IS PREPARED TO \nWORK WITH THE LOCAL FIRE DEPARTMENT, OR OTHER STATE AND LOCAL \nAUTHORITIES, TO MITIGATE ANY RELEASE AND TO MINIMIZE THE IMPACT \nOF THE RELEASE ON PEOPLE AND THE ENVIRONMENT. THE FACILTY WILL MAINTAIN  \nAN INTERNAL WRITTEN EMERGENCY PLAN.\n\nII. FACILITY INFORMATION:\n\nA. THE PRIMARY ACTIVITY OF THE FACILITY IS DISTRIBUTING NON-\nHAZARDOUS LIQUID FERTILIZERS FOR USE IN THE GEOGRAPHICAL \nAGRICULTURAL MARKET.  IN ORDER TO PROVIDE THE NEEDS OF OUR \nAGRICULTURAL CUSTOMERS, WE RECEIVE ANHYDROUS AMMONIA BY \nRAIL, WHICH IS USED AS A CROP NUTRIENT.  AS IT \nIS BEING UNLOADED IT IS NEUTRALIZED INTO A NON-HAZARDOUS \nFERTILIZER AND STORED AT THE FACILITY UNTIL TRANSPORTED TO \nVARIOUS LOCATIONS IN THE GEOGRAPHICAL AREA.  TYPICALLY, \nAMMONIA IS AT THE FACILITY 200 TO 325 DAYS OF THE YEAR. \nTHE MAXIMUM QUANTITY OF A RAIL CAR IS \nAPPROXIMATELY 150,000 POUNDS. A PLANT EMPLOYEE, TRAINED IN THE \nOPERATION OF UNLOADING AND HANDLING AMMONIA, IS IN \nATTENDANCE DURING THE TIME THE CAR IS HOOKED UNTIL THE TIME \nUNLOADING IS SUSPENDED AND THE CAR IS DISCONNECTED AND \nSECURED FOR SAFETY AND SECURITY.\n     \n III. THE ACCIDENT RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM:\n\nTHE FACILITY HAS IMPLEMENTED THE PROVISIONS OF \"SAFETY  \nREQUIREMENTS FOR THE  STORAGE AND HANDLING OF ANHYDROUS \nAMMONIA, K-61.1\", PUBLISHED BY THE  AMERICAN NATIONAL \nSTANDARDS INSTITUTE, INC.

THE STATE \nOF MINNESOTA REQUIRES THESE STANDARDS BE MAINTAINED.  \nPERIODICALLY THE PLANT IS SUBJECT TO STATE INSPECTIONS.\n\nTHE STANDARDS OF THE US OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH \nADMINISTRATION  (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"STORAGE AND HANDLIN"

AS CARS ARE RECEIVED, THEY ARE VISUALLY \nINSPECTED BY THE FACILITY MANAGER OR HIS DESIGNATE FOR SIGNS OF \nLEAKAGE.  THE SECURITY OF THE CARS BECOMES THE RESPONSIBILITY OF \nTHE FACILITY UNTIL EMPTIED AND RETURNED TO THE RAILROAD.  \nFACILITY PERSONNEL ARE NOT TRAINED TO MAKE REPAIRS, BUT IF \nDEFECTS OR LEAKS ARE DETECTED, THE FACILITY CONTACTS SUPPLIER \nAS WELL AS RAILROAD OFFICIALS. \n                                                                                           \nIV.

PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY:  \n\nSAFETY IMPROVEMENTS ARE AN ON-GOING PROCESS AT THE FACILITY.  PERIODIC \nEVALUATIONS ARE PERFORMED TO ASSESS THE MAINTENANCE OF SAFE \nCONDITIONS.
