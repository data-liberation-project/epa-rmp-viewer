Anhydrous Ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a \r\ncrop production nutrient. The maximum quantity stored would be 131325 pounds in the \r\nfacility's storage tank.\r\n3.\tThe worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of the storage tank \r\nrelease as a gas over 10 minutes. The maximum quantity released would be 131325 pounds, \r\nwhich represents the volume of the storage tank at 85% capacity as limited by design \r\nstandards and company procedures. The distance to the endpoint of dispersion based on the \r\nmodel used is 2.41 miles.\r\n4.      The Alternative-case release scenario is assumed to be a release from the rupture of a 2 inch line, \r\nwith 7200 pounds released over 2 minutes.  The distance to the endpoint of dispersion is .68 miles.\r\n5.\tTHE ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PROGRAM:  The facility complies with the \t       \r\nrules and Regulations relating to the handling of Anhydrous Ammonia and Low Pressure \r\nNitrogen Solution, Equipment, Containers and Storage Facilities.  These regulations \r\nadministered by the Illinois Department of Agriculture are consistent with ANSI K61.1 and \r\nOSHA 29CFR 1910.111  regarding storage and h"
