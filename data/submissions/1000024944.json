As such, the information, procedures, policies, and documentation that make up this program must be made easily accessible and updated as necessary. To accomplish this, Madera Power has elected to use PSMWriter&copy;, software developed and distributed by Resource Compliance, Inc. This software will assist us with updating, maintaining, scheduling, and tracking RMP-PSM related activities. \r\n\r\n1.1\tMADERA POWER, RISK & PROCESS SAFETY MANAGEMENT PROGRAM \r\n\r\nThis is to inform all interested persons, including employees, that Madera Power has updated their unified RMP-PSM Program. This program has been prepared to address the risks involved in operating and maintaining the following processes which have the presence of hazardous chemicals above threshold quantities: \r\n\r\nAmmonia Process\t| Anhydrous Ammonia | 60,000 lb\r\n\r\nOur RMP-PSM program promotes overall plant, worker, and public safety. The program enables our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of ammonia. Overall, the program is designed to prevent accidental fatalities, injuries, and illnesses and avoid physical property damage.\r\n\r\nMadera Power has an exemplary safety record, one that we are quite proud of. Our company has many policies and procedures in place to promote overall plant, worker and public safety. We have: \r\n\r\n1.\tPrepared a unified program based on the PSM plan to meet CalARP and RMP obligations as well\r\n2.\tOrganized the"

Ammonia gas is piped from a storage tank through a control valve (which is controlled by the NOx emissions), where it mixes with forced air in a duct.  The air-ammonia mixture flows into the combustor.\r\n\r\n1.3\tGENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE & CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\n\r\n1.3.1\tGENERAL \r\n\r\nWe inform our employees engaged in process operations of the dangers of an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia in annual safety meetings. During these meeting we also discuss preventative measures, such as evacuation, in order to be prepared for a release.\r\n\r\nMadera Power has also conducted an off-site consequence analysis of worst-case and alternative release scenarios for the ammonia process. These are for the purposes of informing the public in the event of an accidental release. The results of the analyses are reported in the body of the program. \r\n\r\n1.3.2\tANHYDROUS AMMONIA\r\n\r\nThe ammonia process at the Madera Power facility is an integral part of the overall business and operates most of the year. It is extremely important that this process is maintained and operated in a safe and efficient manner. Management is committed to making sure that employees are made aware of the potential danger of an ammonia leak.\r\n\r\n1.4\tFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nMadera Power has had no accidental release within the last five (5) years.\r\n\r\n1.5\tEMERGENCY ACTION AND RESPONSE PLAN\r\n\r\nMadera Power's emergency action and response program has been developed to satisfy the following requirements:\r\n\r\n\u00bf\tC"

Under this plan we will call emergency personnel and evacuate the facility. All response activities would be done in coordination with the Local Fire Department and their Hazardous Materials Response Team. \r\n\r\nEvery year we review with our employees our evacuation procedures in the event of an emergency, including a hazardous chemical release.\r\n\r\n1.6\tPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\n\r\nOur company has an outstanding safety record, one that we are quite proud of. Many policies and procedures have been implemented to promote overall plant, worker and public safety. Nevertheless, Madera Power continually strives to improve in all areas, including safety.\r\n\r\nBy utilizing PSMWriter&copy; software, all necessary employees have access to every aspect of the RMP-PSM program. This has improved Madera Power's ability to communicate hazardous situations to employees and contractors. In addition, PSMWriter&copy; tracks all RMP-PSM related events so that Madera Power's management team can ensure that the RMP-PSM program is being implemented.\r\n\r\nMadera Power has implemented all aspects of the RMP-PSM program. When a RMP-PSM program requirement is completed (i.e. mechanical integrity inspection, process hazard analysis, compliance audit, etc.) any specific action items related to that event are entered into PSMWriter&copy;, assigned a responsible person, and given a due date. Once the action item has been completed, the resolution can be documented using PSMWriter&copy; as well. A list of current or past due action items can be accessed at any time by those with access to PSMWriter&copy;.\r\n\r\nIn addition"

It is an interactive framework that guides safe action for Madera Power employees, but allows for feedback and continual improvement. Through the RMP-PSM program Madera Power will continue to maintain overall plant worker and public safety."
