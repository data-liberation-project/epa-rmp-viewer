All refinery process units are currently\n\nmanaged under the PSM Standard, therefore, these processes are, in effect, being\n\nmanaged as RMP Program Level 3 processes.  The refinery had a thoroughly-trained,\n\nexperienced, safety-motivated workforce that has achieved an outstanding safety record. \n\nThe refinery is in full compliance with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration\n\n(OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard.\n\n\n\nPremcor has a longstanding commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment\n\nis demonstrated by the time, money, and effort invested in training personnel and\n\npromoting safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes. \n\nOur policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated\n\nsubstances.  Safety tools include engineering controls, real time process monitoring, level,\n\npressure, and temperature alarms, leak detection systems, and automatic and manual\n\nmitigation systems.  If a release does occur, our trained personnel with respond quickly\n\nand effectively to control and contain the release.\n\n\n\nTo comply with the RMP standard we have focused upon the following:\n\n\n\nMaintaining the management system established by PSM\n\nAdapting the PSM management system to address RMP\n\nPerforming the hazard assessments\n\nCompiling the data elements\n\nCommunicating with the public concerning RMP issues\n\n\n\nPublic Communication of RMP \n\n\n\nPremcor (Williams Refining at the time) "

Twelve  area companies, numerous federal, state, and local\n\nregulatory and emergency response agencies participated in the symposium.

Approximately 600 people\n\nattended the symposium.\n\n\n\n The refinery has been working with our Community Advisory Panel (CAP) to identify\n\neffective means for communicating RMP/Safety information to our immediate neighboring\n\ncommunity.  CAP  members have provided many helpful suggestions, and have offered to\n\ndistribute our RMP-related printed material at various venues in the community.
