CFS is NOT involved in the conversion process.  This Program Description and information contained in this Program relates to contractor Mears Fertilizer, Inc. (hereinafter Contractor). Contractor has provided CFS with documentation to support a mechanical integrity program is in place along with written operating procedures, safe work procedures, emergency action plan, and a training program for the conversion process. Additionally, CFS has their own Emergency Action Plan, Incident Response Plan and other safety procedures and policies in place, including those required by the EPA under this Program. The involved contractor reports that the following safeties to the process are in place:\n\n\n\nAn audible and visual alarm system, which will warn if the pump or cooling tower fan malfunctions. Fisher N-550 Emergency Shut-off Valves are installed at discharge of source and at the ammonia pump, and\n\npneumatically held open during use, and they are capable of remote closure. The ammonia hose used between source and pump, as well as that used for bypass, is FMH-22 double-braided, corrugated 316L SS to\n\navoid potential rupture between these critical connections. A standard Fisher ammonia regulator is used at the pump, pressure controlled, to bypass any excess ammonia to the suction side of the pump. A standard ammonia back check valve is used on the input line at the Mix Unit. Pressure relief valves for the ammonia system are recertified annually by an outside vendor. ",

              "Description": "CONVERSION OF 10-34-0.  Central Farm Service (CFS) retains two OUTSIDE contractors who utilizes their own equipment for the production of ammoniated polyphosphate liquids. CFS is NOT involved in the conversion production process. This Program Description pertains to contractor, Blick's Phosphate Conversions(Blicks). Blicks owns and operates a mobile polyphosphate reaction processor that utilizes a pipe reactor (a.k.a. T-Reactor), which they bring on site to complete the conversion process for the CFS. The critical process safety parameters are as follows: Pressure: 350 psig. The 3 ammonia hoses are rated for a maximum working pressure of 350 psig with a burst pressure of 1,750 psig. The valves and pumps on the system are rated for a maximum working pressure of 400 psig. The Contractor monitors process pressures during the operation of the process and they are kept well below 350 psi. Additionally, there is a safety relief valve on the non-contact ammonia/product heat exchanger that is set to discharge at 250 psig, and the ammonia pump has a bypass valve with a differential pressure (between suction and discharge) setting of 150 psig. Thus, pressure should be relived to either atmosphere or the ammonia source tank if there is a sudden spike in system downstream of the ammonia transfer pump. Additional accident prevention program details relative to ensuring water and acid supplies are correct along with other details of the covered process are carried with the T-Reactor and part of Blicks comprehensive Emergency Response and Contingency Plan,their hazard analysis, operating procedures, training, etc. which documents are available at CFS.\n\n",

Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies at the Facility:\n\n\n\nThe Coop board, management and employees at Central Farm Service (CFS), 77 Cedar Street, Easton, MN location, are committed to the prevention of accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n\n\n2. Facility Information and Regulated Substance:\n\n\n\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage of fertilizers for sale to farmers. Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, handled and distributed for direct application. Anhydrous ammonia is used for crop production nutrients.  CFS-Easton also periodically retains two OUTSIDE contractors who utilize mobile units for the purpose of blending anhydrous ammonia with phosphoric acid to produce a non-hazardous liquid fertilizer, 10-34-0.  CFS is neither involved in the conversion process, nor does CFS own the conversion equipment.  Raw materials used in the conversion process include anhydrous ammonia, super phosphoric acid and water. When one of the contractor's portable conversion equipment arrives at the site to conduct the conversion, CFS Easton's RMP is meshed with the contractor's PSM to satisfy regulatory requirements during the conversion process. \n\n\n\nThe facility has two 18,000 gallon storage tanks and one 30,000 gallon (recently added) storage tank for a maximum quantity of BULK ammonia storage of approximately 308,000 pounds; and approximately 135,000 pounds of additional storage is available in 1,450 gallon nurse tanks.  The maximum quantity handled at one time would be the unloading of a tank truck holding 40,000-45,000 pounds.\n\n\n\nThis facility is not constantly manned every work day.  Approximately 10"

General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps:\n\n\n\nThe facility has implemented Minnesota Department of Agriculture rules, the Standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia; and 40 CFR part 68 as they apply to this facility. The facility is required to conduct a semi-annual inspection of all bulk and nurse tank equipment, including load and unload equipment, and perform any needed maintenance to the equipment found during the inspections. \n\n\n\nAs it relates to Process two and Process three (conversion to 10-34-0 by outside contractors) our contractors have provided CFS with information to support they have a mechanical integrity program in place along with written operating procedures, safe work procedures, emergency action plan and a training program. \n\n\n\n4. The Five-year Accident History PROCESS 1 - HANDLING AND STORAGE:  \n\n\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years on site that have: \n\n\n\na) Caused any death, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; or \n\nb) To our knowledge resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage.\n\n\n\n\n\n4.  The Five-year Accident History PROCESS 2 and PROCESS 3 - CONVERSION OF 10-34-00 BY OUTSIDE CONTRACTORS (MOBILE UNIT)\n\n\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that have:\n\na) Caused any death, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility in question during the conversion process; or \n\nb) To our knowledge resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage at the facility in question during the conversion process.  \n\n\n\nHowe"
