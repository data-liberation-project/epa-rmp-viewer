      "SummaryText": "MATHESON GAS PRODUCTS - GLOUCESTER MA BRANCH\n\nRMP EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nThis Matheson Gas Products facility transfills and purifies specialty industrial gases in both large and small quantities.  The source material gas which is transfilled and sometimes purified may be packaged in tube trailers, ton cylinder units or regular cylinders, depending on the gas.  The finished product varies from a single pure chemical gas to gas mixtures, and the capacity of product cylinders varies from 2000 pounds to less than 1 pound of gas depending on the size of the cylinder and the type of material involved.  \n\nThe only process now at this site containing greater-than-threshold amounts of chemicals subject to the RMP regulations is hydrogen chloride storage.  We have considered storage as an RMP \"process\", but this is obviously not a true process.  The single largest container or cylinder of each was used as a basis for the off-site consequence analysis.  Because storage is not a true process, many of the questions for these storage chemicals in the Program 3 section have been answered on the basis of plant practices in general.  For cylinder storage for example, the \"maintenance\" program is simply to make sure that cylinders are requalified (i.e. re-tested every five years).  Storage areas are inspected routinely but that is generally not considered typical preventive maintenance.  \n\nThe greatest safeguard existing at this site is the nature of the cylinders themselves.  The Department of Transportation (DOT) regulations, the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) Codes and the Compressed Gas Association (CGA) guidelines mandate the way in which cylinders are manufactured and used. Everything about cylinder construction is mandated, from the type of metallurgy to the wall thickness; every cylinder is designed to withstand a given pressure which must exceed the fill pressure by a certain percentage.  Any appurtenance such as pressure relief devices and valves must m"

Every cylinder is designed to withstand extremes of operation and overpressure conditions that make catastrophic failure extremely unlikely.  In addition cylinders are leak checked when they are first received and leak checked prior to being shipped out.  \n\n \nDESCRIPTION OF WORST-CASE AND ALTERNATIVE CASE SCENARIOS\n\nWorst-Case Scenarios\n\nFor the worst-case release scenario, the RMPComp model was used.  The mandatory use of a ten-minute release time (no matter what model is used) results in a worst-case release scenario that is unrealistic at best. In addition no adjustments are allowed for the presence and use of active mitigation systems and procedures which include the presence of scrubbers. Consequently Matheson Gas Products believes the results from this worst case modeling cannot be used in any meaningful way. \n\nThe worst-case release scenario for hydrogen chloride assumes the loss of the largest container or 55 lbs. of gas in ten minutes. This represents a release rate of 5.5 lbs. of gas per minute.  The theoretical area of concern to the endpoint is 0.4 miles.\n\nAlternative case scenarios\n\nFor hydrogen chloride storage the most likely alternative release scenario is a valve leak.  There is no real process occurring in storage; and the valve represents the most likely weak point of the cylinder in storage.  A valve leak in a hydrogen chloride cylinder would release 6 lbs./minute for approximately 9 minutes, for a total release of 54 lbs. The theoretical area of concern to the endpoint is 0.1 miles.\n\nACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere have been no accidents in the last five years at this site involving releases of RMP regulated processes. \n\nPREVENTION PROGRAM and EMERGENCY RESPONSE\n\nThe exacting nature of cylinder specifications and the leak checking procedure performed on every cylinder received at the site make releases from stored cylinders extremely unlikely.  \n\nThis facility has an Emergency Response Plan which includes not"
