This commitment is reflected in the safety and environmental programs that are implemented at the facility. For example, written procedures have been created for operating the ammonia refrigeration system. Only trained operators and licensed refrigeration contractors are permitted to perform system operations. Quality Refirgerated Services has also developed a robust maintenance program to ensure the equipment is in good operating condition. All of these programs are geared towards the prevention of an accidental release at the facility. In addition, these programs\n\nincorporate emergency procedures to mitigate the effects of a release if it does occur. At such an event, emergency coordinators will assess the situation and notify outside responding agencies as necessary.\n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nQuality Refrigerated Services is located at 3301 G. Street, Omaha, NE. The area surrounding the facility is urban with a mixture of light business and residential areas. The Quality Refrigerated Services ammonia refrigeration process was designed and constructed in accordance with all applicable federal, state, and local regulations.  The ammonia refrigeration system uses approximately 10001 pounds of ammonia for dock operations, cold storage, and freezer storage. The majority of the system is located in the machine room including vessels and compressors. The condensers and  are mounted on the roof above the machine room. Evaporators are located in their respective cold storage rooms/areas.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nQuality Services Refrigeration has developed an accidental release prevention program for compliance with OSHA and EPA regulations. The program includes but is not limited to the following elements:\n\n\n\nSafety"

These are comprised of equipment monitoring systems and safety cutouts to shut off the equipment when operating parameters exceed safe operating limits. Relief\n\nvalves on pressurized ammonia vessels prevent equipment rupture in the event of over-pressurization. Regular inspections and tests are performed to ensure these controls are in good working order.\n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nA review of the facility's five year accident history showed that there have been no incidents at the facility that meet the RMP criteria for a reportable accident (onsite deaths, injuries, or significant property damage; or known offsite deaths, injuries, property damage, environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place). In addition, there have been no incidents at the facility in the\n\nlast five years that resulted in a release of more than the Federal Reportable Quantity (100 pounds).\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nQuality Refrigerated Services has developed an Emergency Action Plan (EAP) for the purpose of protecting\n\nemployees and the surrounding community. The EAP covers procedures for: 1) evacuating and accounting for visitors and employees, 2) dealing with an ammonia release and other foreseeable emergencies that could occur onsite, 3) notifying external agencies and emergency response personnel, and 4) administering first aid measures for ammonia exposure. Employees are informed of the elements of the EAP."

      "SummaryText": " \n\n\n\nIn the event of an ammonia release, employees will evacuate or shelter-in-place, depending on the nature of the release, \n\nand the facility will coordinate response procedures by contacting the Omaha Fire Department. Ammonia sensors are present in the\n\nmachine room, and automatic shut down systems. Employees within the building are to shelter in place or evacuate to a point upwind of the facility. Evacuation drills are performed annually. This Plan will be reviewed and updated at least once per year to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations, as well as to incorporate facility changes due to the renovation of the facility.\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nPHA's and Compliance Audits will be performed on the ammonia refrigeration system, and these studies will offer action items to improve safety at the facility. The recommendations will mainly consist of formalizing procedures, implementing practices consistent with industry standards, and performing inspections and tests to maintain the integrity of the equipment. Quality Refrigerated Services will\n\nimplement these action items and will move forward with completing any remaining outstanding recommendations. In addition, the facility plans to continue providing employees with a safe work environment through continued training on current policies and procedures, and conducting audits to identify deficiencies and make improvements."
