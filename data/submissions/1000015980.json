      "SummaryText": "Facility:\n\nThis RMP correction submitted on 06/16/2014, is to address changes in management at the LANXESS Orange Site from Markus Linke to John Schmidt, Vice President, North America Manufacturing, BU PBR. John Schmidt is the current owner and operator of the LANXESS Orange Site facility, and, also the certifying offical for the site. In addition, this RMP correction addresses \"Date of last PHA update\" and, \"Expected completion date of all changes from last PHA update\". \n\n\n\nThis RMP correction is to address additional increase of rail cars on site for 1,3-Butadiene raw material supply from 4,750,000 lbs to potential maximum of 7,250,000 lbs. This potential increase is in addition to the previous RMP resubmission that addressed increasing 1,3-Butadiene quantity on site, from 2,225,000 to potential maximum of 4,750,000 lbs, by implementating alternate 1,3-Butadiene supply using rail cars. The addiditonal increase may occur when there is no production of Black Master Batch campaign. The rail car project is intended to augment 1,3-Butadiene raw material supply when there is constraint in the existing pipeline supply. Therefore, the overall annual production of polybutadiene rubber will not change as a result of this project. Also, the rail cars will be unloaded into the existing 1,3-Butadiene storage spheres and each rail car will contain approximatley 150,000 lbs of 1,3-Butadiene. Therefore, the project will not increase the tank farm storage facility, and will not change the existing release scenarios documented in the site RMP.\n\n   \n\n   The Lanxess Orange, Texas facility produces three basic types of polymerized synthetic rubber with several grades and variations of each type.  The four operating units in the plant produce two different types of polybutadiene rubber, ethylene propylene rubber and hydrogenated nitrile butadiene rubber. The rubber produced is fabricated by customers into consumer products such as tires, hoses, roofing membranes, timing belts and sever"

The Utilities area of the plant supplies water, steam, electricity, compressed air, cooling water, potable water, process water and refrigeration for the polybutadiene production units.\n\n\n\n  Hydrocarbons are used as monomers and solvents in the units.  LANXESS Orange Plant inventories the following regulated substances above threshold quantity; butadiene, 1-butene, propylene, butane, ethylene, chlorine and anhydrous ammonia. \n\n \n\n  The LANXESS Orange, Texas site supports many outreach programs for the community including Xperimenting with Science, the United Way, a Community Relations Committee, and an employee sponsored diversity program (MOSAIC). The facility maintains a RC/ISO 14001 standard.\n\n   \n\n   Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:  \n\nThe LANXESS Orange Plant practices Process Safety and Risk Management as delineated in the \"LANXESS Process Safety Management\" manual.  All elements are in place.\n\n   \n\n   Accidental Release Prevention Program: \n\nProcess Safety Management is practiced by the Orange Plant, and the site is in compliance with the OSHA PSM Regulation 29 CFR 1910.119 and EPA 40 CFR Part 68 Risk Management regulations.  All units handling hazardous material undergo a rigorous process hazard review.  During the hazard review, the release of one pound or more of hydrocarbon was a stated consequence of interest.  Managing change across the plant has improved with updated procedures, incident and near hit reporting, preventive and corrective actions, and tracking of action items to closure.   \n\n\n\n   5 Year Accident History: \n\nThere have been no incidents at the Orange Plant with an off-site consequence. There has been one incident from an RMP covered process in which one employee was injured. \n\n\n\n   Emergency Response Program: \n\nLANXESS Orange Plant participates in the Orange County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and Regional Mutual Aid Committees.

An emergency brigade and a hazardous material response team are maintained on site.  Disaster drills are conducted on site at least once a year and the site participates in local area drills.  There are warning lights and signs on the roads to the plant to warn motorists in the event of a plant emergency.  The signs are activated by the local Police Department and maintained by the LEPC. \n\n\n\n   Planned Changes for Improvement: \n\nIn December 2010, the Polybutadiene rubber manufacturing unit, will add rail cars to supply 1,3-Butadiene raw material. The addition of rail cars for 1,3-Butadiene supply will increase 1,3-Butadiene quantity on site from 2,225,000 to 4,750,000 lbs.  However, the annual production of polybutadiene rubber will not change as a result of this project.  The rail cars will be unloaded into the existing 1,3-Butadiene storage spheres and each rail car contains approximately 150,000 lbs of 1,3-Butadiene. Therefore, the project will not increase the tank farm storage facility and will not change the existing release scenarios documented in the site RMP. Other planned changes include recomissioning of the styrene polybutadiene rubber manufacturing line and associated styrene storage equipment, and debottlenecking of Neodymium polybutadiene rubber manufacturing.\n\n\n\nMaintenance and improvement of Health, Safety and Environmental systems are ongoing at this facility and training takes place throughout the year.  Safety and environmental recommendations from employees, whether made during formal sessions like process hazard analyses (PHA) or upon observation of a potential hazard, are considered carefully for implementation.  Significant safety improvements occurring over the last five years include a new Health, Safety and Environmental Management System, major upgrades in fire protection deluge systems, updated emergency response training including chlorine le"

Significant environmental improvements include, process changes that resulted in the elimination of sulphur monochloride from the site, a reduction of scrap rubber (50% reduction of landfill wastes) and a process change eliminating drummed hazardous waste stream in one of the process units and conversion of hazardous waste into sellable products. Planned changes include significant improvements to the site  waste water system and reduction of hazardous waste in the PBR operating units.\n\n\n\n"
