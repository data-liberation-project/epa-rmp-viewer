      "SummaryText": "Kentucky-American Water Company operates two water treatment plants in Fayette County, Kentucky. The water treatment plant at the Kentucky River Station uses chlorine and ammonia along with some other less hazardous chemicals to disinfect and to produce 45 million gallons of water per day. The maximum quantity of chlorine that is stored at the Kentucky River Station is 28,000 pounds, with an average quantity of 20,000.  We have the ability to store a maximum quantity 55,000 pounds of ammonia, with an average quantity of 23,000. The distance to endpoint before the chemicals would be dispersed would be three miles for chlorine and four miles for ammonia.   It is the intent of Kentucky-American Water Company (KAWC) to protect its associates as well as the communities it serves from the dangers that are associated with hazardous chemicals.  In order to achieve this goal at KAWC, specific controls, policies and procedures are in place to prevent and/or to minimize the risk to the community.  The Company communicates its goals and provides the local emergency planning committee and the fire department with information pertaining to the chemicals that it uses.  Fire department personnel and employees from the City of Lexington, Division of Environmental and Emergency Management periodically visit the treatment plants to become familiar with the processes and the chemicals used, in order to respond to chemical emergencies.  During 2000 the Water Company completed the installation of a chlorine scrubber at the Kentucky River Station plant.

This program and the corresponding Process Safety Management Program (PSM), which has been in effect at KAWC since May 1993, are intended to prevent and minimize the impact of the accidental release of chlorine and ammonia.  KAWC developed the PSM and this RMP to include full associate particiation in this program.

The following positions were instrumental in the implementation of both the PSM and the RMP: Director Loss Control, Director Water Quality, Kentucky River Station Water Quality Specialist and Operations Supervisor, Richmond Road Station WaterQuality Specialist and Operations Supervisor and union operating/maintenance personnel.  Written standard operating procedures have been developed for all treatment chemicals utilized by Kentucky-American Water Company.
