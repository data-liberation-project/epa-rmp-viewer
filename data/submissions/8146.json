Cincinnati, Ohio facility management to implement the requirements of the Risk Management Program (RMP) herein in accordance with the USEPA regulations under 40 CFR Part 68 and with the corresponding regulations under OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) program.  The objective is to minimize the potential of a release of a hazardous material, and if a release occurs, to minimize the impact to Morton employees, the community and the environment.  This objective is met by continuing to utilize general good operating procedures, providing appropriate training to all employees, and communicating and coordinating response activities with the local emergency response providers.\n\nMorton has taken a number of steps to minimize the quantity of hazardous compounds that are stored on-site.  For example, the facility has reduced the inventory of propane to a level that is below the RMP threshold.  The RMP regulated materials have been handled safely for over twenty years at this site.\n\nFacility Description\n\nMorton International's Cincinnati, Ohio, facility operates primarily as a manufacturer of specialty chemicals.  Four chemicals - ammonia (in aqueous solution), chlorine, ethylenediamine and methyl chloride - are utilized at the facility in sufficient quantities to be subject to the RMP requirements in detailed at 40 CFR Part 68.  All chemicals used at the facility, including those regulated by the RMP, are handled and stored using best management practices.\n\nConsequence Analysis\n\nThe Accidental Release Prevention Program requires facilities to evaluate the impact of a release of the regulated chemicals under well-defined conditions.  Two types of releases must be considered: a \"worst case scenario\" must be examined as well as an \"alternative case scenario\".\n\nBy EPA regulations the \"worst case scenario\" is defined as the catastrophic rupture of the vessel (or pipe) th"

In addition, the \"worst case scenario\" requires us to assume all process controls, safety devices, monitoring and detection systems fail to operate as designed.  Further, worst case scenarios do not consider possible causes or likelihood of the event.\n\nThe EPA also defines the conditions under which the evaporated material dissipates including conservative assumptions regarding the temperature, wind speed and the tendency for \"mixing\" to occur in the atmosphere.  These EPA assumptions are such that the predicted concentration of the chemical represents an over-estimate of what would actually occur.\n\nBy EPA regulations the \"alternative release scenario\" is an emergency planning release scenario that must lead to an off-site impact based on a facility's use of the regulated chemical.  The emergency planning scenario takes into account the facility's safety systems and response plans to minimize the release.\n\nThe alternative release scenarios provided within this RMP have been developed by considering the following: previous incidents at the facility (e.g., hose leaks, seal failures, safety valve releases) that have involved chemicals, items that have been identified through the HAZOP process and those associated with the chemical industry in general.  The RMP regulations provide for the use of assumptions influencing dispersion that are more likely to occur during an alternative release scenario.\n\nThe worst case consequences analysis indicated that using the EPA guidelines there could be off-site impact in the event of an incident.  For example, a catastrophic release of chlorine from the rail car (defined by the RMP regulations as the worst case) would impact the surrounding community.  The alternative release scenarios that were developed for each chemical indicated that the impact zone would be significantly reduced by compari"

In fact, the reduced impact areas of the alternative scenarios compared to the worst case scenario is one measure of the effectiveness of Morton's prevention and safety programs.\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nMorton has not had any release of ammonia solution, chlorine, ethylenediamine, or methyl chloride from the Cincinnati, Ohio facility that has caused serious injury, significant property damage, affects to the community or the environment.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nMorton's Cincinnati, Ohio facility is staffed with employees trained in emergency response 24 hours per day.  These employees receive annual training on emergency procedures and response techniques.\n\nThe local emergency responders in the community utilize lap-top computers containing CAMEO and ALOHA for determining the likely extent of impact from a release. Hence, the facility chose to use these programs, in conjunction with guidance developed by the U.S. EPA, to determine the extent of the area predicted to be impacted under the various scenarios described above.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nMorton completes a thorough review of the potential impact of all chemicals considered for use at the facility prior to their use.  This includes compounds that are not specifically addressed under the RMP regulation.  Morton has reviewed the chemicals currently used on site as part of the compliance program involving the Clean Water Act, the Clean Air Act, RCRA, Spill Prevention and Contingency Planning and Accidental Release prevention. Further, Morton conducts Process Safety Management reviews at least every three years to ensure that each process that employs hazardous chemicals is thoroughly examined.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe Cincinnati facility "
