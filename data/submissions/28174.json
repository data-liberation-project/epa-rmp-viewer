The management and employees of this facility are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases.  Accidental release prevention is critical to the safe operation of this terminal, the safety of its employees and the community.\n\nTo achieve its accident and accidental release prevention goals, KNC is committed to the following:\n\n?    A knowledgeable, motivated and highly trained employee group\n?    A well-designed facility that is maintained and operated in a superior manner\n?    Implementation of a comprehensive Process Safety Management (PSM) and Prevention Program\n?    Continual review and improvements that enhance safety and accident prevention\n?    Excellence in safety programs and practices, and a superior safety and accident record\n?    Planning, preparation and training for emergency response\n\nThe Murdock Terminal has had a written Emergency Response Plan, as required by the RMP and other EPA and Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) rules, in effect for many years, and is committed to implement the plan in response to any accidental release to minimize the impact to employees, the community and the environment.  The response plan is coordinated with the LEPC and emergency response agencies.  Terminal personnel have interacted with these agencies for many years regarding the plan and activities at the terminal.\n\nEmployees are trained in the implementation of the plan and appropriate response activities that could be required in the event of an emergency.\n\nPrevention Program\n\nThe Murdock Terminal is subject to the OSHA PSM Rule, 29 CFR 1910.119.

The impact of these potential releases must be quantified in accordance with release criteria dictated in the rule.  The projected impact distance is determined using EPA-defined atmospheric conditions and is intended to provide a conservative estimate of the maximum possible area that might be affected.  According to the EPA, the ?worst-case? scenario is intended to ensure that no potential risks to public health are overlooked, but the distance to an endpoint estimated under ?worst-case? should not be considered a ?public danger zone.? Possible causes or the extreme improbability that such releases may occur are not considered.\n\nThe alternative release scenario definition is a release that is more likely to occur than the ?worst-case? release; however, as with the ?worst-case?, the alternative release improbability is not taken into consideration.\n\nWorst-Case Toxic Release - Ammonia\n\nAmmonia is a colorless gas with a strong pungent odor, and is one of the most widely used industrial chemicals.  It is prepared industrially from natural gas, steam and air"

      "SummaryText": ".  Some of this ammonia is used for direct injection into croplands as a fertilizer.  A large amount of industrial ammonia is reacted with carbon dioxide to make urea fertilizer, or reacted to make ammonium nitrate fertilizer.  Ammonia is also frequently used as a refrigerant for the storage of perishable foods.\n\nAmmonia vapors can be irritating to the nose, throat, eyes and skin.  Direct liquid contact to the skin can cause severe burns.\n\nKNC has considered potential ?worst-case? releases from the refrigerated atmospheric storage tank, which is passively mitigated by a secondary containment dike and the bullet tank, the two largest vessels onsite.\n\nKNC?s hypothetical ?worst-case? scenario involves an anhydrous ammonia release from the terminal?s 90,000-gallon bullet, administratively controlled to 85% of its volume.  The ?worst-case? release assumes, as required by the rule, that this entire quantity is released as a result of a catastrophic failure of the tank, in 10 minutes.  This unlikely event was modeled with a publicly available model (DEGADIS), which has been demonstrated to provide reasonable estimates of concentrations and distances associated with this type of release event.  The impact of this release scenario is predicted to extend beyond the facility boundary and impact public receptors.\n\nThis scenario, we believe, is a hypothetical ?worst-case? event dictated by the rule and extremely unlikely to occur for many reasons.  In addition to the stringent design controls for this type of pressurized vessel, facility maintenance and inspection programs address the integrity of process and storage vessels, including this one, and largely preclude such massive and unlikely failures.\n\n\nAlternative Toxic Release - Ammonia\n\nMore likely release events than the hypothetical ?worst-case? tend to concentrate in areas where the ammonia product is handled such as loading and other transport activities.  Generally, significantly lower quantities are involved due to nume"

Operator intervention tends to mitigate and limit the consequences of failures.\n\nThe hypothetical ammonia alternative release scenario considered for this process is a release of ammonia due to the failure of a rail unloading hose.  The hose is assumed to fail and release ammonia for .089 minutes before an excess flow valve stops the release.  The impact of such a release was modeled with the DEGADIS model,which shows that, under typical ambient conditions, the impact of the release would extend off-site.\n\nPlanned Changes for Safety Improvements\n\nSafety improvements are a continual and ongoing process at the facility, which is facilitated by the Prevention Program/Process Safety Management Program.  Formal process hazard analysis is conducted at least every five years, but review is constant through management of change procedures, operator training, incident investigation and mechanical integrity programs.  As a result, changes relevant to safety occur continuously as needs are identified through these procedures and policies."
