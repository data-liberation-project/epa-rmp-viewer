Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies:\nRed Cedar Gathering Company's Arkansas Loop treating plant removes water and carbon dioxide from coal bed methane gas.  RCGC AL has implemented the elements of a Program 1 Risk Management Plan (RMP) and all the elements of OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) program.\nRed Cedar AL Emergency Response Plan is site-specific. It includes required actions by plant employees as well as required notification and coordination with local responders and agencies. All employees are trained in the execution of the Emergency Response Plan and drills are conducted annually.\n\n2. The regulated substance handled by this facility is methane.  The purpose of this treating facility is to remove impurities from the methane gas (water and carbon dioxide) and compress the gas into transportation pipelines.  Methane gas is not stored at this facility.\n\n3. The general accidental release prevention program and specific steps.\nThe RCGC AL has implemented all the elements of a Program 1 Risk Management Plan (RMP) and all the elements of OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) program. Key element of these programs include:\n\nProcess Safety Information: Technical information and documents are used to help maintain safe operation of the process, make decisions and perform process hazard analysis.  \n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA): A systematic examination of the plant to identify possible hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.  \n\nOperating Procedures: RCGC AL maintains written procedures that address all modes of operation, including a) initial start-up, b) normal operations, c) temporary operations, d) emergency shutdown, e) emergency operations, f) normal shutdown, and g) start-up after turnaround.  \n\nContractors: RCGC AL uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.

The training programs include classroom, OJT, demonstration and computer-based training. Employees are tested to demonstrate competency.\n\nManagement of Change: The RCGC AL uses MOC to manage changes by performing reviews to ensure that adequate controls are in place for any new processes or changes to processes.  \n\nIncident Investigation:  The RCGC AL has developed an incident investigation program to determine the causes an incident or near miss and to take actions to prevent recurrence.\n\nCompliance Audits: Audits are conducted in accordance with the requirements of PSM and RMP re"

Five-year accident history:\nNo release of a regulated substance as defined in the EPA Risk Management Plan (RMP) regulation has occurred in the past 5 years. \n\n5. Emergency Response:\nThe facility's emergency response is based on OSHA's 1910.38 (Employee emergency plans and fire prevention).  Employees have been instructed / trained to activate the Emergency Shut Down System and evacuate the facility in an emergency.  The Los Pinos fire district personnel will not enter this facility in a fire or explosion emergency but may be summoned to control the public and any grass or shrub fires on surrounding property.  Fire district personnel will assist in caring for any resulting injuries.  \n\n6.  Planned changes to improve safety:\nThis facility was constructed in 1989 and has had no major safety up-grades.  Being an OSHA 1910.119 Process Safety Management facility constantly places all elements of the process under scrutiny.  Safety issues are continuously addressed."
