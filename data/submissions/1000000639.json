It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal, State and local regulations. If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to immediately vacate the premises, move to a safe location, notify the Glidden Volunteer Fire Dept (via 911 call) and request that it respond to the emergency. Incidental to the notification to the fire department, a call to the Region 5 LEPC will be made. \n\nWhile we have planned for an emergency, it is acknowledged that a real emergency will be unexcepted and may very well be different and cannont be ensured to duplicate what we may have planned. In reality, the situation that develops may not happen in the manner in which it has been planned. In that event, what we may have planned will serve only as a guideline to follow.  \n\nThe Emergency Action Plan for this facility describes certain procedures that are intended to minimize the hazards associated with human health and the environment from fires, explosions, the sudden and unexpected release of chemicals, (i.e. Anhydrous Ammonia), tornados, bomb threats or other accidents or acts of God which might occur on our premises. \n\nThe primary emergency response coordinator for the Glidden, Iowa location is Darrell Berte, Operations Manager. His work and 24 hour emergency reponse numbers are provided in the Registration Section. The 24 hour emergency response number provided in that section also provides a telephone tree for additional individuals who are available and can respond to an emergency at that location.   \n                                                                                                                                                                     DESCRIPTION OF THE ANHYDROUS STORAGE/DISTRIBUTION PLANT AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCE HANDLED AT THE NEW COOPERATIVE GLID"

      "SummaryText": "DEN FERTILIZER PLANT. \n\nThis facility is a bulk anhydrous ammonia storage and distribution plant. The anhydrous ammonia that is stored at this facility is distributed to agricultural corp producers in the surrounding area who utilize the anhydrous ammonia for crop nutrient purposes. \n\nThe system consists of one (1) storage tank with associated piping, valves, liquid pump(s) and other miscellaneous equipment. The anhydrous ammonia plant is only operated on a seasonal basis (spring and fall). Full-time equivalent employee numbers were computed on that basis. At a maximum, the plant operates a total of three (3) months (1/4 of the year). The FTEs for this company location is one (1). \n\nWORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO: The worst case scenario is the failure of one (1) of the storage tank when filled to the greatest amount allowed (85% capacity), resulting in the release of the total volume in a gasous (hazardous ammonia vapor cloud) form. According to EPA's RMP* Comp Program (Version 1/06). The alternative release scenario involves the transport delivery vehicle pulling away from the intake lines into the storage plant without disconnecting the transfer hose. \n\nSince this facility is located in relatively close proximity to the Town of Glidden, provisions have been designed to notify all affected persons. An evacuation plan is in place. \n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS:  \n\nThis facility complies with the EPA's accident prevention rule and all applicable State and local codes and regulations. The anhydrous ammonia system is designed, installed and maintained in accordance with ANSI Standard k-61.1-1995 and State Law. In addition the company has specific operating procedures in place intended to minimize the potential for an accidental (and potentially catastrophic) release of anhydrous ammonia. Finally, NEW Cooperative has extended to the Lidderdale Fire Dept the opportunity to visit our anhydrous ammonia plant, to partic"

In the unlikely event tha the Woolstock Fire Dept in unable to adequetely respond to an emergency at our Glidden Location, mutal aid (reciprocal agreement between neighboring fire depts) will be summoned. We have discussed this policy with the fire department and Region 5 LEPC. Members of the fire dept and the LEPC have inspected our anhydrous ammonia plant. In additon, copies of photographs taken of our plant have been provided (for reference) to both entities."
