Our goals are to have no accidents, no harm to people, and no damage to the environment.  It is our commitment to provide a working environment that is safe by identifying hazards; designing and constructing our facilities according to recognized standards, procedures, and management systems; operating and maintaining facilities within the current design envelope; carefully selecting and training our workforce; managing changes to the organization, personnel, systems, procedures, and equipment; and maintaining emergency management plans to identify equipment, training, and personnel necessary to protect the workforce, public, and environment in the event of an incident.\n\nDescription of facility/Regulated substances handled\n\nThe BP Amoco Chocolate Bayou Plant manufactures polypropylene plastic and olefins, including ethylene, propylene, and butadiene.  The facility handles no toxic substances over the threshold quantity.  Twenty-seven different flammable substances are held over the threshold quantity.  All are hydrocarbons, ranging from hydrogen to pentane.  These are present in the plant both in pure form and in mixtures.\n\nThe Chocolate Bayou Plant operates 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.  The facility has management representation 24 hours a day through the use of a shift superintendent and several shift foremen.  In section 1.8, we have listed Bobby Monk as the emergency contact.  Mr. Monk is one of four shift superintendents.  The phone number for the emergency contact is the shift superintendent's office number.\n\nRelease scenarios\n\nThe worst-case scenario is the release of a flammable mixture of butane and butadiene from a storage vessel, with an explosion in the resulting vapor cloud.  This release was analyzed using the EPA Off-site Consequence Analysis guidance document.  The area of i"

It is unlikely for such an extreme vessel failure to take place; the plant has a comprehensive inspection and maintenance program to prevent such an incident.  Further, measures are taken to limit the possibility that any release might reach a source of ignition.\n\nA second worst-case scenario involving a release of propylene from a storage vessel is reported because it can impact different off-site receptors.\n\nThe alternative release scenario is the release of ethylene from a hole in a processing line containing liquefied ethylene under pressure.  It is expected that this type of leak may be stopped within ten minutes due to monitoring of operations by detection equipment and our personnel.  This release was analyzed using our own modeling.  Some of the material from this release will disperse away from the release point before ignition can occur.  The area of impact for serious injury (i.e., 1.0 psi overpressure) includes off-site receptors.\n\nPrevention Program\n\nThe most effective part of preventing off-site impacts from hazardous chemicals is to reduce the amount of those chemicals stored at the site, or eliminate them altogether.  The plant has eliminated the use of some regulated toxic materials, including chlorine.\n\nThe facility is subject to the Program 3 prevention requirements of the EPA RMP rule, and to the OSHA PSM rule upon which those requirements were based. The facility reduces the possibility of a fire or explosion through several mechanisms.  Process hazard analyses (PHAs) are done on a routine schedule for the process, and any change to the process undergoes PHA before it is operated.  The plant has an ongoing inspection program according to American Petroleum Institute (API) standards.  Training programs and operating and maintenance procedures are also routinely reviewed.  Operators are trained and certified initially and on a three year interval.  The facility has"

For work that is performed by a contractor, procedures are in place to evaluate the contractor prior to work and to evaluate the contractor\u0012s performance on an on-going basis.  The plant reduces the possibility that a source of ignition might be present by maintaining hot work procedures and through proper classification of electrical equipment.\n\nFive-year accident history\n\nThe plant has had one release in the past five years that resulted in an injury to a contract employee onsite.  This was due to a fire resulting from a release of a covered flammable material.  There are no incidents of off-site impacts from releases at the site.\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nThe Chocolate Bayou plant encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team.  Employees have access to all information created as part of the plant prevention program.  Specific ways that employees can be involved in the prevention program are documented in the employee participation plan that addresses each prevention program element.  In addition the plant has a number of initiatives under way that address process safety and personal safety issues.  These initiatives include forming teams to promote both process and personal safety.  The teams typically have members from various areas of the plant, including operations, maintenance, engineering, and plant management.  \n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nThe Chocolate Bayou plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.

This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known exposure concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  For process areas, the plant has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (i.e. temperature, level, composition).  The plant assures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (i.e., automated shutdown systems).  In addition, information is available summarizing the consequences of deviation from these limits and the corrective actions to take.\n\nThe plant also maintains technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical ratings of equipment, piping and instrument drawings, etc.  This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nThe Chocolate Bayou plant has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.

HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\nThe PHA team\u0012s recommendations are forwarded to management for resolution.  These recommendations are reviewed and all approved recommendations are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each recommendation is documented and retained.   \n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the Chocolate Bayou plant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every five years as long as the process exists.  The recommendations from these updates are also forwarded to management.  Final resolution of the recommendations is tracked, documented, and retained.  \n\nOperating Procedures\n\nThe Chocolate Bayou plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process.  These procedures are developed/revised by experienced operators, supervisors and engineers as needed and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.

This information, along with the written operating procedures, is readily available to the process operators and other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\nThe Chocolate Bayou plant has long-standing safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety.  Examples of these include (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) a lockout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous materials before process piping or equipment is opened, and (4) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space.  These procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely\n\nTraining\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the Chocolate Bayou plant has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  New employees receive basic training in chemical plant operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After the new operator demonstrates (i.e. through tests, skills demonstration, etc.) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.

Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform plant personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.  This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to work starting.  In addition, the Chocolate Bayou plant evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor.  Plant personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\nPre-Startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\n\nThe Chocolate Bayou plant conducts a PSSR for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, equipment, procedures, and personnel are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready.  The PSSR review team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness.  A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nThe Chocolate Bayou plant has well-established practices and procedures to maintain"

The basic aspects of this program include: (1) conducting training, (2) developing written procedures and plans, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting identified deficiencies, and (5) applying quality assurance measures.  In combination these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process equipment.\n\nMaintenance personnel receive training on (1) an overview of the process, (2) safety and health hazards, (3) applicable maintenance procedures, (4) emergency response plans, and (5) applicable safe work practices to help ensure that they can perform their job in a safe manner.  Written procedures help ensure that work is performed in a consistent manner and provide a basis for training.  Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended, and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (i.e. adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels).  If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service (if possible), or an MOC team will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment.\n\nAnother integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance.  The Chocolate Bayou plant incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs.  This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made. \n\n\nHot Work Permit\n\nThe Chocolate Bayou plant has a hot work permit program which details those area which require a permit and those areas for which a permit is not required.

This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented.  Changes are reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.  Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures, are updated to incorporate these changes.  In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on the change.  The system ensures that all documentation is updated and training completed prior to the commissioning of the change.\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nThe Chocolate Bayou plant promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in a fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury.   The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts, identify the root cause and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.
