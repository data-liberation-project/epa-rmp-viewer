In addition to identifying the applicable corporate policies and risk management systems, this RMP identifies a set of worst case and alternative release scenarios, the potential off-site consequences of those releases, and the facility's five-year accidental release history.  (This facility has had no accidental release events that would require reporting under these new federal rules).  This RMP also certifies that prevention and emergency response programs are in place so as to minimize risks to both workers and the potentially affected public.\n\nAccident Release Prevention Program and Emergency Response Policy\n\nIt is the policy of Colorite Polymers management to implement the requirements of this Risk Management Program (RMP) in accordance with the USEPA regulations under 40 CFR Part 68.  The objective is to minimize the risk of a release of a hazardous material; but if a release occurs, to minimize the potential impact to facility employees, the public and the environment.\n\nThis objective is being accomplished by utilizing good operating practices and procedures, providing appropriate training to all employees, and coordinating response activities, as necessary, with the local emergency response providers.

Further, the Colorite Burlington Facility recognizes that it has a duty to protect its employees and neighbors from the effects of all dangerous chemicals.  \n\nColorite Polymers has developed a management system to implement and maintain compliance with the ARP Program, which is coordinated with its already-established OSHA Process Safety Management and plant emergency response programs.  At the Colorite's Burlington Facility, the Plant General Manager has primary responsibility for ensuring overall implementation and compliance with these programs. Other individual employees such as the Technical Director, Safety and Training Manager are responsible for the technical implementation of individual sections of these programs.\n\nFacility Description\n\n\nThe Burlington South Plant is a polyvinyl chloride (PVC) manufacturing facility in the Specialty Vinyls Resin Division of Techni-Plex.  The facility began operation in 1962 as Cary Chemical.  Tenneco acquired it in 1966 and by OxyChem in 1986.  In 1995 Colorite Polymers (Pure Tec Inc., parent company), bought the facility.  In 1998 Tekni-Plex took ownership through a merger.\n\nThe plant is located at 35 Beverly Road in the township and county of Burlington.  Of the total plant property of 139 acres, approximately 40 acres are used for industrial activities and are fenced.  The Delaware River is north of the facility.  Public Service Electric property is north and east of the facility.  Residential area is to the east, south and west, with the closest residents about 500 feet north and 1,000 feet south.  The distance to the closest industrial neighbor property is approximately 400 feet to the west of the main VAM storage tank.\n\nThere are 125 site personnel at Colorite.  Production operations are conducted on a seven-day week, 24-hour day basis. Plant security is provided by a 24-hour contract guard service.   The site has supporting offices, laboratory, m"

They both rely on the same permanent connections to the storage facilities that contain the raw materials for both of the processes.  Therefore for the purposes of the RMP program, Colorite considers this storage area and each of the main manufacturing systems as subparts of the same overall PVC manufacturing process.  Operations subject to the EPA RMP Rule include the storage of raw materials, weighing tanks, process reactors, batch mixing tanks, VCM stripping and recovery from PVC.\nManufacturing PVC involves both the dispersion process (rated capacity 50 mm #/yr.) and the suspension process (rated capacity 70 mm #/yr.).  The dispersion process uses licensed Wacker technology in fourteen 3,000 to 3,800 gallon column reactors.  The suspension process uses eight 5,000-gallon tank reactors.  The primary raw material, vinyl chloride monomer (VCM), is received in railcars and stored in four 80,000-gallon 'bullet' tanks.  The co-polymerizing material is exclusively vinyl acetate monomer (VAM), which is received by truck and stored in one 30,000-gallon vertical fixed-roof tank.  Both raw materials contain traces of inhibitor to prevent premature polymerization.  Product resin is shipped by bulk in railcars and trucks and in bags.\nProgram Level Identification\n\n\nThe EPA Risk Management Regulation identifies three levels of requirements defined as \"programs\".  EPA recognizes that some regulated processes would not pose an off-site hazard in the event of an accidental release.  Such processes are classified as Program 1.  Program 1 is applicable to any process for which it can be demonstrated that the public would not be adversely affected by a release. Thus, to qualify for Program 1, a facility with a regulated toxic chemical needs to meet two criteria.  \n7 no release over the most recent 5-year period has resulted in off-site injury or environmental damage; and \n7 Disp"

However, modeling calculations of the possible consequences of the \"worst-case release\", as defined by the regulation, predict the possibility of thermal effects of VCM or airborne concentrations of VAM at public receptors that could exceed the toxic endpoint identified in the rule. Therefore, neither of these two materials is eligible for Program 1.\n\nProgram 2 and 3 are applicable to processes that do not qualify for Program 1. Program 2 applies to any process that is ineligible for Program 1 and is not subject to Program 3. Program 3 applies to all processes, such as those for VCM at Colorite, that are subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management Standard (PSM). Much of the basic foundation of the Colorite Accident Prevention Program is adopted directly from the compliance program for the PSM standard for VCM.  These OSHA requirements are directly consistent with the Program Level 3 RMP Program requirements under 40 CFR Part 68. For VCM, therefore, Program 3-related information is included in the Data Elements section of this Risk Management Plan.\n\nVAM is not directly subject to the OSHA PSM Rule, and therefore was not previously the specific subject of the existing Colorite Accident Release Prevention program.  This material is, however, utilized in many of the same processes and most of the same equipment systems as VCM, because Colorite also makes a number of copolymer products which require a blend of both of these basic chemicals in the formulation.

For the purposes of developing and maintaining adequate Risk Management Plans, the EPA has defined in its governing rules and guidance a series of modeling methods and assumptions, which are to be used as administrative guides for planning purposes.  In order to standardize and simplify the many factors that can potentially occur in an accidental release situation, some of these assumptions may not take into account the available preventive measures or mitigation methods that could diminish or even eliminate the implied risks that are suggested by \"worst-case\" analyses. For that reason, both the results for the standardized \"worse-cases\" defined by the EPA methods and a set of alternative cases.  The latter set of alternative cases are believed by the technical staff and management of the Colorite Burlington Plant to more realistically represent situations that may possibly, but rarely, occur within the lifetime of their facility. \n\nEPA has defined a worst-case release as the instantaneous release of the entire contents of the largest vessel or connected piping that contains a regulated substance. For either flammable liquids or vapors, such as VCM, or potentially toxic gases or vapors, such as VAM stored at ambient temperatures, it is assumed that the release occurs over a 10-minute period.\n\nThe release event is then evaluated using modeling techniques and/or reference tables to define the distance to a specified endpoint (concentration of toxic vapors, or overpressure or thermal load due to rapid combustion).  The distance to the endpoint is affected by several factors including molecular weight, volatility, heat of combustion, and physical setting (ur"

The ERPG-2 is defined as:\n\n\"The maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to 1 hr without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects or symptoms which could impair an individual's ability to take protective action.\"\n\nGiven that the worst-case is a 10-minute release duration with a 10-minute concentration averaging time, the actual hazard zone is typically overestimated by selecting the ERPG-2 value as the criterion because it id defined as applicable to a one-hour period of exposure. Within such a time period there are a number of emergency measures that can reduce or eliminate exposures to levels this high for an interval much shorter than an hour.\n\nFor flammables, like VCM, the endpoint is based upon the EPA-required assumption that a vapor cloud forms instantly from the released liquid and burns with explosive force producing a shock wave.  The endpoint of interest is the distance at which the overpressure produced is equal to 1psi above ambient pressure, or the thermal effects of an associated fire producing a thermal load at a nearby receptor of 5 kw/m2.  The first of these effects would be sufficient to produce structural damage that could lead to injuries or fatalities; the second could produce significant burns.\n\n\tWorst-Case Releases\n\nThe SLAB (Dense Gas Dispersion) model was used to simulate the worst-case release scenario. The SLAB model is a publicly available model that simulates contaminant movement for heavier-than-air gases such as concentrated VCM vapor or VAM vapor for either instantaneous or continuous near-ground-level releases. \n\nFor VAM, which is subject to the RMP rule"

In this case, due to its higher boiling point temperature, the EPA specifications for the \"worst case\" analysis method allows appropriate corrections to be made for the beneficial effects of the dike surrounding the storage tanking.  The EPA's version of the SLAB dispersion model was utilized to evaluate the potential consequence area for this worst case scenario.  SLAB is a publicly available model which readily simulates the initial heavier-than-air vapor formed by the evaporation of VAM from the diked pool.\n\nIn the immediate vicinity of the Colorite Storage tanks and the polymer manufacturing buildings, the aerodynamic surface roughness is close to 'urban' in nature, due to the many large buildings, tanks and other structures at the site.  At greater distances, the surface roughness is a mixture of both urban and rural characteristics.  Therefore, for the required worst-case scenario analysis by the SLAB model, a 40-cm surface roughness parameter value was utilized.  The modeling results demonstrate that the presence of the dike around the storage tank limits the distance to the endpoint concentration, 75ppm (260 mg/m3), to a maximum of 0.37 mi.  \n\nThe overall worst-case scenario for the Colorite Burlington Plant involves VCM, which is included in the RMP program as a Program 3 regulated substance due to its high flammability characteristics.  The EPA-specified \"worst case\" consists of a 10-minute gaseous ground-level release of 80,000 gal of stored VCM, without regard for any benefits of storage container diking.  For flammable materials that are gases at normal temperatures and pressures, the EPA \"worst case\" does not assume any credit for the presence of the dike.

Even if the storage tank were to breach, some liquid VCM would spill to the ground in a boiling pool.  Furthermore, if a hole were to form in the vapor space of the storage tank, the flashing vapor in the tank would cause the tank to auto-refrigerate.  This would gradually reduce the release rate with time).  The selection of the worst-case release for VCM should, therefore, be viewed as a regulatory necessity, rather than a realistic representation of a worst-case release event.\n\nFor this EPA-defined \"worst case\" release, consequence modeling was performed with the AIRTOX Flammable Jet Model.  The AIRTOX models are a proprietary set of hazards assessment models developed by ENSR and officially recognized as appropriate for RMP use in the U.S. EPA's Offsite Consequence Assessment Guidance (OCAG), as well as in listings for similar applications in the states of New Jersey, California, and Texas.   Modeling results indicate that the maximum distance to the EPA-specified endpoint for a vapor cloud explosion, which could occur from such a release scenario, is approximately 0.51 miles.\n\n\tAlternate Releases\n\nAlternative releases are intended to represent release scenarios that have a greater likelihood of occurrence than a worst-case release.  Alternative releases do not necessarily represent the types of releases that the PSM hazards analysis and/or accident history indicate would be most frequent, but rather a release that is somewhat more likely than the worst-case release and that generally still has the potential to affect off-site receptors.

In order to determine the most conservative off-site consequence estimates, the Colorite Plant has chosen to include in the Risk Management Plan the alternative release scenarios that resulted in the greatest toxic endpoint distance.\n\nIn accordance with the RMP rule, alternative releases are modeled under typical (rather than worst-case) dispersion conditions.  The EPA OCAG default dispersion conditions are neutral atmosphere, with dispersion neither enhanced nor limited (D stability and 3 m/sec wind speed).  Unlike the worst-case release (for which an instantaneous spill or 10-minute ground-level gas release is assumed), alternative scenarios can account for the actual release configuration, and account for both active and passive mitigation.\n\nFor the VAM alternative case, review of the PHA results led to the selection of a leak of 420 lb/min from a one-inch drain valve into an area with no diking.  Although preventive maintenance and routine inspection procedures make it unlikely that this event will ever occur, it is possible.  It is assumed that it takes at least ten minutes to discover and stop this leak condition.  In that time the liquid is assumed to spread out into a 1-cm deep pool and rapidly evaporate. \n\nThis spill of VAM is assumed to be onto an undiked area, somewhat separated from the storage tanks, it was conservatively assumed that the initial roughness would be nearly equivalent to \"rural\".

If the incident continued for more than ten minutes there would be little effect on the distance predicted for potential exposures to the EPA-specified toxic endpoint concentration, due to the short time of transport to that distance compared with the spill duration assumed.  In this alternative case scenario, the vapors are predicted to reach the endpoint concentration of 75 ppm for VAM at a distance of 0.26 mi.   This distance does extend beyond the Colorite property boundary.  The closest neighbor to the Colorite facility is, however, another industrial facility and both a warning system at that facility and an additional public notification plan for neighbors has been established\n\nAlthough the hypothetical worst case scenario for VCM had the largest potential area for affecting the plant's neighbors, a careful review of realistic alternative cases could only identify one other scenario which might produce any of the specified effects beyond the plant boundary.  That alternative release scenario for VCM was a separation in the 3-inch diameter portion of the line transferring VCM from one of the rail cars to the main storage tank, above an undiked area.  It is conservatively assumed that the greatest release rate would be determined by the vapor pressure of a nearly full system, although this is about 50% greater that the normal average rate of transfer in this line.  Normally it takes about 5 hours to transfer some 22,000 gal of VCM out of each rail car.\n\nNormally Colorite Plant staff would be able to respond to such an event and stop the flow prior to emptying the tank, because the facility maintains an external sensor and alarm system that would alert facility personnel to the tank leak.

The thermal endpoint of interest, 5 kw/m2 would occur at a greater distance than the EPA-specified benchmark of 1 psi overpressure for the associated shock wave.   However, the maximum distance to the thermal effect endpoint from this unlikely, but possible, event is only about 230 ft. from the initiating event.  Depending on the exact source location, this maximum distance for any significant effect would likely be limited to onsite areas.\n\nIf the source event were located at the end of the plant property closest to the western boundary, it is possible that this effect distance would extend onto the neighboring industrial property.
