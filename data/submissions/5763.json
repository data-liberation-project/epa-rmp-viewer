In this capacity, Coyne is a re-seller and packager of chemicals to industrial, commercial, and municipal customers.  Of the current inventory of 200 types of chemicals, 2 of these are subject to RMP regulations. The facility is located on 8.393 acres within the Edgely Industrial Park bordered by a rail siding to the north, a marsh on the east, a marsh and then State Road to the south, and Gilbreth International on the west.\n\nProducts Covered by RMP are\n\nChlorine  CAS # 7782-50-5\nSulfur Dioxide  CAS # 7446-09-5\n\nBoth of these items are delivered to Coyne in 100 # and 150 # Cylinders, the are stored inside the warehouse in racks with 16 cylinders per rack. We have had a no off site releases of these items in the past 5 years.  The worst case scenario for Chlorine is a release of the entire contents of one 150# cylinder in 10 minutes from a broken valve. This scenario has an end point of 3 tenths of a mile. Do to the fact that these items are stored and transported in racks the worst case scenario is not likely to occur.  The alternative scenario for both items is a small leak from a valve or packing nut releasing 150 # over the period of one hour with an endpoint of 1 tenth of a mile. Mitigation for ether of these events includes applying a cylinder \"A\" kit or placing the leaking cylinder into a containment vessel. \n\nCoyne Chemical has an in-house Emergency Response Team trained to handle this type of emergency. \nIn addition when the facility is closed a Manager is on call and can be reached through our emergency voice mail system.\n\nCoyne Chemical is a member of the National Association of Chemical Distributors (NACD) and subscribes to its Responsible Distribution Process. As part of this process Coyne Chemical has developed polices regarding Risk Management and Emergency Response.\n\n RISK MANAGEMENT POLICY\n\nIt is the policy "

These programs address the primary goal of continual risk reduction by analysis of the hazards of the chemicals distributed, the likelihood of accidents/incidents, and the impact of these releases on the public and the environment. The Company fully supports and encourages employee participation in the safety programs established and requires strict adherence to the guidelines established for the safe operation of its facilities.\nContinuous risk reduction will be encouraged through the following steps:\n\nA. Product review and hazard assessment,\nB. Hazard ranking of the chemicals distributed,\nC. Review with Manufacturer of products supplied,\nD. Incident review and analysis, and\nE. Employee training.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE & PUBLIC PREPAREDNESS POLICY\n\nIt is the policy of the George S. Coyne Chemical Co., Inc. to have programs in place to identify and handle emergency response and public preparedness issues involving products handled at facilities operated by the company, in transit, and during storage and/or use at a customers site. These programs address the following items deemed critical to achieving this goal:\n\nA. Documentation, review, coordination, and tests of emergency response plans.\nB. Procedures for response, reporting, investigation, and preventative measure implementation with respect to incidents, which could have, or did, result in a release, explosion and/or fire.\nC. Procedures for supplying emergency response information regarding chemicals handled to emergency response agencies and, communication with state and local emergency planning and response organizations regarding potential hazards of products handled at facilities.\n\n\nSECURITY\n\nThe outside boundary of Coyne Chemical is protected by a (6) six-foot chain link fence with barbwire at the top.
