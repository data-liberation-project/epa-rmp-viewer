      "SummaryText": "The accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at your facility:  The facility complies with all applicable federal, state, and local laws.  The facility will respond to accidental releases of hazardous materials, but may rely on local response agencies for large emergencies.\n\nA description of the facility and the regulated substances handled:  The Columbus III facility site is a production facility consisting of one 28,000 gallon natural gas liquids tank.  Natural gas liquid is processed on-site and distributed off-site via pipeline.\n\nThe worst case release scenario:  The worst-case scenario is a failure on one 28,000 gallon natural gas liquids storage tank.  According to the Automated Resource for Chemical Hazard Incident Evaluation (ARCHIE) program the distance to endpoint is 2016 feet or 0.38 miles.  The worst-case release could impact sensitive populations located as close as 500 feet from the natural gas liquids storage tank.\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps:  The facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule (40 CFR 68) and applicable state and local codes and regulations.\n\nFive-year accident history:  The facility has not had an accident involving natural gas liquids that caused deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place within the past five years.\n\nThe emergency response program:  In the event of an emergency involving the natural gas liquids system, Columbus III Production L.C. employees will respond.  If the emergency is beyond Columbus III facility's response capabilities, the Memphis Fire Department, St. Clair County Sheriff, and St. Clair County Emergency Management will be notified and requested to respond to the emergency. \n\nPlanned changes to improve safety:  Implementation of hazard review recommendations."
