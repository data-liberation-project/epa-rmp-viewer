These risk evaluations include off-site consequences, possible environment consequence, and public impact. This program has been established to ensure that hazards associated with the RMP regulated process are controlled. Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place. The studies are conducted using a cross functional team of personnel who have operating, maintenance, and engineering experience in the process been evaluated. A Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) study, along with a Layers of Protection (LOPA) study and Checklist, is the methodology used to perform these evaluations. \n\nA HAZOP study of the MAN process unit is completed every five years. \n\nThe HAZOP team's recommendations for improvement are reviewed with management, and recommendations are tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each recommendation is documented, retained, shared and made available to affected employees.  \n\nOperating Procedures \n\nWritten procedures are maintained under the ISO9000 program for the MAN process and address various modes of process operations, including such activities as unit startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown, and startup following a turnaround or after an emergency shutdown. These procedures are used as a reference and refresher by experienced process operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new process operators.

New employees receive basic training in chemical plant operations. After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks and procedures. After the new operator demonstrates (i.e. through tests, skills demonstration, etc.) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently. All operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level. This refresher training is conducted at least every three years. This training is documented, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\nMechanical Integrity \n\nPractices and procedures are under continuous development and improvement to effectively maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition. The basic aspects of this program include (1) conducting training, (2) developing written procedures and plans, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting identified deficiencies, and (5) applying quality assurance measures. The combination of these activities forms a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process equipment. \n\nMaintenance personnel receive training on (1) an overview of the process, (2) safety and health hazards, (3) applicable maintenance procedures, (4) emergency response plans, and (5) applicable safe work practices to ensure that they perform their job in a safe"

Inspections and tests are performed on process equipment to ensure that equipment functions as intended, and to verify that equipment complies with design standards and specifications.\n\nAnother integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance. The facility incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs. This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made. \n\nManagement of Change \n\nThe Site management of change (MOC) program ensures proper reviews are conducted, hazards are assessed, and a safe operation environment is maintained during and after the introduction of a change in the covered processes. Each MOC (permanent or temporary) includes a risk assessment to identify potential hazards of a change such as (1) process equipment, (2) chemicals, (4) technology (including process operating conditions), and other facility changes. The MOC system ensures that all documentation is updated, and training is completed prior to the commissioning of the change. MOC approval and action items are tracked to resolution.  Personnel affected by the change are informed and/or trained as prescribed by the MOC. \n\nPre-Startup Safety Reviews (PSSR)\n\nPSSRs are conducted for any new facilities or modification that requires a change in the process safety information. The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, equipment, procedures, and personnel are properly prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service. This review provides one additional check to make sure that construction is completed in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready.

There are procedures for cleaning and isolating all major pieces of equipment. Safety standards and work procedures are reviewed annually by all personnel who use them.\n\nContractors \n\nThe Site uses contractors to supplement its work force during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities. Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the Site has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inf"

This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, (4) safe work practices prior to start working and (5) stop work authority. The Site evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor. \n\nAlso, all  employees of contractors must complete the Three Rivers Manufacturing Council Safety Course before they are allowed to work at the facility. Contractor employees must recertify in this course annually. The facility evaluates contractor employer safety programs and performance during the selection of the contractor. INEOS personnel periodically conduct contractor performance evaluations to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations. \n\nEmergency Response Program \n\nThe site maintains a written emergency response program, which is in place to protect workers and the public as well as the environment. The program includes procedures for responding to a release of an RMP-regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is released. The procedures address aspects of emergency response, including first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and personnel accountability after an evacuation; notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs; and post-incident cleanup and decontamination requirements. The Facility has procedures in place that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment, as well as instructions that address the use of emergency response equipment.\n\nThe site has an emergency response team composed of trained volunteers (employees) supported by onsite dedicated contract emergency response personnel.   Employees receive training to perform their specific emergency response duties. The emergency res"

      "SummaryText": "ponse program is updated based on modifications made to facility processes or emergency response procedures. \n\nThe overall emergency response program for the Facility is coordinated with the Will County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC). This coordination includes periodic meetings of the committee, which involves local emergency response officials, local government officials, and industry representatives. The Facility has the capability of communicating with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., fire departments, industrial neighbors, and mutual aid with industry) around-the-clock. This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident and facilitating response to an incident. In addition to periodic LEPC meetings, the Facility conducts periodic emergency drills that involve the LEPC and local emergency response organizations. Additionally, the Facility provides occasional refresher training to local emergency responders.\n\nChemical Specific Prevention Steps \n\nProcess hazards are managed to ensure continued safe operation. The PSM Program summarized previously is applied to the MAN production process. Collectively these program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures/human errors. \n\nIn addition to PSM, the facility has instrumentation and equipment to detect, contain, and reduce the consequences of a release at and around the MAN production unit and associated n-Butane sphere, including but not limited to: \n\nRelease Detection \n-\tHydrocarbon detectors with alarms \n-\tProcess instrumentation to detect density, temperature, level, and pressure changes \n\nRelease Containment/Control \n-\tAtmospheric relief devices \n-\tValves to permit isolation of the process \n-\tAutomated shutdown systems \n-\tRedundant equipment and instrumentation (i.e., uninterruptible power supply for the process control system) \n-\tInert gas purge system \n-\tLevel indication on butane sphere \n-\tButane tend"

The resolutions and resulting changes are tracked internally to ensure completion. Capital projects are continually identified and implemented through this risk assessment process.\n\nFive-Year Accident History \n\nThe Facility has an excellent record of accident prevention over the past five years. If an incident were to occur, it would be investigated by a qualified team to determine a root cause and prevent a similar occurrence from happening again. No incidents meeting the 68.42 criteria have occurred in the previous 5 years."
