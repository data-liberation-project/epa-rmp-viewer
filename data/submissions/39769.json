This revised RMP was prepared in accordance with the requirements of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program (RM Program) regulation (Risk Management Programs for Chemical Accidental Release Prevention, 40 CFR Part 68).  The original was prepared with assistance of Primatech Inc.  This revision is being prepared due to the timely revalidation of the ammonia Process Hazard Analysis.\n\nThe information presented in this report reflects the data element requirements of the final EPA RMP submission.  \n\nA. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nGood Humor - Breyers-Breyers recognizes management's responsibility in protecting it's employees, equipment, property, and the environment.  The safety and health of all personnel are very important.  The control of accidents has been and will continue to be a basic responsibility of all personnel in the Hagerstown facility. \n\nTo accomplish the Company's goal in controlling accidental losses, the facility has established a Plant Safety Program and a Plant Safety Team.  The objectives of the Plant Safety Program are to:  achieve maximum efficiency and safety performance, reduce losses associated which damage of property, and the economic burden resulting from injuries and accidents.\n\nOne of the activities associated with the Plant Safety Program has been the development and implementation of accidental release prevention and emergency response programs which are designed to comply with OSHA's Process Safety management (PSM) standard (Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals, 29 CFR 1910.119), and EPA's Risk Management Program (RM program) regulation (Risk Management Programs for Chemical Accidental Release Prevention, 40 CFR Part 68).

      "SummaryText": "implementation of the Risk Management Program.\n\nThe purposes of the accidental release prevention and emergency response programs are to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of toxic substances as well as fires, explosions and other types of catastrophic accidents.  Overall, these programs prevent accidental fatalities, injuries and illnesses and avoid property damage. \n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response programs help prevent accidents because they focus on the rules, procedures, and practices which govern individual processes, activities, or pieces of equipment.  These rules are detailed and improved as necessary.  They are also communicated to and accepted by all employees at the facility.  \n\nB. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nGood Humor-Breyers operates an ice cream production facility in Hagerstown, MD.  The facility operates an ammonia refrigeration system to provide cooling and freezing capabilities.  The amount of anhydrous ammonia (CAS #7662-41-7) contained in the system is in excess of 10,000 pounds.  Since an ammonia release from the system could pose a risk of offsite public impact and the system is regulated under the OSHA PSM standard, the system is subject to the Program 3 requirements of the EPA's RM program.\n\nC. Description of the Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe prevention program consists of the following elements:\n\n\u00b7 Employee Participation:  This program involves the employees in establishing and implementing the program.  Employees are also to be involved when a process hazard analysis is conducted.  The program also ensures that all employees have complete access to the program.\n\u00b7 Process Safety Information:  Written information has been collected which enables the employees to identify and understand the potential hazards in the system.  The written information includes the ammonia MSDS and details of the design of the ammonia refrigeration system.\n\u00b7"

      "SummaryText": "Process Hazard Analysis:  Formal studies using the What-If technique have been conducted to look at the system and identify potential hazards.\n\u00b7 Operating Procedures:  Written, detailed procedures have been developed which describe the steps to be followed to ensure that the ammonia refrigeration system is operated safely.\n\u00b7 Training:  A training program has been developed which ensures that employees are trained on all aspects of the system and on the duties, which they should perform to ensure the safe operation of the ammonia refrigeration system.\n\u00b7 Contractors:  All contractors are screened and evaluated before they perform work on or near the ammonia refrigeration system.  The contractors are also periodically evaluated to ensure that they perform work by following safe work practices.\n\u00b7 Pre-Startup Safety Review:  A pre-startup safety review is completed for all new ammonia projects to verify that all new ammonia projects to verify that all safety programs are in place, training has been performed, and construction has been completed according to design standards before the project is put into use.\n\u00b7 Mechanically Integrity:  This program ensures that the ammonia refrigeration system have been properly installed and is maintained using preventive maintenance procedures to minimize unexpected breakdowns or failures.\n\u00b7 Hot Work Permit:  These procedures ensure that a signed permit is obtained prior to any cutting, welding, or burning.\n\u00b7 Management of Change:  The procedures are designed to ensure that all changes made to the ammonia refrigeration system are properly reviewed.\n\u00b7 Incident Investigation:  The procedures ensure that any incidents (and near misses) are investigated, reviewed, and documented using an investigation team.\n\u00b7 Compliance Audits:  There are procedures to conduct regular audits of the program to ensure that the program is in place and working properly.\n\nD. Five-Year Accident History\n\nTwo ammonia-related incidents were identified for the Hager"

      "SummaryText": "stown facility in the previous five years.  On September 30, 2003, less than one (1) pound of liquid ammonia was released from a pipe joint over an eight (8) minute time period.  Two (2) employees received medical treatment.  This incident did not result in property damage or offsite impacts.  On January 28, 2000, a vapor release occurred from a valve leak.  Less than one five (5) pounds of ammonia vapor was released over a two (2) hour time period.  Two (2) employees received medical treatment.  This incident did not result in property damage or offsite injuries.\n\nE. Description of the Emergency Response Program\n\nAn emergency response program has been implemented at the Hagerstown facility.  This program contains procedures describing how the facility will respond to ammonia spills and other emergencies, including evacuation procedures describing how the facility will respond to ammonia spills and other emergencies, including evacuation procedures.  The program has been coordinated with the Washington County LEPC.  \n\nThe emergency response program consists of the following elements:  \n\n\u00b7 Organization Plan and responsibilities\n\u00b7 Communications Procedures\n\u00b7 Detailed Action Plans \n\u00b7 First Aid Procedures \n\u00b7 Emergency Medical Treatment Procedures \n\u00b7 Evacuation Plans\n\u00b7 Description of Outside Assistance Available \n\u00b7 Site Re-Entry Procedures \n\u00b7 Training Programs and Drills\n\nF. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nTwenty four (24) changes to improve safety were recommended for the equipment and procedures during the ammonia refrigeration system PHA revalidation in Febrary 2004.  The recommended changes will be evaluated and implemented as required."
