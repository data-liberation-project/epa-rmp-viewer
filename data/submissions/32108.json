The Facility Policy:\n\nThe Facility owner, management, and employees of ConAgra International Fertilizer, are \ncommitted to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia.  Local \nresponders are encouraged to visit the Facility to gain first hand knowledge of the site. \nEmployees are required to hold monthly safety meeting and include sections of the \nRisk management in those meetings.  The Facility maintains an internal emergency                                                            contingency plan. If an accidental release should occur,the facility is prepared to work                                                           with local responders, and other authorities to mitigate any release, and to minimize the\nimpact of a release on the population and environment.\n\nII.   Facility Information:\n\nThe primary activity of the Facility is to distribute agricultural fertilizer for the farming \nindustry in the area.  Part of the fertilizer comes in the form of Anhydrous Ammonia, \nhere after referred to as ammonia.  Ammonia is received, store, and used in the \nproduction of non-hazardous liquid fertilizer solutions. Ammonia is an important \nsource of Nitrogen for agricultural crops during the spring and fall of the year.\n \nThe maximum quantity that can be stored at the facility is 131,300 pounds.  The typical \nmethod of receiving ammonia is by truck transport containing 40,000 pounds. Transports \nare unloaded through a permanent piping system constructed and maintained in \naccordance with industry guidelines and ANSI K61.1. The pipe reactor batch process is a large consumer \nof the product but is intermittently operated.  \n\nIII.  Accidental Release Prevention:\n   \nThe Facility takes guidance from material published by the American National Standards           \nInstitute Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia \nK61.1, and Compr"

All employees \ninvolved with the handling and processing are trained and continue to update their \ntraining to be competent in the performance of their duties. The Facility continues to \nreview and look for means to improve operating and best management practices for \nincrease safety.  A Process Safety Management plan is also incorporated into the \nmanagement of this system.\n\n\nIV. The Five Year Accident History:\n       \nThere have been no accidental releases of ammonia related to the operation of this facility \nin  the past five years.  There have been no deaths, injuries, or significant property \ndamage at the Facility. To the best of our knowledge, no off-site deaths, injuries, \nevacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage has occurred \ndue to the operation of this facility.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBibliography / References:\nTechnical Inc. prepared for NIOSH, HAZOP of  Anhydrous Ammonia Use in \nAgricultural 1991.\n\nClements Associates, Inc., Fairfax, VA;  Health Effects for Ammonia, prepared for The \nFertilizer Institute.\n\nU.S. Environmental Protection Agency  Chemical Emergency Preparedness and \nPrevention Advisory \u00bf Ammonia, September 1991 Oswer 91-008.2, Series 8; No.2.\n\nEcology and Environment, Inc.,  Generic Hazard Assessment and Off-site \nConsequences Analysis Kern and Kings Counties' prepared for California Fertilizer \nAssoc.
