This is a structured approach to managing the safety, health, and environmental risks, which are inherent in our business.  While OIMS was not designed to meet a specific regulation, each section of the Process Safety Management (PSM)/Risk Management Program (RMP) standard can be mapped directly to an OIMS system.  The OIMS system is the overall guidance, while specific operating, mechanical, technical and / or SHE procedures support the system by providing more detailed information.\n\n\nTHE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n     BRPP was constructed in 1968 and manufactures low-density polyethylene (LDPE) via a high-pressure process using six production lines (A-F-Lines).  Products produced from the LDPE include plastic films, molding, adhesives, compounding and oil additives.  An additional line (G-Line) was built in 2004 which produces ethylene-propylene rubber.  Ethylene, propylene, and vinyl acetate are received by pipeline while other raw materials are received by truck or railcar.  BRPP has several small storage tanks for raw materials.  All power is generated offsite and supplied through ENTERGY.  Four small package boilers provide for the site steam needs.  Two flares are used to control continuous and intermittent vent streams from the units.  The site utilizes three cooling towers and refrigeration units to supply cooling/chilled water throughout the site.  BRPP's Purge Gas Purification Unit is used to recycle ethylene from offgases of the units.\n\n     BRPP uses seven regulated substances above threshold quantity in six separate processes.  These substances are acetaldehyde, n-butane, 1-butene, ethylene, propane, propylene, and vinyl acet"

Operations Integrity addresses all aspects of operations that can impact safety, security, health and environmental performance (SSH&E).\n-- OIMS 5.1 - Personnel Safety:  This system is in place to ensure that safety is a core value and will be considered in every decision that is made.  No business objective is so important that it will be pursued at the sacrifice of safety.  Each employee has a personal responsibility for our safety and the safety of others. Accidents, injuries, and occupational illnesses are preventable through the application of effective systems, procedures, and practices to ensure the safety of personnel.\n\nPSM/RMP Element - Process Safety Information [29 CFR 1910.119(d), 40 CFR 68.65]\n-- OIMS 2.1 - Risk Analysis, Assessment, and Management:  This system is in place to ensure that risk assessments reduce risks to safety, security, health and the environment and mitigate the consequences of incidents by providing essential information for decision-making.  This process involves hazard identification, assessment of probabilities and consequences, and evaluation of risk prevention and mitigation measures.  The process applies to ongoing operations, projects, and products.\n-- OIMS 3.1 - Facility Design and Construction:  This system ensures that inherent safety and secur"

Operations and maintenance procedures provide guidance for plant personnel for work activities which are complex, critical, or infrequent and thus should be formalized to ensure consistent and effective execution.\n\nPSM/RMP Element - Process Hazard Analysis [29 CFR 1910.119(e), 40 CFR 68.67]\n-- OIMS 2.1 - Risk Analysis, Assessment, and Management:  This system is in place to ensure that risk assessments reduce risks to safety, security, health and the environment and mitigate the consequences of incidents by providing essential information for decision-making.  This process involves hazard identification, assessment of probabilities and consequences, and evaluation of risk prevention and mitigation measures.  The process applies to ongoing operations, projects, and products.\n\nPSM/RMP Element - Operating Procedures [29 CFR 1910.119(f), 40 CFR 68.69]\n-- OIMS 6.1 - Operating and Maintenance Procedures:  This system ensures that operation of our facilities within established operating and regulatory parameters.

Critical equipment also includes devices which protect against breaches of security access that have the potential for serious consequences.  This system is intended to help ensure this equipment operates when called upon.\n-- OIMS 6.4 - Mechanical Integrity:  The mechanical integrity system protects the safety and health of personnel, the environment, equipment, and satisfies applicable laws, regulations, and approved standards.  It addresses the mechanical integrity of all equipment that can impact SSH&E with a focus on prevention of loss of containment.  It applies to existing facilities, new construction, modifications to existing facilities, and replacements-in-kind.\n\nPSM/RMP Element - Hot Work Permits [29 CFR 1910.119(k), 40 CFR 68.85]\n-- OIMS 6.4 - Mechanical Integrity:  This system ensures that each site has a work permit system in place to protect personnel (employees and contractors), site facilities, and the surrounding community.  The purpose of a work permit system is to ensure that jobs are planned, equipment is prepared, personnel are informed of hazards and procedures, precautions are taken, and work is executed in a manner to protect safety, security, health, and the environment.\n\nPSM/RMP Element - Management of Change [29 CFR 1910.119(l), 40 CFR 68.75]\n-- OIMS 7.1 - Management of Change:  This system ensures that changes in operations, procedures, applicable standards, facilities, and personnel are evaluated and managed to ensure that safety, security, health, and environmental risks arising fro"

This is accomplished through a process of internal and external assessments and follow-up.\n-- OIMS 6.6 - Regulatory Compliance:  This system ensures compliance with safety, security, health, and environmental laws, regulations, permits and other governmental requirements, including Consent Decrees/Agreed Government Orders (CD/AGOs).\n\n\nTHE FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n     There have been no accidents in the previous five years.\n\n\nTHE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n     As previously stated, OIMS 10.1 (Emergency Preparedness) is in place to ensure that, in the event of an incident, all necessary actions are taken for the protection of the public, employees, contractors, the environment, and assets.  This is achieved through comprehensive response procedures that coordinate on-site responders with Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC), industry, and public agencies.  Fixed fire protection equipment is maintained on-site with additional capability provided by area ExxonMobil resources.\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n     As previously discussed, O"

      "SummaryText": "IMS 11.1 (Assessment and Improvement) is in place to improve Operations Integrity by measuring performance relative to requirements.  Since OIMS supports PSM / RMP elements as discussed above, the assessment and improvement process under OIMS 11.1, by definition, improves overall process safety at the site.  This is accomplished through a process of internal and external OIMS assessments and follow-up.  Internal assessments are conducted annually utilizing personnel trained in the expectations OIMS.  External assessments are conducted periodically by personnel from outside the affected operation.  Team composition and frequency are consistent with the complexity of operations, regulations, and performance history."
