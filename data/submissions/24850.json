Resolution Performance Products LLC maintains Environmental, Health, and Safety (EHS) management systems to ensure the safe operation of its facilities.  As part of this commitment, Resolution Performance Products LLC invests resources in various areas of accident prevention, such as:\n\n- Safety in process design\n- Safe operating policies and procedures\n- A comprehensive mechanical integrity program\n- Management of process changes\n- Training\n- Incident investigation and auditing\n- Emergency response participation.\n\nThis document provides an overview of the risk management activities at Resolution Performance Products LLC, including:\n\n- A description of the facility and substances regulated by the EPA RMP rule.\n- A summary of potential release scenarios and potential off-site consequences.\n- An overview of the Prevention Program to prevent accidental chemical releases.\n- A five-year history of accidental releases of chemicals regulated by EPA's RMP rule.\n- An overview of the emergency response program.\n- Planned changes to improve safety.\n\nFACILITY DESCRIPTION AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nResolution Performance Products LLC operates three (3) units with regulated substances in sufficient quantities to be covered under the Risk Management Program (RMP) regulation.  The facility is classified as Program Level 3 under the RMP regulation.  These three units, the C-unit, the Resins Unit, and the Shipping Unit, store or process RMP toxic and flammable substances as follows:\n\n1.  C-Unit\n\nThis unit produces and/or stores intermediate feedstocks used in the production of epoxy resins and calcium chloride.  RMP regulated substances stored or processed in this unit include chlorine, epichlorohydrin, propylene and butane.\n\n2.  Resins Unit\n\nThis unit produces"

Shipping Unit\n\nThis unit receives and stores feedstocks used in resins production.  Epichlorohydrin is the only RMP regulated substance stored or processed in amounts greater than threshold quantity in the Shipping/Loading area.\n\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS (OCA) SCENARIOS\n\nAn offsite consequence analysis (OCA) was performed on the potential worst-case scenarios (WCS) and alternative release scenarios (ARS) involving toxic and flammable substances at Resolution Performance Products LLC.  The WCS is considered to be unrealistic because it neither reflects actual operating conditions nor allows credit for all mitigation measures in place.  On the other hand, the ARS is a more realistic scenario, which takes into account actual operating conditions and applicable mitigation measures.\n\nThe following are brief summaries of the Worst Case and Alternate Release scenarios at Resolution Performance Products, including information on mitigation control measures, which can reduce potential offsite impact.  All OCA release modeling was performed using the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency?s (USEPA) RMP*Comp offsite consequence analysis program.  Population estimates, public receptors and environmental receptors were analyzed using U.S. Geological Survey topographic maps and the U.S. Department of Commerce, Economics and Statistics Administration, Bureau of the Census, LandViewa III Environmental Mapping Software (1997).\n\n1. Worst-Case Toxic Release Scenario ? Chlorine\n\nThe worst-case toxic release scenario is an instantaneous failure of a storage vessel that results in a release of 371,000 lbs. of chlorine over a 10-minute period. The release calculation assumes urban topography due to the proximity of congested process areas and buildings.  The vessel was assumed to be 50% filled, which is the maximum l"

The distance to toxic endpoint (0.0087 mg/L based on the AIHA ERPG-2 level) was calculated at radius of 20 miles. A population estimate of 518,956 people offsite, including residential, religious, recreational, hospital, school, prison, commercial, and environmental receptors could be potentially affected by the release.\n\nAlthough the RMP rule does not allow credit for mechanical safety systems on worst-case scenarios, there are various prevention measures that significantly reduce the potential risk and impact of the worst-case scenario.  These measures include:\n\n- Mechanical integrity inspection and preventive maintenance programs\n- A perimeter chlorine detection system\n- Critical instrument systems with audible and visual alarms\n- Automatic isolation valves\n- An emergency containment system\n- Routine surveillance by trained operators\n- Normal operating limits of storage vessel maintained at 20-30% of capacity. \n\n2. Alternative Toxic Release Scenario ? Chlorine\n\nThe alternative release scenario for chlorine involves a 6,150 lb. release from a 1/16\" gasket leak on a 6\" pipeline orbit valve.  This scenario was selected because of the release proximity to offsite receptors.  The release calculation assumes urban topography due to the proximity of congested process areas and buildings.  The release is assumed to last 1minute, from the time of detection to complete mitigation.  Mitigation measures include detection by area chlorine monitors, activation of alarms and automatic isolation valve, initiation of emergency notification procedures, operator intervention to activate a firewater monitor and activation of pipeline emergency purge procedures.  The distance to toxic endpoint (0.0087 mg/L based on the AIHA ERPG-2 level) was calculated at 0.9 miles (4,752 ft.).  A population estimate of 641 people offsite, including residential, religio"

Alternative Toxic Release Scenario - Epichlorohydrin (ECH)\n\nThe alternate release scenario for ECH involves a 46,000 lb. release of ECH from a 1.5 inch flange leak during rail car unloading. This scenario was selected because of the release proximity to offsite receptors. The release calculation assumes urban topography due to the proximity of congested process areas and buildings.  ECH rail cars are pressurized with nitrogen to unload the ECH into tank storage.  The scenario assumes a 15 minute release based on operator surveillance to detect the release, stop nitrogen flow to the rail car, and apply water to the affected area with area firewater monitors to mitigate the release.  Passive mitigation consists of a 400 square foot containment dike.  The distance to toxic endpoint (0.076 mg/L based on the AIHA ERPG-2 level) was calculated at 0.1 miles (528 ft.).  A population estimate of 45-50 people offsite, including residential public receptors could be potentially affected by the release.  No environmental receptors were identified.\n\n4. Worst Case Scenario - Flammable Mixture\n\nThe worst-case scenario for a flammable release assumes the catastrophic failure, release, and vapor cloud explosion of 82,000 lbs. of propylene in a column.  The release calculation assumes urban topography due to the proximity of congested process areas and buildings.  No passive mitigation (i.e. containment) credit was applied to the release calculation.  The maximum impact distance to a 1 PSI endpoint was calculated at 0.3 miles (1,584 ft.).

Alternative Release Scenario ? Flammable Mixture\n\nThe alternative release scenario for a flammables assumes the release of butane from a relief valve during startup of the C-200 process and vapor cloud explosion of 5,000 lbs. of butane.  The release calculation assumes urban topography due to the proximity of congested process areas and buildings.  The scenario assumes a 25 minute release based on operator surveillance to detect the release, deactivate the process, and apply water on the release with a firewater monitor.

Release Mitigation\n\nArea firewater monitors\nMobile emergency response equipment\nTrained emergency response personnel\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nOver the last five (5) years, there have been one incident of Propylene release, a RMP regulated substance, from the Resolution Performance Products Plant that have resulted in either offsite or onsite impact per 40 CFR Part 68, Section 68.12 requirements of the RMP rule.  On 13 December 2000, an HCl absorber column ruptured after a minor plant upset.  The column was one of two columns in HCl absorber service.  They operate in parallel and are both constructed of fiberglass reinforced plastic with a PVDF liner.  The column rupture was caused by a cracked vessel liner.  The liner was damaged through thermal and mechanical stresses associated with transient startup conditions.  The cracked liner permitted HCl from the process to deteriorate the fiberglass reinforcing in the column until it could no longer retain operating pressure.  As a result of this incident, 2200 pounds of propylene was released.  This incident did not result in any on-site or off-site impacts.  However, the Louisiana State Police, Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality, and St. Charles Parish EOC were notified.  The Louisiana state Police responded to the incident. \n\nThe failed column was repaired by removing the damaged section and replacing it with new FRP material.  The entire column was then re-wrapped with FRP to provide a wall thickness double that of the original column.  The second HCl absorber column was inspected and determined to be in good condition.  Both the column"

The OEP is also responsible for coordinating the plans and operations of various emergency response agencies in St. Charles Parish such as fire, police, emergency medical services, public works, volunteers and other groups that respond to emergencies. \n\nResolution Performance Products (through Shell) maintains a written emergency response program designed to protect workers, public safety, and the environment. This program consists of policies and procedures for responding to releases, including actions to be taken in the event of a fire, explosion, or chemical release. These procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including first aid and medical treatment, evacuation, personnel accountability plans, notification requirements to St. Charles Parish OEP and the public in the event of a release, post-incident cleanup and area decontamination requirements. In addition, there are procedures that address maintenance, inspection, testing, and use of emergency response equipment.  Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific response duties.  The emergency response program is updated as needed to address changes to Resins processes.  The Management of Change process is used to trigger updates to the emergency response plan, including notification and training of personnel affected by the change.  All the above actions of the emergency response program are undertaken by Resolution Performance Products through a service agreement with Shell. \n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nDiligent compliance with our RMP Prevention Program forms the framework on which we will continue to improve the level of safety at the facility.
