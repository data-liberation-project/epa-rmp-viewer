Facility in Archbold, Ohio is a Pizza Manufacturing Facility. The facility incorporates an Ammonia Refrigeration System which is a standard Compression and Evaporation Style System specifics are avaialbe through the office of the Safety Manager.\n\nRelease scenarios, both worst case and alternate release, have been developed and specifics are located within other areas of this RMP submittal.\n\nSUMMARY OF THE FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nFrozen Specialties, Inc. has had one major accident within the last ten years. This involved a fire in a storage area where ammonia was present. There were only minor injuries reported and no deaths. Modifications have been made to the system to prevent any reoccurance.\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN\n\nIn the event that an ammonia leak is detected employees are to notify the onsite Engineer and Emergency Response Facilitator.  The facilitator takes an ammonia level reading using a detection device.  If the facilitator determines that the ammonia level is above 25 ppm an evacuation of the exposure area is ordered.\n\nThe engineer determines if the leak is serious enough that outside assistance is needed.  If outside assistance is needed the local HAZMAT organization is contacted.  Also Frozen Specialties, Inc. Emergency Response Team is contacted.  The engineers then take appropriate procedures, such as Emergency Shutdown Standard Operating Procedures, to control the leak with personal protective devices in place.\n\nOnce the Incident Commander arrives on scene, a report is given and the Incident Commander takes control of the situation.\n\nFrozen Specialties, Inc. is committed to continuous improvement of our policies, procedures, and facility. It is the intention of Frozen Specialties, Inc. to remain an industry lead"
