This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n1) To save lives.\n2) To minimize and avoid injuries.\n3) To protect the environment.\n4) To minimize property damage.\n\nBama Pie maintains an emergency response team whose members are the designated emergency coordinators for the facility.  The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year to ensure compliance with the OSHA PSM Standard and the EPA RMP Rule, as well as to incorporate any changes to the facility, personnel, roles and responsibilities, procedures, etc. \n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance\nThe Bama Pie facility prepares frozen bakery products for distribution.  The facility utilizes an industrial refrigeration system in order to conduct operations, and ammonia is used in the system as a refrigerant.  Prior to December 2003, the facility operated a small refrigeration system that was not applicable to the EPA RMP regulation.  The facility underwent a major expansion, and operations on the newly expanded system began in December 2003.  As a result of the expansion, the facility is required to comply with Program Level 3 of the EPA RMP Rule.\n\nThe refrigeration process, consisting of piping, valves, and equipment, cycles ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide cooling for process equipment and cold storage rooms. Typical operating conditions range from vacuum (approximately 15.5\" Hg) on the low pressure si"

The system has been designed with several safety features to prevent a release of ammonia.  For example, the compressors are equipped with safety mechanisms that will cause the units to shut down if operating conditions exceed designated safety limits.  Also, level indicators, alarms, and switches are installed at key points within the system to monitor the supply of liquid ammonia and to ensure that a vessel is not overfilled.  Ammonia sensors are installed throughout the facility which will alert plant personnel in the event of an ammonia detection.\n\nFive Year Accident History\nA review of the Bama Pie's accident history in the last five years showed that there have been no incidents at the facility that meet the RMP criteria for a reportable accident (onsite deaths, injuries, or significant property damage; or known offsite deaths, injuries, property damage, environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place).  In addition, there have been no significant releases of ammonia that exceeded the Federal Reportable Quantity of 100 pounds.\n\nWithin the course of the last five years, the facility has experienced small ammonia lea"

These incidents were investigated following the procedures within the Incident Investigation program. The objective of the investigation is to determine the root cause of the leak and any contributing factors, and to devise and implement corrective actions to prevent recurrence of these incidents.\n\nEmergency Response Program\nBama Pie has an Emergency Response Program, which includes procedures for responding to ammonia releases and other foreseeable emergencies that could occur onsite.  The facility has an Emergency Response Team that is trained to the Hazmat Technician Level.  Emergency response team members receive initial 24-hour training and an 8-hour refresher on an annual basis.  Incident Commanders also receive 8-hour initial training and 8-hour annual refresher training.  Emergency Response Team members, who are trained in hazardous materials management and decontamination, are fit tested and respiratory trained annually.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\nBama Pie has worked to address safety issues as they arise in a continued effort to ensure a safe work environment.  The most recent Compliance Audit was completed on May 4-5 and May 26, 2023. The Process Hazard Analysis was updated on September 27, 2018, to address the addition of a new spiral freezer per MOC Record No. BP-41. Recommendations were generated as a result of these analyses to improve safety at the facility. The recommendations from the September 2018 PHA update have been completed. Bama Pie is in the process of addressing the recommendations resulting from the May 2023 Compliance Audit."
