The maximum quantity released would be 140,196pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 2.68miles.\nb)\tThe alternative release scenario based on the most likely potential incident is a release from a break in a transfer hose.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is .83miles.\n\n4.\tThe accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe facility has implemented the provisions of \u00bfSafety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-611.1\u00bf published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc., and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). 29 CFR 1910.111, \u00bfstorage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia.\u00bf\n\n5.\tThe Five Year Accident History\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that:\n\na)\thave caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility, nor\nb)\tTo our knowledge have resulted in offsite death"
