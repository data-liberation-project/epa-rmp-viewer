              "Description": "All 2-methylpropene handling, safety, and countermeasure equipment are covered under an extensive test and inspection program, and under the plants preventive maintenance program. The outlets of the storage tanks and the railcars are protected by excess flow valves that close tight if their set point is exceeded. The storage tanks, railcar unloading, reactor, and compressor areas have perimeter or process flammable gas detectors. There is a leak detection and repair program that calls forthe inspection and gas testing of valves. There are water curtains that are activated by high LELs around the storage, reactor, compressor, and unloading areas. There are heat activated foam deluge systems over any area where the 2-methylpropene is handled. The majority of 2-methylpropene liquid and vapor unloading and vessel piping and gaskets have been upgraded to 300 psig rated equipment and include thermal expansion relief valves. All personnel who operate or maintain equipment, or manage the process in an area where 2-methylpropene is handled are trained on safe handling techniques, countermeasures for leaks, how the fire systems work, and what to do in case of fire or leak. There is a management of change program.  All 2-methylpropene areas fall under the plants 29 CFR 1910.119 compliance program.  All other safety programs apply. There are parts of the transfer lines that are not inside of the detection perimeter or under the deluge systems, but they are in the leak detection and repair program and are protected by excess flow valves, and all other prevention programs apply.",

This is accomplished through both engineering and administrative controls. All applicable elements of the U. S. EPA's Prevention Program and OSHA's Process Safety Management standard are adhered to. The Merisol Antioxidants LLC's Emergency Plan is tailored to meet the needs of any foreseeable release at the Oil City, PA facility, and was developed using input from the local emergency response agencies (Cornplanter Twp. Vol. FD, Rouseville Vol. FD, Oil City FD, and Venango County Emergency Management Agency). The plan was submitted and approved by the Venango County, PA Local Emergency Planning Commission (LEPC). \n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance Handled\n\nThe Merisol Antioxidants LLC facility located at Oil City, PA is a manufacturing facility that produces Butylated Hydroxy Toluene (BHT), a crystalline Phenolic antioxidant. Isobutylene (2-methylpropene) is stored in bulk at the plant, and is used to add the butyl groups onto mixed cresols (methylphenol). The isobutylene storage tanks and associated transfer equipment have several engineered safety features, such as thick walled tanks; excess flow valves; perimeter monitor and alarm systems; pressure relief valves; a flare protected vent system; and administrative procedures to prevent or detect releases. The plant is manned 24 hours a day and the isobutylene system is monitored continuously. There are automated vapor dispersing, fire extinguishing, and associated alarm systems around the isobutylene storage, reactor, compressor, and off-loading areas. All storage and handling equipment as well as all safety and countermeasure equipment are on a rigid test and inspection program as well as a general preventiv"

They have been trained how to assess the situation and communicate to emergency response personnel the most prudent course of action to take to safeguard the community. Merisol Antioxidants LLC management personnel will report to work on site with emergency responders as a resource for controlling releases of isobutylene, and for operating counter measure systems.  Merisol Antioxidants LLC personnel will assist the Incident Commander on the scene as specialists in handling isobutylene. The emergency plan is reviewed and resubmitted to the Venango County LEPC when updated for its review and approval. Necessary elements of the plan are incorporated into the Venango County Emergency Response Plan.  Periodic tabletop or deployment drills are conducted to keep emergency response personnel familiar with plant materials, emergency systems, and response measures.\n\nRecent Changes to Improve Safety\n\nMerisol Antioxidants LLC performs periodic process hazard analyses (safety reviews) of all chemical processes, including the isobutylene system. Some of the recently completed changes to improve the safety of the isobutylene storage and transfer system are listed below.\n\n\n1) New higher pressure rated piping and gaskets were installed in isobutylene liquid and vapor service piping associated with the storage vessels and unloading in 2007 and 2008;\n2) The addition of an automatic shutoff valve interlocked to LEL detection and fire systems for the vapor line connecting the unloading area to the storage vessels was completed in 2007;\n3) Thermal expansion relief valves with discharge to the isobutylene storage vapor piping were added to the isobutylene charge and unloading liquid piping in 2007 to prevent over-pressure and releases;\n4) Some older sections of isobutylene recovery piping were replaced in 2008 and all gaskets were upgraded in the recovery piping;\n5) A Reactor LE"
