These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating, and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe start-up prior to placing equipment into operation.\r\n\r\n\r\nCompliance Audits:\r\nCompliance audits are conducted on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the Risk Management Program (RMP) regulation are being implemented. These audits are carried out at least once every three (3) years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\r\n\r\n\r\nIncident Investigation:\r\nIncidents that have resulted in, or could reasonably result in, a catastrophic release of a regulated substance are promptly investigated. These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from recurring. All incident reports are retained for a minimum of five (5) years.\r\n\r\n\r\nEmployee Participation:\r\nO'Fallon strongly believes that process safety management and accident prevention are a team effort.

This commitment is demonstrated by O'Fallon's comprehensive accidental release prevention program. It is O'Fallon's policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. Unforeseeably, if such releases do occur, there are highly trained employees on hand to control and mitigate the effects of the releases. The site also coordinates with the O'Fallon Fire Department, who provides emergency response services.\r\n\r\nThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled (\u00a768.155(b))\r\nThere is one (1) regulated substance present at this facility. This substance is ammonia (anhydrous). The highest expected inventory of ammonia (anhydrous) at this facility is 14,000 pounds (rounded to two significant digits for reporting purposes). \r\n\r\nThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical Specific Prevention Steps (\u00a768.155(c))\r\nThe facility has taken the following steps as required by 40 CFR Part 68 of the EPA regulations. Our ammonia (anhydrous) process is subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard under 29 CFR  1910.119. The facility is also subject to the EPCRA Section 302 reporting requirements. The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that are in place.\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information:\r\nInformation related to the hazards of the ammonia refrigeration system installed at the facility has been compiled. Prior to conducting the initial and subsequent hazard analyses, the process safety information was reviewed and utilized in identifying and mitigating recognized hazards. The process safety information was also used in the development of the operating procedures.\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis:\r\nComprehensive studies were conducted"
