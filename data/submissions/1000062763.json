      "SummaryText": "The RS-Nelson Farms 156-92-24 V-1,2 is a proposed test site to determine the potential for Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) in the North Dakota Bakken Shale.  The facility will store and inject propane into a producing well bore.  Liquid propane will be stored in two pressurized vessels and the vessels are operated and configured such that only the volume of one vessel would be a contributor to a maximum potential release.  The worst case scenario has been identified as the loss of the full contents of one of the propane vessels with a resulting vapor cloud explosion.  Using table 2 (40 CFR part 68) for the maximum volume (18,000 gallons / 70,000 lbs.), the 1 PSI overpressure distance is 0.3 miles and would not impact a public or environmental receptor.  This facility meets the requirements for Program Level 1. \n\n\n\nThis is a new facility and therefore there is no data in regard to a 5 year accidental release.  The facility complies with NFPA 58 requirements for LPG storage and it is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state and local laws.  In the event of a fire, explosion or significant release of a regulated substance, it is our policy to notify 911 and/ or the local Stanley Fire Department and request they respond to the emergency. Entry within the distance to the specified endpoints may pose danger to the local volunteer fire department or emergency responders; therefore , the local emergency responder volunteer fire department should avoid entering the area except as arranged with the emergency contact in the emergency response plan. The Fire Safety Analysis Manual for LP-Gas Storage Facilities developed by the National Fire Protection Association and National Propane Gas Association (2011 Edition) was also used. \n\n\n\nThe undersigned certifies that to, the best of my knowledge, information and belief formed after reasonable inquiry, the information submitted is true, accurate and complete."
