Automation of P-Tank Farm and associated systems is currently expected by the end of 2024.  \r\n\r\n- Automated end-of-line valves installed at Truck Racks, Rail Racks, and Marine Docks to assist in preventing overfills.  \r\n\r\n- Double verification of all line and hose connections before commencing any product transfer operations to reduce the possibility of incorrect valve and/or hose alignment.\r\n\r\n- Adding a concrete secondary containment floor and total organic carbon (TOC) analyzer to the facility's A-Tank Farm.  A-Tank Farm is one of Stolthaven Houston's original Tank Farms, and was originally constructed with earthen secondary containment.  \r\n\r\n- Continuous improvement through the facility's ISO 9001:2015 Certified QMS.\r\n\r\n- Employee Experienced Feedback Program.\r\n\r\n- Fall protection added at transfer racks where trucks and ISO containers are loaded and unloaded.\r\n\r\n- Two 753-horsepower fire-water pump driver emergency diesel engines added in 2019 at Ship Dock 11 for fire-fighting response.  \r\n\r\n- Gas detection systems updated in 2020 to include 5-gas monitors with photo-ionization detectors (PID).\r\n\r\n- Fire-fighting equipment upgrades planned for 2021, including the purchase of a new Fire Truck and a utility terrain vehicle (UTV) Quick Attack Unit.\r\n\r\nAdditional capital budget projects under consideration for future improvements to safety and emergency response at Stolthaven Houston, Inc. include additional surveillance cameras to be installed around the terminal's east expansion property, and adding concrete paving to four existing tank farms (B, F"

The facility currently consists of 188 above-ground storage tanks that vary in capacity from 2,000-barrels up to 110,000-barrels, five truck loading/unloading racks (Truck Racks T-3, T-4, T-5, T-6, and T-8), four rail car loading/unloading racks (Rail Racks R-1, R-2, R-3, and R-5), one dedicated barge dock (Barge Dock-C), a finger pier jetty equipped with two separate marine vessel berths for handling barges and ships (Ship Dock 2/3), and a new jetty placed into service in October of 2019 also for handling barges and ships (Ship Dock 11).  A rail car cleaning and intermodal transfer station (Rail Rack R-4 and Truck Rack T-7) is also located within the Stolthaven Houston Terminal, and a biological waste water treatment plant and various air pollution control devices are operated on-site to reduce the impact of the Stolthaven Houston Terminal's operations on the environment.\r\n\r\nBulk liquid products are received into the Stolthaven Houston Terminal by various modes of transportation cargo container including tank trucks, ISO tank containers, flexi-bags, rail tank cars, barges, and marine parcel tankers.  The received liquid products are stored on-site according to customer-specified requirements, and are subsequently transferred off-site through one or more of the above-referenced transportation modes.  Stolthaven Houston, Inc. also performs direct product transfers between marine vessels and rail tank cars with no intermediate storage in the facility's above-ground storage tanks."
