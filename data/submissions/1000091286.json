The specific changes associated with this RMP update include:\n\n\n\n- Adding Acrylonitrile Transfers from Marine Vessels into a Rail Car, and subsequent transfers of the Acrylonitrile from the loaded Rail Car into ISO Tank Containers for shipment off-site.  Acrylonitrile represents a regulated toxic substance to be handled above the Threshold Quantity in a new covered process at the Stolthaven Houston Terminal.  \n\n\n\n- Updating the maximum on-site inventories for all RMP regulated chemicals handled at the facility, and  \n\n\n\n- Various data element updates since the previous RMP certification.  \n\n\n\n\n\n? 68.155(a):  ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\n\n\nStolthaven Houston, Inc. is committed to operating and maintaining our processes related to bulk chemical storage and distribution in a safe and responsible manner.  The facility uses a combination of accidental release prevention and emergency response planning programs to protect the environment and to ensure the safety of our employees and assets, our industrial neighbors, and the citizens of the surrounding community.  This Executive Summary provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that Stolthaven Houston, Inc. has designed and implemented, including:\n\n\n\n- A description of our facility and the substances regulated by 40 CFR 68 that may be handled on-site in stationary sources above their corresponding Threshold Quantities.\n\n\n\n- An overview of our accidental release prevention programs.\n\n\n\n- A five-year history of significant accidental releases, if applicable, from processes covered by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (\"EPA\") RMP regulations.\n\n\n\n- An overview of our"

The facility currently consists of 188 above-ground storage tanks that vary in capacity from 2,000-barrels up to 110,000-barrels, five truck loading/unloading racks (Truck Racks T-3, T-4, T-5, T-6, and T-8), four rail car loading/unloading racks (Rail Racks R-1, R-2, R-3, and R-5), one dedicated barge dock (Barge Dock-C), a finger pier jetty equipped with two separate marine vessel berths for handling barges and ships (Ship Dock 2/3), and a new jetty placed into service in October of 2019 also for handling barges and ships (Ship Dock 11).  A rail car cleaning and intermodal transfer station (Rail Rack R-4 and Truck Rack T-7) is also located within the Stolthaven Houston Terminal, and a biological waste water treatment plant and various air pollution control devices are operated on-site to reduce the impact of the Stolthaven Houston Terminal's operations on the environment.\n\n\n\nBulk liquid products are received into the Stolthaven Houston Terminal by various modes of transportation cargo container including tank trucks, ISO tank containers, flexi-bags, rail tank cars, barges, and marine parcel tankers.  The received liquid products are stored on-site according to customer-specified requirements, and are subsequently transferred off-site through one or more of the above-referenced transportation modes.  Stolthaven Houston, Inc. also performs direct product transfers between marine vessels and rail tank cars with no intermediate storage in the facility's above-ground storage tanks."
