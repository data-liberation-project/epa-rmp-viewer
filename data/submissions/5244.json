In addition, HED(US) is preparing for certification under International Standards Organization \n\n(ISO) 14000 later this year and has performed drills and audits to demonstrate the effectiveness of the \n\nemergency response procedures.  This plan includes notification of local authorities and the public in the \n\nevent of the release of hazardous substances.\n\nHED(US) is primarily a manufacture of color picture tubes for the electronics industry. The North American  \n\nIndustry Classification System code for the overall facility is 334411:  Electron Tube Manufacturing.   \n\nHED(US) does not produce any hazardous substances, but uses small quantities of several regulated \n\nsubstances in plant processes. The EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) provides Threshold Quantities \n\n(TQs) which are the minimum quantity of each regulated chemical stored on site that will require \n\npreparation of a Risk Management Plan (RMPlan).  In December of 1998, HED(US) compiled a list of all \n\nregulated chemicals used at the facilities and determined the maximum quantity of each chemical  that \n\nwould be stored at the facility at any given time.  HED(US) identified 6 regulated substances that were \n\nused at the facility that are not stored in quantities or concentrations above the TQs.  In accordance with  \n\nthe EPA RMP regulation, these substances are not included in this RMP.  These substances are  \n\nincluded in HED(US)'s Emergency Planning and Response Plan and HED(US) has evaluated the impact of \n\nreleases of these substances.  In addition, HED(US) identified 1 substance, an acid, that is stored in \n\nexcess of the EPA RMP  TQs.   This RMP is submitted for this acid.\n\nThe acid is purchased in two container types:  55-gallon drums contained in overpack drums and 5-gallon  \n\nplastic containers.   There is only one location where the total quantity of this acid exceeds the EPA's TQ.  \n\nThe drums are stored  until use in the Hazardous Material"

There is a potential to have \n\nas much as 6,000 pounds of the acid in 55-gallon drums and 5,000 pounds of the acid in 5-gallon \n\ncontainers in this storage building. The  EPA guidance for RMP states that the worst case release scenario \n\nfor a substance should be based on an instantaneous release of the entire contents of the largest \n\ncontainer.  In our case, that is the release of the contents of a 55-gallon drum.\n\nThe worst case release scenario could occur either inside or outside of the Hazardous Materials Storage \n\nBuilding.  HED(US) modeled a release both inside and outside the Hazardous Materials Storage Building.  \n\nThe greatest distance calculated to an endpoint was for the release outside of the building,  calculated at \n\n0.31 miles.  This is included in Section 2.  Toxics: Worst Case.  The release of the entire contents of the  \n\ndrum of acid inside the building was calculated to reach 0.19 miles to the endpoint and is included in \n\nSection 3.  Toxics: Alternative Release.  Both of these scenarios could have off-site impacts.   Neither \n\nscenario is considered likely to occur.   The  drums are contained in overpack drums designed to contain \n\nany of the acid that may spill from the inside drum.  In reviewing past releases to create the 5-year \n\naccident history (Section  6), the largest release in the past 5 years was the content of a 5-gallon  \n\ncontainer.   Modeling results indicate that a release of this size would not have off-site impacts.   This \n\nrelease was caused by using a forklift inside the Hazardous Materials Storage Building.  As a result of  \n\nthis release, forklifts are no longer allowed inside the building for drum loading or unloading.  Drums are \n\nmoved with drum trucks rather than forklifts, so the likelihood of rupture during transportation is reduced.\n\nHED(US) routinely reviews and audits safety procedures, training and practices.   Our philosophy is to \n\navoid accidents and releases through adherence to sound "
