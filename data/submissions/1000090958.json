      "SummaryText": "Giorgio Fresh Company operates a mushroom post harvest facility in Blandon, PA. Like many mushroom postharvest facilities, we use anhydrous ammonia in our refrigeration system. Ammonia is the best refrigerant available for our use.\r\nBecause of its moderate toxicity and slight flammability, ammonia is considered a hazardous material.\r\nGiorgio Fresh Company is committed to maintaining a safe manufacturing operation for our employees and the surrounding community. Our refrigeration system obeys our local building and fire codes, as well as industry consensus codes and standards where appropriate. Finally, to comply with requirements of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and the United States Environmental Protection Agency, we have a Process Safety Management program to help us operate and maintain the system safely.\r\nOur priority is to prevent accidental releases of hazardous materials instead of merely responding to problems. Our Process Safety Management program includes elements addressing:\r\n- Employee Participation: We involve our employees at all appropriate points in our program.\r\n- Process Safety Information: We maintain information relating to the safety of ammonia and the design limits of the refrigeration system so that our employees are fully informed.\r\n- Process Hazards Analysis: We conduct detailed studies of our refrigeration system to identify the important hazards and safeguards and to identify appropriate changes to improve safety.\r\n- Operating Procedures: We provide written operating procedures to help our staff stay within the safe operating limits of the refrigeration equipment.\r\n- Mechanical Integrity (Maintenance and Quality Control): We have established a comprehensive program of\r\ninspections and preventive maintenance to keep mechanical failures from occurring.\r\nWe have contracted with a Refrigeration Contractor to inspect our Refrigeration System monthly and perform preventative maintenance as required.   This is in addition to"

As required, this scenario has offsite impact, meaning that a level of 200 ppm ammonia is reached beyond the property line.\r\nThe \"alternat"
