The process is located at 21411 North 11th Avenue, Phoenix, AZ 85027.  The chlorine transfer process for A Diamond Pool, Inc. consists of chlorine one-ton containers which are the storage vessels.  Chlorine liquid is dispensed from the one ton container through a filling manifold to a 20 pound cylinder.  The system is operated manually; therefore, someone is present when ever the container valve is open.  During off-hours, the container valve is closed and the system is shut down.\n\nThe maximum quantity of chlorine on site is 8000 pounds.\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nA Diamond Pool, Inc. has a Process Safety Management program to manage the handling of chlorine.  In addition, common industry standards, policies, and procedures are utilized to ensure safe practices are being performed.  This includes common practices outlined by the Chlorine Institute and the National Association of Gas Chlorinators.  \n\nThe owner and operator of the facility has over 30 years of experience in the gas chlorination industry with a perfect histo"
