We use a combination of an accidental release prevention\n\nprogram and an emergency response planning program to help ensure the safety of our employees and\n\nthe public, as well as protection of the environment.  This executive summary provides a brief overview of the\n\ncomprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including:\n\n\n\n     *    A description of our facility and use of substances regulated by EPA's risk management plan (RMP)\n\n           regulation.\n\n     *    An overview of our accidental release prevention program.\n\n     *    A five-year accident history for accidental release of chemicals regulated by EPA's RMP rule.\n\n     *    An overview of our emergency response program.\n\n     *    An overview of planned improvements at the facility to help prevent accidental chemical releases \n\n           from occurring and adversely affecting our employees, the public, and the environment.\n\n\n\n2.0     Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nThe City of Topeka's water supply and treatment facilities provide safe, reliable, and economical drinking water\n\nwithin the city limits and surrounding areas.

Regular review of safety information such as Materials Safety Data Sheets (MSDS), daily\n\n         documentation of chlorine inventory, and regular updating of safety information to assure\n\n         accuracy and completeness.\n\n2.     Hazard review of the chlorination system using industry recommended checklists to assess\n\n         potential problems that could result in an accidental release, determine the safeguards needed\n\n         to control hazards or prevent equipment malfunction.\n\n3.     Written operating procedures that address initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations,\n\n         emergency shutdown, emergency operation, normal shutdown, startup following a normal or \n\n         emergency shutdown or a major change, consequences of deviations and steps required to correct\n\n         or avoid deviations, and routine equipment inspections.\n\n4.     Regular employee training to assure that each plant operator has the required knowledge, skills,\n\n        and abilities to safely carry out the duties and responsibilities assigned.\n\n5.
