(National Beef) owns and operates a beef slaughter house and packing plant in Dodge City, Kansas.  On site, National Beef has an ammonia refrigeration system which contains anhydrous ammonia, a regulated hazardous substance, for the refrigeration of meat at the facility.  The maximum intended inventory of anhydrous ammonia on site is above the threshold quantity listed in 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 68.130.\n\n\n\nBecause the quantity of anhydrous ammonia exceeds the threshold quantity, National Beef is required to implement a Risk Management Program (RMP) at the Dodge City, Kansas plant which includes three (3) major elements: hazard assessment, prevention program, and emergency response program.  The submission of the RMP Plan presents the details of the RMP compliance measures conducted by National Beef.  \n\n\n\nNational Beef is also subject to OSHA's Process Safety Management Program (PSM).  Based on the information presented in this program, National Beef is subject to Program Level 3 requirements of the RMP regulation.\n\n\n\n1.1 Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nNational Beef is committed to the protection of the safety, health, and environment in our routine operations and emergency responses.  Our prevention and emergency response practices are developed to protect the public as well as our own employees.  It is our policy to comply with applicable laws, and to support and work with local emergency response agencies.  To implement this policy, the following plans are maintained and implemented at the Dodge City facility:\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Plan\n\nProcess Safety Management (PSM) Program\n\nRisk Management Program\n\n\n\nThese programs and procedures provide comprehensive planning for accidental and emergency situations. \n\n\n\n1.2 Description of National Beef and the Regulated Substance Handled\n\n\n\nThe National Beef Pac"

Live cattle are received and slaughtered, and fresh meat is cut and packaged.  The ammonia refrigeration system provides the necessary refrigeration of the meat.  In addition, the ammonia refrigeration system is utilized to provide cooling for the plant itself.  There are approximately 300,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia located within the closed-loop ammonia refrigeration system.\n\n\n\n1.3 The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nNational Beef has specific process controls in-place to minimize the risks of spills.  National Beef is subject to OSHA's Process Safety Management Program (PSM).  National Beef has a preventative maintenance program in place to address maintenance of all vital parts of the ammonia refrigeration system.  All inspection and testing procedures are addressed within this program.  In addition, there are many safety controls installed within the system.  These include an interlock system, relief and check valves, manual and automatic shutoffs and alarms located within the ammonia refrigeration system.  \n\n\n\n1.4 Five year Accident History\n\n\n\nWe have had one accidental release of ammonia in the past five years that is reportable under the Five-Year Accident History criteria.  The release was well under the Reportable Quantity (RQ) for anhydrous ammonia.  The release resulted in two minor employee injuries; no one offsite was injured or evacuated.\n\n\n\n1.5 The Emergency Response Program\n\n\n\nNational Beef's emergency response policies summarize the actions to be taken in response to a chemical spill.  In the event of a spill, National Beef will react with the proper actions as listed in the Emergency Response Plan in association with the local emergency response agencies.  Local emergency responders are familiar with the facility and the hazards of release.\n\n\n\n1.6 Planned Changes to"

National Beef is committed to continuously improving the facility's safety and working practices through the use of newly-identified protocols and through employee involvement and development.\n\n\n\nA Process Hazard Assessment (PHA) was recently reviewed at the National Beef facility.  A number of additional safeguards identified during the PHA have been implemented to improve the safety of the anhydrous ammonia process as well as reduce the chances and magnitude of any anhydrous ammonia spill.\n\n"
