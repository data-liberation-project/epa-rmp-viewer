If an \nabnormal event indicates the potential for the release of a chemical and quantity that may \nlead to an emergency condition, the site emergency response team is notified and the \nmost appropriate mode of response is determined by the Site Emergency Coordinator, \nwith support from available emergency response and technical advisory staff.  \n\nTraining of responsible staff from both the Charleston Chemical Plant and the Mill Emergency Response Team is designed to ensure that reliable communication \nand coordination occurs in any emergency situation.  The Charleston Chemical Plant has \na continuous safety improvement program which includes prompt investigation and \nreporting of all spill- or release-related events, even when there is no immediate threat of \noff-site exposure.  \n\n6.0 PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nMeadWestvaco Specialty Chemicals Division, under the EPA Accidental Release \nPrevention program, as well as its PSM and SARA Title III Community Right-to-Know \nAct compliance programs has organized its management system to effectively address \nhazards and potential risks.  These programs are documented so that needed information \nabout the safe handling of chemicals present at the facility is continuously available to \nemployees, and can be readily interpreted by emergency response team staff and the Site \nEmergency Coordinator when questions arise from public safety officials on potential \nrisks to the community.  All of these features of the RMP and the integrated risk \nmanagement program at this site lead to operations that are safe today, but will be even \nsafer tomorrow."
