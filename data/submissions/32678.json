      "SummaryText": "INTRODUCTION\n\nThe RUTGERS Organics Corporation (formerly Bakelite Epoxy Polymers) Augusta Georgia plant is a custom batch manufacturer of a variety of organic chemicals that are used in various industries such as agriculture, coatings, and plastics.  The plant is located on a 77-acre tract of land in south Augusta, GA.  The original plant was built in 1980.  The product mix at the facility changes frequently due to the nature of the custom batch manufacturing business.\n\nThe Augusta plant currently stores and uses two chemicals that are listed on the RPM Toxic Chemicals list above the material?s threshold quantity.  These chemicals are epichlorohydrin (106-89-8) and 98% nitric acid (7637-37-2).\n\nThe 98% nitric acid is used in the manufacture of an herbicide intermediate.  The nitric acid is received via tank truck and is stored in a 7,500 gallon above ground; glass lined bulk storage tank.  The tank is located within a diked area.\n\nEpichlorohydrin is used the in manufacture of epoxy resin and diluents.  The epichlorohydrin is received via tank truck and is stored in a 15,000 gallon above ground bulk storage tank.  The tank is located within a diked area.\n\nACCIDENT PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nRUTGERS Organics Corporation Augusta Plant is committed to conducting operations in a manner that prevents accidental chemical releases.  RUTGERS Organics? policy is to design, maintain, operate and audit operations to make sure the possibility of a chemical release is kept as low as possible.  In the unlikely event an accidental chemical release does occur, RUTGERS Organics? policy is to have a well trained and prepared workforce capably of responding to a release and have the equipment and facilities available to minimize the release and its affects on employees, the public, and the environment.  The RUTGERS Organics Augusta Plant?s accidental release prevention program, coupled with the emergency response program consists of multiple safeguards or ?layers of protection? designed to pr"

      "SummaryText": "event or minimize the effects of an accidental chemical release.\n\nThe first layer of protection is to ensure all processes are designed for safety.  Hazard assessments are performed on the initial process design and every five years afterwards.  Safety systems are designed into the process that actively or passively help minimize the effects of a chemical release.  Equipment and piping are designed and installed per established industry codes and standards, such as the American Society of Mechanical Engineers and the National Fire Protection Association.  All changes to a process are thoroughly reviewed by technical and health and safety personnel to ensure any change to equipment, procedures, chemicals, etc. will not affect the safety of employees, the environment, or the public.\n\nThe second layer of the prevention program involves the maintenance of process equipment.  A preventative maintenance program is in place that is designed to identify problems with plant equipment before they occur.  All critical safety equipment is checked regularly and prior to process startup to ensure it operates as designed.  Inspections and tests of critical devices such as relief valves, pressure vessels, and storage tanks are regularly performed to ensure the integrity and function of the equipment are maintained.  In addition, maintenance personnel are highly skilled and regularly trained.\n\nOperating the plant in a safe manner makes up the third layer of the Augusta Plant?s prevention program.  Operators are trained on a process prior to startup and at least every three years afterwards.  All operations are conducted using written procedures that have been reviewed and approved by management and technical personnel.  Access to the plant is restricted to authorized employees, authorized visitors, and authorized contractors.  Areas where epichlorohydrin and 98% nitric acid are stored and handles are further restricted during handling operations.  Sensitive and/or critical process p"

      "SummaryText": "arameters, such as process temperatures and pressures are continuously monitored either by computer or operators.  Maintaining an excellent safety program is considered everyone?s responsibility.\n\nThe fourth layer of the accident prevention program involves auditing plant operations.  Internal reviews by plant management and health and safety personnel are regularly performed to ensure employees are doing their job correctly and safely.  Operating procedures are reviewed periodically to guarantee that they are current and reflect design intentions.  All processes undergo a pre-startup safety review that confirms design specifications have been followed, procedures are in place, a process hazard analysis has been performed and all recommendations from the analysis have been implemented, and that training for all employees involved in the process has been conducted.  Should any incident occur involving a chemical release, no matter how small, the incident is investigated and any recommendations from the investigation are implemented to ensure the possibility of any future occurrence is minimized.\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nThere has been no accidental releases involving either or the two RMP regulated substances, in excess of the material?s respective reportable quantity at the RUTGERS Organics plant over the last five years.\n \nEmergency Response Program\n\nThe RUTGERS Organics Augusta Plant?s emergency response program is based on two fundamentals: (1) having a properly trained and prepared workforce, and (2) if a release does occur, have the equipment and procedures necessary to minimized the possible health and environmental effects of the release.  Theses are the last two layers of chemical release protection.\n\nTraining involves all personnel at the Augusta Plant.  The plant has trained HAZMAT Technicians that are able to offensively stop chemical releases.  The rest of the plant is trained on emergency equipment, emergency response and evacuation procedures.

      "SummaryText": "rgency exercises are performed periodically with Augusta-Richmond County emergency responders.  All exercises are critiqued afterwards for improved efficiency.  If a release does occur, the facility is equipped with a plant alarm to alter all personnel.  A contingency plan is in place that directs employees on the actions to take in the case of a chemical release.  This plan includes notification procedures (i.e., 9-1-1, the community, including area schools, businesses, etc.), procedures to control the release, safety procedures (i.e., evacuation, shelter-in-place) and procedures for establishing a response management system.  RUTGERS Organics HAZMAT Technicians, Augusta-Richmond County Fire Department and HAZMAT teams can respond to an emergency within minutes.  In addition to these procedures, the plant is equipped with a variety of emergency equipment, including foam spray nozzles, fire hydrants, sprinkler systems, and spill kits that assist in combating an emergency.\n\nPlanned Safety Improvements\n\nThe RUTGERS Organics Augusta Plant is strives to improve operations in accordance with the Synthetic Organics Manufacturer?s Organization?s Responsible Care codes.  These guidelines steer companies towards continuously improving product stewardship, employee health and safety, process safety, pollution prevention, and community awareness and emergency response."
