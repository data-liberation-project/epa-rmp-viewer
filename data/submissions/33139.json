BACKGROUND\nMPCC owns a cogeneration plant near Anacortes, Washington on land leased by MPCC from the Shell Oil Products US Puget Sound Refinery (PSR), a co-located refinery.  Located within the cogeneration facility, a 20,000-gallon anhydrous ammonia storage tank (ammonia tank) is used to provide ammonia (a) to the Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) system on the cogeneration plant?s gas combustion turbines and (b) to PSR for use in the refinery?s Fluid Catalytic Cracking Unit Electrostatic Precipitator.  The ammonia tank is owned by MPCC.  It is located on property owned by PSR and leased to MPCC.  Previously, the ammonia tank was included in PSR?s RMP.  PSR has deleted the ammonia tank from PSR?s RMP.  MPCC has undertaken responsibility for the RMP for the ammonia tank.  \n\nCurrently MPCC has agreements in place with PSR to provide personnel to perform certain operation and maintenance services for MPCC.  These services that PSR provides include services related to implementation of the MPCC RMP, including emergency response services related to the ammonia tank, and implementation of the fourteen elements of the PSM (Process Safety Management) Plan for the ammonia tank.  PSR has included the ammonia tank in PSR?s Emergency Response Plan.\n\n1.2.  ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION & EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\nMPCC has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of MPCC processes.

      "SummaryText": "The policy of MPCC is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release from the ammonia tank does occur, MPCC has contracted with PSR to have PSR provide trained personnel to respond to, control and contain the release.\n \n1.3.  STATIONARY SOURCE & REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\nMPCC?s cogeneration plant is an existing major stationary source per the requirements of Title V of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990.  Located within this facility is a 20,000-gallon anhydrous ammonia storage tank; anhydrous ammonia is considered hazardous under applicable RMP regulations by the EPA.  \n\nThe ammonia tank is used to provide anhydrous ammonia to the SCR systems on MPCC?s gas combustion turbines and to PSR, the co-located refinery, for use in PSR?s Fluid Catalytic Cracking Unit Electrostatic Precipitator.  The ammonia tank is owned by MPCC.  It is located on property owned by PSR and leased to MPCC.  The maximum quantity of ammonia that can be stored or handled at this facility is 91,040 pounds based on an administrative control stating that the contents in the tank are not to exceed 80 percent of the ammonia tank?s storage capacity.\n\n1.4.  GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM & \nCHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\nMPCC has contracted PSR for assistance in implementing an accident prevention program and in complying with the PSM Standards.  MPCC is using the accident prevention program originally developed in PSR?s original RMP.  The original program, which applies to the whole of PSR, is summarized in Appendix A of this report for information purposes only.  Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by (1) equipment failures and (2) human errors.\n\nIn addition to the accident prevention program activities, MPCC has safety features on the ammonia tank to help (1) contain/control a release, (2) quickly detect a release, and (3) reduce the "

The following types of safety features are used in the process.\n\nRelease Detection\n\nAmmonia detectors with alarms\n\nRelease Containment/Control\n\n1.  Valves to permit isolation of the process (manual or automated)\n2.  Automated shutdown systems for specific process parameters (e.g., high level, high temperature)\n3.  Curbing or diking to contain liquid releases\n4.  Redundant equipment and instrumentation (e.g., uninterruptible power supply for process control system, backup firewater pump)\n5.  Atmospheric relief devices\n\nRelease Mitigation\n\n1.  Fire suppression and extinguishing systems\n2.  Sprinkler systems\n3.  Deluge system for specific equipment\n4.  Trained PSR emergency response personnel\n5.  Personal protective equipment (e.g., protective clothing, self-contained breathing apparatus)\n\n1.5.  FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nMPCC has had no accidental releases from the ammonia tank system over the past 5 years.\n\n1.6.  EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\nMPCC is exempt from the Emergency Response Program (40 CFR part 68.95) because it meets the exemption requirements detailed in 40 CFR part 68.90 paragraph (b), which states that:\n\nThe owner or operator of stationary source whose employees will not respond to accidental releases of regulated substances need not comply with Sec. 68.95 of this part provided that they meet the following:\n\n(1) For stationary sources with any regulated toxic substance held in a process above the threshold quantity, the stationary source is included in the community emergency response plan developed under 42 U.S.C. 11003;\n(2) For stationary sources with only regulated flammable substances held in a process above the threshold quantity, the owner or operator has coordinated response actions with the local fire department; and\n(3) Appropriate mechanisms are in place to notify emergency responders when there is a need for a response.\n\nPSR participates in a Community Awareness and Emergency Response (CAER) program that w"

CAER has prepared a community Emergency Response Plan in accordance with EPA?s RMP requirements, and continues to work in cooperation with government organizations including the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  This community Emergency Response Plan includes the ammonia tank.  In addition, MPCC does not possess any regulated flammable substances held in a process above the RMP threshold quantity.  Finally, MPCC has contracted with PSR to provide emergency response services for the ammonia tank and has established the appropriate mechanisms to notify PSR emergency responders whenever there is a need for a response.  PSR accordingly has a written Emergency Response Plan that incorporates all emergencies related to the ammonia tank and that satisfies the conditions of 40 CFR part 68.95.  MPCC meets all of the conditions from 40 CFR 68.90 (b), and therefore, an Emergency Response Plan is not included as part this report.*  \n \n1.7.  PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\nMPCC conducts or contracts with PSR for Process Hazard Analyses (PHAs), the findings of which result in modifications to the process.  MPCC is also in the process of evaluating several Process Safety Management initiatives to incorporate best practices and enhance safety programs.\n\n*Per a June 6, 2003 phone conversation between Harry Bell, EPA Region 10, and Elizabeth Carper, Trinity Consultants, it was agreed that for the response to the RMPSubmit program, a facility contracting the Emergency Response Program operations, may state that the facility has an Emergency Response Plan if the following statements are true:\n1) The Local Emergency Planning Committee is aware of and accepts the contractual relationship between the two facilities.\n2) The facility that is contracting out the Emergency Response Program responsibilities has appropriate mechanisms in place to notify the contracted emergency responders when there is "

Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the refinery.  In addition, the refinery has a number of initiatives under way that address process safety and employee safety issues.  Through the BEST (Behavioral Education for a Safer Today) Program, employees have designed and implemented a behavior based safety program which encourages modifications to behavior to work safer.  This program utilizes peer observations of work practices and participation on safety teams.  The program has the stated goal that ?We all return home healthy and safe.?  The teams typically have members from various areas of the plant, including operations, maintenance, engineering, and plant management.  PSR and MPCC have also implemented the Paper, Allied-Industrial, Chemical and Energy Workers International Union (PACE) Triangle of Prevention (TOP) program to improve safety.  Major elements of TOP are 8 hours of safety training for all employees, a root cause incident investigation program, an expanded safety metric for tracking progress, and a full time Union Health & Safety Representative.\n\nPROCESS SAFETY INFORMATION\nMarch Point Cogeneration Company uses the same documentation that exists at the Puget Sound Refinery.  Puget Sound Refinery maintains a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  Specific departments within the refinery are assigned responsibility for maintaining up ?to-date process safety information.  Chemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs"

The refinery process uses controls and monitoring instruments, trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\n\nMarch Point Cogeneration Company and Puget Sound Refinery also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, etc.  This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\nPROCESS HAZARD ANALYSIS\nMarch Point Cogeneration Company has adopted and is subject to Puget Sound Refinery?s Hazard Analysis Program.  Puget Sound Refinery has a comprehensive program to help identify and control recognized hazards associated with the various processes.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to recognize hazards and to verify that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.  Puget Sound Refinery primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  HAZOP analysis is recognized as a systematic and thorough hazard evaluation technique.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to a variety of departments for consideration and resolution.

All approved mitigation options being implemented in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and that documentation is retained.  It is Puget Sound Refinery?s and March Point Cogeneration Company?s policy to resolve all open findings in a timely manner.  The time necessary to resolve a finding varies, depending on the nature of the finding and circumstances.  For example, as a general rule, findings are resolved within two years or less, unless the resolution of the finding requires a unit or plant shutdown to complete, or other conditions limit the ability of the plant resolve the open finding.\n\nPuget Sound Refinery and March Point Cogeneration Company periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.  An electronic tracking system is used to manage and document the results and findings from these updates.\n\nOPERATING PROCEDURES\nPuget Sound Refinery?s operations personnel operates the March Point Cogeneration Facilities inside the Puget Sound Refinery.  March Point Cogeneration has adopted Puget Sound Refinery?s operating procedures.  Puget Sound Refinery maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process.  These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.  The procedures are maintained current and accurate by revising them as necessary by Puget Sound Refinery (Operator) to reflect changes made through the managemen"

The Operations at the March Point Cogeneration Facility additionally comply with the Puget Sound Refinery?s training requirements.  To complement the written procedures for process operations, Puget Sound Refinery has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  There is a training program that is designed to provide new operators with basic training in refinery operations if they are not already familiar with such operations.  After attending the training program, new operators are paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties to perform the duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  In addition, operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to help maintain their skills and knowledge.  This refresher training is conducted at least every three years.\n\nCONTRACTORS\nMarch Point Cogeneration Company uses contractors other than the refinery employees to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the refinery has procedures in place so that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform refinery personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.  This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) eme"

The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and the equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready.  The PSSR review team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness.  A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\n\nMECHANICAL INTEGRITY\nMarch Point Cogeneration Company and the Puget Sound Refinery have well-established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition.  The basic aspects of this program include:  (1) conducting training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) addressing findings identified, if any, during inspections and test, and (5) applying quality assurance measures.

Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended, and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels).  If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service (if possible), or a MOC team will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to verify the safe operation of the equipment.\n\nAnother integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance.  Puget Sound Refinery and March Point Cogeneration Company incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs.  This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.\n\nSAFE WORK PRACTICES\nMarch Point Cogeneration Company and the Puget Sound Refinery have long-standing safe work practices in place to help maintain worker and process safety.  Examples of these include (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous materials before process piping or equipment is opened, (4) a permit and procedure to control spark-producing activities (i.e., hot work), and (5) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space.

This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be reviewed pursuant to the MOC process before being implemented.  Changes are reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.  Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures, are updated to incorporate these changes.  In addition, affected personnel are provided any necessary training on the change.\n\nINCIDENT INVESTIGATION\nMarch Point Cogeneration Company and the Puget Sound Refinery promptly investigate all incidents that result in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a reportable fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury.  The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and to develop action items that may help prevent a recurrence of the incident.  The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to refinery management for review.  Actions taken in response to the investigation team?s findings and recommendations are tracked until they are complete.
