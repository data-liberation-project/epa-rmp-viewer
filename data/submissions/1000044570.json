EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nThe Rumford Paper Company operates a paper manufacturing facility located at 35 Hartford Street, Rumford, Maine that manufactures coated paper and market pulp. The area immediately surrounding the plant is primarily rural with just a few commercial facilities and residential areas. The Androscoggin River is the closest water body and is directly adjacent to the plant. The major routes serving the facility include U.S. Route 2 and Maine Route 108.\n\nThe only process at the Rumford Paper Company facility covered by RMP is the chlorine dioxide process which involves the manufacture, storage, and distribution of a 1.2% solution of chlorine dioxide. Specifically the chlorine dioxide process is subject to RMP's Prevention Program 3. Based on a review of chemicals present at the plant, there are no other substances that are covered by RMP.\n\nPursuant to the RMP rule, owners must include a five-year accident history that identifies all accidental releases from covered processes that resulted in: (1) deaths, OSHA reportable injuries, or significant property damage on-site; or (2) known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage. See 40 C.F.R. !? 68.42. A review was completed for all existing RMP covered chemical release/spill records and incident investigation reports dating back to June 2009. No accidental releases from covered processes at the mill meeting the criteria described above have occurred within the past five years.\n\nThe Rumford Paper Company is committed to the safety and health of Rumford workers and the public, preservation of the environment, and prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances. The mill implements controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous substances. These controls include training programs for personnel; programs to help ensure safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of processes at Rumford; and programs to evaluate the "
