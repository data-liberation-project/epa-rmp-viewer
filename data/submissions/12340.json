We have Agriculture Fertilizers, Traces, Ag chemicals and Anhydrous Ammonia.  We offer custom spreading and spraying.  We carry livestock feed and minerals for the area Ranchers and complete feed to help out the 4-H kids with their livestock projects.\n     Superior has 7 full time employees with over 100 years combined experience in the Agriculture industry.\n     With an emphasis on Safety and Environment we have seen a large increase in our laws and regulations.  Superior has always believed that Safety is our NUMBER ONE issue with our employees and our community.  Being located in a small area customers are more than customers, but our neighbors and friends, so our main concern is to conduct business in the safest and most efficient manner possible.\n     The most recent regulation that we will address is the Risk Management Program Rule-40CFR Part 68 Section 112 (r) of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990.  Superior handles Anhydrous Ammonia which is one of the Chemicals listed on the RMP Chemical list.\n     Anhydrous Ammonia is injected into the soil for an effective, economical way to provide crops with nitrogen.  In a closed vessel at normal temperatures Anhydrous Ammonia is a colorless liquid which creates a gas as it compensates for the displacement of liquid with a pressure of 100 psi and 200 psi depending on temperature.\n     Superior stores Anhydrous Ammonia in a liquid cylinder tank.  The tank has a light reflective coating of paint.  The liquid valves are labeled and painted red.  The vapor valves are labeled and painted yellow.  After the new paint job in 1997 four new relief valves were installed.  The tank has the words An"

Also we have hung signs on the fence that say Keep Out, Authorized Personnel Only and Dangerous, Eye Protection Must Be Worn In The Area.  Our Safety relief valve is covered at all times to protect it from the elements.\n     Training and education is an on going process at Superior.  Our employees are trained on the specific elements of required safety and health programs.  Employees know the elements of may programs.  Two of these programs are Hazard Communication and Personal Protective Equipment.  Before handling Anhydrous Ammonia our employees are involved in training.  Then once a year employees are given refreshner courses by using videos, discussion sessions, hands-on practice with equipment, demonstrations, speakers, either in house or guest and brainstorming sessions.\n     The most important training for our employee's is Personal Protective Equipment.  Employees are required to wear long-sleeve shirts and long pants.  Gloves and chemical splash goggles with sponge rubber which restricts the flow of ammonia vapor but allows minimal venting to prevent fogging.  We ask that no contact lenses are worn while working with Anhydrous Ammonia.  A pint sized squeeze bottle full of water is worn in the employees shirt pocket while working with Anhydrous.  We also have at the Facility a water tank full of fresh water, and also a shower.  Our employees know the importance of having water close at hand while working around Anhydrous Ammonia due to the burning effect that it has when it comes in contact with human flesh.  This is caused because Anhydrous Ammonia is an alkali.  Anhydrous Ammonia burns keep spreading until the ammonia is diluted.  This is why water is so important in first aid treatment, if by accident Anhydr"

Our employees all have mobile phones and also we have a phone in the building next to the Anhydrous Ammonia Bulk tank that works as an inter-com so the office can be contacted.\n     Our employees are aware that hoses are the weakest link in the ammonia system.  Superior has several safety checks with hoses that are carefully followed.  First of all Superior only uses hose and hose couplings designed for ammonia service.  Anhydrous Ammonia hoses are marked at 5-foot intervals with the following information:  Anhydrous Ammonia,  the maximum working pressure, the manufacturer's name, and the year of manufacture and also the date the hose should be replaced.  The hoses are designed for a working pressure of at least 350 psi (pounds per square inch).  Our employees are instructed that at any sign of weakening, weathering, checking, soft spots, cuts, gouges or any other signs of deterioration, they must be replaced immediately.  Our hoses are draped or wrapped around a suitable hang-up rack.  During the winter months are equipment is stored in a cool, dry place.\n     Our Bulk Storage tank has a gauge on the end of the tank to let our employees know the amount of liquid that is in the tank.  Our maximum percentage of fill on the tank is decided by the temperature.  Inside the Bulk Tank we have excess flow shut off valves that will shut, if the flow of liquid from valves becomes to rapid, caused by a hose or hose valve failure.\n     Superior has a daily maintence sheet that is filled our for the Bulk Storage and turned in daily and kept at the office after it is filled out.

We do know that we feel that\n             your unselfishness is very much appreciated by the District, the Volunteer Firemen and \n             the community.\n                  Thank you so much!\n\n             Sincerely yours,\n             Howard F.

      "SummaryText": "s Ammonia is stored.  Also attached to the TierII form is a site map showing the exact location of our Bulk Facility and where Emergency Personal Protection Equipment is stored.  We send a copy of our TierII forms by certified mail to Colorado Department of Public Health & Environment, the Crook Fire Department and the Logan County Local Emergency Planning Commission.\n     Under Spills and Releases we have a section for Anhydrous Ammonia which reads as follows:\n          1.  Remain calm, assess the situation, and use extreme caution.\n          2.  Sound the alarm or call the Emergency Coordinator.\n          3.  Stay upwind at all times.\n          4.  If available, use a water fog or spray aimed at the ammonia cloud to reduce vapor.  Do not put \n               water directly on a liquid leak or liquid pool; only on the vapors.\n          5.  Approaching from upwind, stop the leak or shut off valves, if you can do so safely.  WEAR A\n               SUITABLE RESPIRATOR AND FULL PROTECTIVE CLOTHING.\n          6.  Isolate the hazard area, and deny entry to everyone except trained responders wearing\n               protective gear.  Detour motorists from the hazard area and downwind areas.\n                    SMALL LEAKS:  isolate to 150 feet.  If entering isolated area, protect\n                    from body contact with the cloud or liquid.  Use a gas mask with NH-3 \n                    canisters.\n                    LARGE SPILLS:  Isolate to 150 feet.  Then evacuate 3.4 mile radius.  Dike \n                    to contain runoff of liquid ammonia or solution from applied water.  To enter\n                    the isolated area, use only self-contained, positive-pressure breathing\n                    apparatus and full protective clothes.\n           7.  Report the release to the proper authorities.  Spilled anhydrous ammonia is impossible to retrieve\n                or to keep from excaping the remises, so any release over 100 pounds must be reported.\n                NOTES:  Th"
