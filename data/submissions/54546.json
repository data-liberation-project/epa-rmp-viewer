              "Description": "This Prevention Program 3 has been updated from the 2004 RMP submission and covers the recirculating closed-loop ammonia refrigeration system.  The process includes many interconnected vessels and refrigeration units.  Preventive maintenance and on-the-job training of operators and maintenance personnel make up the foundation of the program.  Rose Packing Company continues to implement safe work practices (including lockout/tagout, confined space entry, line break, and entrance control policies and permits), expand our training and emergency response program and reassess procedures to maintain the ongoing integrity of the refrigeration equipment.  Rose Packing has continuously modernized the facility as new technologies are developed.  One important feature of the prevention strategy is the program for the repositioning of evaporators in recessed areas, making contact with vehicles highly unlikely, as well as the placement of virtually all of the refrigeration piping on the building's roof.  Other items include updating of the operations manual and training to reflect improved approaches to safety.",

(Rose Packing), Chicago facility, for the reduction of accidental releases of hazardous materials. This updated, five (5) year Risk Management Plan (RMP) summarizes the management, administrative, procedural, and technological controls that work together to minimize the risk to site personnel, contractors, visitors, and the community and environment at large of hazardous chemical releases. The Risk Management Plan (RMP) is organized to correspond with specific U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) RMP, Program 3 of 40 CFR 68, definitions and requirements of Subpart G, including: \n? Introduction;\n? Rose Packing?s policies to protect health, environment, and safety;\n? Facility identification and regulated substances covered processes;\n? Hazard Assessment;\n? Prevention Program;\n? Five-Year Accident History;\n? Emergency Response Plan; \n? Emergency Communications;\n? Spill Reporting / Environmental Release Procedures;\n? Planned changes to improve safety; and\n? Management Program\n\nII. Rose Packing?s Policies To Protect Health, Environment, and Safety\nRisk management and safety are important concerns at Rose Packing; this RMP formalizes and documents these activities. Rose Packing is committed to conducting its operations in a safe and responsible manner and to reducing risks to human health and to the environment. It is Rose Packing?s policy to comply with all applicable federal, state, and local rules and regulations.\n\nThis RMP has identified potential hazards and has taken steps to design and maintain a safe facility in order to prevent releases, and minimize the consequences of accidental releases, which could occur. RMP addresses potentially catastrophic chemical releases that could result in immediate harm and acute health effects to offsite receptors (public and environmental). The RMP includes the Facility?s Emergency Response Plan (ERP) that contains procedures, w"

Facility Identification\nThe Rose Packing facility is located at 4900 South Major Avenue in Chicago, Illinois. The facility is a manufacturer of fresh, smoked and processed pork products for the retail and food service industries.  Operations include packing, cooking and processing meats. Rose Packing produces Canadian Style Bacon and a full line of raw and fully cooked pork sausage, ethnic sausage and back ribs.  The facility also makes hams, smoked pork shoulder butts, sectioned and formed processed pork, fresh boneless backs, pork roasts and pork tenderloins.  The NAICS code for the facility is 311612.\n\nThe facility uses ammonia for refrigeration, and is regulated under 40 CFR Part 68, the EPA RMP Rule. There is one recirculating closed-loop refrigeration system onsite. The system contains a charge of 34,000 pounds of ammonia, which is above the minimum threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds. \n\nA topographic map identifying the site location is included as Appendix A. An area map is included as Appendix B. \n\nIV. Hazard Assessment ? Worst Case Scenarios (WCS)\nAppendix C consists of the RMP*Submit Printout and contains additional information on the worst-case scenario.  Appendix D consists of the offsite consequence analysis data and maps for the worst case release scenario. \n\nV. Hazard Assessment ?

The most recent audit of the PSM program was concluded on July 27, 2006, and the next audit is scheduled for July 14, 2009, in compliance with the requirement to conduct PSM audits every three years.  The elements of the PSM / Program 3 prevention program and a brief description are listed below.\n? Employee Participation ? Rose Packing has developed a site-specific employee participation plan that ensures employees and their representatives are consulted when conducting and developing process hazard analyses and other information required to be developed under the PSM/RMP regulation.  In addition, the employee participation program ensures employees and their representatives have access to process hazard analyses and all other information required to be developed under PSM/RMP.  Employees at Rose Packing have assisted in developing the initial PHA and the five (5) year PHA revalidation for the ammonia process.  In addition, employees have assisted in the development of other PSM/RMP information such as the development of operating and preventative maintenance procedures.\n? Process Safety Information ? Rose Packing has developed a site-specific PSI program that ensures information pertaining to the hazards, technology, and equipment of the process are properly developed and maintained. Process safety information for the ammonia process has been compiled and was last reviewed and updated as of July 2008.\n? Process Hazard Review ? Rose Packing has developed a site-specific PHA program that ensures a PHA is conducted initially, at a minimum of every five (5) years, and whenever a change is significant enough    to require a change in PSI.

Incident Investigation ? Rose Packing has developed a site-specific incident investigation procedure that ensures each incident that either results in a release or could have resulted in a release of anhydrous ammonia is investigated, within 48 hours, by a team of at least one person knowledgeable in the process.  This procedure also makes provisions to ensure a report is prepared at the conclusion of the investigation and findings are promptly addressed. \n? Compliance Audit ? The facility completed an original RMP on June 17, 1999 for the ammonia refrigeration system that held a charge of 34,000 pounds of ammonia. Although modifications have been made to the ammonia refrigeration system, the amount of ammonia present in the system remains at approximately 34,000 pounds. Compliance audits have been conducted in August 2003 and July 2006.  The next compliance audit is scheduled for July 14, 2009.

Emergency Response Program\nRose Packing has an Emergency Response Plan (ERP), updated during July 2008, to ensure that in the event of an emergency the facility personnel are aware of the appropriate actions to take and authorities to contact in order to mitigate the effects of a release. Response activities are coordinated with the Central Stickney Fire Department (which coordinates response activities with the Mabis 10 HAZMAT Team). This coordination effort includes providing the fire departments with site diagrams and hazardous material information, meeting with fire department personnel to discuss facility operations/processes, and periodic on-site inspections by fire department personnel.\n\nThe facility maintains an ERP on file at the plant. According to the ERP, facility employees are responsible for investigating and assisting the fire department (if necessary) with response to accidental releases of ammonia. The plan includes annual training of all employees on evacuation procedures and emergency notification procedures. The plan also includes annual training for emergency response team members. It identifies the Emergency Response Coordinators, Evacuation Coordinators and alternates. In addition to the facility ERP, the plant is included in a community emergency response plan developed by the Suburban Cook County Central Section Local Emergency Planning Committee. Rose Packing coordinates with the Central Stickney Fire Department (which includes response by the Mabis 10 HAZMAT Team) on emergency response activities. \n\nThe facility has two windsocks present onsite for use in determining wind direction in the event of an ammonia release.\n\nResponders receive HAZWOPER training through classroom instruction and drills.
