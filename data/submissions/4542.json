      "SummaryText": "At AFG Spring Hill, all emergency response plans are tailored to the specific facility and follow all EPA guidelines.\n\nThe sulfur dioxide storage, transfer, and injection process is used in the float glass manufacturing process.  Sulfur dioxide is applied to the underside of the glass ribbon as it enters the annealing process to prevent transfer of roll defects to the glass.  Our maximum storage of (16) 1-ton bottles occurs on the site as far away from the plant as possible.  AFG Spring Hill only connects four bottles to the process at any one time, with only two bottles hooked live.  Of the two live bottles, only one is valved into the system at any time.\n\nThe ethylene tank trailer is located North of the facility on the Silane Pad.  This portable trailer is supplied by our Praxair vendor, who attaches and detaches the trailer, and is positioned at least 100' away from any ignition source.\n\nBoth chemicals are thoroughly covered in our Hazwoper spill classes, which adhere to 29CFR1910.120.  The initial training class involves the 24-hour class for our technicians, with the 8-hour annual reviews.  All production and Maintenance technicians are required, under ISO certification, to participate in the class as part of their Job Training Needs Analysis.\n\nAll off-site consequence analysis scenarios were developed by the RMP*Comp.\n\nNo releases have occurred at Spring Hill in the past 10 years.  The emergency response plans used by AFG have been in effect for the past 10 years, with no changes occurring in the last two."
