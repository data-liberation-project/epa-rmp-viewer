GFS has developed in conjunction with the Clark County LEPC a Chemical Emergency Response Plan & Standard Operating Procedures (Emergency Response Plan) for GFS's Springfield Distribution Center.  The stated purpose of this Emergency Response Plan is:\n\n* To ensure the safety of Emergency Response Team Personnel during a hazardous materials emergency.\n\n* To provide adequate safety precautions in protecting Gordon Food Service employees and the public from harm caused by a chemical release.\n\n* To provide the Emergency Response Team with management direction during all operations directly related to a hazardous material emergency.\n\n\n\nGFS has established a strong relationship with the Springfield Fire Department to assist GFS personnel in implementing GFS's established policies and the procedures established in this Emergency Response Plan.  \n\nSite Description and Substances Handled\n\nGordon Food Service (GFS) distributes general grocery items to restaurants, cafeterias, and Marketplace stores throughout the Midwest.  GFS utilizes refrigerated warehouses (Distribution Centers) to receive product from venders, which is then distributed to Marketplace stores and clients within a 250-mile radius.  The Springfield Distribution Center for GFS is located in an industrial park south of the City of Springfield, Ohio. \n\n\n\nThe structure of the Springfield Distribution Center consists of a warehouse building subdivided to house building maintenance; administration; dry, refrigerated, and frozen product inventory; and unloading and loading dock areas.  Refrigerated and frozen inventory cooling at the Springfield Distribution Center is provided by an anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system located within the Distribution Center.

      "SummaryText": " to the Risk Management Plan (RMP) requirements.  \n\nAmmonia System Design \n\nThe refrigeration system at the Distribution Center contains approximately 31,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.  The refrigeration system consists of the following basic elements:\n\n* compressor,\n\n* controlled pressure receiver,\n\n* liquid pump,\n\n* evaporator,\n\n* condenser, and \n\n* associated piping and valves.\n\n\n\nThis refrigeration system is a closed loop system.  Refer to the attached process flow diagram for further design of the refrigeration system at the Springfield Distribution Center.\n\n\n\nThe major components of the refrigeration system including the controlled-pressure receiver at the Springfield Distribution Center are enclosed in a concrete block room (compressor room) within the warehouse facility itself.  The only exterior components of the refrigeration system is the condenser and associated piping and valves.  The compressor room has only two access points.  One access point is a door that opens into the warehouse itself and the second access point is a door that leads directly to the outside of the facility that remains continuously locked from the inside. The evaporators are suspended from the ceiling of the warehouse throughout the refrigerated and frozen food product areas.\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario \n\nThe Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has defined a worst-case release as \"the release of the largest quantity of a regulated substance from a vessel or process line failure that results in the greatest distance to a specified endpoint\".  Basically, a worst-case release is a catastrophic event that destroys the process and/or storage vessels and causes and immediate release of all stored materials.  In order to determine the radius of impact to off-site receptors, an offsite consequence analysis was conducted.  RMP*Comp(tm), developed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), was the model utilized to perfo"

The following site-specific parameters and required default parameters were utilized to conduct the offsite consequence analysis for the Springfield Distribution Center:\n\n* Quantity of ammonia liquefied under pressure: 31,780 pounds (present in the largest single vessel - controlled-pressure receiver (site-specific value)\n\n* Height of Release:  ground level (default value)\n\n* Release Duration: 10 minutes (default value)\n\n* Mitigation Measures:  Release in enclosed space in direct contact with outside air due to the presence of two doors one of which leads outside (default value)\n\n* Topography: Urban Surroundings (site-specific value)\n\n* Wind Speed: 1.5 meters/second (default value)\n\n* Stability Class: F (default value)\n\n* Air Temperature: 77 degrees Fahrenheit (default value)\n\n* Compressor Room volume:  59,616 ft3 (site-specific value)\n\n\n\nSince the controlled pressure receiver is located within the warehouse, a calculation was performed to assess if the building would fail as a result of the release.  The following equation was utilized to determine the building strength as recommended by the EPA:\n\nCompressor Room Volume/Quantity of ammonia \n\n59,616 ft3/31,780 pounds = 1.88 ft3/pounds\n\n\n\nSince the answer is greater than 0.1ft3/pound, the building will be able to sustain and contain an ammonia release.  Therefore, the default values for a Mitigated Release will be able to be utilized for calculating the estimated distance to the Toxic Endpoint.  Next, site specific values and default values were input into the RMP*Comp(tm) model to calculate the Toxic Endpoint and Estimated Distance to the Toxic Endpoint.  The calculated results are 0.14 mg/l and 1.5 miles, respectively.  \n\n\n\nIn order for a release of this magnitude to occur, all automated and engineered fail-safe mechanisms would have to have been destroyed.

Since the Controlled Pressure Receiver is located in the Compressor Room that has limited access and has no vehicle traffic it is highly unlikely that a catastrophe of this magnitude would occur damaging this vessel.  \n\n\n\nAdditionally, the compressor room has only one door that leads to the outside of the facility and it is locked from the inside.  This door is only used for emergency purposes.  Therefore, there are no direct outlets present for a release of anhydrous ammonia to impact outdoor air.  \n\nAlternate Release Scenario\n\nGFS has reviewed their ammonia refrigeration system to determine a more likely release scenario.  The Process Hazard Analysis conducted in accordance with OSHA's Process Safety Management Standard 29 CFR 1910.119 indicated that a release caused by a hole in piping caused by corrosion or a leaking valve along the piping run located on the roof of the warehouse is a more plausible release scenario.  Under normal operating conditions, the roof-top piping runs are under pressures that fluctuates between 100 to 130 psig.  The fluctuations in the piping run pressure are due to the change in ambient air temperature.  The absolute maximum pressure possible for this system is 150 psi.  The alternate release scenario was calculated assuming the roof-top piping run was damaged creating a 2-inch hole (diameter of the pipe) and the system reaches a maximum possible pressure of 150 psi.  The release rate was calculated utilizing the Bernoulli Equation:\n\nQR = HA x (203)(Pg)1/2\n\nWhere:    QR = Release rate (pounds/minute)\n\n    HA = Hole area (square inches)\n\n    Pg = Gauge pressure (psig)\n\n\n\nUsing this equation, the release rate was calculated to be 4972 pounds of anhydrous ammonia per minute.  Inputting the calculated release rate of 4,972 pounds/minute and the default release duration of 60 minutes into the RMP*Comp(tm) model, an esti"

This radius of impact is significantly smaller than the worst case scenario however; it could still impact the surrounding public.  \n\n\n\nThe alternate release scenario model assumes that all of the engineered fail safe measures present in the ammonia refrigeration system at GFS including automatic and manual alarms and shutoff mechanisms fail.  Therefore, the odds of the alternate release scenario described above occurring are still very low.  GFS does feel that this scenario has a greater chance of occurring than the worst case scenario previously described.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nTo prevent the accident release scenarios described above and others outlined in GFS's Process Hazard Analysis at the Springfield Distribution Center, GFS has implemented an aggressive prevention program since the refrigeration system went on line in 1998.  GFS has made a commitment to understand the environmental aspects and safety aspects of the refrigeration system operations.  In response to this increased knowledge and awareness, GFS has devoted much time and effort to insuring the refrigeration system at the Distribution Center is working efficiently, effectively, and safely for not only on-site employees but also the residents and public areas surrounding the Distribution Center.  \n\n\n\nGFS is subject to the OSHA Process Safety management (PSM) requirements.  Therefore, the PSM program GFS has instituted is in compliance with these standards, at minimum.  GFS's prevention program includes the following:\n\n* Daily manual and automated pressure checks of temperature and pressures in engine room.\n\n* Weekly inspection of exterior insulation, valve stations, and piping runs.\n\n* Bi-weekly leak checks of all valves and valve stations.\n\n* Preventative maintenance program based on observations from inspections.\n\n* Inspections of Preventative Maintenance Work Orders and d"

The Emergency Response Plan details:\n\n* pre-emergency planning procedures, \n\n* GFS's Emergency Response Team organizational structure, \n\n* training requirements, \n\n* emergency recognition and prevention procedures, \n\n* emergency alerting procedures, \n\n* evacuation procedures, \n\n* emergency medical services, \n\n* emergency response procedures, \n\n* medical surveillance procedures, and\n\n* post emergency response critique procedures. \n\n\n\nGFS has provided not only employee training but also all necessary resources needed to adequately, quickly, and safely respond to a release of anhydrous ammonia.  GFS personnel are trained to contact the Springfield Fire Department to respond to and mitigate a release of anhydrous ammonia at GFS's Springfield Distribution Center when a resulting release approaches 100 pounds or a spill over 35 ppm of ammonia which can not be operationally isolated.\n\n\n\nGFS has coordinated with the Springfield Fire Department, area hospitals and local emergency response companies to ensure all parties are aware of their roles and responsibilities in the event a release does occur.  By the direction of the Clark County LEPC, off-site notification comes from the Springfield Fire Department.  Upon their contact they assume the leadership role for emergency response and make all off-site evacuation and sheltering communications to the community.\n\n\n\nGFS employees required to do work in and around the anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system, are trained and annually updated in identifying and initially responding to a release in accordance with the OSHA Standards.  \n\n\n\nTo ensure response procedures and employee training is complete and up to date, GFS in conjunction with the Springfield Fire Department conducts mock emergency response scenarios quarterly.  After completing each mock emergency response scenario the Springfield Fire Department and GFS"

      "SummaryText": " refrigeration personnel review the methods and procedures followed to coordinate the response effort and mitigate a release to assess their effectiveness and to determine if changes to response procedures are necessary.  \n\n\n\nIn any event, GFS and the Springfield Fire Department are fully prepared to respond to an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia and more importantly protect GFS employees, and people living and working around the Springfield Distribution Center.  \n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThe Springfield Distribution Center is a new Distribution Center brought on line in April of 1998.  GFS has been able to introduce many engineering fail-safe mechanisms into the new refrigeration system that improve the odds of a release of anhydrous ammonia from occurring.  These engineered fail-safe mechanisms have increased the safety for all on-site employees and significantly reduced the risk of a release of anhydrous ammonia from not only occurring but also from migrating off-site and impacting the surrounding residences and businesses.  GFS is committed to continually improve the operations of the refrigeration system to continue to reduce the threat of a release occurring.  As part of GFS's continual improvement commitment, several administrative improvements are proposed for the immediate future.  These administrative improvements include but are not limited to:\n\n* Continually enhancing the Employee Training Program to allow GFS to obtain the best available information and technology for improving refrigeration system efficiency and safety,\n\n\n\nGFS is considering adopting the principles and management characteristics of an ISO 14000 Environmental Management System to manage environmental, health and safety compliance issues consistently throughout GFS's diversified organization.  An Environmental Management System is a proactive voluntary initiative that a company commits itself to going beyond compliance.  This system will allow Gordon Food Service to see"
