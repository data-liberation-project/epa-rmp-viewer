Mein-Plant Manager\n\n\nRisk Management Plan---Executive Summary \n\n\n1. The Facility Policy\n\nThe owners, management and employees of Cash Grain are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia at their KAMO Grain plant site.  If any accidental release should occur, we are prepared to work with the Pittsburg and Frontenac Fire Departments, and the Crawford County LEPC, to control the release and minimize the impacts of the release to the surrounding people and environment.\n\n2. Facility Information\n\nThe primary activities of Cash Grain are retail sales of dry fertilizers, ammonia, seed, and agricultural chemicals to area farmers.  \n\nAnhydrous ammonia is received and stored at our KAMO Grain Facility.  The site is where we fill nurse tanks for transportation and delivery to the field where the ammonia is to be applied for crop production nutrients.\n\nThe most ammonia stored in our storage facility would be 99,500 pounds.  This is split up between a 12,000-gallon and 10,000-gallon storage tanks.   The maximum quantity handled at one time would be the unloading of a tanker truck, which is approximately 40,000 pounds.\n\n3. The worst case release and alternative case release scenarios\n\na. The worst case release scenario would be the release of the entire contents of our largest storage tank released as a gas for a period of not over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 54,366 pounds, which represents the contents of the largest 12,000-gallon tank filled to 85% full.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 PPM) is 1.2 miles.\n\nb. The alternative case scenario is one that is based on our own accident history.  Since we have had no major accidents since we have owned the plant (about one year).  We have chosen to depict a more common scenario, which is the break of a transfer hoses.  The dis"

We are not planning any increased safety measures at this time."
