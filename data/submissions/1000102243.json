The facility stores greater than 15,000 pounds of vinyl acetate monomer, which is the threshold quantity (TQ) that triggers applicability to 40 CFR 68. Thus, 40 CFR 68 is applicable to the Columbus facility.\nThe dominant characteristic of vinyl acetate is its toxicity. Vinyl acetate is highly flammable and can form toxic vapors in the air. It is not poisonous, but it is an irritant to human tissue as well as a suspected\nApril 2022 Page 2 of 2\ncarcinogen. Vinyl Acetate is most dangerous when inhaled especially in high concentrations which can cause irritation the respiratory tract.\n3.0 General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps [40 CFR 68.155(c)]\nThe vinyl acetate is shipped in liquid form and transferred to underground storage tanks. The accidental release prevention and emergency response policies are addressed in the individual RMP procedures which detail the RMP program requirements as well as how Franklin complies with the applicable requirements.\n4.0 Five-year Accident History [40 CFR 68.155(d)]\nFranklin International has an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last 5 years. Due to our release prevention policies, there has been no accidental release as defined in 40 CFR 68.42(a) during this period.\n5.0 Emergency Response Program [40 CFR 68.155(e)]\nThe Columbus facility has an Emergency Response Plan (ERP). The ERP describes response procedures to minimize hazards to human health and the environment in the event of release. As backup, Franklin has also contracted with an outside firm who is capable of responding to large chemical releases. In addition, Franklin has coordinated with local emergency response units and share information about our facility layout and hazardous chemicals on site with them on a regular basis. We periodically conduct evacuation drills to maintain a high-level awareness among our employees. All Franklin personnel receive"

Facility management regards employee and public safety as a very serious matter and have taken several precautions to maintain a safe working and public environment. The Columbus facility has an excellent record in preventing releases of vinyl acetate and has a thorough safety and emergency procedure in place at the site. This facility has implemented a closed loop transfer with vapor recovery devices which minimizes discharge of hazardous vapor to the air and the raw material is shipped in liquid form to underground storage tanks to further prevent release. The facility implemented a chemical inhibitor in the vinyl acetate to ensure that a reaction does not occur.\nThe emergency response policies at the Columbus facility ensure that there is emergency response coverage 24 hours \u0096 7 days per week. There are also adequate provisions for coordination with outside agencies such as with the Columbus Fire Department in the event of an emergency.\n2.0 Process Description and Regulated Substances [40 CFR 68.155(b)]\nFranklin International is located at 2020 Bruck St, in Columbus, OH.
