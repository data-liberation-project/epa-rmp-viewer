THE FACILITY POLICY:   The owners, management, and employees of Augusta Farmers Co-op Co. are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia by utilization of proper equipment, regular inspections and maintenance and training of all persons that work with the material. Should an accidental release occur, the facility has orientated the local fire department and the local emergency planning committee so they can plan for response to any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n\n2.     FACILITY INFORMATION:  The primary activity at the facility is the storage of anhydrous ammonia for sale to farmers. Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient. The maximum quantity stored would be 80000 pounds in the facility's 1 tank.\n\n\n\n3.     The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of the storage tank 80000 pounds released as a gas over 10 minutes. The maximum quantity released would be 80000 pounds, which represents the volume of the storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by desighn standards and company procedures. The distance to the endpoint of dispersion based on the model used is .94 miles.\n\n\n\n The alternative-case release scenario is assumed to be a release from the rupture of a 1 inch transfer hose with 3500 pounds released over 2 minutes. The distance to the endpoint of dispersion is .42 miles.\n\n\n\n4.     The accidental release program:  The facility complies with the rules and regulations relating to the handling of anhydrous ammonia and low pressure"
