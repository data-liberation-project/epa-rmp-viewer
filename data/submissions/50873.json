Ammonia is the only hazardous chemical used at this facility that is subject to the CalARP program requirements.\n\nThis facility recognizes the hazards associated with the use of highly hazardous chemicals.  As a reflection of our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws and regulations, we submit this updated plan to address the hazards inherent with the use of ammonia.  Our program addresses safety precautions regarding the handling and operation of this covered system, as well as proper training for those who operate and maintain the system.  The company training policy requires that all employees be properly trained for a job position before assignment to that job.\n\nOur accidental release prevention program is clearly defined by the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) Program for this facility.  This prevention program follows industry-recommended standards for preventing unnecessary human exposures and reducing the threat to the health of our employees as well as to members of the community and the surrounding area.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle these chemicals, the safety devices inherent in the design of this facility and its processes, and the training that we provide our personnel.   This Plan is updated as required by law.\n\nOur Emergency Action Plan (EAP) details the response this facility will take as a result of an uncontrolled release of ammonia.  The Plan includes procedures for notification of the local emergency responders and the contracted refrigeration contractor.  This EAP also includes a specific protocol for responding to an ammonia release and assigns an Emergency Coordinator to implement the response.  All employees at the facility have the following knowledge: 1) general awareness of ammonia at the facility, 2) how to report an ammonia release, 3) where to go when"

This Plan is current and updated as required by law and conforms to the requirements for an Emergency Action Plan.  \n\nThis facility has also coordinated with the local emergency responders and will maintain close contact to ensure that the responders are familiar with the system and with the general safety and accidental release program at our plant.\n\nIt is the policy of this facility to devote the time, energy, and capital toward maintaining prevention and response programs appropriate to the inherent dangers with the use of hazardous chemicals.\n\nTHE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nThe Stationary Source\n\n Fresh Start Bakeries began operating this facility in 1987. The ammonia refrigeration system was originally designed and installed in the same year by Applied Process Cooling Corporation (APCCO) of Modesto, California.  There have been some equipment changes to the refrigeration system since its inception.  The facility is located at 920 North Shaw Road, Stockton, California, on the east side of State Highway 99 and north of State Highway 26 (East Fremont Street).  The immediate area is primarily commercial with some light industrial and residential areas.\n\nFresh Start Bakeries is a wholesale, single-purpose facility for the Quick Service Restaurant industry.  The Stockton facility produces and freezes approximately 21 million dozen hamburger buns each year.  The plant operates three shifts every day of the year.  Shift hours are:\n\n1st  Shift: 0700 ? 1500 hrs\n2nd Shift:1500 ? 2300 hrs\n3rd Shift: 2300 ? 0700 hrs\n\nThe company history below was excerpted from the company website:\n\nUNITED STATES\n\nFresh Start Bakeries' history began in the early 1960s with the construction and operation of the first major bakery to serve McDonald's in Southern California.  In 1971, a new plant was built in Southern California in City of Industry, which today remains one of the largest capacity hamburger bun baking facilities in the world"

      "SummaryText": ", capable of producing 8,000 dozen hamburger buns per hour and 1,400 dozen English muffins per hour.  In 1969, a plant was built in San Jose to supply Northern California (later replaced with a state-of-the-art facility located in Stockton in 1987).  In 1974, Fresh Start continued its expansion by building a third bakery in Hawaii to serve various customers in the Hawaiian Islands.\n\nIn 1984, the company built a single-purpose hamburger bun bakery in Kansas City, Kansas that serves Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska, Southern Illinois and parts of various other surrounding states.  Today, this facility is a joint venture with Best Harvest Bakeries and qualifies for diversity (minority) supplier status.  The Kansas City plant represented a significant step forward in bakery automation for the hamburger bun baking industry and remains one of the most labor efficient bun bakeries of its size in the United States.\n\nIn 1997, Fresh Start Bakeries established a joint venture to build the Tennessee Bun Company (TBC) in Dickson, TN.  TBC is considered one of the most highly automated facilities in the world, baking over 5,000 dozen buns per hour on one line.  In 2001, the partners of TBC expanded their business relationship by equipping an additional production facility in nearby Nashville, TN.  This facility, Nashville Bun Company (NBC), bakes English muffins in a variety of flavors and sizes.  In addition, NBC freezes muffins and buns, and packages them into corrugated boxes for distribution to over 40 states in the U.S., the Caribbean Islands and South America.  These two facilities qualify for minority supplier status.\n\nINTERNATIONAL\n\nThe strength of Fresh Start's performance in the United States provided the opportunity to grow internationally.  In 1988, we opened our first international bakeries in Duisburg, Germany and Sao Paulo, Brazil.  The early success of Fresh Start in the international transfer of American baking technology led to additional global opportunities.  We cur"

The system is a two-stage mechanical refrigeration system that provides controlled cooling to the Cool Dock, Blast Freezer, the Ante Room, and the underfloor heat exchanger for the freezer.

The Engine Room detector will shut down the main liquid feed solenoid in order to stop, or mitigate, a catastrophic release.  Each detector will sound an audible and visual alarm located inside the main facility.\n\nAdditional safety systems include:\n\nPressure relief valves\nCompressor control switches\nCompressor control panels to shut down the compressor operation if safe operating conditions are exceeded\nLiquid level float switches\nVentilation system for continuous ventilation \nEmergency refrigeration control switch for emergency shutdown of the syste"
