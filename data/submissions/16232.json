Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at Dow Chemical Michigan Operations are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  If such a release does occur, our highly trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  We are also coordinated with City of Midland Fire Department which provides additional emergency response expertise.\n\n\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities encompass chemical manufacturing, including agricultural and specialty chemicals and plastics.  We have 30 regulated substances and 19 covered processes present at our facility.  These substances and their maximum inventory at an individual process are located in Table 1.\n\n\nTable 1:  Regulated substances and maximum inventory at an individual process at Midland, Michigan Operations Site.\n\nMaterial\nInventory Quantity\nAcrylonitrile \n520,000 lbs.\nAllyl alcohol \n145,000 lbs.\nAmmonia \n105,000 lbs.\nBromine \n80,000 lbs.\n1,3-Butadiene \n1,500,000 lbs.\nChlorine \n175,000 lbs.\nChloromethyl methyl ether \n110,000 lbs.\nDimethylamine \n106,000 lbs.\nDimethyldichlorosilane \n44,000 lbs.\nEthyl chloride \n270,000 lbs.\nEthyl ether \n103,000 lbs.\nEthylene oxide \n785,000 lbs.\nHydrogen chloride/Hydrochloric acid \n252,000 lbs.\nAqueous Hydrochloric acid (37%)\n150,000 lbs.\nIsopropyl chloroformate \n46,000 lbs.\nIsopropylamine \n67,000 lbs.\nMethacrylonitrile \n183,100 lbs.\nMethyl chloride \n175,000 lbs\nMethylamine \n78,000 lbs.\nOleum \n210,00"

The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures.\nTo evaluate the worst case scenarios, we have used the look-up tables and equations provided by the EPA in the RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance as well as Equations from Appendix D of the EPA's Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance and PHAST 5.11 computer aided modeling program.  For alternative release scenario analyses, we have employed the look-up tables and equations provided by the EPA in the RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance as well as PHAST 5.11 computer aided modeling program.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nPassive mitigation systems where applicable were taken into consideration when modeling each worst and alternate case toxic and flammable scenario.  Mitigation systems in place at each covered process are outlined in the program prevention elements section of the remainder of this RMP submittal.\n\nEffect populations are described in the data elements portion of this RMP submission.  These populations are overstated in relationship to the potential release distance calculated from the individual covered process to the fenceline of Midland Operations.   \n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 3 toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from a chlorine railcar.  The scenario involves the release of 175000 lbs. of Chlorine in a gaseous form over 10 minutes.

The scenario involves the release of 15,000 lbs. of Sulfur dioxide (anhydrous) in a gaseous form over 10 minutes.  Passive mitigation controls such as dikes are taken into account to calculate the scenario.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.0078 mg/L of Sulfur dioxide (anhydrous) is 2.57 miles.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for all Program 3 flammable substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from 1,3-Butadiene Sphere.  The scenario involves the release of 1,502,530 lbs. of 1,3-Butadiene. It is assumed that the entire quantity is released as a vapor, which finds an ignition source, with 10 percent of the released quantity participating in a vapor cloud explosion.  Under worst case weather conditions, the maximum distance of 1.1 miles is obtained corresponding to an endpoint of 1 psi overpressure.  \n\nThe alternative release scenario submitted for all Program 3 flammable substances involves a release from a Vinyl Chloride railcar.  The release is assumed to result in a Vapor Cloud Explosion.  The scenario involves the release of 16,150 lbs. of Vinyl chloride  [Ethene, chloro-] in 10 minutes.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the flammable endpoint of 1 PSI overpressure is 0.06 miles.\n\n\n\n\n\n4.    The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.

The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nDow Chemical Michigan Operations maintains detailed records of safety information that among other things describe the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all covered processes.  Numerous types of information are available to supplement safety information.  Some of these would include, Material Safety Data Sheets for materials used on site, equipment and engineering design specifications and applicable reactive chemicals testing.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  For initial screening and risk evaluation the Dow Chemical Fire and Explosion Index, The Dow Chemical, Chemical Exposure Index and a Reactive Chemical and Process Hazard Analysis are conducted.  These listed methodologies are supplemented when needed with analyses that may include some of the following: What if Analysis, Hazard and Operability Study (HAZOP), Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA), and Fault Tree Analysis.  A team of qualified personnel undertakes the studies with expertise in engineering and process operations.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Dow Chemical Michigan Operations maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessibl"
