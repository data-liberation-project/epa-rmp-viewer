All operators of systems containing the threshold amount of hazardous chemicals will undergo Chemical Process Safety Management training and operator training specific to the system.\r\n\r\nTo insure proper response to emergency situations, Tyson Foods CONCORDIA, MO., has implemented Emergency Action Plans as required by The Occupational Safety and Health Administrations 29 CFR 1910.38(a).  All safety personnel and operators of the process will be trained in these emergency procedures.\r\n\r\nEmergency contact information from section 1.8 is expanded here to include the following call-list in descending order:\r\n     (1) Terry Wodrich, Plant Manager: (660) 463-3401\r\n     (2) Chad Smith, Plant Safety Manager: (660) 463-3405\r\n     (3) Neal Hinck, Plant Engineer: (660) 463-3422\r\n     (4) Security Building if none of the above are immediately available: (660) 463-7122\r\n     (5) Nathan Moore, Process Safety Manager: 660-463-3431\r\n\r\n2.

Worst-Case Scenario  \r\n\r\nThe Tyson Retail Deli facility has an ammonia high pressure receiver (HPR) as the single largest ammonia vessel.  The liquid-full capacity, 100%, of the high pressure receiver is 471 cubic feet.  Using the ammonia temperature of 95oF yields an approximate operating pressure of 181 psig and an ammonia liquid density of 36.71 pounds per cubic foot.  The calculation of 471 cubic feet multiplied by the liquid density yields an ammonia capacity of 17,306 pounds.  Using ALOHA Comp with the settings of ammonia liquefied"

      "SummaryText": "under pressure, rural topography and no passive mitigation the distance to endpoint is 1.7 miles.\r\n\r\nAlternative Release Scenario  \r\n\r\nTyson Foods has considered: 1) transfer hose releases, 2) Process piping releases from flanges, joints, welds, valves, valve seals, and drains, 3) process vessel and pump releases, 4) vessel over pressurization and venting through relief valves.  Based on the facilityA\u00bfs experience with the ammonia process and judgment of likely scenarios, the alternative release scenario of a pressure relief valve activation has been chosen.  Pressure relief valve activations historically have been the primary release type within the company based on reports to Tyson Environmental Health and Safety department.  The scenario chosen for the Concordia location was based on a typical relief valve installed on an evaporative condenser.  Pressure relief valves on evaporative condensers at Concordia are Hansen H5602R SRVs with 250 psig set point, capacity 17.0 lb*air/min.  Based on high-side high-pressure shutdown safety at the facility it is considered that typical release duration for the SRV would not be longer than 10 minutes.  The chosen release duration of 10 minutes in a rural setting yields a distance to endpoint of 0.38 miles which exceeds the property boundary at Tyson's Concordia facility.\r\n\r\n4.  The general accidental release prevention program.\r\n     \r\n This facility complies with the Occupational Safety and Health Administrations Chemical Process Safety Management 29 CFR 1910.119 and the Environmental Protection Agencies Risk Management Program 40 CFR Part 68.  For ammonia systems Tyson Foods, Inc. has adopted the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration guidelines for system operation and maintenance.  Tyson Foods Inc. uses the IIAR Basic Ammonia Refrigeration Training Series for all operators augmented by Tyson Standards and Specifications for design, construction and maintenance of refrigeration systems.\r\n \r\n5.

The emergency response program.\r\n\r\nA written Action Plan has been developed and is on record at the Facility.  This plan includes Pre-Emergency Planning with Outside Agencies, Personnel Roles and Lines of Incident Command Authority, Facility Hazard Analysis and Emergency Prevention, Safe Distances and Places of Refuge, Site Security and Control, Evacuation Routes and Procedures, Decontamination Procedures using fixed systems at the plant, provisions for Emergency Medical Treatment, Emergency Notification Procedures, Post Incident Critique, and Personal Protective Clothing.    Tyson employees will not respond to emergency incidents involving ammonia above immediately dangerous to life and health concentrations (IDLH) due to limitations in training and equipment maintained on-site.  The facility relies on defensive action support from the local Fire Department who would assist with evacuations and vapor suppression if necessary.  If deemed necessary, the local fire department would make contact with the State Emergency Management Agency to request Regional Hazardous Materials Team support for a Technician Level hazardous materials response.  The first resources likely to respond under the regional program would be the Kansas City Fire Department Hazardous Materials Team.  Statewide protocols are in place to request this resource if needed and no specific agreements are necessary between Tyson Foods or the emergency services entities involved.  Training and Drills are routinely planned with local emergency responders.\r\n\r\nAll Team members are trained in Hazard Communication to report any observed chemical leaks/spills and odors to their supervisor or a member of management immediately.  Supervisors are taught to report the above to the Safety or Maintenance department immediately for further investigation and action by the Refrigeration Team.
