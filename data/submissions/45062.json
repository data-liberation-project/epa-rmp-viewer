To assist with ongoing compliance, a \"Chemical Accident Prevention Compliance Manual\" has been prepared and implemented.  Concerning the emergency response policy at the facility, the owner has made the decision that employees will not respond to accidental releases of regulated substances and will instead evacuate.\n\n40 CFR 68.155(b)  The stationary source and regulated substances handled \n\nThis facility processes natural gas, natural gas liquids (NGL), and oil from various field wells.  High pressure gas from the wells is sent to a high pressure separator with the gas being routed to a glycol contact tower for drying and is then routed to the inlet of the gas plant.  The gas plant strips out NGL liquids which are stored in one 10,000 gallon pressurized bullet tank operating at approximately 200 psig.  The NGL is removed from the facility by transfers to tank trucks.  Liquids from the high pressure separator are routed to lower pressure separation vessels and the oil product is stored at another facility in atmospheric storage tanks and removed from the site via transfers to tank trucks.  The facility is subject to the RMP requirements since it is a natural gas processing plant producing NGL and contains threshold quantities of regulated substances as indicated in below:\n\nRegulated substance: Butane, 52,000 lbs. on site. Threshold quantity is 10,000 lbs.\nRegualted substance: Ethane, 37,000 lbs. on site. Threshold quantity is 10,000 lbs.\nRegulated substance: Methane, 17,000 lbs. on site. Threshold quantity is 10,0"

      "SummaryText": "00 lbs.\nRegulated substance: Propane, 46,000 lbs. on site. Threshold quantity is 10,000 lbs.\nRegulated substance: IsoButane, 52,000 lbs. on site. Threshold quantity is 10,000 lbs.\nOn site lbs = (total gallons) x (lbs/gallon)\nNGL lbs = 10,000 x 5.2 = 52,000 lbs (based on density of butane)\n\nThe NGL product is a mixture of hydrocarbons consisting of methane, ethane, butane, isobutane, and propane.  For purposes of determining the largest weight on site, the highest density substance was used (butane for NGL).\n\n40 CFR 68.155(c)  The general accidental release prevention program and chemical specific prevention steps \n\nSince this facility is a Program 2, a documented prevention program is required.  This program is discussed in a \"Chemical Accident Prevention Compliance Manual\" prepared for the facility.  The prevention program does discuss NGL which has the specific chemicals contained in an amount above the threshold quantity.   \n\n40 CFR 68.155(d)  The five year accident history \n\nAs documented in Section 4.0 of this plan, the facility has not experienced a release as defined in the regulation within the past five years.  \n\n40 CFR 68.155(e)  The emergency response program \n\nSince this facility is a Program 2, a written emergency response program is required.  This program is contained in Section 5.0 of the \"Chemical Accident Prevention Compliance Manual\" prepared for the facility.  Further, emergency response procedures have been developed and are contained at the front of this RMP and these procedures will be implemented in the event of an accidental release or the threat of such a release.  Basically, the instructions are to evacuate the facility and then notify the proper authorities.\n\n40 CFR 68.155(f)  Planned changes to improve safety \n\nAt present time, there are no planned changes to improve safety."
