      "SummaryText": "Alto Dairy Cooperative is a dairy product manufacturer located in the Town of Alto, Fond du Lac County, Wisconsin.  As a cooperative, it is owned by area milk producers.  The facility produces cheese and powdered whey from milk purchased from area farmers.\n\nThe processing of these dairy products requires the use of anhydrous ammonia and other chemicals.  Milk that arrives at the facility, as well as the products produced at the facility must be kept at refrigerated temperatures to maintain quality and shelf-life.  As a result of this need for chilling processes and refrigerated storage areas, Alto Dairy utilizes an ammonia refrigeration system.  The system contains approximately 12,950 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.  \n\nAmmonia, although a necessary component of Alto Dairy's processing, can be dangerous to employees, the public in the immediate vicinity of the plant, and the environment if released in an uncontrolled manner is substantial quantities.  Alto Dairy has recongnized the inherent risks with ammonia and has therefore developed and implemented a Risk Management Program to:\n\n-prevent accidental releases of ammonia; and\n-respond appropriately to accidental releases, if any, of ammonia.\n\nAlto Dairy's Prevention Program for ammonia consists of the following elements:\n\n1)  Safety information for ammonia has been gathered and evaluated to assit Alto Dairy employees in understanding the hazards associated with the process.  This information then formed a basis for other prevention program elements to minimize the potential of accidental releases.\n2)  A hazard evaluation was completed for ammonia.  The purpose of the analysis was to identify, evaluate, and control the hazards in the process.\n3)  Written operating procedures were carefully developed so that employees at Alto Dairy have access to written instructions for the safe operation of and maintenance of the ammonia process.\n4)  Employees at Alto Dairy have been trained, and will continue to be trained, on the jo"

These scenarios were determined by using the EPA's Off-site Consequence Anaysis Guidance document.\n\nAlto Dairy has not had an accident with ammonia in the last five years that requires reporting under this rule.\n\nAlto Dairy has demonstrated their commitment to minimize the potential for accidental releases and thus protect their employees, neighbors, and the surrounding environment in the following manner:\n\n-Committing significant resources to the training of operation, maintenance, and emergency response personnel;\n-Hiring external consultants to provide a high level of program competence;\n-Dedicating themselves to the continuous improvement of the prevention program at Alto Dairy to futher minimize the potential for accidents.\n\nMembers of the public are encouraged to talk to Alto Dairy about Alto Dairy's Chemical Accident Prevention Program.
