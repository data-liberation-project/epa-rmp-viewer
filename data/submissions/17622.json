As part of that commitment, Mead Ohio Operations has established management systems to maximize the safety of operating processes at this facility.  One component of this design is a risk management plan (RMP) that guides the safe handling, storage, and usage of regulated hazardous substances at Mead and complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) regulation 40 CFR part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule).  \n\nOne of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit a risk management plan (RMPlan) describing the risk management program at Mead Ohio.  This document is intended to satisfy the RMPlan requirement of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program at Mead Ohio.\n\nThe risk management program at Mead Ohio consists of three elements:\n\n1) Hazard assessments to analyze and understand (a) the potential for offsite consequences of hypothetical accidental releases and (b) accident and incident investigations that have occurred involving substances regulated by the RMP rule (regulated substances) - see topics 1.3 and 1.5.\n\n2) Prevention programs to help maintain and safely operate those processes containing more than a threshold quantity of a regulated substance - see topic 1.4.\n\n3) Emergency planning for public notification and response should an accidental release of a regulated substance from covered processes ever occur - see topic 1.6.\n\nInformation further describing these elements is provided in this RMPlan.\n\nMead Ohio's risk management planning is designed to assure that the facility is maintained and operated in a safe manner.  However, it is only one component of the facilities' safety program.  In fact, Mead Ohio has a comprehensive safety program in place, which directs many levels"

However, this RMPlan is limited to address those elements of the safety program at Mead Ohio that are required by the RMP Rule.\n\nMead Ohio limits the use of hazardous substances.  \nBefore using a hazardous substance at Mead, less hazardous alternatives are considered.   When a hazardous substance must be used, Mead thoroughly reviews the potential for this substance to adversely affect employees, the public, and the environment and manages its processes to prevent such effects.\n\n\nMead Ohio prevents releases of the hazardous substances used at the facility. \nMead is committed to the safety of employees, the public, the preservation of the environment, and  the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances.  When a hazardous substance is used at Mead Ohio, the equipment is carefully designed, built and operated to reduce the likelihood of an accidental release.  In conjunction with best engineering practices, government and industry standards are closely adhered to in the design, construction, and operation of the equipment. \n\nChemical-specific prevention steps \nMead follows industry standards (e.g., Department of Transportation [DOT], National Fire Protection Association [NFPA], The Chlorine Institute, and manufacturers' guidelines) to maximize the safe handling, storage and usage of all hazardous materials.  For the Chlorine Dioxide and Chlorine processes, Process Hazard Analyses (PHAs) are conducted in accordance with the requirements specified by OSHA's Process Safety Management Standard.\n\nMead Ohio implements reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous substances.

In the event of a significant accidental release, Mead Ohio maintains a trained and certified hazardous chemical emergency response program, would evacuate employees and contact local emergency response agencies (LEPC) as necessary to control, contain, and prevent/reduce the consequences of the release.  Mead Ohio and local emergency response agencies (through the Chillicothe City Fire Department) have established a process to alert the community in the event an offsite consequence exists.\n\nMead Ohio Operations and Regulated Substances\nMead Ohio is an integrated paper products company primarily involved in the manufacture of pulp and paper from both hard and softwoods. Mead Ohio handles two regulated toxic (no flammable) substances in sufficient quantities to be covered by the RMP rule.\n\nAs part of the manufacturing process at this facility, Chlorine Dioxide is used as a stock bleaching agent in the Pulp Mill, and Chlorine is used as a water treatment biocide at Chilpaco.  Both of these substances are inventoried at quantities above the EPA threshold limit and are regulated by the RMP rule.  Both of these systems are regulated and compliance managed in accordance with OSHA's Process Safety Management Standard.  As such they are designated as Program Level 3 processes for RMP rule compliance purposes.\n\nRegulated Process                Program Level               Substance                                 Quantity\nChlorine Dioxide Storage                3                       Chlorine Dioxide                            18,000 lb\nWater Treatment Chlorine              3                           Chlorine                                     16,000 lb\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis\nMead Ohio has performed offsite consequence analyses to estimate the potential for an accidental release of a regulated substance to affect the public or the environment.

The alternative release scenarios were selected to aid local emergency planning committee in improving the community emergency response plan.  An alternative release scenario represents a release that (1) might occur at a facility like Mead and (2) would result in the greatest potential offsite consequences if the release occurred.\n\nThe primary objective of performing the offsite consequence analysis is to determine the distance at which certain effects might occur to the public because of an accidental release (called the endpoint distance).  When considering the release of a toxic substance, it is expected that people at the endpoint distance would experience little or no exposure, with no long-term health consequences. However, the potential for some short-term consequences (e.g., strong eye irritation, or throat irritation), while not likely, does exist.  Some people who are particularly susceptible to the substance released could be incapacitated.\n \nThe RMP rule includes specific requirements for the worst-case and alternative release scenarios that must be reported by Mead Ohio.  These requirements are:\n\n- one worst-case release scenario for the class of toxic substances in Program 3 processes (i.e., one scenario representing both Chlorine and Chlorine Dioxide)\n- one alternative release scenario for each of the toxic substances in a Program 3 process (i.e., Chlorine and Chlorine Dioxide)\nThe following information summarizes the offsite consequence analysis performed by Mead.\n\nProgram 3 Processes - Toxic Substances\nThe worst-case release scenario for the two toxic chemicals on site would be a rupture at the bottom of the 224,000 gallon Chlorine Dioxide storage tank full of solution (1 wt%), resulting in a Chlorine Dioxide/Chlorine vapor cloud release.  This scenario assumes that all safety devices fail.  Also, no administrative controls or passive mitigation were considered for this r"

Public and environmental receptors are located within the endpoint distance from the Chlorine Dioxide storage tank. The U.S. Census indicates that 70,000 people live within this distance from the storage tank; several public receptors are also located within this distance (e.g., shops, schools, churches, residences, hospitals, parks, etc.) \n\nA more likely alternate release scenario for Chlorine Dioxide could occur during start-up, if the Chlorine Dioxide Heater drain valve was inadvertantly left open following a process maintenance shutdown. This model conservatively allows twenty minutes once vapors are detected by local gas monitors and activate alarms, for operations personnel to locate and assess the problem, suit up and close the valve. However, in all likelihood a situation of this type would result in a more timely remote shutdown of the process (and the leak flow).  Again, the released chlorine dioxide solution would form an evaporative pool with Chlorine Dioxide and Chlorine released as a vapor cloud.  The ALOHA modeled distance to the 0.0028 mg/l toxic endpoint is one mile.  The U.S. Census indicates that 1700 people live within this distance.  Several public receptors are also located within this distance (e.g., part of a residential subdivision, the Mead park and ball fields).  There are no environmental receptors within this distance.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for Chlorine is that a 5/16\" gas valve on a full 1-ton chlorine cylinder is left partially open (or leaks through) a 0.10 inch diameter opening, allowing Chlorine gas to escape to the atmosphere.  This scenario assumes that it would require as much as 30 minutes after Chlorine gas monitors in the area detect the leak, for emergency response personnel to suit up, enter the area, and shut the valve or plug the leak.

The accident prevention programs in place at Mead Ohio include:\n\nProgram 3 Prevention Program.\nSince 1963, Mead Ohio has used a prevention program to help prevent accidental releases of hazardous substances.  Beginning in 1992, Mead formalized this prevention program for the Water Treatment/Chlorine and Chlorine Dioxide Generation and Storage processes to comply with the 14 elements of the OSHA process safety management (PSM) prevention program.  In 1996, in accordance with the EPA RMP rule, two Program 3 proccesses were identified.  RMP requirements for these systems are essentially the same as OSHA PSM, except that the program also focuses on protecting the public and the environment. The following sections briefly describe the elements of Mead's prevention program that address the RMP rule prevention program and ERP requirements.\n\nMead Ohio's Prevention Program for the RMP Program 3  Water Treatment/Chlorine and the Chlorine Dioxide Generation and Storage processes consists of the following 12 elements:\n\nProcess Safety Information\nMead Ohio maintains a variety of technical documents (e.g., MSDSs, PSM Process Safety information manuals, etc.) that support the safe operation of its processes.

Operating parameters are included in the standard operating procedures to enhance the safe operation of the process.  These documents are used in (1) employee training, (2) performing process hazard analyses, and (3) the monitoring and maintainence of equipment. \n\nMaterial safety data sheets (MSDS) document the physical properties of hazardous substances handled at Mead, including regulated substances in covered processes.

The operating procedures (1) are used to train employees and (2) serve as reference guides for appropriate actions to take during both normal operations and process upsets. Operating procedures include:\n\nTraining.  \nMead Ohio provides basic chemical specific HAZCOM training for all employees.  Mead trains employees to safely and effectively perform their assigned tasks.  For current hazardous process operations personnel, Mead training programs include both initial and refresher training that cover; (1) general overview of the process (2) the properties and hazards of the substances in the process, and (3) a detailed review of the process operating procedures and safe work practices.

The following paragraphs describe some of these safety features.\n\nChlorine Dioxide - To avoid the necessity of transporting large quantities of a hazardous material, Mead Ohio produces Chlorine Dioxide at the facility and stores it as a dilute aqueous solution.  Chlorine Dioxide is generated on-site using the R8 process in the Chlorine Dioxide generator and piped to an absorber column, where a 1wt% Chlorine Dioxide solution is generated. A diked area around the storage tank further reduces the consequences of a release.\n\nChlorine - Supplied in 1-ton DOT-approved cylinders, Chlorine gas is pulled by vacuum through a regulator directly attached to the cylinder. The vacuum regulator at the cylinder acts as an immediate safety shut-off valve in the event vacuum is lost anywhere downstream of the cylinder.  From the regulator, tubing and a piping manifold carry gas to multiple vacuum eductor/mixer stations.  At the chlorinator stations, Chlorine is absorbed into process water for use as a dilute liquid oxidizing biocide solution at various pulp stock chests and paper machine locations. If a leak downstream of the cylinder, large enough to break the system vacuum, should occur at any point in the lines feeding the multiple eductors, the regulator valve at the cylinder is designed to automatically shut off all gas flow. Only the quantity of gas between the vacuum regulator and the leak will be released (0.4 pounds maximum).  The quantity of gas remaining in the system between the leak and the chlorinat"

The cylinders, valves, regulators, carbon steel piping and polyethylene tubing are visiually inspected at least every four hours as part of the day-lab technician's routine round. The tubing lengths from the cylinders to the manifold are replaced on a preventive maintenance routine schedule (even if their condition is still operable).\n\nFive-Year Accident History\nThere has been only one accidental release in the past five years that resulted in two recordable toxic vapor exposure injuries. This incident occurred on May 19,1997,when Pulp Mill maintenance personnel responded to a bleach plant flange leaking dilute Chlorine Dioxide solution, without proper respiratory protection. No serious injuries resulted.  The recordable status of the injuries was invoked when, as a precautionary measure, the two maintenance employees were taken to the plant hospital and received follow-up observation for minor respiratory irritation.  The release caused no other significant onsite or offsite effects. An incident investigation team was assembled and the team followed the incident investigation protocol.  The team suggested several improvements (including re-training of the affected employees) to the Chlorine Dioxide Respiratory Protection Program that were evaluated and, where appropriate, implemented. \n\nEmergency Response Programs\nMead coordinates emergency response procedures with the local fire department.
