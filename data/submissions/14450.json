Recognizing these risks, the Hull Terminal has an established environmental, health, and safety management system to:  \n\n7 Effectively manage our process operations;\n7 Invest in the latest process safety technologies;\n7 Educate and provide ongoing training for our people;\n7 Review our processes for hazards on a continuous basis;\n7 Ensure safety and the environment are considered in process design, installation, operations and maintenance; and\n7 Train and maintain a highly efficient Emergency Response Organization.\n\nBy effectively managing the procedures, technology, and personnel interfaces that produce excellence in our operations, we minimize risks and thus effectively manage and minimize the impact of process related incidents.\n\nThe Mobil Oil Corporation, Hull Terminal has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety.  This is evidenced by:\n\n7 Our history of support and commitment to the community;\n7 Our high environmental standards; and \n7 Our recognition and certification as a STAR facility in the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) Voluntary Protection Program (VPP).\n\nWe are proud of our Safety and Environmental Programs and continue to strive to be among the best in industry.\n\n\n2.\tDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe Mobil Oil Corporation, Hull Terminal, located in Hull, Texas, transports and stores petroleum products produced by Mobil's petroleum refining and chemical business in Beaumont Texas.  These processes contain regulated flammable substances and flammable mixtures, which may include: ethane, propane, propylene, isobutane, butane, and natural gas liquids (NGL).

      "SummaryText": "listed toxic chemicals in threshold quantities.\n\n \n3.\tHazard Assessment Results\n\nThe Risk Management Program (RMP) rule requires companies to develop chemical release scenarios that estimate the potential community impact from an accidental release.  These scenarios are useful for emergency planning in the event of an accident.  There are two types of scenarios required by the EPA.  The worst-case scenario (WCS) is the release of the largest quantity of a regulated substance.  It assumes the worst-case meteorological conditions that would allow the release to have the greatest distance of impact.  The alternative release scenario (ARS) allows industries to develop a more realistic emergency planning scenario.\n\nThe WCS for flammable substances at the Hull Terminal is the release of propane.  The ARS for flammable substances is the release of propane from a loading hose failure.  Our prevention programs described in section one and five mitigate offsite impact. \n\n\n4.\tFive Year Accident History\n\nThe Mobil Oil Corporation, Hull Terminal has had no accidental releases of regulated toxic or flammable substances from covered processes within the last five (5) years that have resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage. \n\n\n5.\tGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nTo ensure that our Risk Management Program is effectively implemented and managed, the Refinery Manager has assigned the role of RMP Coordinator to the EHS Manager.  The RMP Coordinator, acting with the authority delegated directly from the Refinery Manager, has the necessary training, experience, and resources to coordinate implementation of our Risk Management Program.\n\n \nThe Hull Terminal has developed programs to comply with the industry's most stringent environmental, health, and safety standards.  Mobil Oil Corporation, Hull Terminal received the OSHA Voluntary Protection"

Much effort has also been devoted to environmental programs such as waste reduction and emissions minimization.\n\nWe take a systematic, proactive approach to preventing accidental releases of hazardous chemicals.  Our process management systems address each of the essential elements of successful accident prevention programs including:\n\n- Process safety information \t\t- Pre-startup review\n- Process hazard analysis \t\t\t- Compliance audits\n- Operating procedures\t\t\t- Incident investigation\n- Training\t\t\t\t\t- Employee participation\n- Mechanical integrity\t\t\t- Hot work permit system\n- Management of change \t\t\t- Contractor safety\n\nOur risk management program uses these individual elements to prevent accidental chemical releases.  \n\nIn addition to our industry leading management programs, we have designed state-of-the-art systems and equipment to control, prevent, detect, and mitigate potential accidental releases. \n\nWe employ extensive mechanical integrity and preventive maintenance programs to ensure sound equipment.  Our mechanical integrity program uses equipment surveillance and preventive maintenance activities to identify equipment that may be deteriorating and in need of repair or replacement, before failure occurs.  This program also specifies the repairs (or parts replacement) needed to return equipment to acceptable specifications.\n\n \nWe train our employees to safely perform their assigned tasks.  Our training program includes initial training as well as periodic refresher training and training updates when major process or equipment changes are made.  As part of our training, we include provisions for ensuring that employees understand the training, including writ"

While the purpose of the other elements of the Risk Management and Process Safety Management Programs serve to prevent incidents and releases of highly hazardous material, the Emergency Response Plan provides the guidelines for reacting to accidental releases and other emergencies if and when they do occur.\n\nThe Hull Terminal has a trained emergency response organization and appropriate emergency equipment.  Emergency drills and exercises are conducted and periodically coordinated with the Volunteer Fire Department and EMS, Sheriff's Department, Governmental Agencies (Texas Railroad Commission, LEPC) local hospitals, and the news media.  Emergency drills, self-inspections, and insurance inspection results provide a continual improvement process to keep plans current and equipment prepared.\n\n\n7.\tPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nAt the Hull Terminal, we are committed to ensuring a safe and healthy environment for our employees, contractors, and the public.  We plan to maintain the level of commitment and improvement to our environmental, health and safety programs consistent with our past EHS performance by continually improving through sharing best practices."
