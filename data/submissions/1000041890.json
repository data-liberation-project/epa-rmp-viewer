The containers in the two feed banks are equipped with Halogen Systems valve actuators that automatically close the ton-container feed valve when a chlorine concentration of 10 ppm is detected in the room. The spare ton-containers are not equipped with these actuators, as these containers are not connected to the process.\r\n\r\nLiquid chlorine is normally withdrawn from one bank of ton-containers to a piping header that leads to evaporators. The gas discharge piping from the evaporators supply pressurized chlorine gas to vacuum regulating valves (evaporator actuated vacuum regulating valve with check-relief unit) that reduce the pressure to a vacuum.  Vacuum piping continues to the chlorinators.  A gas header from the second bank of ton-containers serves as a backup supply and automatically takes over when the evaporator is shut off due to a low temperature condition. This header is also equipped with vacuum regulating valves (standby vacuum regulating valve with check-relief unit) that reduce the pressure to a vacuum before it reaches the chlorinators. The chlorinators regulate the flow of chlorine. From here, gas is pulled by vacuum to injectors located in remote cabinets on top of the diffuser vaults. It is important to note that in case of loss of vacuum downstream of the vacuum regulating valve with check-relief unit, air would be drawn in rather than chlorine being released and the vacuum regulating valve with check-relief unit will shut down the chlorine supply to the chlorinator, operating as a shut-off valve.\r\n\r\nChlorine leak detectors are provided to detect chlorine leaks in the chlorine room and the chlorinator room,  which alarm locally as well as at the LAAFP's Control Room.

Chlorination is considered to be the most important process for preventing the spread of waterborne disease in drinking water.  The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (LADWP) also uses chlorine for drinking water disinfection purposes to protect public health per state and federal water quality standards. Storing and handling large quantities of chlorine can create hazardous situations. The LADWP takes safety obligations in storing and using chlorine as seriously as it takes in providing safe drinking water.  The LADWP Los Angeles Aqueduct Filtration Plant (LAAFP) facility chlorine handling processes are subject to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program and Plan and also to the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program requirements. The facilities subject to the EPA and the CalARP regulations are required to prepare and update Risk Management Plans (RMPs).  The RMP is to include policies and procedures followed to safely operate the facility and the actions, which will be taken by the facility in an event of an emergency.  \r\n\r\nThe LADWP Los Angeles Aqueduct Filtration Plant facility complex now consists of four different chlorination stations and one chemical depot: (1) the LAAFP facility; (2)  the Los Angeles Reservoir Outlet Chlorination Station (LAROCS); (3) the Van Norman Chemical Depot (VNCD); (4) the Van Norman Chloramination Station # 1 (VNCS#1); and (5) the Van Norman Chloramination Station #2 (VNCS#2).

Additional details of the five processes are provided below.\r\n\r\nThe Los Angeles Aqueduct Filtration Plant\r\nLiquid chlorine is supplied to the Los Angeles Aqueduct Filtration Plant in 90-ton railcars with a backup of one-ton containers for the chlorination process.  Liquid or gaseous chlorine is withdrawn from the railcars. Midland valve actuators are connected to both the liquid and gas connections on the railcars.  The Midland valve actuators will close on the railcar and stop the flow of chlorine when 10 ppm of chlorine is detected in the area.  The Midland valve actuators can also be manually triggered from the following three locations: (1) Rail Car Platform (2) Chlorinator room, and (3) Control Room. In addition to the Midland actuators, there are three Jamesbury actuators on the hard piping to the flex hoses. The detection of 10 ppm of chlorine will automatically close the ball valves connecting the hard piping to the flex hoses, stopping the possible backflow of chlorine, in case a crack developed in the flex hose. \r\nLiquid chlorine travels under pressure to evaporator units, while gaseous chlorine can be withdrawn directly to the chlorinators.  The evaporators vaporize the liquid in a water bath to form a superheated gas which passes through a pressure reducing valve and a evaporator activated vacuum regulating valve with check-relief unit, and then to the chlorinators.  Chlorine gas from the vacuum regulating valve is pulled by vacuum to the chlorinators. The chlorinators regulate the gas flow and discharge it to the injection lines at the appropriate rate.  Chlorine gas from the chlorinators is pulled by vacuum to injectors located on the downstream piping at various chlorine application points.  It is important to note that in case of loss of vacuum downstream of the vacuum regulating valve with check-relief unit, air would be drawn in rather than chlorine being released and the vacuum regulating valve with check-r"

The LADWP prepared Program Level 3 RMPs because the LAAFP processes are subject to Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations. This 2014 RMP is an update of the RMPs submitted in June 2009 and December 2011, and includes updated information for all the five LAAFP processes.

The LADWP has prepared an Emergency Response Plan to facilitate coordination and emergency planning with offsite response officials and facilities in the event of an emergency.  The emergency response plan has been coordinated with the local response agency (City of Los Angeles Fire Department).  The LAAFP facilities have an excellent record in preventing accidents from occurring.\r\n\r\nGeneral Facility and Regulated Substance Information\r\nThe five LAAFP processes are located in the same complex adjacent to the Los Angeles Reservoir in Sylmar, California.  The Los Angeles Aqueduct Filtration Plant treats up to 600 million gallons per day of water from the Los Angeles Owens River Aqueduct or from the Metropolitan Water District. Liquid chlorine is delivered to the plant in 90-ton railcars or by truck in one-ton containers. The 90-ton railcar is the largest vessel (container) online. \r\n\r\nThe Los Angeles Reservoir Outlet Chlorination Station serves to chlorinate water in a single 120 diameter pipeline exiting the reservoir.  The treated water is then piped into the distribution network which serves much of the San Fernando Valley with potable water and feeds other reservoirs.  It also chlorinates the outlet flow from the Van Norman Bypass Reservoir and another pipeline called the Rinaldi Trunk Line.  This station stores chlorine in a 25-ton bulk storage tank; it can also store one-ton chlorine containers to be used when the bulk tank is taken out of service for maintenance or repair. The 25-ton bulk tank is the largest vessel (container) online. \r\n\r\nThe Van Norman Chloramination Station #1 is used to establish a chloramine residual in the treated water. The chlorine storage system consists of two banks of one-ton containers plus additional spare ton-containers. The one-ton container is the largest vessel (container) on-site. Each of the containers in the two feed banks are equipped with Halogen Syst"

It also exceeds the specified threshold quantity of the federal and California Occupational Safety and Health Administration (CalOSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard.
