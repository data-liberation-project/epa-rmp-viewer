      "SummaryText": "Policy Statement\n\n\n\nIt is the George C. Marshall Space Flight Center's (MSFC) and National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA) policy to conduct operations involving toxic and flammable substances safely, reducing to the greatest extent possible any hazards associated with the processes; and reducing any subsequent risk to the surrounding community, personnel, and the environment.  The policy includes working with the surrounding community and local emergency response agencies to promote a spirit of cooperation and teamwork, and to orchestrate an effective contingency plan in the unlikely event of a process incident occurring at MSFC.\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription of Facility and Regulated Substance Handled\n\n\n\nMSFC is one of the largest and most complex of NASA's nine centers.  MSFC is NASA's principal propulsion development center and plays a major role in the National Space Transportation System, managing the Space Launch System's main engines and solid rocket boosters. In addition, MSFC will be a significant contributor to several of NASA's future programs, including the development of advanced propulsion systems and planetary observatories and research on a variety of space science applications.  \n\nLiquid hydrogen, which is flammable, is stored at MSFC in quantities greater than the threshold quantities and used in rocket engine testing and research activities. No other toxic or flammable substances stored at MSFC exceed the RMP TQs.  \n\n\n\n\n\nProgram 1 Substance\n\n\n\nLiquid hydrogen is subject to Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standards however the processes outlined in this Risk Management Plan are eligible for Program 1. MSFC has a number of test and storage facilities, which have the capability of storing quantities of hydrogen above the 10,000 pound TQ. The maximum quantity of liquid hydrogen that can be stored at the facility is 338,745 pounds. The liquid hydrogen storage details for this test are as follows:\n\n"

One storage tank with a capacity of 100,000 gallons (59,000 pounds) \n\n\n\nThe process using hydrogen in excess of the threshold quantity involves a testing procedure in which an article will be filled with liquid hydrogen and subsequently burned via smokestack. The purpose of this test is to simulate the fill and drain procedure in a controlled environment. This testing procedure will be performed a maximum of five times in the East Test Area of MSFC. Following the completion of this test, MSFC will no longer conduct any processes containing flammable and/or toxic substances that exceed the given threshold quantity. \n\n\n\n\n\nSafety and Specifications\n\n\n\nThe liquid hydrogen systems consist of pressure/vacuum relief valves, bypass relief valves, excess flow valves, pressure and temperature indicators, leak detectors, alarms, manual and automatic control systems, burn stack and all necessary safeguards for the safe operation of the systems.  The liquid hydrogen storage systems and associated processes are designed and installed in accordance with NASA and industry-specific design standards.  Where applicable, the manufacturer's specifications are incorporated into the standard operating procedures (SOPs) for safe operation of the process.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFlammable Substance Worst-case and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\n\n\nWorst-case Release Scenario (WRS):\n\n\n\nThe EPA-defined worst-case scenario (40 CFR 68.25 (2)) is the failure of the largest hydrogen container in each process, resulting in a release of 59,000 pounds of hydrogen in 10 minutes.  The liquid hydrogen tank is stored in an open diked area.  Therefore, passive mitigation is not considered. Realistically, MSFC does not anticipate that the worst-case scenario could actually occur. In the event of a total rupture of the liquid hydrogen storage tank, much of the liquid hydrogen will freeze and dissipate over a period of a few hours. This worst-case scenario was conducted with the assumption that the total"

The hydrogen concentration present in the vapor cloud would not be large enough to realistically meet and/or exceed the set flammability limit. \n\n\n\nDistance to Endpoint:\n\n\n\nThe distance to 1.0 psi overpressure is estimated to be 0.4 miles, using EPA's RMP*Comp tool. The vapor cloud explosion has a calculated distance of 0.4 miles, beyond which there will not be enough overpressure to pose a hazard to the public and/or buildings. On the included graphic file, MSFC boundaries, the East Test Area, and building 4527 are shown. Both the distance to an endpoint, found using EPA's RMP*Comp tool, and the Quantity Distance Zone, calculated by NASA MSFC's Industrial Safety Department are located on the map. The distance calculated using the RMP*Comp tool, 0.4 miles, is considered a conservative estimation for this program 1 process but is used to satisfy all endpoint calculation criteria specified by the EPA. Considering the processes conditions and hydrogen concentration present, the vapor cloud formation will realistically spread a distance no greater than 1,090 ft from the tank in the event of a rupture. \n\n\n\nPublic Receptors:\n\n\n\nThe working population at MSFC affected by this hypothetical worst-case release is estimated to be less than 225 people, based on a total work force of 6,000 MSFC and contractor personnel on duty every day. No offsite residential population will be affected if the worst case scenario were to occur. Marshall Space Flight Center is located on Redstone Arsenal (RSA), access to which is restricted by guards. Further access to MSFC buildings, lots, and test areas is controlled via PIV card. This allows MSFC to identify all personnel on-site, ensuring that any public access is controlled. There is restricted and limited employee activity within the distance to an endpoint of where this program 1 process occurs, therefore the personnel normally present within this distance are not consid"
