This constitutes the general accidental release prevention program for Sacramento County WQD's operations at this facility. The program and document management procedures included in the PSM Program will be used as the management system for the Risk Management Program.\n\nCHEMICAL-SPECIFIC RELEASE PREVENTION STEPS\n\nRelease prevention steps specific to chlorine have been identified and are being implemented.  These include relocation of the chlorine leak sensor and relief vents, and installation of  seismic restraints for the ton container scales if these do not exist.  A Pre-Startup Safety Review will be conducted according to the procedures in the Process Safety Management Program document prior to admitting chlorine into the new system.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThis is a new facility just beginning operation.  There have been no accidents involving chlorine at this facility within the past five years resulting in injuries or offsite consequences.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nSacramento County WQD's Emergency Response Program applicable to chlorine has been coordinated with Sacramento County Environmental Management Department, Hazardous Materials Division, the agency responsible for hazardous materials inventory reporting and release response coordination, and with the Elk Grove Fire Department, the local agency responsible for Incident Command activities.  Sacramento County WQD maintains First Responder capability with respect to chlorine releases at sites which it operates and maintains.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nPlanned changes include extending the vacuum valve relief vents and relocating the leak sensor to a point adjacent to the neutralization scrubber intake vent, installing panic hardware on the  personnel door to the chlorine storage room, and insta"

The alternative case considered for this facility is the release of chlorine from a pinhole leak in a fusible plug of a ton container received by truck prior to offloading, with the release secured by emergency responders by applying a Chlorine Institute Type B rpair kit device after 60 minutes.\n\nADMINISTRATIVE CONTROLS\n\nAdministrative controls in effect at Sacramento County WQD which were considered to mitigate the severity of the Worst Case and Alternative Case release scenarios include Sacramento County WQD's written policies and procedures for training of operators and maintenance personnel, written procedures for control of the inventory of chlorine at the facility, and policies regarding quality level of replacement materials and components for the chlorine system.\n\nMITIGATION MEASURES\n\nNo mitigation measures were considered to limit the severity of the Worst Case scenario.  No passive mitigation measures were considered to limit the severity of the Alternative Case scenario.  Active mitigation was considered for the Alternative Case, in the form of the timely response of properly trained and equipped personnel following established emergency response procedures.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAMS\n\nGeneral accidental release prevention programs instituted by Sacramento County WQD are categorized as administrative (management) programs; procedures, training, and engineering controls; and emergency response"

Pressurized chlorine gas within a ton container is reduced to vacuum by tank-mounted vacuum regulator valves,  metered through manually-adjusted rotameters, and drawn into water solution by the passage of pressurized water through an injector.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nIt is the policy of Sacramento County WQD that the receipt, storage and handling of chlorine at its facilities be done in a manner which meets regulatory requirements and minimizes the probability and severity of accidental releases of chlorine to the atmosphere, in order to protect the health and safety of its workers, the public, and the environment.  In order to accomplish this goal, Sacramento County WQD has gathered safety information on chlorine and on the process, equipment and procedures involving chlorine; performed a structured assessment of hazards of the process and external events which might affect the process; performed an offsite consequences analysis of defined release scenarios; established a written program for prevention and mitigation of accidental releases; and established a written emergency response program coordinated with emergency response agencies.\n\nWORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\nA single worst case release scenario is required to be considered for each stationary source, resulting in the maximum distance to an endpoint for all toxic RS's contained on site above the threshold quantity.\nThe worst case release scenario for toxic chemicals is defined in the ARP regulations as the release of the contents of the largest single container of RS (in this case chlorine) over a period of 10 minutes.
