This regulation is applicable to the St. Cloud WTF because the maximum inventory of chlorine gas stored at the facility is greater than the threshold limit of 2,500-lbs.  The maximum amount of chlorine on-site at the facility is 18,000-lbs.  \n\nThe St. Cloud WTF uses chlorine to disinfect the drinking water supply to the 66,000 residents of St. Cloud and the 3,000 residents of St. Augusta. \n\nA requirement of the RMP is to complete an off-site analysis assessment if an accidental release of chlorine gas would occur.  A worst-case scenerio and an alternate-case scenario was described.  An assessment of these scenarios is documented and stored in the RMP documents.  \n\nThere have been no reportable accidents at the St. Cloud WTF in the last five years.\n\nActive administrative and mitigation control measures are utilized to prevent an accidental release.  Chlorine gas detectors are in place and checked monthly.  An audible alarm will sound if chlorine gas is detected.  An accidental release of chlorine gas would take place in an enclosed building, slowing the release rate and decreasing the distance of travel.  A chlorine scrubber at the St. Cloud WTF is an active mitigation tool in place at the facility that will neutralize a chlorine gas leak, if one would occur.\n\nThe goal of the Prevention Program is to reduce the risks associated with an accidental release of chlorine gas and prevent injury to the WTF employees and the surrounding public.  This is accomplished by specifying responsibilities and outlining safety procedures that will prevent and/or contain a chlorine gas release.\n\nThe City of St. Cloud Water Utility has developed an "

The purpose of the EAP is to ensure the safety and well being of the St. Cloud WTF employees and the surrounding public during times of emergency operations.  The plan identifies necessary administrative and employee actions that shall be taken during the event of an emergency.  The St. Cloud WTF maintains and updates the written emergency procedures annually.  \n\nElements addressed in the EAP include escape procedures and exit routes, critical plant operations, accounting for employees, rescue and medical duties, reporting emergencies, alarm systems and notification of emergencies and types of evacuations.\n\nThe Public Utilities Administration is committed to safety by providing annual employee right to know, bloodborne pathogen, lock out - tag out, emergency action plan, risk management plan and confined space entry procedure training.  Administration supports regular Hazard Control Committee Meetings and Monthly City Safety Committee Meetings and provides personal protection equipment to all employees.  The City of St. Cloud will continue to make safety a high priority and is committed to employee training and improving the current safety policies and programs.\n\n\n\n\n"
