Due to our release prevention policies, no incidents, as defined by the RMP rule, have occurred in the past five years.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\nSaputo - Levin developed an Emergency Action Plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials as well as other emergency events that might occur at the plant. The purpose of Saputo's Emergency Action Plan is to ensure employees know and understand what to do in the event of an emergency to minimize injuries and property damage. The plan includes various aspects of an emergency including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, and notification of local emergency response agencies. Saputo Cheese - Levin has a team that is trained in HAZWOPER Operations and 24-hour spill technician levels. Those trained to the spill technician level have been instructed in the use of Level C protection. Specific employees are also trained and certified as medical responders. All employees are trained in evacuation, hazard communication, and chemical safety. In addition, the plan is promptly updated to reflect pertinent changes.\n \nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\nSeveral developments and findings have resulted from the implementation of the various elements of our accidental release prevention program. Recommendations resulting from the PHA, compliance audits, seismic assessments and mechanical integrity inspections will be addressed in a timely manner. In addition, regular interaction with Saputo Corporate - Department of Refrigeration Services, Department of Environmental Affairs, Health & Safety and Risk Group will improve compliance and overall plant safety."

      "SummaryText": "RMP Executive Summary\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION & EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\nSaputo is strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program in place that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  If such a release does occur, our employees are trained to follow the Emergency Action Plan and to evacuate the facility as necessary. We are also coordinated with the Tulare County CUPA which provides additional emergency response expertise.\n\nFACILITY INFORMATION & REGULATED SUBSTANCES\nThe Saputo - Levin facility is located at 901 E. Levin Avenue Tulare, California. The plant's primary products include packaged provolone and mozzarella cheese for the wholesale and retail markets and liquid Whey processing. The facility employs approximately 215 full-time employees. There is one RMP-regulated substance, anhydrous ammonia, used in the plant's refrigeration system to provide refrigeration for processing and cold storage of dairy food products. This system contains 22,044 lbs. of anhydrous ammonia. \n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM & CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\nThe Saputo - Levin plant follows the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program as the release prevention program for the EPA RMP. In addition, Saputo Corporate - Department of Refrigeration Services works with the plant confirming regulatory and corporate standards are being followed, providing guidance and standardization on the RMP, OSHA PSM and CalARP programs and acting as a resource for the plant on the RMP, PSM, CalARP and other environmental programs.\n\nTHE FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nSaputo - Levin has had a good record of preventing accidental releases over the last"
