This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including:\n\n\n\n *  A description of our facility and use of substances regulated by EPA's RMP regulation\n\n *  An overview of our accidental release prevention programs\n\n *  A five-year accident history for accidental releases of chemicals regulated by EPA's RMP rule\n\n *  An overview of our emergency response program\n\n *  An overview of planned improvements at the facility to help prevent accidental chemical releases from occurring and adversely affecting our employees, the public, and the environment\n\n\n\nFACILITY AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n\n\nOur facility is a food distribution warehouse which uses anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant.  Perishables are kept in the cooler sections.  Frozen food items are kept in the freezer sections.  The anhydrous ammonia we use as a refrigerant is a chemical that EPA has identified as having the potential to cause offsite consequences in the event of a substantial accidental release.\n\n\n\nToxics\n\n\n\nCurrently, we have approximately 23,530 pounds of anhydrous ammonia on site in our refrigeration system.  Under most conditions, ammonia is a toxic chemical (see Flammables). \n\n\n\nFlammables\n\n\n\nAmmonia has an NFPA Fire Hazard Rating of 1 (slight).  In the presence of an ignition source, ammonia is flammable in air at concentrations between 16% and 25%.  Also, ammonia in combination with lubricating oil may be flammable at lower concentrations, depending on the amount of oil dispersed in the a"
