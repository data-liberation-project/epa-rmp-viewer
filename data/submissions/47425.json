This document consists of the executive summary and registration data elements (68.155 through 68.185).\n\n1.0\tRELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nThe Armour Eckrich Branded Meats,LLC (Armour Eckrich) facility in St. James, Minnesota has a good record in preventing releases of anhydrous* ammonia. As part of their release prevention program, the plant uses a Computerized Maintenance Management System (CMMS) to control scheduling and to accomplish preventative maintenance on all components of the refrigeration system. More information about these aspects of the prevention program is discussed in Section 4.0 of this Executive Summary.\n\nThe facility has implemented an Emergency Action Plan, which is to ensure the safety of its employees, the community, and the environment.  This detailed emergency response program includes procedures for handling an emergency - the established action plan and appropriate personnel involved in containing an ammonia release \u00bf HAZMAT Team. All of these components make the Emergency Action Plan a thorough and comprehensive plan for release prevention and emergency response.  The emergency response policies at the Armour Eckrich facility ensure that there is emergency response coverage 24 hours - 7 days per week. \n\n*From this point in the Executive Summary, anhydrous ammonia will be synonymous with ammonia.\n\n2.0\tPROCESS DESCRIPTION AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe ConAgra St. James plant produces processed meats including lunch meats. The NAICS code for the processes at this facility is 311613.   Many areas of the plant are refrigerated to preserve the meat products.  Armour Eckrich has one regulated substance under 40 CFR 68: ammonia.  Ammonia is used as a refrigerant in the refrigeration of the products in the various areas of the plant.\n\nThe ammonia threshold for triggering applicability to 40 CFR 68 is 10,000 pounds.  The tot"

      "SummaryText": "al quantity of ammonia stored in the refrigeration process is approximately 44,000 pounds.  The process exceeds the threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds as set by 40 CFR 68 and thus is regulated by the Risk Management Program.\n\n \n3.0\tWORST-CASE AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system has associated hazards that can potentially affect on-site employees and the general public off-site if there is a release from the system.  Described below are the associated hazards for the regulated chemical.  Though there may be other scenarios possible, EPA only requires that one worst-case and one alternative scenario be reported for each regulated chemical. \n\nAmmonia is classified as a Group 2 Refrigerant per ASHRAE Standard 34-1989.  The dominant characteristic of this chemical is its toxicity.  It is a self-alarming chemical by its distinctive pungent odor.  Due to this odor, persons exposed to ammonia vapor will not voluntarily stay in areas of even small concentrations.  Ammonia will burn at a very narrow and high range of concentrations accompanied with a high ignition temperature.  Although ammonia is not poisonous, it is corrosive to human tissue.  Ammonia is readily absorbed into the moisture of the skin and, at high concentrations, can cause severe burns.\n\nThe risks to persons in an accidental release of ammonia include:\n\n1.\tCorrosive attack of skin and other tissue (including lung tissue)\n2.\tFreezing of skin and other body tissue when contacted by liquid ammonia\n3.\tEye contact\n\n4.0\tGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nConAgra has developed an OSHA (PSM) program for their ammonia refrigeration system. At Armour Eckrich, ammonia falls under the RMP Program 3 Prevention Program, which is identical to the OSHA PSM program.  EPA has said that if the process is in compliance with OSHA PSM, then it is compliance with RMP Program 3.  Thus, ConAgra\u00bfs ammonia PSM system has been reviewed and the PSM syste"

The scope of preventative maintenance (PM) and testing/inspection (T/I) for refrigeration components is based on individual vendor recommendations and generally accepted engineering practices with regard to types of preventative maintenance and inspections and their recommended frequencies.  The plant has created work tasks for each type of PM and T/I associated with the refrigeration system.  These tasks are included on the individual work order generated by the CMMS.  This system ensures that each operator/mechanic is aware of the pertinent safety precautions required for a PM procedure as well as the step-by-step actions required to complete the procedure.  Results of PM and T/I procedures are documented on the individual work order.  The work order is signed off by both the operator/mechanic and their supervisor.\n\n5.0\tFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe review of Armour Eckrich\u00bfs accident history includes the following range of dates: June 21, 1999 \u00bf June 21, 2004.  According to 40 CFR Part 68.42(a), there have been no accidental releases at this facility.\n\n6.0\tEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nAs mentioned previously, the ConAgra facility has developed an emergency response program called Emergency Action Plan (EAP) to ensure the safety of its employees, the community, and the environment. \n\nArmour Eckrich\u00bfs EAP is a detailed document which discusses the role of employees and management in an emergency situation.

This document also contains an Emergency Ammonia Shutdown Procedure which gives very detailed information for shutting down the ammonia system.\n\n7.0\tPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nBased on the completed Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) for ammonia, a list of action items to improve safety was developed and the status monitored to ensure that implementation was accomplished."
