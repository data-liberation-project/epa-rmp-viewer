The approximate 17acres of land this facility sets on is equal in elevation to most of the surrounding county, Located in the country with very few neighbors or businesses in the area. This plant is manned 7 days a week by experienced supervisors and operators under the direction of our plant manager.\nA designated storage and operations area occupies the site on the west side of the facility with capacity to hold 5 one-ton cylinders. Containing 2000 pounds of chlorine each\nThe cylinders are kept in a leak-proof contained area. Chlorine is a safe and effective purification method used in the aluminum manufacturing process, however, chlorine in a gas or pressurized state has potential to be extremely hazardous if not properly handled by trained and experienced personnel.\nChlorine Gas Cylinders: A vacuum system is used to remove the chlorine from the cylinders at a controlled rate, Should the system fail, causing lack of vacuum regulators mounted directly on the system and closes to prevent any loss of chlorine into the atmosphere and is also equipped with a leak detection devise that has a set point lower than the OSHA (PEL) Limits for our industry.\nEmployees that handle chlorine at the facility receive extensive training prior to working with the chemical and are actively involved and up to date with safety practices.\nAs of June 21, 1999 the Environmental Protection Agency requires that chlorine in quantities over 2500 pounds must have a written RMP program.\nTower Metal Products RMP includes emergen"

Guidelines are in place to ensure that any hazardous chemical (HAZMAT) emergencies are handled in a manner current with 40 CFR part 68 and 29 CFR 1910.1000 regulations and facility safety practices.\nThe plan is intended to cover all chemical releases regardless of size; although a small spill or leak does not entail the same mechanism as a massive release even so it has potential to produce localized injury to personnel. \nThe intention of this plan is to ensure that all personnel approach to every HAZMAT emergency from all perspective are handled in this way, adequate precautions can be taken to minimize the degree of potential injury to employees and the general public.\nTower Metal Products has had no accidental releases or reportable injuries in the past five years from any chemical releases\nDuring a hazardous chemical emergency at the plant, a trained supervisor starts response activities, the trained supervisor will first Asses whether the release is an emergency or incidental. In house personnel trained to do so will handle incidental releases. Emergency releases will require a response by the Linn county Fire Department.\nTower Metal Products emergency response plan details response activities to train personnel and keep open lines of communication and authority between responders, Fire Department, and HAZMAT clean-up crews. The plan also describes responsibilities of trained personnel; steps of mobilization, mitigation, and types of safety equipment needed to perform clean up as described also included are methods for accidental release instructions for evacuation. It provides follow-up meetings to review problems arising from an emergency, ways to improve response time and communications in the event of a future incident.\nThis response plan will be exercised as needed so procedures can be updated as needed so procedures can be up-dated as necessary.\n\nBernard M. Streete"
