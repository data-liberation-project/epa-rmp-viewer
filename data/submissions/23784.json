This filing marks the startup of a new ammonia refrigeration plant for our produce, dairy, and frozen product categories as part of an expansion to our facility. We will take possession of this expansion in early July, 2001.\n\nWe have taken steps with our contractorand our independent safety auditor to ensure that accidental releases are minimized.  \n\n1. The refrigeration system is monitored with sensors throughout. This refrigeration system's alarms are tied into the local Brattleboro Fire Department, who has been a partner in the design of the emergency response system. The sensors are regulated to alert maintenance personnel and all on-site personnel for any release of 35 ppm to for emergency response to react and attend to any accidental release. The alarms are also activated at 75 ppm for emergency response, and will then trigger automatic high-powered ventilation of the mechanical room.\n\n2. We have contracted with New England Air Systems for initial training and startup procedures, as well as ongoing training and maintenance procedures. This long-term commitment with the contractor enables both parties to commit to the responsibility of proper maintenance and training of all who come into contact with the system. As such, accidental release in the course of maintenance should be minimized.\n\n3. Northeast Cooperatives'  Maintenance Coordinator is a twenty-year veteran of ammonia refrigeration, with all the proper respect for the substance that comes from experience. He has continued his training with several off-site workshops and classes in preparation for the installation of this system, and is scheduled to continue this education throughout his employ at Northeast Cooperatives. This is also a requirement for all maintenance assistants, who will be trained in both ammonia coolant systems in general and this ammonia system in particular. \n\n4. T"

      "SummaryText": "he Northeast Cooperatives Technology Drive facility was opened in December of 1999. This refrigeration expansion is scheduled for completion in July of 2001. As such, all of the most stringent safety codes have been applied by both local and state enforcement. The facility is totally alarmed with horn strobes audible and visible from every location inside and immediately outside the facility. \n\n5. An Evacuation Plan has been updated as of May 14, 2001 to include all of the new areas. All personnel has been advised of the properties of ammonia, and of the evacuation plan. All existing site staff has been trained in the emergency response plan, and new employees will be required to attend orientations on emergency response procedures.  All employees have signed a statement certifying their training on both evacuation procedures and the properties of anhydrous ammonia. \n\nIt is important to mention that Northeast Cooperatives is owned by both its staff and by its customers. Northeast Cooperatives is committed to being a good community citizen, not only because of its values, but also because its community is both its workforce and its customer base. It has an excellent profile in the community as a thoughtful and perspicacious corporate citizen, earned over its dozen years in Brattleboro, Vermont.\n\nNortheast Cooperatives' Tech Drive facility has a footprint of 131,040 sq. ft., 51,840 SF of which is refrigerated. Most of this refrigerated square footage will be cooled by an anhydrous ammonia system, powered by three screw compressors. 17,280 SF will be cooled to 34 degrees, 2,880 SF will be cooled to 45 degrees, 10,080 SF will be cooled to 55 degrees, 10,080 SF will be cooled to -20 degrees, and 11,520 SF on the dock will be cooled to 40 degrees. Half of this last square footage (40) and roughly a third of the low temperature area (-20) will be supplemented by the vestigial freon system which predates the ammonia plant. \n\nAs previously mentioned, this is a distribution f"

Northeast Cooperatives specializes in organic products, which necessitate a high degree of attention to safe and clean product handling to protect the limited shelf life of the products. \n\nThe quantity of anhydrous ammonia store on site is less than 13,000 pounds.  The system is heavily valved, with both manual and automatic solenoid valves at every logical juncture to minimize quantity released in the event of an accident. \n\nRMP Comp, a program provided by the EPA, was used to determine both worst-case and alternative release scenarios. In the worst-case scenario, the release was 11,675 pounds of anhydrous ammonia gas liquefied by pressure, or the largest vessel quantity, at 715 pounds/minute for ten minutes. The affected area, under a calm condition, or 1.5 meters/second at 77 degrees, would reach a toxic endpoint of 1.5 miles. This area does not include any schools or hospitals, and is relatively rural. It does include several residences, a recreational area used by boaters and fishermen, and an industrial area and a commercial strip. The passive mitigation measures include an isolated enclosure for the mechanical room, ventilated directly to the exterior, as well as pipes being pitched back towards the liquid receiver.\n\nThe alternative release scenario was that of a broken pipe, presumably precipitated by power equipment within the plant. This would release 1,991 pounds within ten minutes at a 9 pounds/minute rate. The toxic endpoint would be .8 mile. Aside from the passive mitigation systems specified above of enclosures and pipe pitching, active measures include emergency shutdown systems and sprinkler systems. We chose this scenario because forklift operator error  seemed the most likely to occur of all the choices. Of course, we will educate and reinforce training about the ammonia system to all of our staff to mitigate this scenari"

As such, it is subject to OSHA's Process Safety Management standard, (29 CFR 1910.119). The facility, as subject to 40 CFR 68 is required to submit a RMP for all processes. Northeast Cooperatives, as part of this program, has coordinated emergency response activities with local responders. \n\nThere have been no accidents, as this is a first-time submission.\n\nThe emergency response program includes the following:\n\n1. The Brattleboro Fire Department has been provided with full sets of plans, and has visited the site with all three shifts in order to familiarize themselves with the facility layout and the location of the components of the ammonia refrigeration system. \n\n2. The LEPC and the SERC have also received full sets of plans along with their Tier Two report. Northeast Cooperatives will be attending the next monthly meeting of the LEPC in early June to review any and all questions regarding both the system and the program. The SERC will be represented at that meeting, and will participate in the discussion. The Vermont Haz-Mat Coordinator has been alerted to the startup of the system, as have the Haz Mat team across the river in Keene, NH. Both would respond to the Brattleboro Fire Chief's request in the event of an emergency.\n\n3. Northeast Cooperatives' emergency response program has been explained to all personnel. Drills have been conducted, and will continue at regular intervals. All new personnel will be trained in the emergency response program, through a checklist required at orientation.\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety:\n\n1.
