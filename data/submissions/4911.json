The                     \n    facility manufactures fiberglass building insulation which is sold in the commercial,                   \n    residential, and retail markets.  The facility currently encompasses approximately                      \n    702,000 square feet under roof and is set in 51 acres of urban area.  There are presently               \n    about 240 full time employees who operate the Plant 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.                    \n                                                                                                            \n    Johns Manville places a strong emphasis on safety and environmental leadership.  The                    \n    Company fosters a proactive philosophy to ensure that employees work in a safe                          \n    environment and that each facility remains in full compliance with all applicable federal,              \n    state, county and local regulations.  JM is also committed to environmental leadership                  \n    within the community served.  This commitment is exemplified in the Corona Facilitys                   \n    strong recycling and waste minimization program development.  It is anticipated that a                  \n    majority (80%) of the fiberglass waste generated at the Corona facility will be recycled                \n    within two years, despite significant increases in production throughput.  The Companys                \n    long term goal is to have zero process wastes taken to disposal facilities, with all residual           \n    materials either recycled or used for beneficia"

Resin solution is stored in cold storage until it is mixed with          \n    water and other materials to make a binder solution (less than 1% formaldehyde) which is                \n    applied to fiberglass.

The storage vessels are constructed and operated in accordance with               \n    ASME specifications.  The resin storage process is designed to minimize spills in the                   \n    event of an accidental release.  The resin storage room is equipped with trenches that                  \n    minimize the surface area of a spill.  In addition, the resin storage room is maintained at             \n    50 degrees F to reduce the volatility of the material.  Although not a qualifying mitigation            \n    measure for the 112R program, low storage temperatures give plant personnel adequate                    \n    time to react to the situation by reducing the volatilization rate of the resin material.  As a         \n    result of these factors, Johns Manville has not experienced an accidental release of                    \n    formaldehyde over the entire life of the facility.

Under a worst-case scenario, a single vessel containing                    \n    5,000 gallons of liquid resin, which includes about 10.0% formaldehyde, is assumed to                   \n    spill with partial containment (low-lying pavement and trenches) in the resin room.                     \n    Liquid not contained in these rooms is assumed to spill outside and is contained by low-                \n    lying paved areas.  Distance to the toxic endpoint of 12.0 mg/m3 is calculated for Corona               \n    using AFTOX, a dispersion model that will determine toxic chemical concentrations at                    \n    hazard distances.  According to AFTOX, a worst-case resin spill and subsequent                          \n    formaldehyde vaporization onsite at Corona will result in a distance of 0.04 miles to the               \n    toxic endpoint.  A plant and topographic map analysis indicates that 0.04 miles from the                \n    location of the resin tank is completely onsite.  Therefore, the formaldehyde-containing                \n    liquid resin process at Corona does not qualify for Program 2 of 112R.                                  \n                                                      "
