      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\nCabot Corporation, Cab-O-Sil Division (Cabot) located in Tuscola, IL, has operated our 180 A? acre fumed silica manufacturing site since 1958.  Cabot is a global leader in the fumed silica industry.  Cabot currently employs 164 people in Tuscola, operating the facility 24-hours/day.  Cabot produces amorphous fumed silica.  Amorphous silica is a versatile material that is made up of extremely small, very pure particles.  These particles are utilized in a large number of end-products, including common household items, such as toothpaste, cake mixes, nail polish, adhesives, cosmetics, automobile finishes, inks, plastics, various types of rubber, and many other uses.  Some of the fumed silica products are approved as food additives for certain applications by the Food & Drug Administration, while others are used as strengthening agents or to control the flow of both powders and liquids.\n\nThe Cabot facility is subject to Risk Management Plan (RMP) requirements pursuant to Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Part 68 (40 CFR 68).  The facility uses the following RMP toxic materials at the facility in quantities that exceed the thresholds set for each material:\n\nMaterial                Quantity\nMethyltrichlorosilane (MTCS)    Greater than 5,000 pounds\nDimethyldichlorosilane (DiMeDi)    Greater than 5,000 pounds\n\n\nRMP CHEMICALS\n\nToxics\nMTCS is stored in large spherical vessels as both a 100% concentration and as an 80% mixture with Silicon Tetrachloride (Siltet).  The largest quantity of MTCS in a sphere is 2,500,000-lbs.  Administrative controls limit the total MTCS quantity to 2,500,000-lbs.  The worst-case release scenario for MTCS assumes the entire vessel is instantaneously released into a containment dike which provides passive mitigation by reducing release surface area.  Further reduction of the surface area is accomplished through the use of additional passive mitigation in the form of two layers of polyethylene plastic balls which cover approximately 97%"

      "SummaryText": " of the surface area of a released liquid.  The release rate of MTCS was determined from the EPA 'Offsite Consequence Analysis'.  Modeling this release, using the SLAB model, results in a distance to the defined endpoint beyond the facility boundary.\n\nDiMeDi is stored in a smaller, bullet tank located in a diked area, with a maximum stored quantity of 290,000 pounds.  The use of the RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis (OCA) guidelines for the worst-case release of a toxic liquid provided a worste case release of 100% MTCS than for a worst-case release of DiMeDi.\n\nMTCS is conveyed to the point of reaction through 3-inch diameter pipe.  Therefore, the alternative release scenario for MTCS is a pipe break at the discharge of the pump in the containment area. The release duration is approximately ten minutes, by which time the severed pipe would be valved off and the release stopped.  Further reduction of the surface area is accomplished through the use of additional passive mitigation in the form of two layers of polyethylene plastic balls which cover approximately 97% of the surface area of the released liquid.  The distance to the endpoint for the alternative scenario was estimated using the SLAB model, and does not extend beyond the facility boundries.\n\nThe DiMeDi analyses for alternative release scenario was a pipe break at the transfer pump.  The release duration was 10 minutes.  Reduction of the surface area is accomplished through the use of additional passive mitigation in the form of two layers of polyethylene plastic balls which cover approximately 97% of the surface area of the released liquid, rewsulting in a release rate of 5.51 GPM.  The distance to the endpoint was calculated using RMPComp ver. 1.07, and does not impact any public receptors.\n \nRMP APPLICABILITY\n\nCabot is subject to Program 3 RMP requirements for toxics due to the following:\n\n* RMP substances in process above the RMP threshold quantities\n* Public receptors within the worst-case release endpo"

Cabot actively investigates all incidents, regardless of severity, to ensure not only environmental protection, but workplace, public, and employee safety.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe emergency response program is a separate document maintained by the Health and Safety Manager.\n\nSAFETY IMPROVEMENT\n\nThe fumed metals manufacturing process requires that we use certain materials that are potentially harmful if not handled properly.  Their safe use at our Tuscola site is the highest priority of everyone at Cabot; there is no obligation we take more seriously.  Cabot is dedicated to the safe handling of all chemicals as well as the safe and proper operation of all facility equipment.  Process Safety Management (PSM) implementation requires procedures for handling chemicals as well as operating and maintaining the equipment in use at the facility.  Cabot reviews these procedures on a regular basis for accuracy and with the intent for continual improvement.  PSM documents are accessible to all employees.\n"
