SWRC works proactively to provide a safe workplace for each employee and continues to promote safety practices among employees for their health and welfare.  This is accomplished by actively assuring wide employee participation in a thorough PSM program and appropriate safety training.  \r\n\r\nThe PSM program is managed by at the site with a local team, with accountability to the Refinery Manager, with technical input from the corporate team.   The PSM program conforms to OSHA regulations contained in 29 CFR 1910.119.   SWRC has devoted the leadership, manpower, and capital investment necessary to complete the program.  SWRC updates the PSM Program and RMP for each significant process change and at least every five years.  \r\n\r\nSWRC's management recognizes and firmly believes in the need for a safe environment for both the refinery and the local community.  SWRC's policies ensure that our efforts with prevention through planning, training, reasonable process controls, timely maintenance and communication with our neighbors will help prevent unforeseeable releases of regulated substances.  Should a release nevertheless occur, SWRC's trained personnel, in conjunction with trained personnel from the community, have been trained to respond, mitigate and contain the release. \r\n\r\nPSM Program:\r\nFor the RMP-covered processes, uses OSHA'S PSM standard as our prevention program.

Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in the Employee Participation Plan and in procedures for each accident prevention program element. In addition, the Employee Participation Steering Committee is chartered with finding opportunities to improve employee participation.  It includes management, professional, and hourly employees. \r\n\r\nEmployees have access to all information that is part of the accident prevention program.  Copies of the information are located in the unit operations buildings for quick access, and available in the electronic documentation systems through an electronic reporting and recordkeeping program.\r\n\r\nExamples of employee participation include participating in the HAZOP analysis of each unit, updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information for their unit area and being trained on any changes to operational or mechanical information that may affect them.  Employees are also participants on our teams that address both process and worker safety.  Teams are often comprised of representatives from plant management, safety, operations, environmental, maintenance and engineering. \r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information:\r\nThe SWRC keeps technical and safety documentation for each unit that falls under the PSM standard.

The PSM group manages all information about the HAZOP analysis, team members, recommendations and resolutions. \r\n\r\nTo ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not deviate significantly from the original design safety features, SWRC updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  The revalidation team consists of the same types of personnel as the initial HAZOP team.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will continue on that schedule until the unit is no longer operating or is removed.  Revalidated hazard analysis results are tracked, submitted for management review and retained/documented.  \r\n\r\nOperating Procedures:\r\nSWRC maintains written procedures for all operations and worker functions at the refinery.  All are available in the control rooms and electronically to all personnel.  The procedures address various modes of unit operation, including: \r\n\r\n\u00bf\tUnit Startup\r\n\u00bf\tNormal Operations and Process Control\r\n\u00bf\tTemporary or Special Operating Procedures \r\n\u00bf\tEmergency Shutdown\r\n\u00bf\tNormal Shutdown\r\n\u00bf\tStartup following a Turnaround or Emergency Shutdown\r\n\r\nAdditional information"
