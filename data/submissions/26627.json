The Facility Policy\nThe Management and Employees are committed to the prevention of any type of accidental release of NH3 or any other chemical that is stored at this facility.  The Great Bend Coop is a Farmland Industries \"AG-21\" member, one of three in the State of Kansas.  AG-21 is a program that is Environmental Driven.  The Coop goes above and beyond industry standards for the safety of customer, employee, and environment.\n\n2.  Facility Information\nThe facility is located two miles south of Great Bend Kansas, however there are homes in the area.  The facility actvities involves dry, liquid and NH3 fertilizers as well as bulk and packaged chemicals.  The main warehouse has containment for accidental spills.  The maximum NH3 stoarage at this facility is 38,000 gal. contained in 2 tanks of 12,000 and 26,000 gal.\n\n3.  The Worst Case Release and Alternate Release Scenario\nWorst case scenario would be the release of 177,581 pounds during a 10 minutes period 17,758 pounds per minute.  This would travel five miles to end point.  Alternative release could involve overfillng.  This could travel up to 2.4 miles to end point.  \n\n4.  Accidental Release Prevention Program\nThe Coop recognizes all safety procedures required by State and Federal regulations.  The Coop also complies with recommendations from Farmland's AG-21 policies and general industry standards.  The most common accidental release would be the overfilling of nurse trailers.  An example would be if the trailer was filled to 85-90% on a cool morning and the air temperature rises; the product could expand and cause the pressure relief valves to let product escape.\n\n5.  Five Year Accident History\nThe Coop has not has an accidental release within the  past five years.\n\n6.  Emergency Response Program\nThe Coop has an Emergency Response Plan, Emergency Action Plan, and Employee Safety Committee.  All areas have worked with the"
