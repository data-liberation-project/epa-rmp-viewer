These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information. The reference documents are maintained on file at the facility. Chemical specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure considerations, is provided in Safety Data Sheets (SDS) which are kept on site at the facility. For specific process areas, the facility has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) in the operations procedures manual. The facility maintains the process within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, trained personnel and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems). The facility also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment. This information includes materials of construction, design pressure, temperature and electrical ratings. This information, in combination with procedures and equipment operating history, provides a basis for inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis\r\n\r\nThe N. Reeves ROTF has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the covered process are identified and controlled. Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards. The N.

There have been no accidents within the past 5 years.\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\r\n\r\nThe N. Reeves ROTF is a non-responding facility. The facility maintains a written emergency response plan, which has been written in accordance with OSHA PSM requirements. The plan identifies steps to be taken in case of an accidental release including: proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, if a release occurs. Employees receive training on the procedures to be followed in an emergency scenario. The emergency response plan is updated when necessary based on modifications made to facility processes. Periodic drills or tabletops exercises are conducted to test the response plan. The N. Reeves ROTF has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (i.e. Fire Department).

Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years so that the reports can be reviewed during PHAs and PHA revalidations.\r\n\r\nCompliance Audits\r\n\r\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, the N. Reeves ROTF periodically conducts an audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented. Compliance audits are conducted at least every 3 years. Both hourly and staff personnel participate in the audit.

In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the Operating Procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level. This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years, or more frequently upon request or need. All training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify and demonstrate skills.\r\n\r\nContractors\r\n\r\nThe N. Reeves ROTF uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities. Because some contractors work on or near covered process equipment, the facility has procedures in place to ensure that contractors:\r\n\r\n(1) perform their work in a safe manner;\r\n(2) have the appropriate knowledge;\r\n(3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace;\r\n(4) understand what they should do in event of an emergency;\r\n(5) understand and follow site safety rules, and;\r\n(6) inform facility personnel of any hazards that they find during their work;\r\n(7) know and understand the Stop Work policy at the facility.\r\n\r\nThis is accomplished by providing contractors with:\r\n\r\n(1) a process overview of the facility;\r\n(2) information about safety and health hazards;\r\n(3) emergency response plan requirements, and;\r\n(4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work.\r\nIn addition, contractor safety programs and performance will be evaluated during selection of contractors. Facility personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that"

      "SummaryText": "evaluation techniques. The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. This team identifies, evaluates, and makes recommendations to management of the potential hazards associated with the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures. The PHA team findings are forwarded to local and corporate management for resolution. All approved mitigation options are tracked until completion. The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained. The facility periodically updates and re-validates the PHA to assure that the hazards identified have been properly mitigated and identify new potential hazards. These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operational. The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.\r\n\r\nOperating Procedures\r\n\r\nThe N. Reeves ROTF maintains written operating procedures that address various modes of operations such as:\r\n(1) Normal startup,\r\n(2) Normal operations,\r\n(3) Temporary operations,\r\n(4) Emergency shutdown,\r\n(5) Normal shutdown,\r\n(6) Startup following an emergency shutdown, and\r\n(7) Initial startup of a new process.\r\n\r\nThese procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators. Procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate. The procedures are kept current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process. Covered process operating procedures are readily available to operators in the process unit and other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job task(s) and maintain the covered process unit within its safe limits.\r\n\r\nTraining\r\n\r\nThe N. Reeves ROTF has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating the covered proc"

      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY - NORTH REEVES REGIONAL OIL TREATMENT FACILITY (N. REEVES ROTF)\r\n\r\nN. Reeves ROTF is committed to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, facility trained personnel will evaluate the situation, take actions within the capabilities of the facility, and notify the necessary outside agencies.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\r\n\r\nThe N. Reeves ROTF is a centralized oil treatment facility. Oil enters the site via a production pipeline, and is heated by line heaters before going through the inlet surge vessel. Compressed gas is then separated from Natural Gas Liquids (NGLs) in the compressor scrubber. NGLS are stored under pressure until sent via pipeline to a gas processing facility for further fractionation. Liquids from the inlet surge vessel are sent to the 3-phase separator. From the 3-phase separator, the gas stream is sent to the overhead compressor header. The oil stream, from the 3-phase separator, is sent to stabilizer towers. Stabilized oil then leaves the facility via pipeline. \r\n\r\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\r\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place for the covered process at the facility.\r\n\r\nEmployee Participation\r\n\r\nEmployees of the N. Reeves ROTF are encouraged to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention. Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team. Employees have access to all information created as part of the facility accident prevention program. \r\n\r\nProcess Sa"
