NEW EMPLOYEE'S WILL BE TRAINED FOR THEIR PARTICULAR JOB BY AN EXPERIENCED EMPLOYEE IN THE AREA OF THEIR JOB DESCRIPTION.  THEY MUST FAMILIARIZE THEMSELVES WITH OUR SAFETY POLICIES AND PROCEDURES THROUGH ON THE JOB TRAINING AND WRITTEN POLICIES. AT OUR LOCATIONS THAT HANDLE ANHYDROUS AMONIA WE KEEP SAFETY GOGGLES, RUBBER GLOVES, AND RUBBER SUITS FOR THE EMPLOYEES TO WEAR.  IN THE PAST FIVE YEARS WE HAVE ONLY HAD ONE ACCIDENT, AND THIS ONE WAS VERY MINOR.  OUR LOCATION IN GROOM HAS RADIO AND PAGING COMMUNICATION WITH OUR LOCAL EMERGENCY RESCUE TEAM.  THE LOCAL FIRE CHIEF IS AN EMPLOYEE, AND ONE EMPLOYEE IS A MEMBER OF THE GROOM VOL. FIRE DEPARTMENT.   WITH OUR DIRECT COMMUNICATIONS WE CAN HAVE A TEAM ON SITE IN A VERY SHORT TIME.  WE ARE ALWAYS TRYING TO KEEP ALL OF OUR EQUIPMENT IN TOP SHAPE, IN  ORDER TO KEEP ACCIDENTS TO A MINIMUM. WE HAVE HAD ONE ACCIDENT IN THE LAST 5 YEARS WITH JUST MINOR INJURIES. NO PROPERTY DAMAGE.--OUR FACILITY HAS: A.  A WRITTEN EMERGENCY ACTION PLAN IN ACCORDANCE WITH OSHA STANDARD 29.CFR 1910.38;  B. PROVIDED STATE AND LOCAL AUTHORITIES TGHE EMERGENCY PLANNING ADN COMMUNITY RIGHT--TO--KNOW INFORMATION AS REQUIRED UNDER SARA TITLE III. C.  A WRITTEN EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM, IN ACCORDANCE WITH OSHA STANDARD 29 CFR 1910.120,  INCLUDING PRE--EMERGENCY PLANNING AND EMPLOYEE TRAINING.--SAFETY IMPROVEMENT IS AN ON--GOING PROCESS AT THE FACILITY.  PERIOCIC EVALUATIONS ARE PREFORMED TO ASSESS THE MAINTENANCE OF SAFE CONDITIONS.  THERE ARE NO ADDITIONAL SPECIFIC ANHYDROUS AMMONIA SAFETY RECOMMENDATIONS FOR IMPLEMENTATION AT THIS TIME.\nOUR WORST CASE SCENARIO WOULD BE THE RELEASE OF 90,000 LBS. OF ANHYDROUS AT AN END POINT OF .73 MILES.--OUR ALTENATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO WOULD BE THE BREAKING OF A TRANSFER HOSE WHICH WOULD BE APPROX. 7,172 LBS RELEASED AT AN END POINT OF .33 MILES."
