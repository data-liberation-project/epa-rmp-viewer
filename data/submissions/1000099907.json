The products contain propellants that are listed in 40 CFR 68.130 as regulated flammable substances (isobutane, isopentane, butane, and propane).  The products arrive onsite via truck, are repackaged and shipped offsite in the same container in which they arrived.  There is no processing of chemicals at the warehouse.\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical specific prevention steps:\n\nDue to the small containers handled at the facility and the proximity to public receptors, LCS is eligible for Program 1 under the RMP regulation. The facility has procedures in place and a rigorous training program for all employees involved in the covered process.  This facility has emergency medical treatment information readily available for use in an emergency.\n\nFive Year Accident History:\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of the covered chemicals at the LCS facility in the last five years that have resulted in death, injury, or significant property damage on site; or that have resulted in offsite death, injury, property damage, evacuation, sheltering in place, or environmental damage.\n\nEmergency Response Program:\n\nOur employees do not respond offensively to accidental releases of the regulated substances, but rely on local emergency responders when there is a need.  Our employees regularly undergo training in defensive emergency response activities.  This facility has a written emergency response plan that is updated regularly. The emergency response plan includes training for plant employees, coordination with the local emergency planning and response organizations and the evacuation of personnel in the event of an emergency. \n  \nPlanned changes to improve safety:\n\nOur facility continually evaluates and implements employee suggestions and recommendations.  We make changes to improve safety based on comments and information de"
