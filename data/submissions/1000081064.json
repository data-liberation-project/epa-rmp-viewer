The PSM/RMP programs have been effectively used for many years.  They are part of the plant's operating culture.  There are two parts to the program.  The first is the overall Water Division-wide program and the Water Treatment Plant site program.  The second is the chlorine-specific actions within the site program.  Both are coordinated with the Frederick County Fire/Rescue Department (including the HazMat Team), the Fort Detrick HazMat Team and the Regional LEPC.\r\n\r\n4.1.  GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM (D) (1)\r\nPlant-wide, many elements of the prevention program are used for all operations.  An overview of the generally written programs is listed below:\r\nThe City of Frederick has detailed process safety information on each of its operations.\r\nThe document maintenance system is integral to the management of change for all operations on site control.  This system is computer based.  \r\nTraining is the backbone of employee knowledge, job operations and is ongoing in each area.

If there is a chlorine release, significant injury, property damage or an incident that could have catastrophic results, an investigating team is formed within 48 hours.  The team reviews the incident, and a report is drafted that defines the findings and resolution of the occurrence.  \r\nEmployees participate in all aspects of the plant as listed below under Emergency Response.  Employees are also Safety Committee Members, Process Hazards Review Members, Accident Investigation Team Members, and assist in the development of the various P&Ps. \r\nSafe work practices are used throughout the facility including: 1) Hot Work Permits, 2) Lockout/Tagout Permits, 3) Vessel Entry Permits, 4) Site Security, and 5) Breaking Into Chemical Lines.\r\nContractors must meet The City of Frederick's high safety and technical standards as part of selection and ongoing evaluations.  In addition, City of Frederick demands training of contractors to its standards.\r\n\r\n4.2.  CHLORINE SPECIFIC RESPONSE PROGRAM (D) (2)\r\n\r\n4.2.1.

There is specific training in the properties, hazards, handling requirements, and leak repair for chlorine.  Finally, the details of both facility and equipment design are key in the operations manual of the chlorine system.\r\n\r\n4.2.3.  Facility Design\r\nThe plant includes a combined chlorine storage feed room/control room which meet and exceed design codes standards and good engineering practices.  The storage area/control building room is equipped with an emergency vent scrubber also an exhaust fan ventilation system.  There is a chlorine area monitor inside the room.  If chlorine is detected, the monitor alarms and a flashing red light illuminates as well as in the water plant control room.  The alarm system stops the vent system and starts the emergency vent scrubber.  All of these systems are tied into the emergency generator and supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system which also alerts management.\r\n\r\n4.2.4.  Equipment Design\r\nThere are two types of chlorine pipe systems, high pressure and low (vacuum) pressure.  The high pressure chlorine cylinder piping system consists of a yoke and chlorine gas vacuum check regulator on each of the six 150 lb. cylinders.  Chlorine under vacuum pressure enters a flexible tube connects from each cylinder gas vacuum check regulator to the header that has a main block valve.  These parts are made of anhydrous (elemental) chlorine compatible materials; steel, copper or chlorine compatible non-metallic compound (not corroded by chlorine) rated to 500 psig.  The maximum pressure of the chlorine in the high pressure system is 150 psig, giving a three-to-one safety factor.  There are six 150-pound cylinders in a single bank and each bank feeds one of three gas chlorinator and unit injectors.   There is another bank of six 150-pound cylinders on standby.

It operates under permit from the State of Maryland, Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE).\r\nThe chlorine is received and stored in 150-pound cylinders.  Six cylinders are in the in-use bank and another six are in the stand by bank.  Each cylinder has a chlorine vacuum check regulator mounted on it.  The vacuum lines from these six units are manifolded into a bank.  There two banks, one on-line the other on standby.  The on-line bank feeds chlorine to three process control systems.  The chlorine from the cylinder's chlorinator is drawn into the injectors by high pressure water flow.  The resultant chlorinated water flows into the plant's water system which is outside the regulated systems boundaries.\r\n\r\nChlorine is an EPA and OSHA-listed toxic chemical.  It is an irritant and corrosive.  Chlorine is a halogen with the formula CL2.  Chlorine is an oxidizing agent that is non-flammable.  It has a one ppm OSHA ceiling (15-minute) permissible exposure limit (PEL) and a NFPA health rating of 4, severe.

The City of Frederick continually reviews implemented operating procedures for potential safety improvements for all of its operations.  Currently, the City of Frederick management team and process safety team are reviewing potential upgrades to the existing design of the chlorine operations to make the system even safer to prevent a release and minimize consequences in the event of a release of chlorine.\r\nThe City of Frederick Water Treatment Plants compiled the EPA/OSHA-required Vulnerability Assessment (VA).  Recommendations from the VA Report improve site security and safety overall including that of the chlorine system.  The city will conduct a Risk and Resilience Survey for each of its four water treatment plants as required by the EPA's 2018, America's Water Infrastructure Act."

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY INTRODUCTION 68.155\r\n\r\nThe City of Frederick's Water Treatment Department operates the Monocacy Water Treatment Plant at 1950 North Market Street, Frederick, Frederick County, Maryland.  This plant is one of four water plants operated by the City.  The City also operates one wastewater treatment plant.  The Monocacy Water Treatment Plant as well as the Linganore Water Treatment Plant has quantities of regulated hazardous chemicals above the EPA threshold.  The City has a unified Risk Management Program which applies to each plant.  Only the Monocacy Water Treatment Plant operations and policies are presented in this Plan.  The plant is undergoing major changes and safety upgrades and has been under construction since September 2017 when all chlorine was removed from the plant. The anticipated introduction of chlorine and startup date is set for spring 2021.\r\n\r\n1.1. ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION/EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES (A)\r\nThe City of Frederick Water Treatment Plant accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates technologies, procedures, training and management practices.  The plant prevention program complies with all applicable procedures of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) 40 CFR-68 Prevention Program as well as Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA) 27-CFR-1910-119 under the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990.\r\n\r\n1.2. MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS (A) (1)\r\nThe City of Frederick has a management system in place which is lead by the City's Mayor, who delegates implementation and on-going use of the RMP elements to the Deputy Director of Public Works for Engineering and Operations.  The Deputy Director delegates the RMP program to the Assistant Deputy Director of Operations - Utilities who has responsibility for water trea"

A pressure relief valve is in each to the vacuum check regulator.  The valve vents if the pressure in the line reaches over several inches of water pressure.  All the pipes, tubes, and equipment are also chlorine compatible.  The system is designed to complete vacuum giving it a large safety factor over the typical vacuum (negative) pressure in it.  .\r\n\r\n5.  FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY (E)\r\nThe plant has been chlorine reportable and release free since 1992 to the present, 27 years as defined by 40 CFR-68.\r\n\r\n6.  EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM (F)\r\nEmergency response procedures are contained in both the Plant Emergency Response Policy and City Emergency Response Plan which is coordinated with the Frederick County Contingency Plan (Emergency Response Plan).  The plan includes an emergency response decision tree and a notification plan.  The Plant also has site-specific emergency actions for small and large (reportable) releases defined in the operating procedures and Emergency Response Plan.  Emergency response drills and evacuation drills are conducted annually by the operating department.  Emergency operation and response procedures are also reviewed annually.\r\nThe emergency response program (contingency plan) is coordinated (reviewed by) with the water plant Safety Committee, the City Fire and Police Departments.  The Water Plant and Fire Department coordinates with Local Frederick County Emergency Response Planning Committee (LEPC) and the Frederick County HazMat Team and the Fort Detrick HazMat team.  All are located in Frederick County, Maryland.  Copies of the program are given to key local agencies including: fire, medical, rescue, management, and police departments.  Besides the specific of the prevention programs, they are incorporated in the operating culture of the City water plant.\r\nThe Emergency Response or"

HAZARD ASSESSMENT\r\nA hazard assessment was performed in March 2017 to determine the effects a release would have on the plant, the public and environmental receptors surrounding the plant.  The tobe installed chlorine emergence vent scrubber, the revised chlorine cylinder control system and the new emergency generator were included in the March PHA.  For chlorine, the distance to the endpoint concentration of the gas was determined.  In addition, an estimate of the population that could be affected by a release of chlorine was determined, and sensitive receptors such as hospitals, schools, and nursing homes were identified.  The hazard assessment considers two release scenarios; a worst case and an alternative case.  The City maintains a Five-Year Accident History for the WTP chlorine system (see Section 4 below; five-year accident history.\r\n\r\nTwo offsite consequence analyses were conducted.  The first is a worst case release.  The second is a more probable alternative release scenario.  The first scenario is defined by EPA, which states that the operator shall assume that the maximum quantity in the largest vessel is released as a gas over 10 minutes due to an unspecified failure.  The alternative scenario is defined as more likely to occur than the worst-case scenario.  It was define during the most recent, 2017 Process Hazards Analysis Team members.\r\nAtmospheric dispersion modeling was performed to determine the distance traveled by the chlorine released before its concentration decreases to the toxic endpoint.  The EPA specified endpoint for chlorine is 0.0087 mg/l which equals three ppm.  The three ppm endpoint is the Emergency Response Planning Guideline Level 2 (ERPG- 2).  This is defined by the American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA) as the maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to one hour"

This failure is equal to creating a 0.01 square inch hole in the cylinder below the liquid level.  Modeling using the EPA/RMP Comp and EPA's guidance demonstrated the rate of chlorine release is 31.7 lbs. per minute for a period of 6 minutes releasing a total of 150 pounds of chlorine from one container.
