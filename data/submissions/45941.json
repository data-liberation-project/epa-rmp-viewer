The regulated substances are listed below.\n\n\n\n  Acetylene (flammable, CAS # 74-86-2)\n\n  Anhydrous ammonia (toxic, CAS # 7664-41-7)\n\n  Chlorine (toxic, CAS # 7782-50-5)\n\n  Trichlorosilane (flammable, CAS # 10025-78-2)\n\n  Trimethylchlorosilane (toxic, CAS # 75-77-4)\n\n\n\nA hazard assessment was performed using the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) RMP*CompTM Model.  The worst-case release scenarios were assumed to be the total release of the largest quantity of each substance from their respective storage vessel for a default duration of ten minutes.  The alternative release scenarios we selected were based upon actual incidents or failure scenarios developed during process hazard reviews and analysis.  The alternative release scenario for each regulated substance is described below.\n\n\n\nAcetylene - A regulator failure causes the two inch diameter pipe to pressurize to 100 psig.  A release occurs at the relief valve at the reactor, causing an explosion.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia -The flange on the remote operated valve (ROV) fails, causing a release to occur.\n\nChlorine - A 0.25-in diameter orifice is formed in a 1-ton cylinder as a result of a poor bond between the lead alloy and the fusible plug retainer.\n\nTrichlorosilane - A leak develops in the recirculation line.  This scenario is based on a release that occurred at the facility on August 8, 1998.\n\nTrimethylchlorosilane - A two inch diameter pipe fails at the pipe rack causing a release to occur.\n\n  \n\nThe following accidental release scenarios were selected based on the distance to the endpoints as determined by RMP*Comp.\n\n\n\nOne worst-case release scenario for the toxic substances (anhydrous ammonia).\n\nOne worst-case release scenario flammable substances (acetylene).  \n\nEvery alternative release scenario fo"

These zones were analyzed to provide estimates of the total population and public and environmental receptors that could potentially be exposed should the hypothetical releases occur.  Although off-site areas would be impacted by the releases, we believe that safety procedures, mitigation measures and ongoing risk reduction program will substantially reduce the potential for off-site consequences and subsequent risks to the surrounding community.  Our safety devices include detectors, perimeter monitoring, alarms, fixed fire suppression and automatic system shut-off features. \n\n\n\nWe have had two releases with offsite consequences in the last five years.  The substances and dates of the releases are listed below.\n\n\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia, May 8, 1998\n\nTrichlorosilane, August 8, 1998\n\n\n\nInformation from each release was collected and reviewed to determine the corrective actions to be implemented to prevent a reoccurrence.  We consider near-misses as serious as actual releases. Therefore, the same procedures used for major incidents are used for near-misses.  Because of the risks our covered processes pose to the public and the environment should a release occur,  we have implemented a thorough risk assessment and reduction program to eliminate or minimize, to the greatest extent possible, the consequences of a release of hazardous chemicals.  As a result, significant improvements have been made to include:\n\n* The installation of fixed low and medium expansion foam systems at our bulk storage and unloading facilities for fire and vapor suppression\n\n* The installation of fixed foam systems in many of our process areas\n\n* The installation of perimeter monitoring systems for HCl detection to 50 ppm\n\n* Improvements to our storm water retentio"

Together, they satisfy the requirements for the USEPA RMP, 40 CFR Part 68, and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) program, 29 CFR 1910.119.  The PSM program ensures that our facility is operated under safe conditions and that any risk of a catastrophic release is minimized.  The program has been written to reduce the potential of a release due to human error or equipment failure at our facility.  In order to prevent the release due to human error, our PSM program ensures that operating procedures are current and reviewed annually. Training also plays a vital part in our program.  Employees and contractors working near or on the facility's chemical manufacturing processes are required to be trained in facility procedures and informed of the hazards of the chemicals used in those processes.   \n\n\n\nTo prevent equipment failure that could result in a release, our Mechanical Integrity program ensures that equipment inspections, tests, and preventive maintenance are in accordance with accepted engineering practices and includes manufacturer's recommendations.  Manufacturing equipment is inspected and tested in accordance with the planned maintenance schedule. \n\n\n\nAll existing and proposed future equipment has been designed according to applicable standards and codes.

We have designated responders on all assigned shifts trained to respond to and carry out all necessary activities.  Our facility is also included in the community emergency response plan.  Employees at our facility are thoroughly trained to respond to accidental releases that occur on-site.  The Emergency Response Plan consists of initial response procedures, response team procedures, facility emergency numbers, and coordination with the Gainesville Fire Department.  The plan also addresses notification procedures to the public and the local emergency response agency.\n\n"
