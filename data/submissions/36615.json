This commitment is demonstrated by our efforts in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, facility trained personnel will evaluate the situation, take actions within the capabilities of the facility, and/or notify the necessary outside agencies.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe Conway LPG Storage Facility is located on Kansas State Highway No. 56, approximately 6.5 miles west of McPherson, Kansas.  The Conway LPG Storage Facility provides storage and terminal operations for liquefied petroleum gas and unleaded gasoline.  Stored products are shipped from the facility via pipeline systems, trucks and railcars.  The Conway LPG Storage Facility is able to store enough propane, butane and other flammable materials to meet the minimum RMP reporting quantities.\n\n GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n \nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the Facility.  The processes at the Conway LPG Storage Facility is regulated by both the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) Risk Management Program (RMP) rule and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard.  Because RMP accident prevention requirements for these processes are essentially the same as PSM, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements, and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program at the Conway LPG Storage Facility.  \n \nEMPLOYEE PARTICIPATION\n \nThe Conway LPG Storage Facility encourages employees to participate in all fac"

Employees also participate in safety meetings, resolving certain safety concerns, and updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information pertaining to the process and critical equipment.  \n \nEmployees have access to all information created as part of the facility's accident prevention program.  Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in a written employee participation plan that is maintained at the Conway LPG Storage Facility.  This employee participation plan addresses each accident prevention program element.  \n \nPROCESS SAFETY INFORMATION\n \nThe Conway LPG Storage Facility keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the process.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific inventories, safety interlocks, suppression systems, and equipment design basis/configuration information. \n \nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/ exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs). For specific process areas, the facility has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) in the equipment specifications and operating procedures.  The Conway LPG Storage Facility maintains the processes within these limits by using process controls and monitoring instruments, trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\n \nThe Conway LPG Storage Facility also maintains technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature rating"

This information, in combination with procedures and equipment operating history, provides a basis for inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes so safety features in the process are not compromised.\n \nPROCESS HAZARD ANALYSIS (PHA)\n \nThe Conway LPG Storage Facility has a comprehensive program to identify and control hazards associated with the various processes that are identified and controlled.  Within this program, the processes are systematically examined to identify potential hazards and controls in place to manage these hazards, and recommend additional controls, as appropriate.\n \nThe facility uses a variety and combination of applicable methodologies to conduct PHAs.  These PHAs address (1) facility siting, (2) human factors, (3) qualitative evaluation of a range of the possible safety and health effects of failure of controls on personnel, (4) and one or more of the following methodologies appropriate to determine and evaluate the hazards of the process (a) What-if; Checklist, (b) Hazard and Operability (HAZOP), (c) Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA), (d) Fault Tree Analysis, or (e) an appropriate equivalent methodology.  PHAs are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience, as well as engineering expertise.  This PHA team identifies and evaluates potential hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and then makes recommendations for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures. \n \nThe PHA team recommendations are forwarded to management for resolution. Implementation of additional prevention and/or mitigation options in response to PHA recommendations is based on a relative priority ranking assigned by the PHA team.  The approved prevention and/or mitigation options in response to PHA team recommendations are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each recomme"

The recommendations from these revalidated PHAs are also forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of each revalidated PHA recommendation is documented and retained.\n \nOPERATING PROCEDURES\n \nThe Conway LPG Storage Facility maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations.  These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate. In addition, the Conway LPG Storage Facility maintains information on how to respond to upper or lower limit exceedances for specific process or equipment parameters.  This information, along with written operating procedures, is readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n \nTRAINING\n \nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the Conway LPG Storage Facility has implemented a comprehensive training program for employees involved in operating the process.  New operational employees receive training on the Conway LPG Storage Facility's operating procedures and basic training in process operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.

The goal of each investigation is to determine the factors that may have led to the incident, and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The investigation team documents its recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these recommendations to management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's recommendations are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the recommendations.  Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years so that the reports can be reviewed during future PHAs and PHA revalidations. \n \nCOMPLIANCE AUDITS\n \nTo help determine that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, the Conway LPG Storage Facility periodically conducts an audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented.  Compliance audits are conducted at least every 3 years.  The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to facility management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are retained.  \n \nSPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n \nThe process at the Conway LPG Storage Facility has potential hazards that must be managed for continued safe operation.
