Pleasant. Chlorine is considered hazardous by EPA. The properties of chlorine that make it useful in the treatment of water make it necesssary to observe safety precautions that will prevent unnecessary exposure to chlorine thereby reducing the threat to the plant employees and also, reduce the threat to the persons in the community. Ammonia is used in the water treatment process but is not stored in quantities that require requlation. However, the same safety precaution in efect for chlorine are also applied to ammonia. Training employees when they begin to work and subsequent review of hazards associated with chlorine will be prominent in preventing releases of clorine to the atmosphere. There have been no accidents in the preceding five year period. A chlorine detector is mounted in the area to detect chlorine leaks. Accidental release prevention program is in effect and copies are retained in a manual available at the water treatment plant. Emergency response policies have beenreviewed and are still  in effect. Copies of the Emergency Response are maintained in a manual at the treatment plant."
