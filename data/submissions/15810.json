All applicable procedures of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Prevention Program are adhered to.  The WSP emergency response policy involves the preparation of response plans which are tailored to the Hays water softening plant facility and to the emergency response services available in the community, and is in compliance with the EPA Emergency Response Program requirements.\n\nb)  The Water Softening Plant Chlorination Station has been installed to disinfect the water flow into the City of Hays water distribution system.  The chlorination system is located on the southeast corner of the intersection of Vine Street and 10th Street.  The station includes a chlorination room, which contains liquid chlorine containers, a chlorinator, and various safety equipment, and an instrument room, which contains a flow recorder, various electrical panels, and additional safety equipment.  The amount of chlorine handled is 3 one-ton containers and 25 one-hundred fifty pounds containers.  The chlorine station is not continously manned 24-hours per day but water treatment operators visit the chlorine station periodically throughout the 24-hour day and respond to any trouble alarms which may occur.\n\nc)  The offsite consequence analysis includes consideration of two chlorine release scenarios, identified as \"worst case release\" and \"alternative scenario\".  The first scenario is identified by EPA, which states that \"the owner or operator shall assume that the  ... maximum quantity in the largest vessel... is released as a gas over a period of 10 minutes,\" due to an unspecified failure.  The alternative scenario is defined as \"more likely to occur than the worst case scenario\".\n\nEPA's RMP*Comp(tm) atmospheric dispersion modeling has to be performed to determine the distance"

This program includes an emergency response decision tree and a notification plan.  Emergency response drills and drill evaluations are conducted very six months; emergency operation and response produres are also reviewed at that time.\n\ng) Four changes to improve safety (recommended actions) were identified in May an"
