Local community and business notification phone numbers are also found in the Emergency Response Plan.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\nRecommended corrective actions to mitigate the potential for an accidental ammonia release are proposed on the tables located in RMP Binder Chapter 0.0. The table items result from recommendations made during the Process Hazard Analysis, a Code Compliance Review, Seismic Review, and a Safety Inspection performed by a qualified person. Some recommendation items in the recommendation table originate from multiple codes but are listed only once. Specific facility areas and systems categorize recommendations resulting from the Safety Inspection; some of which may repeat general Process Hazard Analysis and Code Compliance Review items. \nBased on the severity of the hazards identified, implementation deadlines are also recommended.

Local fire and police departments will provide emergency response for a major release event with mutual aid from Harkins Street Holdings LLC response employees. Emergency response notification phone numbers are found in detail in the RMP reporting procedures. Detailed phone numbers are updated yearly. Phone numbers are located in the RMP binders and on the face of the Business Response Plan (which contains Harkins Street Holdings LLC emergency response information), Evacuation maps are provided, and windsocks are strategically located on the property to aid in determining prevailing wind and escape routes.

This equipment includes compressors, condensers, and evaporation equipment as well as ice makers, vacuum tubes and air handling equipment. General visual inspections are done throughout the workday as the starting/stopping of the equipment is required. Inspections identify potential sources of problems and potential releases of ammonia. Equipment corrections are then resolved by on-site personnel, registered engineers and refrigeration contractors as required. Refrigeration equipment will be reviewed for updates and changes when changes occur or when new equipment is brought on site. As described above, Accidental Release Prevention is a continuing- ongoing process involving system inspection emergency response program and employee hazardous response training is also performed yearly. All new hires are trained in safety and operational safeties specific to the operation of the refrigeration equipment. Business Response Procedures and Emergency Response Procedures are updated yearly. Portable equipment, new to the site, is tested for operational safeties at the time of specific installation. All ammonia refrigeration maintenance and operations personnel are required to be trained and become familiar with the company's Safety and Operational Procedures and Emergency attendance records are maintained in the RMP binders.

A Safety Data Sheet (SDS) for Ammonia is included in Chapter 8 Appendix 8.4 of RMP binder, which details the chemical properties, health hazards and exposure limits of anhydrous ammonia.\nAcutely Hazardous Material Uses: Anhydrous ammonia is used as the refrigerant in the refrigeration systems. The ammonia refrigeration system is a single-stage with a central plant and a piping loop distributing refrigerant throughout the site. The system contains approximately 120,000 lb. of ammonia. This is an engineering estimate based on calculations of the system volume. The exact ammonia volume is not known due to the system's age and the fact that the ammonia was not measured into the system. The TPQ for ammonia is 500 lbs. The main engine room is located at 1040 Growers Street. The main condensers and receivers and the main liquid shutoff valve (King Valve) are located at 1140 Meeks Street. The emergency ammonia high pressure diffusion system consists of a high to low pressure manual relief valve system; a low pressure to high pressure relief valve system, and a water diffuser system located at 1140 Meeks Street. Each system is only to be used in an absolute catastrophic emergency to relieve excess pressure. There are windsocks located around the main property as an aid for evacuation. A facility-wide computer system manufactured by Andover Corporation controls the temperature of the cold rooms, and operation of evaporators, compressors, and condensers. Safeties are monitored on a real time basis and the computer will test the appropriate responder in the event of an ammonia leak, and related safety hazards.

The following is a summary of the programs, policies, and procedures in place to reduce the risk of a hazardous materials release.\nThe purpose of the RMP is threefold: 1.) to prevent unwanted releases of hazardous chemicals, especially into locations that could expose employees and others to serious hazards, 2.) to identify hazards associated with the use of anhydrous ammonia, and 3.) to provide procedures to minimize the risks involved with handling this material.\nHarkins Street Holdings LLC has implemented the RMP at the Salinas, CA facility in order to comply with regulations and to fulfill this facility's responsibility to protect its employees, equipment, property, the surrounding community, and the environment from accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.\nIn addition to the mandated prevention program elements listed in the RMP:\n\u2022\tHarkins Street Holdings LLC facility utilizes visual inspection procedures prior to startup and shutdown of on-line cooling equipment. This equipment includes compressors, condensers, and evaporation equipment as well as ice makers, vacuum coolers and air handling equipment.\n\u2022\tGeneral visual inspections are done throughout the day as starting or stopping of the equipment is required.\n\u2022\tInspections identify potential sources of problems and potential releases of ammonia. On-site personnel, registered engineers and refrigeration contractors as required then resolve equipment corrections.\n\u2022\tAccidental Release Prevention is a continuing ongoing process involving system inspection, emergency response program reviews and employee hazardous response training (performed yearly). All new operating technicians are trained in safety and operational safeties specific to the operation"
