IF AN ACCIDENTAL RELEASE SHOULD OCCER,THE FACILITY IS PREPARED TO WORK WITH THE LOCAL FIRE COMPANY, OR OTHERAUTHORITIES,TO MITIGATE ANY RELEASE AND MINIMIZE THE IMPACT OF THE RELEASE TO PEOPLE AND THE ENVIRONMENT.\n\n2. FACILITY INFORMATION\n\n     THE PRIMARY ACTIVITY AT THE FACILITY IS THE STORAGE AND BLENDING OF FERTILIZERS FOR SALE TO FARMERS.\n\n     ANHYDROUS AMMONIA IS RECEIVED, STORED AND DISTRIBUTED FOR DIRECT APPLICATION. ANHYDROUS AMMONIA IS USED FOR CROP  PRODUCTION NUTRIENTS.\n\n     THE MAXIMUM QUANTITY OF AMMONIA STORED WOULD BE 220000 POUNDS IN OUR 26000 GALLON STORAGE TANK AND NURSE TANKS. THE MAXIMUM QUANTITY HANDLED WOULD BE THE UNLOADING OF A TRUCK HOLDING 40000 POUNDS.\n\n3. THE WORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO.\n\n     A. THE WORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO FOR ANHYDROUS AMMONIA WOULD BE THE RELEASE OF THE TOTAL CONTENTS OF A STORAGE TANK RELEASED AS GAS OVER TEN MINUTES. THE MAXIMUM QUANTITY RELEASED WOULD BE 120000 POUNDS WHICH REPRESENTS THE VOLUME OF THE STORAGE TANK AT 85 PERCENT CAPACITY AS LIMITED BY DESIGN STANDARDS. THE DISTANCE TO THE ENDPOINT (POINT OF DISPERSION TO 200 PPM) IS 1.09 MILES.\n\n     B. THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO FOR ANHYDROUS AMMONIA BASED ON THE HAZARD REVIEW IS A 2 MINUTE RELEASE FORM A BREAK IN A 3 INCH PIPE. THE DISTANCE TO THE ENDPOINT ( POINT OF DISPERSION TO 200 PPM  IS .78 MILES.\n\n4. THE ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM.\n\n     THE FACILITY HAS IMPLEMENTED THE PROVISION OF \"SAFETY REQUIREMENTS FOR THE STORAGE AND HANDLING OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA, K-61.1\", PUBLISHED BY THE AMERICAN NATIONAL STANDARDS INSTITUTE, INC AND THE STANDARDS OF THE U."
