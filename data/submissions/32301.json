The Edinburg emergency response policy involves the preparation of a response plan that is tailored to each facility and to the emergency response services available in the community. The policy adheres to EPA Prevention Program procedures whtere applicable, and is in compliance with EPA Emergency Response Program requirements.\n\nThe City of Edinburg Water Raw Water Pump Station No. 1 is located at 2100 West Sprague Street, Edinburg, Hidalgo County, Texas. The pump station has two, one-ton chlorine cylinders connected to the system at one time. One, one-ton cylinder is operational and the other one is used as backup.\n\nThe accidental release prevention program for the Edinburg Pump Station is based on the following key elements: the high level of training of the operators; the preventive maintenance program; the use of state of the art process and safety equipment; the use of accurate and effective operating procedures--written with the participation of the operators; the performance of a hazard review of equipment and procedures; and the implementation of an audit and inspection program.\n\nChemical specific prevention steps include the availability of Self-Contained-Breathing -Apparatus (SCBA) worn by the operator during connection/disconnection of each chemical supply, the awareness of the hazardous and toxic properties of chlorine and the presence of a chemical detector.\n\nNo accidental releases of chlorine have occurred in the past five years.\n\nThe facility has an emergency response program which has been coordinated (reviewed) by the City of Edinburg, and Edinburg's Fire and Police Departments. Both of these entities are members of the Hidalgo County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC). The program includes an emergency response decision tree and a notification plan.
