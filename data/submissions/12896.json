The facility cannot store more than 17,600 gallons in the tank.  A vapor cloud explosion of this tank would result in an endpoint distance of 0.3 miles.  A total of approximately 300 people would potentially be affected.\n\nThe prevention program:  Carpenter Industries complies with the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) accident prevention rule and all applicable state and local codes and regulations.  The propane system is designed, installed and maintained in accordance with NFPA-58 and applicable state law.\n\nFive-year accident history:  Franklin Electric has never had an accident involving propane that caused deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations or shelterings in place.\n\nThe emergency response program:  In the event of an emergency involving our propane system, it is our policy to notify the Wayne County LEPC, the RFD and the appropriate state and national entities.
