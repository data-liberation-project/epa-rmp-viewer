      "SummaryText": "The Brunswick Glynn Joint Water Sewer Commission Risk Management Plan for safe handling of chlorine and sulfur dioxide involves a unified approach that integrates technologies, procedures, and management practices to monitor potential chlorine and sulfur dioxide hazards and minimize the risk of accidental chlorine and sulfur dioxide releases.  Procedures in the plan seek to provide employee safety, public health and response agency interactions.\n\nThe Brunswick Glynn Joint Water Sewer Commission owns and operates the wastewater treatment plant known as Academy Creek Water Pollution Control Plant.  This plant utilizes chlorine to disinfect treatment plant discharge and utilizes Sulfur Dioxide to neutralize residual chlorine prior to discharge.  Chlorination processes include chlorine and sulfur dioxide cylinders, chlorination equipment, an instrument room, electrical equipment, and process safety equipment.\n\n\nThe Brunswick Glynn Joint Water Sewer Commission Risk Management Program includes the following key elements to mitigate the effects of potential chlorine and sulfur dioxide release hazards:\n\n* Operator Training\n* Preventive Maintenance Program\n* Process Safety Equipment\n* Safe and effective standard operating procedures, written with operator participation\n* Hazard review of equipment and procedures \n* Respiratory protection (SCBA) program\n* Chlorine detectors and alarms\n* Sulfur dioxide detectors and alarms\n* Personal protectice equipment program\n\nThe Brunswick Glynn Joint Water Sewer Commission emergency response program includes the evacuation of the plant, evaluation of release sources, and notification of City of Brunswick Fire and Police Department, Glynn County, and Local Emergency Planning Committee.  This will be done using the 911 emergency telephone number.\n\nThe emergency response program includes notification of responsible individuals of the releases and procedures for notifying the general public within the release areas.\n"
