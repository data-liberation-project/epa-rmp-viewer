This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive risk management program that covers equipment design, installation, operating procedures, mechanical integrity, and employee training associated with processes at the Pineville plant.  The Risk Management Plan formalizes the management system that documents these activities. \r\n\r\nThis commitment to health, environment, and safety (HES) starts with Senior Management.  Senior Management routinely dedicates time to review HES matters.  This emphasis on safety is carried on at all levels of the plant.  The success of the plant's HES program is also demonstrated by a strong commitment to safety by our employees and site contractors. \r\n\r\nArkema Pineville's HES programs include policies, procedures, standards, and guidance materials to ensure our commitment to health, environment, and safety.  These materials include Risk Management Program guidance use"

This facility currently receives, stores, blends and ships various natural gas odorants.  Ethyl Mercaptan, which is received, stored and shipped at the facility is a regulated substance under 40 CFR 68, the EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) Rule.  Ethyl Mercaptan is used as a propane gas odorizer and it can also be used to produce agrichemicals such as biodegradable herbicides and pesticides.  \r\n\r\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT\r\n\r\nIn-depth process hazard analysis studies for the existing plant by personnel knowledgeable with the process.  The team utilizes study techniques approved under the OSHA Process Safety Management Standard.\r\n\r\nTHE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\n\r\nThe Arkema Pineville plant has an accidental release prevention program in place to minimize the risk of hazardous chemical releases.  This program is designed to address the requirements of the OSHA 29 CFR 1910.119.  Process Safety Management Standard and the EPA Risk Management Program 40 CFR 68.  The accident prevention program includes the following elements and activities:\r\n\r\nWritten operating procedures that are certified which and are used to train affected personnel to perform their job tasks in a safe manner.
