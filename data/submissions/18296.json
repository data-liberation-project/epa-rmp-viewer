BOX 2500\n3707 OLD HIGHWAY 395\nFALLBROOK, CA  92028\n\n\nSECTION 1:  EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\nThis risk management plan addresses the risk management program for Rainbow Municipal Water District.  This plan applies to the process conducted to store chlorine gas cylinders that are used to chlorinate the water supplies and distribution systems within the district.  Section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act and 1990 Amendments requires a risk management plan and program be developed for regulated substances used above certain thresholds within a process that could lead to an accidental release.  The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) implements the Federal Clean Air Act by Title 40, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 68.  In turn, Title 19 of the California Code of Regulations on Public Safety implements the Federal requirements with certain additions specific to the state.  The EPA has delegated its authority to the state and local regulatory agencies.  As such, the State of California has established threshold levels that are lower (more stringent) than the Federal thresholds.  Rainbow Municipal Water District's inventory of chlorine gas [Chemical Abstracts Service (CAS) number 7782-50-5] cylinders stored at the District Storage Yard is above the Federal and State regulatory threshold.   \n\nThis plan is prepared in compliance with the San Diego County Department of Environmental Health, Hazardous Materials Division, \"California Accidental Release Prevention Program (CalARP) Guidelines\" (revised February 25, 1999).   This plan shall be reviewed annually and updated at least every 5 years.  This plan is intended to describe the responsibilities and activities necessary to respond to an accidental release of chlorine gas to personnel, the public, and the environment.  This plan is made available to the public and the local emergency responders (e.g., North County Fire Protection District, and California Division "

      "SummaryText": "of Forestry). The Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) Code for this district is 4941(water supply), and the North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) Code is 221 (water and wastewater treatment).\n\nRainbow Municipal Water District has established a chlorine-handling procedure, emergency plan, and training program that ensures the safety of personnel, the public, and the environment.  This plan addresses emergency response and accident prevention.  The chlorine handling procedure covers the safety aspects of changing chlorine cylinders and storage.  The hazardous material training programs consist of hazard identification, proper handling of chlorine cylinders, safety precautions, use of Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS), daily visual inspections, work orders, and corrective maintenance services.  The program also provides for training as first responders and hazardous material (HAZMAT) technician-level mitigation specialists.  The program implements the elements of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management standards.   A process hazard evaluation has been performed and will be updated at least once every five years or whenever there is a new hazard or risk created by changes at the District Storage Yard.\n\nThe Rainbow Municipal Water District was established in December 1953 under the Municipal Water District Act of 1911.  The water district was needed for the prime purpose of importing Colorado River water and Northern California water (via the 444-mile long California Aqueduct) to the areas populated mostly within the Bonsall Basin area, in order to augment the local water supplies (see Figure 1-1).   The Bonsall Basin area is fed by drainage of the San Luis Rey River. \n\nThe Rainbow Municipal Water District encompasses approximately 49,792 acres (77.8 square miles) that includes district-owned watershed lands, the Bonsall and San Luis Rey River Basins, and Indian Reservation lands (Pala Tribe).

Many residents are transient grove workers and others are property owners that reside in the Bonsall and San Luis Rey River Basins seasonally.  The District serves approximately 6,293 connections on a regular basis.  Some residents have their own private water supply or are supplied by the mutual water companies near the Rainbow Municipal Water District's boundaries and have stand-by connections in the event demand exceeds their pumping abilities or well failure. \n\nThe District's boundaries are adjoined by the City of Escondido, Pendleton Military Reservation, City of Oceanside, Vista Irrigation District, Vallecitos Water District, and Valley Center Municipal Water District (see Figure 1-3).  Live Oak State Park is 2.5 miles from the District, and seven golf courses are located near the District (the closest golf course is within 1 mile of the District).   The area is unique in many ways due to its varying elevations and high rate of irrigation.  Average rainfall per year is approximately nine (9) inches.\n\nThe Rainbow Municipal Water District is governed by a five (5) member board of directors representing a division of the District in which each member resides.  Regular meetings of the board of directors are held monthly.  The board elects its officers at its first meeting in January of each odd-numbered year.  The District utilizes outside consultants on a continuous, as needed basis for operational and environmental concerns.\n\nThe District headquarters is located on Old Highway 395 and contains a storage depot (District Storage Yard).  Full one-ton (2,000 pound capacity) chlorine gas cylinders are routinely delivered to the District Storage Yard by an offsite chemical supplier, that varies based on economic value and costs.  The one-ton cylinders are transported using a super-duty one-and-a half-ton truck to six (6) chlorine injection"

These sites include Morro Reservoirs 1 & 2, Northside Reservoir, Pala Mesa Reservoir, North Reservoir, and Beck Reservoir.  All of these sites, except for the North Reservoir, has a single one-ton chlorine gas cylinder that exceeds the State threshold quantity.   The North Reservoir has four (4) 150-pound cylinders instead of the one-ton cylinder. A separate Risk Management Plan will be prepared to address these sites, as agreed upon by the San Diego County Department of Environmental Health, Hazardous Materials Division.   Figure 1-5 shows the District Storage Yard layout.\n\nWhen the cylinders are empty, District personnel pick up the cylinders and replace the empty ones with full ones from the District Storage Yard.   The empty cylinders are stored temporarily at the District Storage Yard and picked up by the offsite chemical supplier in exchange for new full cylinders.   Personnel mark the used-cylinders \"empty\" or \"partial\" in the storage area in order to distinguish them from the full or new cylinders.  Administrative controls are in place to ensure safe storage and transport.   No more than seven (7) full one-ton cylinders and ten (10) 150-pound cylinders are stored onsite at the District Storage Yard.  The chlorine gas cylinders are stored on a concrete pad that is enclosed by a chain-link fence with two gates and asphalt roof.  Usage rates vary from one month to several months, up to one year for each station.  Turn-around time never exceeds one year for each injection site.  \n\nAn offsite-consequence analysis, using the worst-case scenario for an accidental release of chlorine gas is provided in Section 4 of this plan.  The worst-case scenario consists of failure of a full one-ton chlorine gas cylinder and 150-pound chlorine gas cylinder, releasing chlorine gas at ground level over a ten "

This release is based on worst-case weather conditions, outdoor operations, and is the distance at which chlorine gas no longer poses a hazard to the public.  The worst-case release scenario is modeled using the methodology identified in the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), \"Risk Management Program Guidance For Wastewater Treatment Plants\", EPA 550-B-98-010.    The chlorine gas cylinders are designed to withstand a 45 miles per hour (mph) impact.   Also, an alternate scenario that is more likely to occur than the worst-case release scenario is provided in this section.   The alternate release scenario consists of a punctured hole or small leak on a full chlorine gas cylinder.  The alternate release scenario is modeled using the EPA air dispersion model T-SCREEN( (Version 3.0, Britter-McQuaid model, 1992).   The distance to the toxic endpoint is 3 miles for the one-ton cylinder and 150-pound cylinder. \n\nAdministrative controls and procedures are in place to quickly identify problems associated with leaking cylinders.   Leaking cylinders are repaired in a timely manner in order to minimize releases.   Proper chlorine gas handling procedures are in place to ensure safe handling, loading and off-loading by operations personnel.   A chlorine emergency repair kit is used to contain any valve leaks detected during normal operations.  Employee training and HAZMAT personal protective equipment are available and are used to safely repair this kind of problem.  Work orders are prepared by personnel to ensure that safety equipment maintenance and repair are properly completed in a timely manner.  An effective training program for employees and participation in simulated exercises or drills ensures management's commitment to general release prevention. \n\nThere have been no accidents or anyone offsite inju"
