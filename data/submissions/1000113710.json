Furthermore, the facility works with the city, fire department, and the St. Louis County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) to ensure their emergency response plans include response information for the Polynt - Valley Park facility. \n\nPolynt will respond positively to requests for information from outside agencies and the public.  Facility tours are provided for first responders, the Valley Park Fire Department, emergency medical/ambulance service, and the St. Louis County Police Department.\n\nTransportation of hazardous materials within the local area is included in planning activities.  The ERP considers chemical distribution safety and emergency response capabilities of local agencies by utilizing CHEMTREC, state, and local networks.\n\nEmployees are trained and familiar with the contents of the plan and their roles and responsibilities as specified in the plan. The facility is planning to perform drills involving the LEPC, fire department, and the city of Valley Park. These drills can include field exercises or tabletop exercises. The Emergency Response Plan is reviewed annually and updated, as needed. The ERP is also revised based on deficiencies from drills or incidents.\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nPolynt works with employees, vendors, and corporate EHS support staff and incorporates corrective actions identified through programs, such as mechanical integrity inspections, incident investigations, compliance audits and PHA studies to continually improve the safety of processes.  Polynt will continue to evaluate and document analyses of safer technologies."

Reports are developed for all TDI incidents. Reports include, at a minimum, injuries, fatalities, personnel evaluated, and included in shelter in place, impact on the environment, emergency response actions, and cause(s). The regulations require the reporting of RMP events involving regulated substances that result in deaths, injuries or significant property damage on site, or known deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering-in-place, property damage, or environmental damage off-site or other off-site consequences. \n\nThe facility maintains an accurate list of all TDI near misses and incidents. This is used during revisions to the plant Emergency Response Plan, employee training, Process Hazard Analyses (PHAs), and procedures. When there is a RMP accident, the facility notifies regulatory agencies. The facility will also plan and hold a public meeting within 90 days following the RMP accident. \n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nPolynt has a comprehensive Emergency Response Plan (ERP) that is coordinated with St. Louis County Emergency Management and Valley Park Fire Department.  The ERP provides clear roles and responsibilities, procedures, and corrective measures to be used in the event of an emergency that could threaten human health or the environment.  Along with emergency response procedures, the plan includes preparedness and prevention, notification, and post-emergency recovery procedures designed to minimize injuries to personnel and damage to property in the event of a fire, explosion, hazardous material release, utility outage, bomb threa"

Information pertaining to this assessment is included in the RMP data elements.\n\n\nACCIDENT PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nPolynt is dedicated to continuous improvement of its comprehensive Environmental, Health and Safety (EH&S) Program, which includes compliance with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) Process Safety Management regulations (29 CFR 1910.119). Employees are highly trained, knowledgeable, and skilled, which results in a workforce that is very capable in their job performance. Employees are supplied with detailed information concerning their job duties, chemicals on site, and operating the processes. The OSHA Process Safety Management Program is used to identify, correct, review, and mitigate potential hazards associated with chemical processes.  Employee participation in the development and implementation of these programs is essential to ensure employee understanding and compliance with each element of the programs.\n\nPolynt has developed a strong Contractor Safety and Management Program. Contractors and their employees are treated as though they are Polynt employees, while performing work at the Valley Park facility. Contractors are trained on Polynt processes and procedures, expected to participate, as necessary, in incident investigations, and are held to the same standards of performance as Polynt employees.\n\nFinally, in an effort to continually improve these programs, regular audits are performed to determine the facility's implementation and operation under these programs.

(\u0093Polynt\u0094) is committed to operating the Valley Park facility in a manner that is safe for our employees, the community, and the environment.  As part of this commitment, Polynt has established a Risk Management Program that helps the company to identify and communicate risks associated with our operations and reasonable controls have been established to prevent accidental releases from occurring.  In the unlikely event of a release of hazardous materials from the facility, specific plans are in place to reduce the effects upon our employees and the general public.  Polynt has developed site-specific plans for emergency response that involve both our employees and local emergency service providers.  These plans are in compliance with the U.S. EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) plan requirements and follow the format provided by the RMP Data Elements published by the U.S. EPA (EPA form 8700-25).\n\n\nPROCESSES AND SUBSTANCES SUBJECT TO 40 CFR PART 68\n\nPolynt\u0092s Valley Park facility uses toluene diisocyanate (TDI), to produce a variety of urethane coatings and other resins.  TDI is onsite in quantities greater than the applicability threshold and therefore is subject to the RMP regulation.  In addition to TDI, Polynt uses numerous other chemicals that are not subject to the RMP regulation.\n\nPhysical security of the plant is maintained by a chain link fence topped by barbed wire that encompasses the site. Site activities are monitored by 23 TV cameras, with monitor screens located in the guard house and other plant computers. A security guard is on duty 24 hours a day, seven days a week.\n\n\nOFF-SITE CONSEQUENCE ASSESSMENT\n\nAs part of the Risk Management Program, Polynt has conducted an assessment of the off-site consequences of the worst-case and alternative releases. The worst-case release is defined as the sudden release of the entire contents of the single vessel containing the largest"
