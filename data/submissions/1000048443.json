At this Facility, MGB engages in the formulation, distribution and sale of chemicals (i.e. retail) to customers and the contracted production of an ammonium polyphosphate fluid fertilizer for retail sales.\r\nThis submittal provides estimates of the offsite consequences of an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia from the Gunter Facility located at 602 W. Main, Gunter, TX 75058. It also summarizes the policies and procedures implemented by the facility to minimize the likelihood of an accident and the actions taken to ensure that a response to a release will be implemented in a proper and timely manner.\r\nPURPOSE FOR UPDATING RMP\r\nMGB is submitting this RMP to include the portable contractor operations, to remove the ammonia nurse tank sales operation and to raise the program level from a 2 to a 3.\r\nFACILITY\r\nThe operations at the Gunter facility consist of agricultural chemical storage and handling, blending, retail sale and distribution. As related to the PSM/RMP programs, the Gunter facility stores and handles one covered chemical (i.e. anhydrous ammonia) at quantities that exceed the threshold quantity established by EPA and OSHA (10,000#). Two covered processes are operated at this Facility and they include:                                                  \r\nCovered Process 1: Stationary Storage (Anhydrous Ammonia) \r\nCovered Process 2: Fertilizer Blending using contract portable pipe             reactor.\r\nAt this Facility, anhydrous ammonia is blended with water and phosphoric acid to make ammonium polyphosphate. Ammonium polyphosphate is a liquid fertilizer that is used by farmers on a seasonal basis. Covered process equipment used in this process includes a stationary storage tank (old railcar) for the storage of the anhydrous ammonia a"

      "SummaryText": "nd a Mobile Pipe Reactor (MPR).  MGB owns the storage tank and the ammonia.  The MPR is owned and operated by an Independent Fertilizer Reacting Contractor (IFRC).\r\nMGB orders anhydrous ammonia from a chemical vendor and the chemical vendor ships the anhydrous ammonia to the facility in tank trucks. The chemical vendor personnel unload the ammonia into the storage tank in accordance with established operating procedures. When the IFRC arrives at the facility, he connects to the storage tank with his equipment/hoses and assumes responsibility for the safe transfers and operations using ammonia from the connection point to his portable operations.  When the IFRC has completed his operations, the IFRC disconnects from the storage tank and removes his equipment from the site.  MGB maintains the responsibility for the storage tank and any residual ammonia that is left over after the reacting is completed.\r\nOFF-SITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\r\nWorst case and alternative case offsite consequence analyses were completed for the ammonia storage process and the reaction process. The worst-case release scenario is the same for both processes because the storage tank is common to both.  The worst-case scenario was modeled (using EPA Comp) as if the storage tank was catastrophically ruptured and the entire contents (40,000# of ammonia) were released within a 10-minute time frame.\r\nThe alternative scenarios are different for the two processes. For the stationary storage process, the alternative consequence analysis assumes that a theft or attempted theft of ammonia, for manufacturing Meth, results in a valve being left partly open and ammonia being released to the environment (actual occurrence in past).  For the reaction process, the alternative consequence analysis assumes that a 2-inch liquid transfer hose on the suction side of the ammonia pump is severed during the operation. \r\nACCIDENT PREVENTION PROGRAM&#8232;\r\nThe Branch Manager implements the risk management planning process a"

The Branch Manager is responsible for ensuring that Facility Operators are properly trained in the implementation of the Program 3 Accident Prevention Program elements.  The Branch Manager is responsible for managing the IFRC in accordance with the Contractor PSM/RMP requirements. The IFRC is responsible for ensuring that its Operators are properly trained in the implementation of its OSHA PSM accident prevention program.\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\r\nMGB's Gunter Facility is a non-responding facility. The Facility has coordinated emergency response activities with its local emergency response agency and local fire department.\r\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\nThere have been no on-site deaths, injuries, or significant property damage; or off-site deaths, injuries, property damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place, in the past five (5) years. \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThe Risk Management Plan implemented by Helena Chemical Company at the Abernathy Facility complies with the requirements of the Clean Air Act, Section 112(r). The RMP will be updated as the Abernathy Facility adds, deletes, or changes processes. The Emergency Action Plan has been coordinated with the Gunter Fire Department."
