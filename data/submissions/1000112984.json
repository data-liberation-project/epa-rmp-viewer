Since that time, we have used best engineering practices to ensure our systems would operate as intended.  All changes or additions to the processes now undergo a formal review and approval procedure (Management of Change).  This triggers hazard analysis and design safety reviews as necessary.  We have concrete dikes to catch any spilled materials.\n\nValve systems are designed with keyed locks to ensure that valves are operated as required for the process. \n\nOn a regular schedule a site walk-through is conducted to review critical valve positions, valve locks, detection of leaks inside and outside of dikes, and the  status of the plant site in general.   If we find a valve, pipe, tank, or pump that might fail and allow a release or an incident, we will correct it immediately.\n\nMaintenance:  We have formal mechanical integrity and preventative maintenance programs in place.  Tank inspections and preventative tasks for critical equipment identified with site Process Hazard Analyses are in place, and operators recheck equipment after maintenance has been completed before operating it.  \n\nSafe Operations:  Our employees are essential to the safe operation of our plant.  Their training, their experience, their observations, and their knowledge of how to respond to situations is the basis of safe operations.  These people apply their knowledge and training in their everyday actions.

This resulted in an endpoint of 1.15 miles from the site.  Within the ACS estimated impact area using Marplot 2010 census data, a total population of approximately 1,800 could be affected.

These other flammable materials, however, are not regulated under RMP.  Regardless, we have systems in place for these flammable materials that are designed to prevent accidents and to respond to accidents if they occur.\n\nChromascape Piedmont has policies and safeguards to prevent releases and minimize hazards from flammable materials.

In addition, vessels are equipped with conservation vents with flame arrestors to prevent venting and mitigate the impact of a potential fire. \n\nIn the event of a fire on the plant site, our employees are equipped with fire-fighting equipment and are trained to evaluate the magnitude of the fire and if it is within their capability, to fight it until outside assistance arrives.  \n\nAccident History:  In the past five years, this facility has had no incidents with RMP regulated materials causing an offsite consequence.  \n\nGoals:  The goal at Chromascape Piedm"

In comparison to RMP Comp, ALOHA calculations were completed by adding physical property data for the formaldehyde solution used at the Piedmont site (but not taking credit for passive mitigation) and resulted in an endpoint of only 2.4 miles from the site.  We would consider the ALOHA model a more realistic WCS model and impact area than the RMP Comp calculation due to using actual formaldehyde solution physical property data as a basis.  \n\nWithin the calculated affected area based on the ALOHA model and using Marplot 2010 census data, a total population of approximately 8500 could potentially be affected.  The area of impact includes residential, commercial, industrial facilities, and schools.  There could potentially be a higher number of people affected during business hours or due to traffic passing through the area on local roads.\n\nAlternative Scenarios Overview:  While the alternative scenario discussed below is still unlikely to occur, it is more likely to happen than the Worst Case Scenario discussed above.  In the Alternative Case Scenario for formaldehyde solution, EPA\u0092s Offsite Guidance allows us to presume our safety processes, our safety programs, our safety equipment, and our people will be available for response.  While this scenario is more likely to happen than the Worst Case and is the scenario used for Emergency Planning, our safety procedures are designed to prevent them from happening.\n\nAlternative Case Scenario \u0096 Analysis of our systems indicate that the most likely toxic scenario would be a liquid release from an open 3/4 vent, a drain valve, or a small rupture in transfer piping, or a failed gasket at the storage tank.   A release of this magnitude, occurring in such a manner would be contained within the tank truck\u0092s or the tank's diked areas.

Our handling and processing of formaldehyde takes the hazards of the material into consideration.  We receive tank truck shipments of formaldehyde solution which are transferred into a stabilizer solution of water and acetone.  The vessel the formaldehyde is transferred into is an atmospheric tank with conservation vent to minimize pressure, emissions, and protect the tank from vacuum during transfer to the reaction vessel.\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis:\nWorst Case Scenario \u0096 Toxic Chemical Analysis of our processes showed the Worst Case Scenario to be the sudden and complete loss of a truck of formaldehyde solution.  The only safety precautions that Risk Management allows to be considered in the Worst Case Scenario are passive mitigation devices.  In our case, the stabilized formaldehyde solution is surrounded by concrete dike containment.  The supplier\u0092s tank truck of formaldehyde solution, however, sits in a separate containment area outside of the tank dike.  This tank truck containment area is currently a portable containment apparatus, but there is a project in place to install a permanent concrete curbing containment area.  \n\nThe contents of a ruptured or leaking truck would empty into the contained unloading pad, which would drain into a sump or be pumped into the adjacent tank concrete dike until transferred into sealed bulk containers by Chromascape employees. This routing would limit the surface area from which formaldehyde could evaporate.  \n\nRMP Comp disallows the inclusion of passive mitigation elements in our case due to the handling temperature of formaldehyde solution received even though it is well below the boiling point of the solution (elevated temperature is required for the grade of formaldehyde received to ensure quality stability).
