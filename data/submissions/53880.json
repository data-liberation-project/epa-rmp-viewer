The prevention program consists of the following elements:\n\n- Employee Participation Program \n- Process Safety Information \n- Process Hazard Analysis \n-  Operating Procedures\n-  Training Program\n- Contractor Safety Program\n-  Pre-Startup Safety Review Procedures\n- Mechanical Integrity Program\n-  Hot Work Permit Procedures\n- Management of Change Procedures\n- Incident Investigation Procedures\n- Compliance Audit Procedures\n\n\nD.   Five-Year Accident History\n\nNo ammonia-related accidents have occurred at the San Jose plant over the past five years that resulted in significant of-site or offsite consequences. \n\n\nE.   Description of the Emergency Response Program\n\nAn emergency response program has been implemented at the San Jose Plant.  This program contains procedures describing how the facility will respond to ammonia spills and other emergencies, including evacuation procedures.  \n\nThe plant has an on-site employee response team trained to enter and stop an accidental ammonia release.  This team meets regularly for training and practice drills.\n\n\nF. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThe Eggo Company is committed to operating our ammonia refrigeration system in a safe and responsible manner.  We are continually evaluating our equipment and procedures to meet this objective."

      "SummaryText": "The Eggo Company manufacturers a variety of waffles at our facility in San Jose.  We have produced waffles in San Jose since 1962.  We have a strong commitment to operate our facility in a safe and responsible manner.\n\nAmmonia is used at our facility as the cooling medium in our refrigeration system.  Similar to the function Freon plays in a home or car air conditioning system, ammonia is used to cool the air in our industrial freezers and product coolers.  The ammonia is contained in a closed loop system; it is designed to remain inside the piping and vessels in our facility.  We believe that ammonia provides the safest and most efficient cooling choice for our operation.\n\n\nA. Describe the Accident Release Prevention and Emergency Policies\n\nThe Eggo Company takes many precautions to prevent or minimize accidental releases of ammonia from the refrigeration system.  Any release from the ammonia system is detected by sensors, which automatically start a ventilation system.  The ventilation system routes the air into a scrubber, which removes ammonia before exhausting the air into the environment.  Other precautions include safety controls (alarms and automatic shutdown devices) which are designed to identify and prevent potentially unsafe conditions like pressure increases that could cause a system failure.  We also have a preventive maintenance program designed to maintain the on-going integrity of the systems, a training program designed to ensure that the systems are operated by qualified personnel, and emergency response procedures that enable trained personnel to respond quickly to system upsets.\n\nThe Technical Manager is responsible for the management of these ammonia safety programs.\n\n\nB.   Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe Eggo Company's San Jose plant produces waffles for sale to the public.  Ammonia is the only substance covered by the Accidental Release Prevention Regulations handled at the San Jose plant.\n\n\nC.   Description of the Acc"
