The process is regulated by Cal OSHA Process Safety Management of Acutely Hazardous Materials, Title 8 California Code of Regulations 5189 and 19 California Code of Regulations 2735 California Accidental Release Prevention Program.  This is a RMP/CalARP Program Level 3 facility.  The facility is in the process of implementing a prevention program described below.\n\nThe Rocklin LPG Terminal has a commitment to employee and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases.  However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.  \n\nThe prevention program exceeds the requirements of this regulation and includes the following: Employee Participation, Process Safety Information, Process Hazard Analysis, Operating Procedures, Training, Contractor Evaluation, Contractors and Visitor Orientation, Pre-Job Start-Up Review, Mechanical Integrity, Code of Safe Work Practices (Hot Work Permit, Confined Space Entry, Control of Hazardous Energy), Management of Change, Incident Investigation, Emergency Planning and Response, and Compliance Audits. \n\nTraining includes employee responsibilities in the process safety management program, National Propane Gas Association-certified employee training program, hotwork permit procedure, code of safe work practices, and operating procedures.  All visitors onto the property must undergo a site safety orientation and check in prior to each visit. Planned changes to improve safety have been established based on compliance with the process safety management audits every three years and revalidation of the process hazard analysis every five years.

There are 18 tanks with a capacity of approximately 30,000 gallons and 11 permanent rail tank cars with a capacity of approximately 31,000 gallons.  The tanks are administratively controlled to hold liquefied petroleum gasoline at 85% maximum capacity, 25,000 gallons and 26,350 gallons respectively.  \n\nCoast Energy Group maintains an emergency response plan in compliance with local emergency response agencies.  The Rocklin LPG Terminal has a Hazardous Materials Business Plan on file with the Placer County Environmental Health Department - Certified Unified Program Agency.  \n\nIn the event of an accidental release, the facility operators are trained to sound the alarm, shut off the source from a safe location or activate one of the emergency shutdown devices, contact 9-1-1 and secure the area.  The 9-1-1 system is used to notify the Fire Department.\n\nBased on the criteria set forth 40 CFR 68.10 and 19 CCR 2735.4, this facility has not had an accidental release.  This information was verified by the reviewing of records from the Placer County Environmental Health Department - Certified Unified Program Agency and from internal records.  \n\nThe worst case release scenario is based on a version of the Baker-Strehlow vapor cloud explosion model created by Wilfred Baker Engineering, Inc.  The worse case release simulation of 110,742 pounds of propane resulted in a 1 psi explosion overpressure distance of 0.07 miles.  This simulation assumed medium fuel reactivity, medium obstruction and a 3-dimensional expansion. This distance impacts public receptors of adjacent industrial areas and no resident population.  In addition, although there are numerous controls in place, none were taken into account for evaluating the worst case scenario.  The alternative release scenario for this process is a hose rupture while pumping propane.  This scenario was modeled using CANARY b"

This scenario assumed the pump continued to operate at a rate of 430 gallons per minute (gpm) for 10 minutes after the hose ruptured.  In addition, a 3 meter/second wind speed, an atmospheric stability of \"D\" (neutrally buoyant), a 70% relative humidity and an ambient temperature of 100F were assumed.  The simulation calculated that 16,463 pounds of material were released in the assumed time frame.  The resulting simulated vapor cloud traveled 0.10 miles downwind to reach the lower flammable limit (LFL) for propane (2.1%).  Mitigation measures were taken into account when evaluating the alternative release scenario.  In general, the process does have mitigation measures consisting of relief valves, check valves, manual shutoff valves, automatic shutoffs, startup and operating procedures, grounding equipment, and excess flow devices.  The facility operator and truck driver are also in attendance during transfer operations.\n\nThe engineering and administrative controls in place have been established to reduce the risk of an accidental release of identified hazards.  Coast Energy Group is committed to operations which are safe for employees and the surrounding community."
