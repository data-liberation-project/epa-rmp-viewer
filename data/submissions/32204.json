Argo incorporates all the elements of the Program 3 Prevention program, worst\u00bfcase scenario analysis, alternative release analysis, 5-year history, document management system, process safety information, training, mechanical integrity, incident investigation, compliance audit, management of change, pre-startup review, employee participation, hot work permits and emergency response plan.\r\n\r\n(b)\tThe stationary sources and the regulated substances handled are:\r\n\r\nCompressed Chlorine Gas\r\nArgo Chemical handles this product in one ton and in 150 pounds pressurized cylinders.

The cylinders are received via truck and unloaded using a forklift.  The full cylinders are stored by securing them with chains to storage cradles made of steel. For delivery to clients, the cylinders are loaded using a forklift onto the bed of a truck on which they are secured with straps during transport.\r\n\r\nAqua Ammonia\r\nThis product, handled in bulk, is stored in a 15,000 and two 11,000-gallon tanks. It is loaded into shipping containers using pumps and, hoses with vapor return to the vessel from which the product is being removed.  \r\n\r\n(c)\tIn the highly unlikely event (worst-case scenario) of a mechanical failure of one of the cylinders containing a compressed gas, a release of the contents of the cylinder may occur and have offsite consequences.  An alternative scenario involves a release of the compressed gas through a 1/8-inch in diameter hole in the cylinder wall caused by corrosion.  Minimum offsite consequences may result from such an alternative release scenario. \r\nIn the case of aqua ammonia, the worst-case scenario is a release of the entire contents of the tank in 10 minutes. An alternative scenario is the release of 500 gallons in 10 minutes. In the case of anhydrous ammonia, the worst-case scenario is the release of the entire contents of one 1000-gallon storage tank; an alternate scenario is the release of 35 gallons per minute of anhydrous ammonia for a period lasting 10 minutes.\r\nThe entire anhydrous ammonia and aqua ammonia handling facility has a water deluge system capable of delivering 100 gallons per minute of water in a form of a spray covering the plant in its entirety.\r\n\r\n(d)\tArgo Chemical has in place an accidental release prevention program, which, among others, includes Process Safety Information, Process Hazard Analysis, Operating Instruction"
