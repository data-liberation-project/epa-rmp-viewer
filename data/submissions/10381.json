If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to \nnotify the Southwestern New Hampshire District Fire Mutual Aid System (911 or 603-352-1100).  The \nMutual Aid Dispatcher then notifies the local fire, police, and emergency response services required to \nrespond to that particular emergency.\n\nFacility description and regulated substances handled:  Troy Mills Inc. is a manufacturer of non-woven \nneedle punched textile goods for distribution to automotive, filtration, apparel and home furnishings \nindustries internationally.  Activities at this facility include administrative/accounting, marketing, \nmanufacturing, R & D, warehousing and distribution functions.  Our present maintained maximum \ninventory of propane is above the threshold quantity for propane as determined under 40 CFR 68.115, \nrequiring us to comply with 40 CFR 68 - Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions.  This facility utilizes \npropane for rolled goods processing (drying & singeing) as well as heating of warehouse and office space.  \nThis system consists of one 30,000 gallon tank (Tank #1), one 15,000 gallon tank (Tank #2), and \nassociated piping, vaporizers, valves, burners and other miscellaneous equipment.  The tanks are located on \nopposite sides of a 19 acre parcel, approximately 750 feet apart.  The tanks are interconnected by 2 \nindependent 2\u0014 lines with normally closed valving located inside the facility.  Per 40 CFR 68.10, Troy \nMills Inc. meets RMP Program 2 eligibility requirements.\n\nThe worst-case and alternative release scenarios:  Troy Mills worst-case scenario is a failure of the \ninterconnected storage system with both tanks (one 30,000-gallon and one 15,000-gallon) filled to the \ngreatest co"

      "SummaryText": "ntrolled amount allowed (88% capacity @ 60 F), resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  The \nresulting distance to the endpoint extends offsite, and public receptors are within the distance to the \nendpoint.  Our alternative scenario is a break in a 2\u0014 vapor line directly connected to Tank #1 (30,000-\ngallon), leading to a 20-minute release and resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  The resulting distance to \nthe endpoint extends offsite, and public receptors are within the distance to the endpoint.\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps:  This facility \ncomplies with EPA\u0012s Chemical Accident Prevention rule and all applicable federal, state and local codes \nand regulations.  This facility propane system is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with \nNFPA-58 and New Hampshire state law.\n\nFive -year accident history:  Troy Mills New Hampshire facility has never had an accident involving our \npropane system that caused death, injury, property or environmental damage, evacuation, or sheltering in \nplace.\n\nThe emergency response program:  Troy Mills has developed and maintains Troy Mills Contingency Plan \nand Emergency Procedures.  Included in this plan are procedures in the event of an emergency involving \nour propane system.  It is our policy to notify the Southwestern New Hampshire District Fire Mutual Aid \nSystem (911 or 603-352-1100) requesting emergency response.  The Mutual Aid Dispatcher then notifies \nthe local fire, police, and emergency response services required to respond to that particular emergency.  \nWe have discussed this policy with the Troy Fire Department and members of the fire department have \ninspected our propane system.\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety: None."
