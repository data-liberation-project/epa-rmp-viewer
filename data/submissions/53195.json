This commitment is evident by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as employee training and consideration of safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement controls to prevent potential releases of hazardous chemicals.  However, if a release does occur, our well-trained personnel will respond to mitigate the release. \n \n DESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED\n BASF FINA Petrochemicals complex is a joint venture between the BASF Corporation and TOTAL Chemicals.  SABINA Petrochemicals is a joint venture between the BASF Corporation, TOTAL Petrochemicals, and Shell Chemical. This complex is operated by BASF and is located in Port Arthur, TX adjacent to the TOTAL Refinery.  The sites steam cracker receives naptha feed from the adjacent Total refinery.

The goal of each investigation is to perform a root cause analysis and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.

All affected chemical hazard information, process-operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures are updated to incorporate these changes.  All affected personnel are trained on applicable changes.\n \n PRE-STARTUP SAFETY REVIEWS (PSSRs)\n BASF conducts a PSSR for any new facility or modification to the existing facility that requires a change in the process safety information.  A PSSR is conducted prior to startup to ensure that: (1) all equipment is installed per design, (2) all procedures are updated to reflect changes, (3) all affected employees are trained on the new procedures, (4) and if a PHA was performed, all action items are closed or that the change was handled under the MOC program. The PSSR review team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness. In addition, a PSSR requires field verification of the construction and serves as a quality assurance function.\n \n COMPLIANCE AUDITS\n The BASF Corporate Ecology and Safety Auditing Group conduct PSM/RMP compliance audits of the site utilizing the necessary personnel to address PSM/RMP specified req"

      "SummaryText": "all facets of risk management and accident prevention. Employee participation can include, but is not limited to, (1) updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information, (2) Pre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSR\u00bfs), (3) employee safety observation program, (4) participating as a member of a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) revalidation team, (5) Participation in Incident Investigations (6) in addition to a number of other teams to promote both process safety and personal safety.  Specific ways that employees can be involved in Employee Participation Element of PSM is documented in the PSM/RMP manual.  The various safety teams typically have members from various areas of the plant, including operations, maintenance, electrical/instrumentation, engineering, and plant management. \n \n SAFE WORK PRACTICES\n BASF has long-standing history of safe work practices to help ensure worker and process safety.  Examples of these include (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, such as contractors, (2) a Lock/Tag/Try  Procedure to verify isolation of potential energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) procedures for safe removal of hazardous materials before process piping or equipment is opened, (4) a permit and procedure to control spark-producing activities (i.e., hot work), and (5) a permit and procedure to confirm adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space. In addition to these \u00bfnon-standard\u00bf work activities, BASF also permits all routine and non-routine maintenance work.  These procedures, along with training of all personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed in a safe manner.\n \n CONTRACTORS\n BASF uses contractors as part of its regular on site work force in addition to periods of increased maintenance or construction activities. All contract companies must be pre-qualified through EMR and injury rates to be allowed to bid for work in the facility. Each"

      "SummaryText": "contract employee must be trained by an industrial safety training council facility before they are allowed to work in the complex. Contractors work on or near process equipment therefore, the plant has procedures in place to verify that contractors  (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills to perform the task, (3) are aware of the hazards in their work area, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, (6) and inform plant personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.  This will be accomplished by providing contractors with a general Process Overview and information about site safety and health hazards.  In addition, all contractors are trained on the Emergency Response Plan requirements and safe work practices prior to their issuance of a permit to work. BASF evaluates and places priority on contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor.  Plant personnel monitor contractor performance to help ensure that contractors are abiding by their safety obligations. Contractors participate in regular facility emergency drills.\n \n RELEASE PREVENTION STEPS\n The processes at BASF have hazards that must be managed to help ensure continued safe operation. In order to prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and/or human errors BASF has put several safety systems in place to help: contain/control a release, quickly detect a release, and mitigate the consequences of a release. The following types of safety features are used throughout the facility:\n \n \n Release Detection\n-Gas Detectors (%LEL) with Alarms\n- Benzene Detectors\n- Hydrogen Sulfide Detectors\n- Ammonia Detectors\n Release Containment/Control\n All process relief valves discharge to the flare/thermal oxidizer\n Automated Shutdown Systems for specific process parameters\n Redundant equipment and instrumentation\n Uninterruptible Power"
