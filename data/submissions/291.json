The accidental release prevention and emergency response policies.\n\nThe Mississippi Gulf Coast Regional Wastewater Authority's Emergency Response Plan is used to provide clear, concise directions during an emergency. Its function is to prevent physical harm to the staff, the public, or the plant facilities.\n\nThis plan is a key to preparedness and was developed using EPA guidelines. The Emergency Response Plan includes a series of action plans for specific situations and lists emergency supplies, emergency organizations and emergency phone numbers.\n\nThe Emergency Response Plan is comprised of the following action plans for emergency situations:\n\n*   Emergency Phone Numbers\n*   First Aid Procedures\n*   Chemical Emergencies\n*   Electrical Emergencies\n*   Weather Emergencies\n*   Material Safety Data Sheets\n\nInsofar as possibe, every contingency has been covered under the Authority's Emergency Response Plan.\n\nThe Authority's wastewater treatment facilities have safety systems for the prevention of an accidental release.  These systems include the following:\n\n*   Leak Detector System\n*   Call-Out System\n*   Safety Inspections\n\nThe leak detector system is connected to an audible alarm horn and warning light located on the chlorine/sulfur dioxide storage building. In the event of a leak,  the alarm system will activate and alert plant personnel or the call-out man via the plant's automatic dialing alarm system (ADAS). Responding personnel then implement the Emergency Response Plan and follow the pertinent procedure.\n\nThe call-out system provides the Authority with a dedicated employee available 24 hours a day to respond to emergency situations at the wastewater facilities.\n\nThe safety inspections are conducted by the Safety Committee by use of an inspection check list. These inspections are conducted on a semi-annual basis. The inspections are reviewed by each department head and any s"

      "SummaryText": "afety infraction is corrected. The safety inspection ensures that a safe working environment is maintained at all times.\n\nWith the use of these safety systems, the Authority provides safety of not only plant personnel, but the community around the facilities.\n\n2. The stationary source and regulated substance handled.\n\nGautier Regional Wastewater Treatment plant treats domestic wastewater from the city of Gautier.\n\nChlorine is applied to the treatment plant effluent for the purpose of disinfection and sulfur dioxide is used for chlorine removal prior to discharge to the West Pascagoula River.\n\nThe facility stores two one-ton containers of chlorine and two one-ton containers of sulfur dioxide. This equates to a four month supply on hand. The facililty operates with one container on line and one container on stand-by.\n\n3. The worst-case release scenario:\n\nThe worst-case release scenario was based on the failure of a storage container containing 2,000 pounds of chlorine, with a 10 minute release time.\n\nUtilizing urban conditions with a wind speed of 1.5 meters per second, class F stability, the toxic end point would be 0.0075 at a distance of 5.4 miles.\n\nThe residential population within this distance is 41,000. Public and environmental receptors within the distance that would be affected include schools, hospitals, prisons, recreational areas, industrial areas, state parks, monuments, and a wildlife refuge.\n\nAlternate-case release scenario number one:\n\nThe alternate-case release scenario number one was based on the failure of a storage container containing 2,000 pounds of chlorine, with a 10 minute release time.\n\nUtilizing urban conditions with a wind speed of 3.0 meters per second, class D stability, the toxic end point would be 0.0075 at a distance of 2.0 miles.\n\nThe residential population within this distance is 15,500. Public and environmental receptors within the distance that would be affected include schools, prisons, recreational areas, and a wildlife refuge.\n\n"

      "SummaryText": "Alternate-case release scenario number two:\n\nThe alternate-case release scenario number two was based on the failure of a storage container containing 2,000 pounds of sulfur diioxide, with a 10 minute release time.\n\nUtilizing urban conditions with a wind speed of 3.0 meters per second, class D stability, the toxic end point would be 0.0075 at a distance of 2.0 miles.\n\nThe residential population within this distance is 15,500. Public and environmental receptors within the distance that would be affected include schools, prisons, recreational areas, and a wildlife refuge.\n\nThe chlorine/sulfur dioxide building is covered and partially enclosed. This minimizes the potential for overheating of the ton container.\nThe gas feeder on the container is designed to shut off the supply of gas in case of a line breakage.\n\nThe chlorine/sulfur dioxide building is also equipped with a leak detector system. In the event of a leak, the alarm will activate, alerting the plant personnel. This provides for immediate response to a leak by plant personnel.\n\n4. The accidental release prevention program.\n\nThere are several key steps to the Gautier Regional Wastewater Treatment plant's prevention plan.  These include the following:\n\n*   Call-out System\n*   Leak Detector System\n*   Safety Inspections\n*   Safety Training\n\n5. Five-year accident history.\n\nThe Gautier plant has not had an accidental release of chlorine or sulfur dioxide over the past five years.\n\n6. Emergency Response Program.\n\nThe Authority participates in the Community Right to Know, SARA Title III Tier 2. This is provided to the Mississippi Emergency Management Agency, the Jackson County Civil Defense, and the Gautier Fire Department.\n\n7. Safety Improvements.\n\nThe Authority plans to replace existing leak detectors."
