The property is bounded on three sides by Metro East Industries.  The site runoff water and any possible spill on the site into the site sewer system empty into a 100,000 gallon waste water pit.  The material collected in this pit is analyzed for pH prior being pumped to the local POTW.\n\n\n\nThe Alorton Plant is required to comply with the Solvay Process Hazard Management Program.  This program meets or exceeds the minimum requirements as listed in 29CFR1910.119 OSHA's Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals standard for the same regulated substance - Hydrogen Fluoride and Ammonia - that are also covered by the Clean Air Act (CAA) Section 112 A; or as more commonly referred to as the Risk Management Plan (RMP) program.\n\n\n\n1.    Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:\n\nSolvay Fluorides, LLC., is strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.   This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement controls to prevent possible release of regulated substances.  Safe work practices and training of our personnel supplement the safe design of the plant.  Automatic and manual means of water mitigation are available throughout the process area to reduce the potential effects of accidental release\n\n\n\n2.

These substances are Hydrogen Fluoride/Hydrofluoric Acid and Anhydrous Ammonia.  Hydrogen Fluoride/Hydrofluoric Acid is used for the source of fluoride ion in each of our four products manufactured at our Alorton plant.  Anhydrous Ammonia is used to manufacture Ammonium Fluoride on site.\n\n\n\n3.     The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternate Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigations measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario.\n\n\n\nThis facility has developed worst case and alternative scenarios in accordance with 40 CFR 68.
