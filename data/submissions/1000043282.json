Factors contributing to the incident\n\n?    Root cause of the incident\n\n?    Any recommendations to prevent future incidents\n\n\n\nSynergy Liquids established incident investigation procedures for the RGB and RGP transloading process as follows:\n\n\n\n1.    The facility maintains an updated comprehensive EAP in accordance with OSHA regulations (29 CFR ?1910.38). All operators are trained on the activation of the EAP and their roles. \n\n2.    All product releases are reported following the incident reporting procedures list in the EAP.\n\n3.    Upon completion of the emergency phase of the incident, a formalized incident investigation process is initiated using an investigation form.\n\n\n\nSynergy Liquids will hold an incident review conference call or on-site investigation meeting within 5 days of any incident with injury, evacuation or off site consequence.  Senior operations personnel will lead this call from Synergy Liquids, the operator and other groups or agencies with significant incident involvement.",

These chemicals have been identified by the EPA as having the potential to cause significant off-site consequences in the event of substantial accidental releases:\n\n\n\nRegulated Flammable Substances:\n\ni-Pentane (CAS Number 78-78-4);\n\nn-Pentane (CAS Number 109-66-0);\n\ni-Butane (CAS Number 75-28-5); \n\nn-Butane (CAS Number 106-97-8);\n\nPropylene (CAS Number 115-07-1);\n\nPropane (CAS Number 74-98-6); and\n\nEthane (CAS Number 74-84-0).\n\n\n\nThe maximum inventory of RGB and RGP for the transloading process at the facility is 150,000 gallons.\n\n\n\n1.3 ?68.155(c): Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nSynergy Liquids takes a systematic, proactive approach to preventing accidental releases of flammable substances.  Synergy Liquids has developed a written procedure that lists the conditions and guidelines for safely transloading RGB and RGP from a rail car to a tank truck or vice versa.  This procedure will be followed by the third-party carrier who actually performs the transloading on behalf of Synergy Liquids.  \n\n\n\nBoth RGB and RGP are liquefied flammable gases transported under pressure.  All ignition sources in the vicinity of the transloading operations will be eliminated prior to executing the transloading procedure. \n\n\n\n1.4 ?68.155(d): Five-Year Accident History\n\nOperation of the Trimac Tulsa Transloading Facility will begin in 2014; therefore, there have been no accidents in the past five years.\n\n\n\n1.5 ?68.155(e): Emergency Response Program\n\nSynergy Liquids has coordinated emergency response activities with the Tulsa Fire Department.
