This commitment is reflected in a comprehensive accidental release prevention program. This program addresses the design, installation, operation, maintenance, and employee training associated with the process equipment at the facility. \n\n\n\nBream and Bear, Ltd. senior management is not only committed to offering superior service, but also to maintaining a safety and environmental program to promote a safe environment for all its employees and the surrounding communities. Bream and Bear, Ltd.'s safety and environmental policies as they relate to the ammonia refrigeration system are administered by the Facilities Director, who conducts inspections of the facility to ensure compliance.\n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\n\n\nThe refrigeration cycle begins with the transfer of liquid ammonia from the Evaporative Condensers to the High Pressure Receiver.  The High Pressure Receiver maintains a minimum liquid level to deliver high pressure liquid ammonia to 18 Surge Drums and one (1) Evaporative Cooler Box.  \n\n \n\nThe High Pressure Receiver feeds high pressure liquid ammonia to the Surge Drums that serve the +32?F Evaporators.  High temperature suction from the +32?F High Temperature Recirculator then delivered to the Accumulator.  The Compressors draw high stage suction from the Accumulator.  High stage discharge leaves the compressors and goes to the Evaporative Condenser.  The Evaporative Condenser condenses high stage discharge gas back into liquid and delivers it to the High Pressure Receiver to repeat the process.\n\n  \n\nThe ASME vessels and compressor oil separators are equipped with pressure relief valves.  All of the relief valves are tied into a common relief header that vent to the atmosphere.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nThe Bream and Bear, Ltd. ammon"

For example, the facility operates in accordance with OSHA's Process Safety Management regulation.  Facility maintenance personnel complete a shift log noting operating parameters. All other preventative maintenance and all minor/major repairs are completed by an outside contractor.\n\n\n\nThe facility including the ammonia system was designed and constructed in accordance with applicable codes at the time of construction, which specifically outlines requirements for the safe operation of the ammonia refrigeration system.  These safety features include ammonia sensors in the engine room.  In addition, the majority of the ammonia is maintained inside the engine room and just outside of the engine room (condensers). All pressure vessels are equipped with pressure relief valves that relieve to the atmosphere.\n\n\n\nBream and Bear, Ltd. has developed a preventive maintenance program that utilizes the services of a professional refrigeration contractor to complete regularly scheduled inspections and tests of the ammonia refrigeration system as well as repairs as needed to process equipment.\n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nThere have been no significant releases of ammonia that exceeded the Federal Reportable Quantity of 100 pounds in the past five years (November 2014 - November 2019).  In addition, there have been no injuries resulting from an ammonia release, nor any releases or \"near misses\" that warranted an internal incident investigation.\n\n \n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe Bream and Bear, Ltd. facility has an emergency action plan.  The Emergency Action Plan (Plan) is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of this PSM/RMP document. This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n\n\n  1.)  To save lives.\n\n  2.)  To minimize and avoid injuries.\n\n  3.)  To protect the environm"

To minimize property damage.\n\n\n\nThe operator of the facility maintains a safety committee whose members are the designated emergency coordinators for the facility.  The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures, which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility. This Plan was reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations.\n\n\n\nIn case of an ammonia emergency, the facility plans to evacuate all employees and contractors and activate the facility's action plan to respond to the situation.  If necessary, they will alert the local emergency responders (Adams County Emergency Services) for assistance. The facility plans to coordinate emergency response efforts with the fire department on a periodic and ongoing basis.\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nThe Process Hazards Analysis, conducted on November 14, 2019, including a Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) study and a Facility Inspection, provided mitigation measures to improve safety at the Bream and Bear, Ltd. facility.  The Bream and Bear, Ltd. safety committee is planning to complete several items over the next year, as a continual effort to provide a safe work environment for their employees. \n\n\n\nThese changes include the following items:\n\n\n\n1. Continue to train all employees in the facility Safety Plan/Programs.\n\n\n\n2. Continue to have employee involvement in Safety Plan Development.\n\n\n\n3. Continue employee involvement through safety team participation.\n\n\n\n4. Continue internal and external safety audits/inspections and implement changes as needed.\n\n"
