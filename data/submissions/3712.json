IN THE EVENT THAT AN ACCIDENTAL RELEASE SHOULD OCCUR, WE ARE PREPARED TO WORK WITH OUR LOCAL FIRE DEPARTMENT, EMERGENCY RESPONSE PERSONNEL, AND OTHER APPROPRIATE AUTHORITIES DEEMED APPLICABLE, DEPENDING ON THE SPECIFIC INCIDENT, TO BEST MITIGATE ANY RELEASE AND TO MINIMIZE THE IMPACT OF THE RELEASE TO PEOPLE AND THE ENVIRONMENT.\nFACILITY INFORMATION:  THE PRIMARY ACTIVITY OF OUR COMPANY IS NAICS CODE 49313, \"FARM PRODUCT WAREHOUSING AND STORAGE\".  WE ARE ENGAGED IN PROVIDING \"AGRICULTURAL INPUTS\" THAT INCLUDE THE RECEIVING, STORAGE, AND RELOADING OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA FOR DELIVERY TO FARMERS IN OUR AREA.  THE NAICS CODE THAT WE FEEL MOST APPLICABLE FOR RECEIVING, STORING, AND RELOADING IS #493130 \"FARM PRODUCT WAREHOUSING AND STORAGE\".  ALTHOUGH ANHYDROUS AMMONIA IS THE ONLY PRODUCT SUBJECT TO THE EPA RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAM AT THIS TIME, IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT WE ALSO HANDLE PROPANE FOR BOTH AGRICULTURAL USES AND HOME HEATING, WHICH IS UNDER CONSIDERATION AS A LISTED SUBSTANCE.  WE INCLUDE PROPANE (AS WELL AS ALL AG-CHEMICALS AND PETROLEUN PRODUSCTS) IN OUR PLANNING, TRAINING, AND MAINTENANCE PROGRAMS, HOWEVER ONLY THE ANHYDROUS AMMONIA FACILITIES WILL BE INCLUDED IN THIS REPORT.\n\nANHYDROUS AMMONIA IS RECEIVED, STORED, AND DISTRIBUTED FOR DIRECT APPLICATION TO FARM FIELDS DURING THE EARLY SPRING AND LATE FALL MONTHS.  DURING THE BALANCE OF THE YEAR, INVENTORIES WILL BE STORAGE ONLY, WITH LITTLE IF ANY PRODUCT TRANSFER TAKING PLACE.  FOR APPROXIMATELY ONE WEEK PER YEAR, ANHYDROUS AMMONIA MAY BE INCLUDED IN A PROCESS (T-REACTOR) OF BLENDING TO MAKE A 10-34-0 STARTER GRADE OF LIQUID FERTILIZER.  THE MAXIMUM QUANTITY STORED IN PRESSURIZED PERMANENT STORAGE VESSELS AT THE LOCATION DESCRIBED IS 294,425 POUNDS.  THE MAXIMUM ON SITE VESSEL SIZE IS 30,000 GALLONS, STORING 126,000 POUND"

THE FACILITY IS OPERATED ON A FULL-TIME BASIS WITH STAFF PRESENT DURING REGULAR WORKING HOURS.  TOTAL ANNUAL HOURS ARE APPROXIMATELY 2600 HOURS PER EMPLOYEE.  OUR FACILITIES HAVE ADEQUATE LIGHTING, AND ARE INSPECTED AT VARIOUS TIMES DURING THE DAY.\n\nWORST -CASE RELEASE SCENARIO:  THE \"WORST-CASE  RELEASE SCENARIO\" IS CONSIDERED TO BE THE RELEASE OF THE TOTAL CONTENTS OF OUR LARGEST ANHYDROUS AMMONIA TANK, RELEASED AS A GAS OVER 10 MINUTES.  THE MAXIMUM QUANTITY RELEASED WOULD BE 130,000 POUNDS BASED ON 85% TANK CAPACITY AS LIMITED BY DESIGN STANDARDS.  THE DISTANCE TO THE ENDPOINT IS 2 MILES BASED ON EPA'S RMP-COMP PROGRAM (VERSION 1.06).  POSSIBLE PUBLIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL RECEPTORS WITHIN THE AREA HAVE BEEN PROVIDED TO THE  COUNTY LEPC FOR THEIR CONSIDERATION.\n\nALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO:  AS WE HAVE NOT HAD AN ACTUAL RELEASE OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA DURING THE LAST 5-YEARS AT THE SITE, TO PROVIDE AND EXPERIENCE, WE BELIEVE THE MOST LIKELY RELEASE WOULD BE CAUSED BY A BREAK IN A TRANSFER HOSE.  TRANSFER HOSES ARE PROTECTED BY MANUAL AND SELF CLOSING EXCESS FLOW VALVES SO OUR ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO IS BASED ON THE LOSS OF CONTENTS FROM THE LARGEST HOSE USED.  THE DISTANCE TO THE ENDPOINT IS 0.1 MILE PER INSTRUCTIONS BY EPA GUIDANCE.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PROGRAM:  OUR ANHYDROUS AMMONIA ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PROGRAM IS BASED ON GUIDELINES FOUND IN THE AMERICAN NATIONAL STANDARDS INSTITUTE, INC. STANDARD K-61.1 \"SAFETY REQUIREMENTS FOR THE STORAGE AND HANDLING OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA\"  AND THE U.S. OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH ADMINISTRATION STANDARD 29CFR 1910.111 \"STORAGE AND HANDING OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA\".  WE CONDUCT ANNUAL EMPLOYEE TRAINING ON THE SAFE HANDLING, TRANSPORTATION AND DISTRIBUTION OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA, AND HAVE INSTALLED SAFETY EQUIPMENT INCLUDING, BUT NOT "
