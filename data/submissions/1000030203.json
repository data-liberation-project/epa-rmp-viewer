This commitment is reflected in a comprehensive accidental release prevention program. This program addresses the design, installation, operation, maintenance, and employee training associated with the process equipment at the facility. \n\n\n\nReinhart Foodservice LLC / Agar (Reinhart) senior management is not only committed to offering superior service, but also to maintaining a safety and environmental program to promote a safe environment for all its employees and the surrounding communities. Reinhart's safety and environmental policies as they relate to the ammonia refrigeration system are administered by the Facility Maintenance Manager, who conducts inspections of the facility to ensure compliance.\n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\n\n\nThe refrigeration cycle begins with the transfer of liquid ammonia from the Evaporative Condensers to the Thermosyphon Receiver.  The Thermosyphon Receiver maintains a minimum liquid level to deliver ammonia to the compressors for oil cooling and routes the excess liquid ammonia to the High Pressure Receiver.  \n\n \n\nThe High Pressure Receiver feeds high temperature liquid ammonia to the +18?F High Temperature Recirculator. The +18?F High Temperature Recirculator then pumps high temperature recirculated liquid to the -20?F Low Temperature Recirculator and to the following evaporators:\n\n \n\n?         +40?F Perishable Truck Dock (AU1-12)\n\n?         +42?F Dry Produce (AU13-15)\n\n?         +50?F Dry Produce (AU16-19)\n\n?         +32?F Wet Produce (AU20-24)\n\n?         +32?F Fish Cooler (AU25)    \n\n?         +32?F Processed Meat Cooler (AU27-30)\n\n?         +28?F Fresh Meat Cooler (AU31-38)\n\n?         +28?F Poultry Cooler (AU39-40)\n\n?

Suction is drawn off the top of the vessel by Compressors RC-4 & RC-5.   \n\n \n\nAt the evaporators, fans are used to transfer heat from the product in the room to the ammonia within the system.  The liquid ammonia, flowing through coils in the unit, is partially boiled as it absorbs heat from the product and room.  The resulting high stage 'wet suction' (liquid/vapor mix) from Evaporators AU1-40 is returned to the +18?F High Temperature Recirculator.  The resulting low stage 'wet suction' (liquid/vapor mix) from the -10?F Freezer Evaporators (AU41-46) is returned to the -20?F Low Temperature Recirculator. \n\n \n\nCompressors RC-1, RC-2, and RC-3 are high stage compressors, which draw high stage suction from the +18?F High Temperature Recirculator.  The high stage compressors raise the pressure of the vapor and then discharge to the Evaporative Condensers, to the Glycol Heat Exchangers (GHX1 & GHX2) for underfloor heating, to the Thaw Room Evaporator (AU26) for humidity control (when in service), and to the evaporators for coil defrost.  Compressors RC-4 and RC-5 draw low stage suction from the -20?F Low Temperature Recirculator.  Compressor RC-4 discharges to the +18?F High Temperature Recirculator, while Compressor RC-5 discharges to the Evaporative Condensers.   All compressors receive high pressure liquid from the Thermosyphon Receiver for oil cooling purposes. \n\n \n\nAt the Evaporative Condensers, air (fans) and water (pumps) are used to condense the compressor discharge into high pressure liquid, which then drains to the Thermosyphon Receiver to begin the refrigeration cycle again.

All of the relief valves are tied into a common relief header that vent to the atmosphere.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nThe Reinhart ammonia refrigeration system has many safety features.  Much of the safety of the system is inherent in the policies and procedures that govern the operation of the system.  For example, the facility operates in accordance with OSHA's Process Safety Management regulation.  Facility maintenance personnel complete a shift log noting operating parameters. All other preventative maintenance and all minor/major repairs are completed by an outside contractor.\n\n\n\nThe facility including the ammonia system was designed and constructed in accordance with applicable codes at the time of construction, which specifically outlines requirements for the safe operation of the ammonia refrigeration system.  These safety features include ammonia sensors in the engine room as well as sensors in the cold rooms and vent line.  In addition, the majority of the ammonia is maintained inside the engine room and just outside of the engine room (condensers). All pressure vessels are equipped with pressure relief valves that relieve to the atmosphere.\n\n\n\nReinhart has developed a preventive maintenance program that utilizes the services of a professional refrigeration contractor to complete regularly scheduled inspections and tests of the ammonia refrigeration system as well as repairs as needed to process equipment.\n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nThere have been no significant releases of ammonia that exceeded the Federal Reportable Quantity of 100 pounds or the state requirement mandating immediate reporting of any release of 10 pounds in the past five years.

The Emergency Action Plan (Plan) is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of this PSM/RMP document. This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n\n\n  1.)  To save lives.\n\n  2.)  To minimize and avoid injuries.\n\n  3.)  To protect the environment.\n\n  4.)  To minimize property damage.\n\n\n\nThe operator of the facility maintains a safety committee whose members are the designated emergency coordinators for the facility.  The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures, which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year. This Plan was reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations.\n\n\n\nIn case of an ammonia emergency, the facility plans to evacuate all employees and contractors and activate the facility's action plan to respond to the situation.  If necessary, they will alert the local emergency responders (fire department) for assistance. The facility plans to coordinate emergency response efforts with the fire department on a periodic and ongoing basis.\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nThe Process Hazards Analysis, conducted in December 2011, including a Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) study and a Facility Inspection, provided mitigation measures to improve safety at Reinhart.  The Reinhart safety committee is planning to complete several items over the next year, as a continual effort to provide a safe work environment for their employees. \n\n\n\nThese changes include the following items:\n\n\n\n1.
