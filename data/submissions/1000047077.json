If an emergency were to occur, it is United Cooperative's policy to notify the local fire department and other emergency responders and request that they respond to the emergency.\n\n\n\n5.2    Stationary Source and Regulated Substance Handled (40 CFR 68.155(b))\n\n\n\nThe Pulaski facility  herein referenced as the stationary source. The primary activity at this facility source) is the storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia for direct retail sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application as crop production nutrients. The anhydrous ammonia is liquefied under pressure in the various storage vessels located at the facility.   The maximum quantity that could fill the 26,500 gallon (water capacity) would be 136,200 pounds> The maximum stored @ 85%  operating range is approximately 120,000 pounds.  \n\n\n\n5.3    The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps (40 CFR 68.155(d))\n\n\n\nThe facility complies with EPA's chemical acc"

The anhydrous ammonia system is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.111 and relevant American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) standards.\n\n\n\n5.3.1. Process Safety Information and Process Hazard Analysis\n\n\n\nUnited Cooperative maintains a separate written Emergency Action Plan regarding safety information that describes the chemical hazards associated with anhydrous ammonia.  Further safety information is also detailed in the RMP.  In addition, operating procedures and equipment design codes and standards associated with the anhydrous ammonia process are maintained in the RMP at the Facility.\n\n\n\nThe Facility conducts safety inspections to identify and control the hazards associated with the anhydrous ammonia process.  United Cooperative inspection includes one 26,500 gallon anhydrous ammonia bulk storage vessels, hoses, valves, gauges, and pumps.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\n\n\n5.4    Operating Procedures\n\n\n\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities at the Facility associated with anhydrous ammonia, United Cooperative maintains written operating procedures included in the RMP.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after an emergency shutdown.  The information is reviewed as needed and is readily accessible to operators involved with the processes.\n\n\n\n5.5    Training\n\n\n\nUnited has an anhydrous ammonia operator safety training program in place to train employees involved in the anhydrous ammonia process.  The facility maintains written operating procedures for the handling and storage of anhydrous ammonia.

The audit will be documented and conducted by a person knowledgeable in the safe handling and storage of anhydrous ammonia.  Corrective actions required as a result of each compliance audit will be performed promptly and documented.\n\n\n\n5.8    Incident Investigation\n\n\n\nFacility management will investigate each incident that results in, or could have reasonably resulted in a catastrophic release of anhydrous ammonia.  The investigation will be performed to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  Investigation reports will be retained for five years.  Report forms that will be completed in the event of an incident or possible incident are found in the EAP and the RMP.\n\n\n\n5.9    Employee Participation\n\n\n\nUnited believes accident prevention is a team effort.

Facility employees will not respond to accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia except for those that are small or incidental, can be controlled at the time of the release by employees in the immediate release area (e.g., shutting a valve) and do not appear to pose an immediate safety or health hazard.  This protocol has been discussed with the local fire department and the other emergency responders and the facility has appropriate mechanisms in place to notify the emergency responders when there is a need for a response.
