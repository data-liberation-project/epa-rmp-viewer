The Facility Policy\n\nThe management and employees of Two Rivers Coop are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. It an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire company, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information.\n\nThe primary activity the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for crop production.\n\nWe have a total of three tanks(1-30,000 gallon, 1-26,000 gallon, and 1-12,000 gallon) with a total capacity of 297,092 pounds when filled at 85%.  There are 15 - 1,000 gallon nurse tanks that will hold a total of 65,535 pounds when filled to 85%.  The maximum quantity handled would be the unloading of semi trailer holding 10,000 gallons.\n\n3. The Worst-case Release Scenario and the Alternative Release Scenario.\n\nThe worst-case and alternative release scenarios have been removed from the Executive Summary at the request of the EPA.  All relevant information will be provided to the emergency responders.  The decision to remove this information was based on the Homeland Security Act.\n\n\n4. The Accidental Release Prevention program.\n\nThe facility has implemented the provisions of \"safety requirements for the storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia, k-61.1\", published by the American National Standards Institute, and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), \"storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia\".  NOTE:  The Kansas Department of Agriculture has not yet adopted the most recent version of the ANSI Standards.  However, this company recognizes the need to stay current on our facilities and we will update to the current standards as time and budget allow.\n\nWe also co"

Good work practices and proper safety protocol are vital to the safe use of this product.  \n\n5. The Five-Year Accident History.\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that:\n\n-Have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor\n-To our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n6.  The Emergency Response Program. \n\n-The facility has:\nA. A written Emergency Action Plan, in accordance with OSHA standard.  By definition we have chosen to have our employees evacuate and notify the first responders; therefore we do not have an Emergency Response Plan.  \n\nB. Provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under Sara Title III (EPCRA).\n\n7. Planned changes to improve safety.\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions. There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for the implementation at this time."
