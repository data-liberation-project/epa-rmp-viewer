The purpose of an MI program is to maintain process equipment so that a catastrophic release of ammonia is avoided or properly contained. The emphasis should be on preventive maintenance rather than breakdown maintenance.\r\n\r\nMany more specific programs and policies (Hot Work, Confined Space, Lockout / Tagout, Employee training, etc..) have been developed..\r\n\r\nProcedures for conducting Compliance Audits, Mechanical Integrity Inspections, and Process Hazard Analyses have also been developed.\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis 5 Year Re-validation was completed on July 21, 2016.

In addition to other state and local codes applicable to our facility and process. We maintain this process to deal with the risks involved with the storage, handling, and use of Anhydrous Ammonia in our facility.\r\n\r\nOur goal is to promote overall worker, public, and plant safety. The SmithFoods Milk Process facility is located at 230 North Vine Street, Orville, Ohio. We manufacture dairy products. The facility has processing tanks, piping, packaging equipment, raw materials warehousing, finished goods refrigerated storage, an Ammonia refrigeration engine room, boilers, and miscellaneous utilities. \r\n\r\nThe Milk Processing Facility refrigeration system required for our production process necessitates the submission of this Risk Management Plan. The refrigeration system contains approximately 9,289 pounds of anhydrous ammonia. This is less than the threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds outlined in Process Safety Management and Risk Management Program regulations. However, it was decided to complete an RMP submittal due to the location of the facility and it's close proximity to Smithfoods - Ice Cream Facility and Public Receptors. Additionally this facility previously contained approximately 16,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia and was reduced due to equipment elimination.\r\n\r\nAccidental release prevention and emergency response policies.\r\n\r\nThe SmithFoods has implemented numerous policies and procedures to enable our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences of significant releases of Anhydrous Ammonia as well as other hazardous substances, fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents.
