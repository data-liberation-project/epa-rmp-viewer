Airy\n\nRMP Exceutive Summary\n\nThe City has implemented a comprehensive program to safely manage chlorine at its water and wastewater treatment plants located in or adjacent to the City. There have been no chlorine incidents in the most recent five-year period.\n\nIn 1994 and 1995, a Process Safety Management (PSM) program was initiated at the Plants using internal resources. A PSM Implementation Manual was developed to be site specific for each plant. Key items included in the manual were:\n\n-Written site specific procedures for Employee Involvement, Management of Change, Incident Investigation, Pre-Startup Reviews and Self Audits.\n\nChlorine safety information as required by the regulations.\n\nNext, these additional steps were implemented to complete the PSM program.\n\n-Training on PSM and its key components including Management of Change, Mechanical Integrity and Incident Investigation.\n\n-Conducting Process Hazards Analyses for the two chlorine processes.\n\n-Developing Standard Operating Procedures for Chlorine Management.\n\n-Developing an initial Emergency Response Plan.\n\n-Training in support of the certification of operators.\n\nThe supervisor, chief operator and several plant operators are meeting once per year to review and update procedures and to maintain compliance with all aspects of the PSM regulation.\n\nIn addition to PSM compliance, the plants have implemented a number of programs to improve the safe handling of chlorine and other chemicals.\n\n-The chlorine delivery systems at the plants have been upgraded to vacuum processes over the past 15 years. This process has proven to greatly reduce leaks by reducing the amount of equipment that is exposed to pressurized chlorine.\n\n-Chlorine has been replaced by calcium hypochlorite at the S.L. Spencer plant, the City's other water plant. This facility is     located in town near facilities that would be impacted by a release.\n\nThe site's Emergency Response Plans (ERP) have been significantly upgraded. In 1997, t"

      "SummaryText": "he ERP was revised to include offsite response and communication. The county LEPC and other local response organizations have been incorporated into the ERP. Where necessary, communication plans have been developed to notify businesses or residences that may be impacted by a release. Chlorine Reponse Drills have bee rountinely conducted since 1997.\n\nIn addition to Process Safety Management, the organization has an active safety program. Both plants have safety meetings monthly with all operators to review safety policies, new safety procedures and gather feed back from all operators as to their  needs and concerns regarding safety at the plants. In addition to the monthly safety meetings routine training is conducted for topics such as:\n\n-Hazard Communications\n\n-Personal Protective Equipment\n\n-Lockout/Tagout\n\n-Confined Space\n\nAs a result or our programs, the plants have had an excellent safety record with no recordable injuries over the past four years. As mentioned earlier, there have been no reportable chlorine releases from the plants in the last five years. The City has worked extensively to upgrade its safety program.\n\nFinally, in 1997 the City of Mount Airy was awarded STAR status by the North Carolina Department of Labor and recertified as a STAR site in 2003, the first municipality to achieve this status. We plan to continue our emphasis on safety to maintain and improve our safety performance.\n\nReport by:\n\nJeff Boyles\nPublic Services Director"
