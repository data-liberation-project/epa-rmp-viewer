THE FACILITY POLICY\n\n     The owners, management and employees of New Vision Coop are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire company or other authorities to mitigate and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2.  FACILITY INFORMATION\n\n     - The primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers.\n\n     - Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for both direct application for crop production nutrients.\n\n     - The maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia stored would be 500,000 pounds in our 1-26,000 gallon storage tank, 1-18,000 gallon storage tank and nurse tanks.\n\n3.  THE WORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO AND THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\n     a. The worst case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of the largest storage tank released as a gas over 8.9 minutes for anhydrous ammonia. The maximum quantity released would be 115,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the storage tank at 85% capacity as limited by design standards. The distance to the endpoint of dispersion to 200ppm is 1.09 miles.\n\n     b. The alternative release scenario for ammonia is a 2 minute release from a 3 pipe break, resulting in distance of .78 miles.\n\n4.  THE ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n     The facility has implemented the provisions of safety requirements for the storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia , K-61.1, published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc., and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration-OSHA-, 29CFR 1910.111, Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia. In addition, the Minnesota Department of Agriculture Ammonia Rules. \n\n5"

      "SummaryText": ".  THE FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n     There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years.\n\n6.  THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n     -The facility has:\n     a. A written Emergency Action Plan , in accordance with OSHA Standard , 29 CFR 1910.38;\n\n     b. Provided State and Local Authorities the Emergency Planning and Community Right-To-know information as required under SARA Title lll-EPCRA;\n\n     c. Coordinated with local emergency responders.\n\n7.  PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n     Safety improvement is an on-going process at the facility. Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions. There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
