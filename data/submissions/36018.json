It is our policy to promote a spirit of cooperation and team work among the employees at the Water Treatment Plant; it is also our policy to work with the surrounding community and local emergency response agencies, to promote a spirit of cooperation and teamwork to provide an effective contingency plan in the unlikely event that a process incident occures at the facility.\n\nRegulated Substances\n\nThe primary activity at the Water Treatment Plant (WTP) is municipal water treatment. Chlorine is the only 40 CFR 68 regulated substance at the facility. Chlorine is used primarily as a disinfectant. The maximum amount of chlorine at the facility is 20 tons.\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario (WCS)\n\nThe Worst-Case release scenario according to EPA's Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance document is \"the greatest amount held in a single vessel.\" The worst-case scenario is the complete release of chlorine from a one-ton container. The worst-case scenario may not consider the use of active mitigation such as emergency scrubbers.\n\nThe chlorine toxic enpoint defined by 40 CFR Part 68 is 0.0087 mg/l which is equivalent to 3 parts per million by volume (ppm). According to the American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA) Emergency Response Planning Guidline (ERPG)-2, this toxic end point is specified as \"the maximum airborne concentration below which it is belived that nearly all individules could be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects or symptions which could impair an individual's ability to take protective action.\"\n\nThe SLAB computer model was used to simulate the worst-case scenario. The maximum distance to toxic endpoint is 2.08 miles. This distance considered "

      "SummaryText": "the mitigation provided by the building but did not include the use of active mitigation measures such as the emergency scrubber.\n\nA worst-case release is unlikely due to the materials of construction of the chlorine container. In addition, a comprehensive risk management program has been developed to prevent accidental releases.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario\n\nThe alternative release scenario modeled is the worst-case scenario with the emergency scrubber in operation. It is assumed that a one-ton container reputes and releases all of its contents within the Process/Chemical building. When the release is detected, the emergency scrubber is activated. There is no off-site impact for the alternative release scenario. This alternative release scenario is not likley to occur; however, it demonstrates that off-site impacts do not occur even for the worst-case scenario when the active mitigation system is used.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\nCity of Naples is in compliance with 40 CFR 68. The City has conducted a comprehensive review of the chlorine system as well as administrative, technical, operating and maintenance procedures, in addition to the other required program elements of the regulations.\n\nThe City has both passive mitigation, an enclosed building, and active mitigation, an emergency scrubber, to minimize the consequences of an accidental release. The Risk Management Program addresses actions to minimize the likelihood of an accidental release and to minimize the impact if one occurs.\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nThe WTP had a release of a hazardous substance on January 6th, 2000. Employees were changing chlorine cylinders and a valve leaked chlorine. The emergency system of the building went into full alarm operation. All WTP employees were evacuated, Naples Fire Department responded to stop the leak. Naples Police closed off the area around the plant. Fire personnel entered the building and stopped the leak by closing the cylinder valve. It was deter"

      "SummaryText": "mined that 100 pounds of chlorine leaked out of a full 2000 pound cylinder. The chlorine scrubber neutralized the chlorine gas; there was no off-site release. Post accident investigation determined it to be possible operator error. The chlorine handling procedure was updated to reduce the risk of operator error.\n\nThe WTP had an incident on Febuary 21st, 2002. The chlorine supplier, Allied Universal, dropped a 2000-pound cylinder off the back of the delivery truck. The cylinder landed on a track causing two large dents in the tank. No chlorine was released. Allied was called to pick up the full cylinder. Allied was notified to use an acceptable delivery vehicle. Bid specs were modified to require vendor to use an articulating trailer for off-loading and loading ton cylinders.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nThis facility has an emergency response program that is coordinated with the Collier County Comprehensive Emergency Response Plan (ERP) that has been prepared in accordance with all local, state and federal regulations.\n\nContinued training and practices documented in the RMP will continue to improve safety at the facility."
