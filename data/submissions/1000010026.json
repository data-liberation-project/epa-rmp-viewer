It is in compliance with all EPA Prevention Program and OSHA Process Safety Management Program requirements.  The responsibility of the RMP has been assigned to the WWTP operator who will review the program at least on an annual basis.\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information A\u00bf The Corning WWTP has developed and maintains written safety information about the chlorination and de-chlorination process and the technology of process equipment used.  The operation of this facility adheres to the guidelines of the Chlorine Institute and to the OSHA regulations regarding Process Safety Management.  Process Safety Information is readily available to all personnel and is updated when changes are made.\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA) A\u00bf A PHA review was conducted in June 2009 appropriate to the complexity of the chlorination process that identified, evaluated, and controlled potential hazards using the A\u00bfWhat-If ChecklistA\u00bf and A\u00bfHazard Review ChecklistsA\u00bf processes.  These processes include the analysis of hazards due to equipment malfunction and human error.  It describes steps used to detect and monitor releases.  This PHA will be updated every three years (next PHA in June 2012) and the Corning WWTP will conduct reviews whenever major changes occur to the process.\r\nOperating Procedures A\u00bf The WWTP plant operator has prepared written standard operating procedures specific to their operations that provide clear instructions for the safe operational activities associated with the process.  These procedures are included in the facility operations manual and the Process Safety Management manual.  The manual includes procedures for operation of all phases of the processes, and normal and emergency shutdown of the process.  These procedures will be reviewed and updated if necessary on an annual basis.  All WWTP"

The training documentation will be reviewed at least annual to ensure trainings have been completed.\r\n\r\nMechanical Integrity A\u00bf The WWTP has a preventive maintenance program (Maintain It A\u00bf April 2009) that insures the mechanical integrity of its chlorination / de-chlorination processing equipment, which includes periodic inspection, testing and an annual overhaul of critical processing equipment.  Maintenance procedures are written for each step of the maintenance process and assigned to appropriate personnel.\r\n\r\nManagement of Change (MOC) A\u00bf The WWTP has implemented written MOC procedures to manage changes (except changes in-kind) to process chemical technology, equipment and procedures.  Employees affected by a change in a process are informed of and trained in the change prior to start up of the process or affected part of the process.  Safety information and operation procedures are updated accordingly.\r\n\r\nPre-Startup Review A\u00bf Written standard operational procedures have been developed to allow operators to perform a pre-startup safety review for new and modified chlorination equipment, or where modification to the process is significant enough to require a change in the process safety information.\r\n\r\nCompliance Audits A\u00bf A compliance audits was performed in June 2009 and will be performed every three years (next June 2012) to verify that the procedures and practices are adequate and are being followed.
