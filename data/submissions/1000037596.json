At the Ingevity North Charleston Plant, only the lignin-based production area contains a threshold amount of a regulated substance, formaldehyde solution.\n\n\n\nThe lignin production area includes a number of reactors that produce a variety of products. Formaldehyde solution is delivered to the site via tank truck in the form of a 37% aqueous solution and stored at slightly elevated temperature in an above ground tank with a 30,000 gallon (270,000 lb) capacity.  The tank is surrounded by a 30 ft x 30 ft dike that provides passive mitigation by limiting the surface area of a spill.\n\n\n\nThe EPA Risk Management Regulation identifies three levels of requirements defined as \"programs\".  Ingevity has determined that the production process that uses formaldehyde sois a Program 3.  Program 3 applies to processes that are subject to Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management Standard (PSM) or listed among nine North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) codes.  The process belongs to a listed NAICS code (325199, industrial organics), is subject to PSM and the worst case release scenario has the potential to impact the KapStone facility.\n\n\n\nThe Risk Management Plan requirements for Program 3 processes are the same as those for the PSM standard.\n\n\n\n\n\n3.0   HAZARD ASSESSMENT RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\n\n\nThe Hazard Assessment under the ARP program consists of two parts; 1) a review of the five-year accident history involving regulated substances in the covered process and 2) a modeling evaluation of the impact associated with an accidental release.  There have been no accidental releases during the most recent five-year period that had an off-site impact, however, modeling of a worst-case release shows that off-site concentrations of formaldehyde would exceed the toxic endpoint concentration.

The incident information is reviewed by environmental and supervisory staff and a determination is made as to whether a reportable quantity of any listed chemical requiring reports to regulatory authorities is involved.  If so, the appropriate authorities are promptly notified. \n\n\n\nDuring the past 5 years, there have been no accidents involving formaldehyde that qualify for reporting under 40 CFR Part 68.

The IngevityNorth Charleston Plant's emergency response plan is contained in the Integrated Contingency Plan (ICP).

This ensures that those with more significant possible consequences receive immediate priority for appropriate emergency response.  If an abnormal event indicates the potential for the release of a chemical and quantity that may lead to an emergency condition, the plant emergency response team is notified and the most appropriate mode of response is determined by the Plant Emergency Coordinator or Incident Commander, with support from available emergency response and technical advisory staff.  \n\n\n\nTraining of responsible staff from both the North Charleston Chemical Plant and the Plant Emergency Response Teams (Rescue Team and Fire Brigade) is designed to ensure that reliable communication and coordination occurs in any emergency situation.
