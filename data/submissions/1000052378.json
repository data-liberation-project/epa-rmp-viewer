There is only one substance at this facility above the threshold quantity: butane in a bulk storage tank with a capacity of 11,900 gallons, as well as empty and full butane 20 lbs. and 100 lbs. cylinders. The maximum amount on hand is approximately 50,000 pounds. Butane is filled at this facility out of the bulk storage tank and into the cylinders which are then distributed to our wholesalers and retail facilities for sale.\n\n\n\n3.    General Accident Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThis facility has taken all of the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set forth in 40 CFR Part 68 of the EPA. The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at this facility.\n\n\n\nPr"
