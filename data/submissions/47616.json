The handling of TDI in BASF's processes is completely computer controlled. Prior to use in manufacturing, TDI is pumped from the bulk storage tank into one of three 2350-pound capacity \"day\" tanks. TDI is then pumped from the \"day\" tanks to mixer heads in the intermediate area, reacting and consuming the material. This \"activation\" procedure is controlled through an Inbatch computer control system which will shut down operations and sound an alarm if outside close tolerances.\n\n\n\nBASF has specific standard operating procedures and training in the offloading of tankers to bulk storage. The TDI off-loading SOP specifies that a trained BASF employee wearing proper PPE will be present during the entire offload procedure, including transfer hose hookup, product transfer, offload and during removal of the transfer hose. Any leak or rupture will be observed and proper steps taken to shut down transfer to minimize TDI loss. An isocyanate emergency stop is located at the offload station that automatically stops the offload operation when activated.\n\n\n\nBASF has a comprehensive contingency (emergency response) plan that includes procedures for chemical spills/releases, medical emergencies, natural disasters, and environmental issues.

The TDI day tank room has an active exhaust that passes through a carbon scrubber before being vented out of the facility. Sensor systems were installed in the bulk storage and \"day\" tank storage that monitor TDI levels in the rooms. Remote displays allow employees to check for levels of TDI down to 0.2 parts per billion prior to entering the storage areas. If levels rise above 5 ppb, the building security company will receive an alarm and notify the facility emergency contact. Our maintenance, department has a preventative maintenance program that includes critical TDI safety and testing of equipment."
