The technical information herein may be used as a training reference in initial and\n  recurring operator and maintenance training. Training on process fundamentals, operations, and\n  maintenance, coupled with the recommended process modifications discussed below, will reduce the potential\n  hazards to plant personnel and the surrounding community.\n\n  An Emergency Response Program and an Incident Investigation Program are included. These two programs should be\n  an integral part of both initial and recurring training.\n\n  A Risk Management Plan (RMP), in the format required by the EPA, is included at the end of the main body of this\n  document.  It consists of a summary of data elements as required by EPA for inclusion in a\n  public access database. The RMP is intended to inform the public of the East Bank WTP's\n  proactive stance toward protection of the environment and the surrounding community.

A mitigation factor of 0.55 is allowed for\n  this process due to the building which encloses the chlorine system. This scenario was\n  developed and modeled using the EPA approved RMP Comp model.

It should be noted that at this concentration, a person may be exposed for up to one\n  hour without suffering permanent injuries (ERPG-2).\n\n  Alternative Release Scenario\n  The Alternative Release Scenario of chlorine was also modeled using RMP Comp.
