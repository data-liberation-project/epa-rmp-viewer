      "SummaryText": "1.0    Introduction\n\nPer the requirements of Section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act Amendments  of 1990 as codified in Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations(CFR) Part 68, this Risk Management Plan (RMP) is submitted to the United States Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) in a timely manner for Boise White Paper LLC pulp and paper mill in Wallula, Washington.  The Wallula mill handles one or more regulated substances listed in Appendix A of Part 68.\n \n2.0    Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled.\n\nBoise owns and operates a pulp and paper mill located in Wallula Washington, which is an existing major stationary source per the requirements of Title V Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990. The regulated substance handled by this facility is chlorine dioxide, which is considered hazardous by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA).\n\nThe Wallula mill uses Kraft and neutral sulfite semi-chemical (NSSC) pulping processes to produce pulp and paper from wood chips. Chlorine Dioxide is regulated under the Risk Management Program, and used at the mill to bleach the Kraft pulp.  Paper, the final product of the mill, is made from both bleached and unbleached pulp.\n\nChlorine Dioxide is generated at the mill using the R-8 generation process. Chlorine Dioxide is stored in an aqueous solution in two 272,000 gallon storage tanks. The maximum amount of chlorine dioxide that is stored in the tanks is 52,220 pounds.\n\nBoise also stores the following listed chemicals on-site, in quantities below the RMP thresholds for each process: propane, hydrochloric acid, acetylene, and chlorine for process water treatment.\n\n3.0    Accidental Release Prevention\n\nBoise takes a systematic, proactive approach to preventing accidental releases of hazardous chemicals.  The Wallula mill's management systems, which cover the chlorine dioxide process, address each of the following key features of successful prevention programs.\n\n    1.    RMP Management System\n\nA management system was "

Process/Chemical Safety Information\n\nA comprehensive chemical data base has been assembled to include regulatory reporting, action thresholds, health hazard and chemical exposure limitations, and list the physical properties of regulated substance.  This information was compiled from numerous sources for easy access by a reader seeking data on these substances.\n\nProcess safety information was carefully assembled for the chlorine dioxide processes. Process specifications on each process are collected in one area for easy reference.  Detailed specifications on such items as maximum intended inventory, safe upper and lower temperatures, and codes and standards used to design, build and operate the processes are on file at the mill.\n\n    3.    Process Hazard Analysis\n\nA hazard analysis was conducted for each of the covered processes.  The hazard analysis team was made up of representatives from plant management, maintenance experts, process and project engineers, and process operating personnel.  The hazard review utilized the Hazard and Operability Study (HAZOP) approach, which was supplemented by the completion of design checklists.\n\n    4.    Operating Procedures\n\nA rigorous detailed Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) program has been developed, and is stringently reviewed and adhered to by all employees at the Wallula Mill. The SOP provides system descriptions"

The SOP covers start- up; shutdown; abnormal, and emergency operation; maintenance; and troubleshooting procedures.\n\n    5.    Operator Training Program\n\nBoise utilizes experienced personnel to train employees to safely and effectively perform their assigned tasks.  The Wallula training program for the covered processes includes both initial and refresher training courses, a general overview of the process, the properties and hazards of the substances in the process, and a thorough review of the standard process operating procedures and safe work practices.  Oral reviews and written tests are given to ascertain if the employee understands the materials.\n\n\n    6.    Mechanical Integrity Program\n\nAn experienced and well-trained maintenance staff maintain the mechanical integrity of the process equipment to minimize and prevent equipment failures that could endanger workers, the public, and/or the environment.  The mechanical integrity program covers inspections and testing to identify equipment deterioration or damage before equipment failure.  The elements of this program include:\na)    Specifications for inspection and testing of process equipment.\nb)    Specifications for replacement parts and equipment.\nc)    Procedures for inspecting, testing, and maintaining process equipment.\nd)    Procedures for safe work practices such as lockout/tagout, hot work permits and confined space entry.\ne)    Maintenance personnel training procedures\nf)    Documentation of maintenance activities\n\n\n    7.    Management of Change\n\nThe Wallula millA?s management of change program requires approval by the management team for all proposed changes to chemicals, equipment, and procedures for the chlorine dioxide process to ensure that the change does not affect safe operations. Process changes that are determined to be replacement in kind are allowed without completing a full management of change procedure.  All other changes must be confi"
