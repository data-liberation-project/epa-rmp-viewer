      "SummaryText": "General Executive Summary for Diaz Intermediates Corporation\n\n1.    Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at Diaz Intermediates Corporation are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety. This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility?s primary activities encompass organic chemical intermediates manufacturing.  We have two regulated substances present at our facility. These substances are Bromine, which is reacted with aromatic raw materials (benzene, fluorobenzene, etc.), and 2-butene, which is reacted with bromine to make 2,3-dibromobutane.\n\nThe maximum inventory of Bromine at our facility is 75000 lb.\nThe maximum inventory of 2-butene at our facility is 26800 lb.\n\n3.    The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analyses for our facility, we have used the EPA's RMP Comp. The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 3 toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from bromine unloading. In this scenario 67000 lb. of Bromine is released.  The toxic liquid released is assumed to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place. The entire pool is estimated to evaporate over 6000 minutes. The release rate has been limited to 5% of the maximum rate of the source by a system of administrative controls.  Passive mitigation systems such as dikes and sumps are also taken into accoun"

      "SummaryText": "t to calculate the scenario. These mitigation systems have the effect of reducing the release rate of the bromine, and also the total quantity released before other active response measures can be undertaken. At Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s wind speed, the maximum distance of 2.7 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.0065 mg/L.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for Bromine involves a release from a bromine transfer line. The scenario involves the release of 1170 lb. of bromine. Toxic liquid is assumed to be released to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place. The entire pool is estimated to have evaporated after 375 minutes. Passive mitigation controls such as dike(s), drain(s), sumps(s) and enclosure(s) are taken into account to calculate the scenario, having the effect of reducing the amount of bromine available to evaporate (reducing liquid contact with the atmosphere). The release is also assumed to be controlled by sprinklers, scrubber(s) and neutralization. These active mitigation systems have the effect of blanketing the liquid, forming a barrier, which prevents evaporation until the bromine can be neutralized. Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.0065 mg/L of Bromine is 0.1 miles.\n\nThe worst case scenario submitted for Program 3 flammable substances as a class involves a release from a 2-butene cylinder. In this scenario 268 lbs. of 2-butene is released. The flammable gas released is assumed to form a flammable cloud which is ignited by a source such as a lift truck. The release rate is based on a puncture of the cylinder, such as by a lift truck?s fork. The cloud is expected to ignite to its lower flammability limit, <0.1 miles. There have been no mitigation systems taken into account to calculate this scenario.\n\nThe alternate release scenario submitted for 2-butene involves a release from a cylinder. In this scenario 268 lbs. of 2-butene is released. The flammable"

There have been no mitigation systems taken into account to calculate this scenario.\n\n4.    The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA. The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nDiaz Intermediates Corporation maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes. The hazard information is communicated to the LEPC and local hospital.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently. The methodology used to carry out these analyses is What If/Checklist (combined). The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of five years. Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner. The most recent PHAs for both 2-butene and bromine were performed in 2003.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Diaz Intermediates Corporation maintains written operating procedures. These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround. The information is regularly"
