These units have similar prevention program elements and are listed together in Section 7.  The units and their corresponding initial PHA or updated PHA dates are as follows:\n\n\n\nAmmonia Plant - PHA revalidation February 2011\n\nAmmonia Storage & Loading - PHA revalidation March 2009\n\nUrea I Plant - PHA revalidation March 2009\n\nNitric Acid I Plant - PHA revalidation October 2010\n\nUrea II Plant - PHA revalidation April 2011\n\nUAN Plant - PHA revalidation March 2011\n\nNitric Acid II Plant - PHA revalidation September 2012",

      "SummaryText": "I.   Executive Summary\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe CF Industries - Port Neal Complex manufactures anhydrous ammonia and urea ammonium nitrate (UAN) solution.  Intermediates in the manufacture of these products include nitric acid, urea solution, and ammonium nitrate solution.  The regulated substances, as defined by 40 CFR Part 68, that exceed the threshold quantity are ammonia and Syn Gas.  \n\n\n\nIt is CF Industries' policy to prevent accidental releases from the plant by effective process safety management (PSM) programs and procedures that include participation by plant employees in every element of the PSM program; regular analysis of process hazards utilizing current and accurate process safety information; maintaining current operating procedures; providing timely and comprehensive training for all employees involved in operating and maintaining process equipment; overseeing the activities of contractors and ensuring that they are trained to perform their jobs safely; following established pre-startup safety review and management of change procedures to ensure that modifications are adequately evaluated for safety; administering a comprehensive mechanical integrity program to ensure that process equipment is maintained in accordance with good engineering practice and accepted industry standards;   investigating incidents when they do occur so that we can promptly correct deficiencies and learn from the experience; and auditing the PSM Program on a regular basis to verify that elements, procedures and systems are in place and adequate.\n\n\n\nIt is our policy to maintain a current and accurate written emergency response plan and a well-trained and equipped onsite emergency response team; a system to notify neighbors in the event of a release; and to coordinate emergency response planning with local authorities and exercise those plans annually.\n\n\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis - Toxic\n\nThe Port Neal Complex Toxic Worst Case Scenario involves the spill and subsequent vaporizati"

      "SummaryText": "on of 30,000,000 pounds of liquid ammonia over a ten minute period.  The distance to the toxic endpoint for ammonia (200 ppm) is estimated to be 4.7 miles.  This scenario incurs significant offsite impact.  The Alternative Release Scenario for ammonia is a 2\" pipe break, resulting in the release of 11,850 pounds over a ten minute period.  The distance to the toxic endpoint for ammonia is estimated to be 1.13 miles.  The effect of the alternative toxic release is limited by the operation of excess flow valves and emergency shutdown procedures in place at the facility.\n\n\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis - Flammable\n\nThe Port Neal Complex Flammable Worst Case Scenario involves the release and instantaneous explosion of 33,854 pounds of Syn Gas, 10,582 pounds of which are flammable components (hydrogen, methane, and ethane).  The distance to the flammable endpoint for Syn Gas (1 psi overpressure) is estimated to be 0.2 miles.  This scenario incurs minor offsite impact in terms of affected receptors.  The Alternative Release Scenario for Syn Gas is a failure of a flange or bleed valve in the synthesis loop, resulting in the release of 6,577 pounds of flammable components over a ten minute period.  The distance to the 1 psi overpressure flammable endpoint for Syn Gas is estimated to be 0.2 miles.  The effect of the alternative flammable release is limited by operator-controlled isolation valves in place at the facility.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe Port Neal Complex has a comprehensive Process Safety Management (PSM) Program and is subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's standard for process safety management of highly hazardous chemicals found at 29 CFR Part 1910.119.  Key elements of the PSM program include: 1) stringent design standards of equipment which incorporate substantial safety factors and include state of the art monitoring and control instrumentation; 2) extensive process safety information that is accurate and up to date;"

A small amount of ammonia vapor, estimated at less than 5 pounds, was released.  An employee received burns to the forearm and waist.  The ammonia was rinsed off, and no further medical treatment was needed.  There was no off-site impact or outside response.  On January 13, 2012, an overhead flow transmitter was dripping ammonia.  Liquid ammonia, estimated at less than 1 pound, was released.  An employee experienced an eye burn.  Treatment included prescription eye drops.  There was no off-site impact or outside response.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nThe Port Neal Complex also has a comprehensive Emergency Response Program which includes a written plan that is coordinated with local authorities, a 50-plus member emergency response team, and an emergency notification system that utilizes both in-plant sirens and the First Call  Network telephone system.  Plant personnel have participated in county-wide emergency drills with local responders including Woodbury County Disaster Services (LEPC), Salix Fire and Rescue, Sioux City Fire Department and Sioux City HazMat.  Additionally the plant exercises its emergency response plan with in-plant drills."
