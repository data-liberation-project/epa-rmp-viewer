The Tanner family started out in the ammonia business in 1954 with the purchase of National Ammonia Company in Philadelphia, PA. The company has grown to it's current size through the acquisition of three other ammonia companies, Bower Ammonia and Chemical Co. in 1971, Northeastern Ammonia Co. in 1985, and Hamler Industries in 1991. This particular facility was established in 1992.\n\nThe mission of Tanner Industries, Inc. is to constantly improve our products and services to meet or exceed our customers needs, to distribute our products in a safe, efficient and environmentally responsible manner, and to generate a reasonable return in order to provide continuity for the business and employment for our employees. \n\nTanner Industries, Inc. is firmly committed to a fully effective implementation of the Risk Management Plan (RMP) as it applies to the safe distribution of ammonia.

The material is transported to our facility by rail car and then transferred from the rail car to our transport cargo tanks for bulk distribution to the end-users of the material.\n\nBenefits and Uses of Ammonia:\n\nAmmonia is a basic chemical that has many common manufacturing and practical uses. The largest users of ammonia are agricultural industries. Ammonia itself is applied directly by farmers as a fertilizer. Some agricultural businesses combine ammonia and other chemicals and nutrients to form more complex fertilizers. Other common products that are made with ammonia include textiles, pharmaceuticals, cleaning solutions, dyes, inks and food packaging products. Ammonia is also used by some companies in various processes. Ammonia is recognized as an ozone safe refrigerant. This means that, unlike other refrigerants, any ammonia releases into the atmosphere will not harm the earth's ozone layer. Besides refrigeration, Ammonia is used in some common processes like drinking water purification, air and water pollution control, waste treatment, reprographics, and the heat treating or hardening of metal parts.\n\nPotential Health Effects of Ammonia:\n\nEven in small concentrations, ammonia is irritating to the eyes, throat and breathing passages.  Accompanied with a very pungent odor, ammonia can be said to be auto-repulsive. These  characteristics provide us with an early warning of the material's presence and force us to retreat from ammonia contaminated atmospheres.  High concentrations could have more serious health effects. These could include convulsive coughing, difficult and painful breathing, eye damage and in extreme cases, death. Liquid ammonia or ammonia solution contact of the eyes or skin can produce serious chemical burns requiring prompt medical attention.\n\nEmployees and contractors who work around ammonia should take the extra precautions of"

These committees meet on a periodic basis to review safety concerns at our sites as well as at our customer facilities. The management representatives of the site specific committee report directly to the corporate safety committee. The corporate safety committee is comprised of upper management, compliance personnel, headquarters employees, and field personnel that are familiar with plant processes. This committee meets on a regular basis to review accident and injury investigations, evaluate site specific issues, provide recommendations and implementation guidance.  Also, qualified personnel periodically inspect and evaluate each facility to assess safety and maintenance conditions. The results of these facility inspections are reported directly to upper management and the operations department.

In support of our policy, the following is a typical list of safety equipment and systems employed at this facility. \n\n   a) Pressure relief valves are employed on all storage, transfer and delivery equipment to handle unexpected increases in pressure. Per their operational design, these valves will reset after relieving only the excess pressure. Depending on their situational placement in the process, these valves may be designed to relieve pressures caused from either vapor or liquid.\n\n   b) Excess flow shut off devices are incorporated through out the process as prescribed by federal regulation. These valves are designed to stop the flow of liquid material any time their rated flow capacity is exceeded. These valves are designed to prevent the catastrophic release attributed to a storage tank line or valve break.\n\n    c) Breakaway valves are installed at the unloading platforms.
