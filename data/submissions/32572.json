Land use in the immediate vicinity of the site is primarily\nagricultural, with silviculture predominating.  The plant is located astride a low hill or\nridge east of Horsehead Creek. \n     The location of the plant is due to the presence of natural brine deposits located\nabout 1.5 miles beneath the plant.  These brines are withdrawn through a system of\nwells and processed to produce bromine and hydrogen sulfide, and then replaced into\nthe same geologic formation by a second system of wells.  \n     The South Plant produces bromine, sulfur, fire retardants, pesticides and\npesticide intermediates, clear completion fluids and other speciality chemicals.  \n\nAbout our accidental release prevention and emergency response policies:\n     The South Plant Facility has very active accidental release prevention and\nemergency response programs.  It is the policy of the South Plant Facility to reduce the\nrisk of chemical release to the extent feasible.  The main vehicle for chemical risk\nreduction is the Process Safety Management (PSM) program.  When the OSHA PSM\nstandard was promulgated, existing programs were subsumed into the PSM program\nfollowing the OSHA standard.  \n     The Policy of the South Plant is to first prevent the occurrence of emergency\nsituations, but if prevention measures are unsuccessful, to respond to those situations\nin a professional and appropriate manner.  The site has an integrated Emergency Plan\nwhich follows EPA's One Plan concept.  South Plant personnel respond to\nemergencies on site with a trained fire brigade, HazMat responders, and a corps of\ntrained EMTs.  The emergency plan provides for coordination with local care givers, first\nresponders, law enforcement, and the county emergency response infrastructure\nthrough the county-wide emergency plan.  \n     Briefly, if a chemical incident appears to have the potential for"

If a situation has impact beyond the\nborders of Columbia County, the county-wide emergency plan provides for coordination\nwith adjoining counties and parishes.\n     All of our south Arkansas facilities use the same basic accidental release\nprevention and emergency response programs.  Using the same plan makes training\neasier and coordination with local off site responders better.  Details of the emergency\nplans (such as maps; locations of response equipment) are different due to the physical\ndifferences in the facilities.\n\nRegulated substances handled at the South Plant:\n     The South Plant is known to handle as many as fifteen listed chemicals in up to\n21 processes.  Information on the handling and storage was gathered.  Eleven\nregulated chemicals in eight processes were found to be subject to the RMP rule.  The\naccidental release prevention and emergency response programs are exactly the same\nfor covered and non-covered processes; covered and non-covered chemicals are both\nsubject to both programs.\n     The Risk Management Program has been incorporated into the PSM program to\nprovide continuity.  A description of our risk management program is found below.  \n\nOur accidental release prevention program:\n         The South Plant Facility is subject to the OSHA PSM standard.

The PHA identifies any and all possible mishaps, the likelihood and\nconsequences of mishaps, and predicts how safety and mitigation systems will perform\nin the event of a mishap.  For each PHA, a team is formed which possesses the\nrequisite expertise in engineering, process operations, hazard analysis, industrial\nhygiene, safety systems, and emergency response.  Several standard methods may be\nused to analyze the available information, and more than one method may be applied\nto a process hazard analysis.  The PHA documentation is retained for the life of the\nprocess.  This information is used to eliminate hazards when possible, and mitigate\nthose hazards when elimination is not possible or impractical.\n     Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) exist when each process is first started\nup, and undergo continual review and improvement.  Some of the items included in\nSOP's are procedures for start-ups, shut-downs, routine or hazardous procedures,\noperation of safety and environmental control systems, and mitigation of process\nhazards.  SOPs are updated to reflect current operating conditions.  Each SOP is\nreviewed no less often than annually.\n     Training is the key aspect of accident prevention.  Each employee in an\noperating process receives job specific and general training on safety and health\nhazards, emergency operations, and safe work practices.  This training is administered\naccording to the needs of the employee and the specific requirements of the program.  \n     Preventative Maintenance (PM) is an integral part of our accidental release\nprevention program.

      "SummaryText": "ting jobs in progress within a process area.  A Safe Work\nPermit may require the permittee to initiate and complete a Hot Work Permit before\nperforming certain tasks.  Sometimes, tasks involving welding, cutting, braising, or other\nflame or spark producing activities, must be performed in areas where flammable\nchemicals are present.  Hot work permits insure fire prevention and protection\nrequirements have been implemented prior to beginning the work.  Another essential\npart of the risk management program is the use of lock out/ tag out procedures. \nWhen a safe work permit is issued, the permit requires the permittee to assure that all\nsources of potential energy have been deactivated.  For instance, the permittee may\nperform the following procedures before working on a pump: Check the Safe Work\nPermit to make assure operations has purged and drained the pump; check the red\ntags in place to make sure the pump is isolated from the process; and place a personal\nlocking device on the electrical switchgear energizing the pump.  No employee can\nremove a red tag, actuate a tagged component, or remove a personal locking device\nplaced by another employee.  \n     We depend on contractors and contract employees for many essential services. \nUnder our PSM program, we insure that contractor preformed maintenance, repair, and\ngeneral operations are preformed safely.  Contractors are fully informed of the potential\nhazards of the relevant processes and applicable portions of the facility emergency\nresponse plan.  The contractor, in turn, must control the entry, presence, and exit from\nprocess areas.  The contractor, as a condition of employment, must adhere to all facility\nsafe work standards and practices.  \n     You will find specific prevention program information in section 7 of this plan. \n\nSection 8 does not apply to this facility.\n\nFacility five year accident history:\n     The South Plant has been relatively free of offsite consequences.

Although the South Plant does not\nhave any incidents which meet the EPA criteria, we have had releases of chemicals\nwhich had offsite consequences.\n     Periodically, neighbors call and report odors.  These reports are investigated and\na serious attempt is made to determine the origin of the odor.  If the odor is found to be\noriginating at the South Plant, all efforts are made to mitigate the odor at the source.\n     There have been releases in the past with potential offsite consequences.  For\ninstance, in 1987 an expansion joint below a vessel filled with bromine chloride failed,\nallowing the entire contents to flow into a diked area.  (This chemical is no longer\nproduced at the South Plant.)  Stable wind conditions carried the vapor cloud due west\ninto a forested portion of the facility.  Vegetation in this forested area was affected, and\nthe release could have necessitated an offsite response if the wind direction had been\ndifferent.  \n\nFacility emergency response program:\n     Our emergency response plan is in the format developed by EPA.  This format is\ncommonly known as the One Plan.  This particular format was developed to address\nthe off site responder need for simplicity while complying with all regulatory\nrequirements.  \n     The emergency response program is based on the principle that the facility\nshould respond to incidents within the scope of the facility's expertise, while the local\nauthorities respond within the scope of the Columbia County Emergency Response\nPlan.  This means that the facility is responsible for preventing incidents before they\nhappen.  But if a incident does occur, the facility is responsible for mitigating the offsite\nconsequences of the incident by source control.  The Columbia County Department of\nEmergency Management is charged with implementing the Columbia County\nEmergency Plan and coordinating the response.  The"

      "SummaryText": "Columbia County Emergency\nPlan was developed by the Columbia County Local Emergency Preparedness\nCommittee (CCLEPC) under the direction of the Columbia County Department of\nEmergency Management Coordinator with the aid of the Columbia County Judge.\n     The South Plant Emergency Plan contains procedures for response to chemical\nreleases, fires, and natural disasters.  Provision is made for informing the public through\nresponsible officials according to the provisions of the County Emergency Plan.  The\nemergency plan describes the location and mode of use of specialized emergency\nresponse equipment.  The plan also describes the delivery of medical treatment for\ninjuries.  \n     Public awareness is an important component of an emergency response\nprogram.  The South Plant facility seeks to maintain continual contact with the public\nthrough regular meetings of the Community Advisory Panel (CAP).  The CAP advises\nthe facility on the need, frequency, and effectiveness of public communications. \nPlanned changes to improve safety:\n     The best way to protect the public is by preventing accidents.  We use the\nProcess Safety Management process to identify and prevent chemical releases.  The\nPSM process drives continual improvement in process safety.\n     Offsite, the facility has been active in supporting (through donations, participation\nand membership) the CCLEPC since its formation in 1987.  EPA's implementation of\nthe Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 caused us to examine, and plan for, incidents\nwhich are extremely unlikely.  As a result of this examination, the entire emergency\nresponse process has benefitted.  \n     A CCLEPC initiative worthy of mention is the filming of a public service video, \nwhich instructs the public how to shelter in place.\n\n General comments about chemical release scenarios:\n     All release modeling included in this plan comes from EPA's  tool RMP Comp, Ver.\n1.07."
