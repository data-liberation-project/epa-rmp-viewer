The  Santa\n\n     Maria Facility handles hazardous materials onsite,  and\n\n     recognizes  a  responsibility  to  safely  operate  the\n\n     facility in order to protect the surrounding community,\n\n     employees, and the environment.  The Facility has taken\n\n     a   proactive  stance  to  promote  the  overall   safe\n\n     operation  of the processes, with programs  to  prevent\n\n     accidents from occurring, planning for emergencies, and\n\n     maintaining  the equipment needed if an emergency  does\n\n     occur.   The  RMP  formalizes  existing  programs   and\n\n     procedures so that these programs may be reviewed  more\n\n     efficiently.\n\n\n\n     The   Santa   Maria   Facility   processes   oil   into\n\n     intermediate products for further processing  at  other\n\n     locations  to produce gasoline.  The Facility  receives\n\n     oil  from many sources via pipeline, stores it in tanks\n\n     onsite,  and  processes the oil  into  products  to  be\n\n     shipped elsewhere by pipeline, railcar, and truck.  The\n\n     Refining  process  separates the crude  oil  into  four\n\n     products:   gas  oil,  naphtha  (pressure  distillate),\n\n     sulfur,  and  coke (solid carbon based material).   The\n\n     sulfur  is  generated because oil contains  significant\n\n     quantities  of sulfur that must be removed  to  produce\n\n     gasoline.   The gas oil and naphtha products  are  also\n\n     stored  in  the  Facility's  Storage  Tanks  prior   to\n\n     shipping by pipeline, while the solid sulfur and  solid\n\n     coke  are  shipped offsite by truck  or  railcar.   The\n\n     Facility  also  has  the utility  and  "

Within  this\n\n     program,  each Facility unit is systematically examined\n\n     to  identify hazards and ensure that adequate  controls\n\n     are  in  place to manage these hazards.  The  PHA  team\n\n     identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well\n\n     as  accident  prevention and mitigation  measures,  and\n\n     makes  suggestions  for  additional  prevention  and/or\n\n     mitigation   measures  when  the  team  believes   such\n\n     measures are necessary.\n\n     The  Santa Maria Facility primarily uses the hazard and\n\n     operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these\n\n     evaluations.  HAZOP analysis is recognized  as  one  of\n\n     the  most  systematic  and thorough  hazard  evaluation\n\n     techniques.  Other techniques utilized less  frequently\n\n     are  What-If/Checklist Analysis  and  Failure  Modes  &\n\n     Effects Analysis (FMEA).\n\n     The  PHAs are conducted using a team of people who have\n\n     operating  and engineering experience.  Typically,  the\n\n     HAZOP   team   consists   of   a   Technical   Services\n\n     Representative,   an  Operations  Representative,   and\n\n     someone  knowledgeable in the PHA  Methodology.
