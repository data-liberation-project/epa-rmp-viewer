The active mitigation systems in place at the Poneto facility are:\n>  Excess flow valves are located on all outgoing liquid and vapor valves on the storage tanks.  They close automatically if the volume of gas or liquid flowing through the line exceeds the normal flow rate.  They won\u00c2\u00bft reopen until the downstream shutoff valve is closed and the pressure equalizes on both sides of the valve seat.  Two principal causes of the excess valve closing are a ruptured hose or a broken pipe or shutoff valve downstream that is opened too quickly.\n>  Back check valves are located on the unloading lines of delivery trucks and are designed to ensure that the flow goes in one direction only.  This prevents anhydrous ammonia or propane from flowing to a transport tank from the storage tanks.\n>  Pressure-relief valves (four) are located on the top of the bulk storage tank, fixed steel piping and on the vaporizer to relieve pressure that is too great.  This can be caused by elevated temperatures in the summer or overfilling.  They open directly to the atmosphere at 250 psig and close when the pressure inside the tank drops below this pressure.\n>  An emergency shutoff switch, located along the side of the ammonia storage tank activates the emergency shutoff valves on the discharge side of the ammonia pump. \n>  An ample supply of water is available near the bulk storage tank from a nearby water tank and a nearby 25,000 sq. ft. pond to help knock down a vapor cloud.

      "SummaryText": "Poneto RMP Executive Summary\n\nSource and Product Description\nThe Andersons Poneto Wholesale Fertilizer facility is engaged in the handling, storage, shipping and receiving of bulk agricultural fertilizers (liquid and granular).  The facility began operations in 1976 and was purchased by The Andersons, Inc. in 1987.  Key personnel at the Poneto facility are Steve Labordus and Steve Towne.\n\nThe facility manufacturers a liquid ammonium polyphosphate fertilizer called 10-34-0 (N-P-K analysis) which is produced by combining anhydrous ammonia, phosphoric acid and water, in a controlled environment.  While the process is exothermic, the resulting heat is managed through a closed-loop process that virtually eliminates the production of a steam plume.  Production rates average 27,000 tons of 10-34-0 fertilizer per year.\n\nThe facility occupies approximately four acres and is situated four miles west of of the intersection of State Routes 1 and 218, on the western edge of the town of Poneto.  There is one residence across the road, on the south side of 218.  The town of Poneto is located on the east side of the facility, across the railroad tracks.\n\nThe RMP-regulated material involved in this fertilizer manufacturing process is anhydrous ammonia.  An 18,000 gallon tank is used for bulk storage of  the material. When filled to the maximum 85% capacity, this tank can hold 15,300 gallons of anhydrous ammonia.  This material is a gas at ambient temperature and pressure.  It is a liquid when stored under pressure inside the tanks.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is not a poison, but it is an inhalation / respiratory hazard.  Ammonia is a toxic material but it has no cumulative toxic effects on the human body.  However, it is acutely corrosive when it comes in contact with mucous membranes, in particular.  Anhydrous ammonia is a non-flammable gas.  Anhydrous ammonia has a strong chemical affinity for water and therefore, an abundant supply of water is our best defense against a small or large-sc"

The most probable time for an exposure or release to occur will be during a transfer from a delivery unit (generally a tanker truck) to the bulk storage tanks.  Flexible hoses must be connected properly.  Hoses on tank trucks are date-stamped are replaced by the transporter in advance of the expiration date or when defects are observed.  All transfers of ammonia are observed by Anderson personnel.\n\nTransfers from the storage tanks to the processing system or the grain drier occur inside fixed steel pipes and are automated from the control room.  No hoses are utilized in the operation.  Mass meters are used to indicate the rate of flow.\n\nWith elevated temperatures that occur during mid-to-late summer, the ammonia gas inside the bulk storage tank can expand, and possibly cause the relief valve to open in order to equalize the pressure inside the tank.  The relief valve will reseal itself when pressure is relieved.  These \u00c2\u00bfevents\u00c2\u00bf are very short in duration - a few seconds at the most.\n\nA complete failure or burst tank, as indicated by the worst case scenario, is highly unlikely.  The bulk storage tanks were built under strict guidelines established in the ASME pressure vessel code.  The bulk anhydrous ammonia storage tank is protected by concrete traffic barriers.  All welding and structural work done on the tank or appendages are performed by certified welders.  \n\nExplanation of How Hazard Releases are Prevented.\nPassive mitigation refers to equipment, devices, or technologies that function without human, mechanical or other energy input.  The passive mitigation systems in place at the Poneto facility are:\n>  Secondary containment dikes that meet or exceed regulatory standards.\n>  Bulkhead breakaway units located on the connection point to the storage tanks.
