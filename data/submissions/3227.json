It is governed by the citizens of the district who elect its board of directors, and it is staffed by approximately 160 regular employees. This plant is located in a residential subdivision in Nevada County, California called Lake Wildwood, and processes untreated surface water that originates from reservoirs in the High Sierra. It produces some of the finest drinking water in the world. \n\nThe Nevada Irrigation District's accidental release prevention policy involves a unifies approach that integrates technologies, procedures, and management practices. The district adheres to all applicable procedures of the Environmental Protection Agency prevention Program. The district's Emergency Response Policy involves the preparation response plans that are tailored to this facility and to the emergency response oft the community and to local responding agencies. It is in compliance with the EPA Emergency Response Program requirements.\n\nThe offsite consequences analysis includes two scenarios. The first scenario releases chlorine gas in ten minutes at an amount of two thousand pounds. The second scenario states that 317 pounds of gas would be released in sixty minutes. Any release of chlorine would trigger an alarm and AutoDial system and there would be quick response from district personnel and from emergency responding local agencies. It would activate our emergency response plan.\n\nThe Nevada Irrigation District's accidental release prevention program is in compliance with the OSHA PSM rule and is based upon the following key elements:\n7 A high level of training of our state certified plant operators.\n7 A preventative maintenance program with strict adherence.\n7 The use of state of the art process and safety equipment.\n7 The use"

They are trained and certified by the California Department of Health Services. As part of their certification and their training, safe chlorine handling , high standards of maintenance of processing equipment, release prevention and emergency response are made a top priority. Regular safety training, preventive maintenance of equipment, and continuing education are the intrinsic duties of the operators of this plant.\n\nThe District's nine treatment plant operators and supervisors make up the Chlorine Emergency Response Team. They are trained regularly in the usage of self-contained breathing apparatus while wearing B level chemical suits. The District has one ton and one hundred and fifty pound chlorine emergency repair kits. The response team's exercises include the use of these kits while wearing the suits and the self-contained breathing apparatus systems. Training exercises are performed at the plant site while simulating equipment failures. Each team member has regular cardiopulmonary testing. The District has a health clinic and provides excellent healthcare benefits.\n\nThe foundation of our accidental release prevention program is the chlorine leak detection system that is installed at the site. It is connected to an automatic dialing systems and a telemetry based alarm system that notifies the appropriate personnel who are on twenty-four hour call. This system as well as other processing systems are tested and maintained regularly. Major overhauls on all system components, including the leak detection system, are preformed annually.\n\nThe emergency response program includes interaction and communication with local and State responsive agen"

      "SummaryText": "cies. The Nevada County Department of Environmental Health, as part of their business plan program, inspects our facilities bi-annually and is notified immediately if there is a hazardous release. The Penn Valley Fire Protection District, as incident commander in the case of a chlorine release, coordinates evacuation procedures in a worst case scenario. The California State Office of Emergency Services and Nevada County Office of Emergency Services are also notified in a worst case scenario. The District's chlorine manufacturer is also notified.\n\nThese policies and procedures are described in the Nevada Irrigation District's Chlorine Process Safety Management Manual. This manual, as required by State and local regulatory agencies, also contains information and procedures relating to chlorine processing equipment, handling, leak response and repair procedures, education and safety training. It contains a HAZOP Study and various report forms.\n\nThe Lake Wildwood Treatment Plant meets all current safety requirements. As it has in the past, the Nevada Irrigation District will comply with any and all new requirements and advancements in water treatment processes and safety. The well being of our community and our employees is paramount in the goals of our organization."
