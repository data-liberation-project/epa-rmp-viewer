      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\n\nThe Bethany/Warr Acres Public Works Authority operates a wastewater treatment plant located in the northern portion of the service area. The plant uses chlorine to treat the wastewater for the area. The wastewater treatment plant holds safety as its first priority, especially when it comes to chlorine. The maximum inventory is 4 tons and the treatment plant limits the maximum number of cylinders in use at any one time to two.\n\nThe worst case scenario for Bethany/Warr Acres Public Works Authority Wastewater Plant is the release of a 1 ton cylinder resulting in an estimated Level of Concern [LOC] of 1.2 miles using the National Safety Council's ALOHA mapping program. The first alternate scenario represents the severing of a transfer hose [whip] from the cylinder to the header pipe. This has an estimated LOC of 0.99 miles and a release of approximately 1000 pounds. This alternate is the release scenario that is most likely to occur. The second alternate scenario is a release representative of a culmination of both of the previous scenarios. This could occur if a tank ruptured and other tanks were able, due to failure of controls, to flow back along the header pipe and out the broken transfer hose [whip]. This would result in the release of approximately 1.5 tons of chlorine and result in a LOC footprint of 1.4 miles. \n\nThe Bethany/Warr Acres Public Works Authority Wastewater Plant follows a strict operation, safety and maintenance program to minimize the likelihood of an accident occurring at the facility. Because of the strict implementation of the above-mentioned programs, this facility has not had a release within the last five years.\n\nThe Bethany/Warr Acres Public Works Authority Wastewater Plant holds training and refresher courses for the personnel at the facility regarding the chlorine system. However, if an accident occurred, the Local Emergency Planning Commission [LEPC] and the Deer Creek Volunteer Fire Department would be notified and woul"
