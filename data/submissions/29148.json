EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\n\nFarmland National Beef, L.P (Farmland National Beef) owns and operates a meat cutting and tray packaging facility in Moultrie, Georgia.  On site, Farmland National Beef has an ammonia refrigeration system which contains anhydrous ammonia, a regulated hazardous substance, for the refrigeration of meat at the facility.  The maximum intended inventory of anhydrous ammonia on site is above the threshold quantity listed in 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 68.130.\n\n\n\nSince the quantity of anhydrous ammonia exceeds the threshold quantity, Farmland National Beef is required to implement a Risk Management Program (RMP) at the Moultrie facility which includes three (3) major elements: hazard assessment, prevention program, and emergency response program.  The submission of the RMPlan presents the details of the RMP compliance measures conducted by Farmland National Beef.  The required RMP information was electronically submitted to the United States Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) in a timely manner before the date on which a regulated substance is first present above a threshold quantity in a process.\n\n\n\nFarmland National Beef is also subject to OSHA's Process Safety Management Program (PSM).  Based on the information presented in this program, Farmland National Beef is subject to Program Level 3 requirements of the RMP regulation.\n\n\n\n1.1 Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nFarmland National Beef is committed to the protection of the safety, health, and environment in our routine operations and emergency responses.  Our prevention and emergency response practices are developed to protect the public as well as our own employees.  It is our policy to comply with applicable laws, and to support and work with local emergency response agencies.  To implement this policy, the following plans are maintained and implemented at the Moultrie facility:\n\n\n\nEmergency R"

Moultrie, GA plant located at 189 West Bypass is a meat cutting and tray pack plant.  Fresh meat in large cuts is cut into consumer portions and packaged in consumer trays.  No slaughtering takes place at the plant and no live animals are received.  The ammonia refrigeration system provides the necessary refrigeration of the meat.  In addition, the ammonia refrigeration system is utilized to provide cooling for the plant itself.  There are approximately 25,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia located within the closed-loop ammonia refrigeration system. \n\n\n\n1.3 Worst Case Scenario\n\n\n\nSection 68.25 of the RMP Regulation defines a worst-case scenario as a release of the largest quantity of a regulated substance from a vessel or process line failure that results in the greatest distance to a specified endpoint.\n\n\n\nAt Farmland National Beef, the worst-case scenario is identified to be the release of anhydrous ammonia from the largest vessel containing anhydrous ammonia.  The anhydrous ammonia receiver is the largest ammonia vessel at the facility.  As an administrative control, the receiver is filled with anhydrous ammonia only to a maximum of eighty (80) percent (9,739 lbs of anhydrous ammonia) of its capacity.  The largest vessel is assumed to instantaneously release its entire contents in a worst-case accidental release scenario.  The anhydrous ammonia will then volatilize into the atmosphere.  Modeling of this release was performed using the EPA's offsite consequence analysis program RMP*Comp(tm) and shows that the toxic endpoint may reach a distance of 1.2 miles. This release would affect public and envir"

This failure will conservatively assume that 5,517 pounds of anhydrous ammonia will be released to the atmosphere in ten minutes.  Modeling of this release was performed using the EPA's offsite consequence analysis program RMP*Comp(tm) and shows that the toxic endpoint may reach a distance of 0.2 miles.  This release would affect public receptors.\n\n\n\nIn general, mitigation procedures in place at the Moultrie facility include a shutoff valves to isolate any line or vessel in case of an accidental release.\n\n\n\n1.4 The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nFarmland National Beef has specific process controls in-place to minimize the risks of spills. Farmland National Beef has a preventative maintenance program in place to address maintenance of all vital parts of the ammonia refrigeration system.  All inspection and testing procedures are addressed within this program.  In addition, there are many safety controls installed within the system.  These include an interlock system, relief and check valves, manual and automatic shutoffs and alarms located within the ammonia refrigeration system.  \n\n\n\n1.5 Five year Accident History\n\n\n\nFarmland National Beef, L.P. opened this plant in June 2001.  Operations by the prior owner of the property ceased in June 1996.  Farmland National Beef, L.P. does not have actual knowledge of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia during the past five years.\n\n\n\n1.6 The Emergency Response Program\n\n\n\nFarmland National Beef's emergency response policies summarize the actions to be taken in response to a chemical spill.  In the event of a spill, Farmland National Beef will react with the proper actions as listed in the Emergency Response Plan in association with the local emergency response agencies.\n\n\n\n1.7 Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nFa"
