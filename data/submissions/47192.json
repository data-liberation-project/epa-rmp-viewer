To protect this highly valued asset, Nashua Corporation will:\n\n-Provide the safest workplace posible\n-Strive to exceed applicable safety laws and standards\n-Strive to reduce and eliminate losses that can jeopardize the jobs of our people\n\nI.  Sationary Source information\n\nAddress:  Nashua Corporation\n               59 Daniel Webster Highway\n               Merrimack, NH 03054 \nPrimary activity at site:  Coating of specialty papers\nRegulated substance:  Vinyl acetate monomer\nUse of regulated substance:  Used in the production of a polyvinylacetate based adhesive\nMaximum Quantity onsite:  84,000 lbs\n\nII.  Worst Case Release Scenario\n\n-Scenario:  Instantaneous spill of 41,000 lbs of vinyl acetate monomer from a tranker truck during the unloading process.  The release would be limited to less than 2,196 pounds by the use of a spill containment pad and an underground containment tank system.  The release would take place over a 60-minute period.\n-Under worst case weather, the vinyl acetate would travel 0.31 miles before dispersing enough to no longer pose a hazard to the public.\n\nIII.  Alternate Release Scenario\n\n-Scenario:  A runaway reaction in the polymerization reator, containing 1,360 lbs (179 gals) of vinyl acetate monomer releases vapor into the venting system over a 120-minute period.  The vapor release would be limited to 400 lbs by a vapor condenser and a vent collection tank.\n-Under worst case weather, the vinyl acetate monomer vapors would travel 0.11 miles before dispersing enough to no longer pose a hazard to the public.\n\nIV.  Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe facility is subject to the OSHA PSM rule.  The PSM program is an ongoing project at the facility with special attention given to release prevention by improved maintenance, training, and equipment upgrades wher and when warranted.\n\nV.  Five Year Accident History\n\nThere have been no reportable"

Emergency Response Program\n\nThe facility's Emergency Response Program relies on the Merrimack NH Fire Department and Clean Harbors, Inc. to respond to releases of hazardous materials.  The facility has a SPCC Plan, which documents notification procedures to be followed during and after a release of a hazardous substance."
