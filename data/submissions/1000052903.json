A combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs are used to help ensure employee and public safety as well as protection of the environment.  This document provides a brief overview of the ongoing risk management activities that have been designed and implemented, including:\n\n\n\n-    A description of our facility and use of substances regulated by EPA's RMP regulation\n\n-    An overview of accidental release prevention programs \n\n-    A five-year accident history for releases of chemicals regulated by EPA's  RMP rule \n\n-    An overview of the emergency response program \n\n-    An overview of planned improvements at the facility to help prevent accidental chemical releases from occurring and adversely affecting employees, the public, and the environment \n\n\n\n\n\nTHE STATIONARY SOURCE AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n\n\nThe facility is the world's only supplier of ultra-high purity granular polysilicon.  This material is used in the manufacture of silicon wafers for the semiconductor industry.  The facility also produces ultra-high purity silane gas which may be shipped in cylinders or tube trailers to the semiconductor industry as well as being used as the raw material for the facility manufacture of granular polysilicon.  Silane is a flammable gas and is listed as a regulated flammable substance by the RMP rule.  It is stored underground as a refrigerated liquid.\n\n\n\nThere are no RMP regulated toxic materials.\n\n\n\nThe accidental release prevention programs and contingency planning efforts help effectively manage the hazards that are posed to employees, the public, and the environment through the use of this chemical.\n\n\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND THE CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nManagement systems address each of"

Employee Participation\n\n?    Permit to Work Systems including Hot Work Permits\n\n?    Inspection Programs\n\n?    Critical Instrument Checks\n\n?    Contractor Qualification and Safety Programs\n\n\n\nWe have implemented the following chemical-specific prevention steps:\n\n?    Silane is stored as a refrigerated liquid in underground tanks to reduce the possibility of tank damage and chemical release.\n\n?    All process systems are computer controlled and monitored by trained Chemical Operators.\n\n?    All process systems have automated redundant emergency shutdown modes and alarms.\n\n?    All changes to process systems must be reviewed and approved by specialists in engineering, operations, maintenance, and environmental, health, and safety.\n\n?    All process systems are included in documented preventative maintenance, inspection, and mechanical integrity programs.\n\n?    All employees must successfully complete training programs to be qualified to work with our processes and equipment.\n\n\n\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nRecords are kept for all significant accidental chemical releases that occur.  During the past five years there was one silane release of 224 lbs in October 2015 that meets the criteria specified in the EPA RMP rule in section 68.42(a).  There were no offsite injuries or damage.\n\n\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN\n\n\n\nThe MEMC/SunEdison Emergency Response Plan provides procedures and guidelines for an orderly and safe response to emergency situations. The Plan includes responses for protection of employees, the environment, community, and equipment resulting from hazardous releases of chemicals.  Our program is coordinated with our industrial neighbors, the City of Pasadena, and the South East"

These continued efforts include the following:\n\n\n\n?    Utilize employee hazard-recognition programs to help identify and address hazards within the site.\n\n?    Conduct detailed Root-Cause Analysis on serious incidents and reliability issues to prevent a similar occurrence.\n\n?
