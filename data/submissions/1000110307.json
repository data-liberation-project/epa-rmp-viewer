This Program will help prevent the occurrence of or minimize the consequences of catastrophic releases by stating our policies and procedures for the management of process hazards in start-up, operation, inspection, maintenance, and the other matters addressed in the federal standard.\nThis Executive Summary includes information required under 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 68.155.\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nThe Red Bluff WWRP implements a scheduled preventive maintenance program, including inspection and testing, to minimize the potential for accidental releases. Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) have been reviewed and revised to enable the employees to perform their work safely and efficiently.\nThe Red Bluff WWRP staff are trained only to manage incidental releases related to maintenance and operation activities and the facility is considered a non-responding facility per 40 CFR 68.90. Emergency response to accidental releases is coordinated with the local fire department and local emergency planning committee.\nStationary Sources and Regulated Substances\nThe Red Bluff WWRP utilizes chlorine gas (regulated substance) as a biocide in the treatment of wastewater.\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nA Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) as well as written process safety information has been developed to enable personnel to identify and understand the hazards posed by processes involving highly hazardous chemicals (HHC). Process safety information includes chlorine information, technology of the process information, and equipment information.\nThe PHA completed for this Risk Management Plan (RMP)/Process Safety Management Plan (PSMP) documents the process and the findings to minimize"

All employees involved in working with and around the chlorine system are trained in process and safety procedures.\nThe mechanical integrity of chlorine process equipment is documented and maintained through maintenance, inspection, and testing programs. In addition, a Management of Change program has been established to ensure proper review of a proposed change to the chlorine system.\nA pre-startup safety review is performed on new or modified processes to ensure that equipment and construction meet design specifications, procedures and training have been implemented, and hazard analysis recommendations are resolved prior to start-up.\nA Compliance Audit Program has also been implemented. The objective of this self-evaluation program is to ensure that a strong Risk Management Program is maintained, implemented, and followed by personnel.\nStaff have developed a formal documented system to manage incident investigations and follow-up. Each incident from a covered process that resulted in deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering-in-place, property damage, or environmental damage will be investigated, and an incident investigation report filed in the RMP/PSMP.\nRed Bluff WWRP management staff are committed to involving employees, or their representatives, in supporting the elements of the RMP/PSMP. The following elements involve employee participation regarding the RMP/PSMP:\n\u00b7\tInvolve employees in the PHA, Compliance Audits, and RMP/PSMP reviews and updates\n\u00b7\tProvide employee access to the RMP/PSMP\n\u00b7\tPresent an overview of RMP/PSMP requirements to staff annually\n\u00b7\tInvolve"

In addition, emphasis is placed on knowing evacuation procedures in the event of an emergency.\nThe WWRP chlorine system technology is not confidential and any information regarding the process or process chemistry is available for review in the RMP/PSMP.\nFive-Year Accident History\nNo accidents that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage onsite, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage involving the chlorine system have occurred at the facility in the past five years.\nEmergency Response Program\nThe RMP/PSMP Emergency Action Plan for the Red Bluff WWRP includes procedures to evacuate. The Red Bluff WWRP is considered a non-responding facility whose employees will not respond to an accidental release of chlorine. The Fire Department would respond to accidental releases of chlorine.\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\nNone anticipated at this time."
