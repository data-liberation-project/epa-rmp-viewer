We routinely train all of the staff on process safety as well as lockout tagout hazcom and food safety. We have located ammonia detectors in all areas where there is a risk for an ammonia leak, we have engineered in controls and a water absorbtion system in the event of a multiple system failure, will contain any ammonia that would be discharged through the relief valve vent lines. The training that we utilize for the operators of our ammonia refrigeration system consists of hands on, books and computer assisted training. We continuously monitor and audit our PSM system in order to prevent mechanical or operational failures of our system."
