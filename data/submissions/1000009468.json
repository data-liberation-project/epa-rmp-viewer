This source contains anhydrous ammonia. The accidental release prevention policy at this facility is to maintain this equipment in good operating condition, have the equipment inspected annually by the supplier of the anhydrous ammonia, utilize contractors that have experience and training with maintaining in anhydrous ammonia systems, and maintain an attendant during the transfer of ammonia to the storage tanks by the delivery truck. A process safety management plan is in place and incorporated into this risk management plan. All work conducted on this system is administered by the Senior Manufacturing Engineer responsible for chemical administration. This same individual is the Emergency Coordinator and responsible for the risk management plan and its implementation. \n\nEmergency Response Policies:\nThis facility is required to have an emergency and contingency plan under RCRA, a process safety management plan under OSHA, and a spill prevention control and counter measures plan. The emergency response plans required for this facility are compiled in one document known as the Integrated Contingency Plan (ICP).\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance:\nThe stationary source is made up of two storage tanks to store bulk anhydrous ammonia, two dissociators used to break down the anhydrous ammonia into its component elements of hydrogen and nitrogen, and the connecting transfer piping from the storage tanks to dissociators.  These storage tanks contain anhydrous ammonia which is the regulated substance.\n\nRelease Prevention Program:\nThe accidental release prevention policy at this facility is to maintain this equipment in good operating condition, have the equipment inspected annually by the supplier of the anhydrous ammonia, utilize contractors that have experience and tra"

A process safety management plan is in place and incorporated into this risk management plan. All work conducted on this system is done through the Facilities Engineering Department. Brian DeLucenay, as the Senior Manufacturing Engineer for chemical systems in this facility, is the emergency coordinator and primarily responsible for the risk management plan and its implementation.\n\nIn addition to periodic inspections, the release prevention actions also include equipping each storage tank with redundant pressure relief valves; used to protect tank integrity.  The reliefs are mounted on a three-way valve to allow, in the event of a pressure relief failure, the failed valve to be isolated while maintaining tank protection with the second relief.  In sections of piping that have the capability of being isolated, piping protection is provided with hydrostats to prevent over-pressuring the pipes.  The dissociators are equipped with pressure relief values at each point where the pressure is reduced in the system to prevent over-pressure of that part of the system.\n\nFive Year Accident History:\nDuring this period, a single incident occurred in December, 2007, where an estimated 5 gallons of anhydrous ammonia was released during periodic maintenance being performed on the storage tanks and exterior piping interconnecting the two storage tanks.  This material was released while changing a shutoff valve on the bottom of one of the storage tanks.  Primary organizations involved were the supplier of the anhydrous ammonia and qualified service contractor.  Investigation and cause/corrective actions were completed which resulted in improved prevention procedures and training put in place by the material supplier to prevent release of materials in the future while performing tank maintenanc"

      "SummaryText": "e. \n\n\nEmergency Response Program:\nAll emergency response operations are directed by the Emergency Coordinator, or in his absence one of the secondary emergency coordinators. Each of these individuals has a minimum of technicianA?s level of training. Plant personnel are trained to notify the personnel listed in the Integrated Contingency Plan when they discover an emergency situation. This call initiates action from the Emergency Response personnel and the Emergency Coordinator. These individuals determine the type and degree of response necessary. The Emergency Coordinator is responsible for notifying the local emergency response agencies through the 911 system in the community. This communication will activate the Van Wert County Emergency Management Agencies response plan for the type of emergency in progress. Their responsibility is to the community within the affected area. This facility is responsible for all personnel on its property. \n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:\nUpon completion of this plan and the recent Failure Modes and Effect Analysis this facility determined that the following changes are necessary to improve the safety of the operation.\n1) Conduct a more detailed hazard analysis incorporating external experts. This process will drive other changes to the process to improve the safety of the system.\n2)  Replace the flow check valve leading from the ammonia storage area to the process that will completely stop the flow of ammonia into the building and place it on a 5 year replacement schedule.\n3)  Place the hydrostats on a 5 year replacement schedule.\n4)  Place an easily accessible valve to be able to quickly shut off the ammonia feed into the facility.\n5)  Add word A?flammableA? to the piping containing dissociated ammonia.\n6)  Have piping tested semi-annually for leaks.\n7)  Install internal alarm system to detect leaks of ammonia.\n"
