Facility Policy\n\nThe owners, management and employees of Western Iowa Coop are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia or propane.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information\n\nWestern Iowa Coop is a farmer owned cooperative providing crop inputs and purchasing farmer produced products.  The primary activity at our anhydrous ammonia facility is storage, refilling nurse tanks and their sale to farmers.   Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrients.  \n\nThe maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia stored  at Pierson is 85% of capacity.\n\n                     Process 1 - Storage Tanks - 2\n\n                      Process 2 - Nurse Tanks  stored - tanks from the Washta location are stored at Pierson except when in use.\n\n\n3. The Worst Case Release Scenario and the Alternative Release Scenario.  \n\nA. The worst case release scenario for anhydrous ammonia would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes.  \nb. The alternative release scenario (or the most likely potential incident) is a release from a break in a transfer hose.  \n\n4. Accidental Release Prevention Program.\n\nWestern Iowa Coop has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by the American National Standards Institute Inc., and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OAHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \" Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\".  In addition, we comply with all applicable federal (EPA), state and local requirements.\n\nOur ammonia systems "

All main storage tank valves and hose end valves are locked when not in use.  The systems are inspected on a regualr basis with maintenance and preventative maintenance scheduled and documented. Liquid and vapor valves, hoses, excess flow valves, gauges and relief valves are replaced when necessary and or according to the guidelines in the ANSI Standards.  When valves or pumps need to be repaired,  they are either replaced or repaired by a professional contractor.\n\nTraining is provided to all employees at least annually, whenever there is a change in the process or whenever competency with the regulations is questioned.  The training consists of classroom lecture, current videos and on the job training.  Topics covered in this training include safety,  operating procedure for plant startup, plant shutdown, filling a nurse tank, unloading a transport,  emergency shutdown and startup after an emergency shutdown.\n\n5.    The Five Year Accident History\n\nWestern Iowa Coop Pierson, Iowa has had no accidental release of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years.\n\n6.The Emergency Response Program.\n\nIn the event of an emergency,  it is our policy to notify the local community fire department and request that they respond to the emergency.  In preparation for this, we have corridinated with all the local response agencies by providing information and facility tours to insure that they are familiar and properly prepared for an incident at our facility.  This will help to insure that our community had the strategy for responding to and mitigating the threat posed by an ammonia release  \n\nWestern Iowa Coop has:\na. a written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA Standard 29 CFR 1910.38;\n\nb. provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and Community Right to Know information as required under SARA Title II (EPCRA).\n\n7."
