Healthcare SC has a policy to limit tank filling to 90% of the tanks capacity to prevent spillage from overfilling.\r\n\r\n3   EMERGENCY RESPONSE\r\nThe facility qualifies for RMP Program 1 and has coordinated with local agencies to have the Facility included the community emergency response plan.  Further, the Facility is a non-responding stationary source, meaning that Healthcare SC, LLC personnel will not respond to a release of a regulated substance. Therefore, per 40 CFR \u00a768.90(b), this RMP need not include the specific emergency response program requirements of \u00a768.95. The Facility will follow the general emergency response procedures discussed below.\r\n\r\nIn the unlikely event of a TDI release, employees are to pull the fire alarm, which will signal immediate evacuation of the building and shut down the manufacturing process. As the chemicals are located on the norther portion of the building, employees will move to the southern portion of the property, unless it is deemed unsafe due to the direction of the wind flow at the time. The Vice Plant Manager, who serves as the RMP Emergency Contact, will immediately notify Fairfield County Emergency Management Agency (the local emergency response agency) to assist in the coordination of the safest and quickest response to contain any release, minimizing exposure to emergency responders, employees, and the public.\r\n\r\nThe Fairfield County Emergency Medical Service would transport any injured parties to the nearest hospital, as appropriate in responding to the medical needs of the patient. Once the scene is deemed safe, an emergency cleanup contractor will conduct the remediation and remove the hazardous waste. The Central Midlands Local Emergency Planning Commission (LEPC) and South Carolina State Emergency Response Commission (SERC) have both been notified"

      "SummaryText": "1  INTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nHealthcare SC, LLC constructed a polyurethane foam manufacturing facility (Facility) located at 1 Milly Way in Winnsboro, South Carolina. The Facility will begin operations in December 2019.  Healthcare SC will produce slabstock polyurethane foam by chemically reacting polyether polyols, diisocyanates, and minor additives. The cured foam will then be incorporated into foam mattresses.\r\n\r\nThe manufacturing process utilizes Mondur TD Grade A (TD80) as a raw material, generically referred to as Toluene Diisocyanate (TDI). The facility comprises three (3) TDI storage tanks, each with a capacity of approximately 4,500 gallons. The tanks are located inside the north end of the Facility. TD80 contains 2,4-Toluene Diisocyanate (2,4-TDI, CAS # 584-84-9) and 2,6-Toluene Diisocyanate (2,6-TDI, CAS # 91-08-7). The threshold quantity (TQ) for these chemicals is 10,000 pounds (lbs). Due to the exceedance of the TQ, the Facility is required to have a Risk Management Plan (RMP) in accordance with 40 CFR 68. This RMP has been developed based on the worst-case scenarios for two processes at the Facility.\r\n\r\nProcess 1 is the TDI storage tanks and associated piping. The worst-case scenario in this process is a catastrophic failure of a storage tank with a full capacity of 4,500 gallons. The storage tanks are located indoors in an area of the building that is surrounded by a concrete berm for containment in the event of an accidental release. Therefore, the liquid contents of a worst-case release from Process 1 would be contained within the building. The worst-case release scenario analysis performed in accordance with 40 CFR \u00a768.25 indicates that the toxic endpoint will not extend beyond the property and will not affect any public receptors.\r\n\r\nProcess 2 is the TDI unloading process at the Facility. TDI will be delivered in tanker trucks with an expected capacity of 6,000 gallons. However, the worst-case release scenario analysis has been performed conservatively by"

      "SummaryText": "assuming that the entire contents of a 11,600-gallon tanker would be released.  TDI released during unloading would flow to the north into an approximately three-foot tall concrete containment area. The worst-case release scenario analysis performed in accordance with 40 CFR \u00a768.25 indicates that the toxic endpoint will not extend beyond the property and will not affect any public receptors. \r\n\r\nThe Facility is new; therefore, it has not had any accidental releases.  As mentioned above, the distance to the toxic endpoint associated with a worst-case release is less than the distance to a public receptor.  Finally, Healthcare SC, LLC has coordinated with local emergency planning and response organizations. Therefore, per 40 CFR \u00a768.10(f), the Facility meets the eligibility requirements for RMP Program 1.\r\n\r\nThe Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) RMP forms are included in Section 2 of the RMP. Section 3 contains the assumptions and methodology used to perform the worst-case release scenario analysis. A letter certifying that, to the best of our knowledge, no public receptors would be affected by a release is provided in Section 4. Lastly, Section 5 contains a copy of the MSDS for TDI should additional information regarding the substance be needed.\r\n\r\n2   ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION\r\nThe company takes safety of employees and the surrounding public seriously, hence Healthcare SC has policies and procedures in place to prevent an accidental release. The release prevention program is designed to ensure proper working order of the equipment, safe tank filling, and employee safety.  Safety begins with proper training of all employees in the dangers and appropriate handling of the materials and equipment. This training will be conducted during on-boarding and annually at a minimum.\r\n\r\nPreventative maintenance and inspections are conducted to ensure proper working order of all equipment. Regulars inspections are conducted on all tanks, piping, pumps, and manufacturing eq"

The Facility will provide continue to coordinate with SERC, LEPC, and other response agencies to ensure preparedness in the event of an accidental release.\r\n\r\nHealthcare SC realizes the concerns of utilizing TDI in the manufacturing process. The Material Data Safety Sheet (MSDS) indicates TDI vapors are dangerous leading to breathing difficulties or death if inhaled. TDI should only be handled while wearing permeation-resistant protective gloves and clothing. Breathing of vapors, spray or dust should be avoided by wearing adequate respiratory protection, such as self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA). An emergency shower and eye wash station are located in the production area in case of exposure."
