Simpson Water Treatment Plant (\"facility\") located at 29528 FM 510 in San Benito, Cameron County, Texas.  The RMP meets the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) requirements for Prevention Program Level 3 (40 CFR 68) facilities and the Process Safety Management (PSM) requirements of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (29 CFR 1910.119). \r\n\r\nThe facility is located in a primarily rural area of Cameron County, Texas.  Properties adjacent to the plant include agricultural lands to the west, east and south.  FM 510 is located north of the site followed by four (4) residential properties to the north and northwest.  The approximate coordinates of the chlorine storage area are: \r\n\r\nLat: N26.135641\r\nLong: W-97.549307.\r\n  \r\nThe facility is stationary and maintains an inventory of chlorine that exceeds 2,500 pounds.\r\n\r\nGeneral information includes the following:\r\n\r\nProcess chemical:\t\t\tChlorine \r\nCAS number:\t\t\t\t7782-50-5\r\nTotal inventory:\t\t\t14,000 pounds\r\nNAICS code:\t\t\t\t22131:   Water Supply and Irrigation Systems\r\n\r\nMr. Eric Haydon, Operations Manager, is responsible for the implementation of the Risk Management Plan and the Process Safety Management.\r\n\r\nThe facility's accidental release prevention policy integrates technologies, procedures, and good management practices. Its emergency response policy involves the preparation of a response plan tailored to the facility and to the emergency response services available in the community.  The policy adheres to Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) 40 CFR 68 Prevention Program procedures and Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) 29 CFR 1910.119 Process Safety Management procedures where applicable, and complies with EPA and OSHA Emergency Response Program regulations.\r\n\r\nRMP regulations for Program Level 3 processes req"

The worst-case release scenario selected involved the complete loss of chlorine to the air from the largest container stored on site (2000 pounds). The worst-case chlorine release rate estimated at 200 pounds per minute.  The modeling results indicate that the maximum distance needed for the concentration of chlorine to reach the toxic endpoint (0.0087 ppm), due to a 10-minute release of 2,000 pounds of chlorine, is 2.2 miles. \r\n\r\nClean Air Act regulations require that the alternative release scenario selection is more probable than the worst-case scenario. The scenario selected involves a seal failure or vessel puncture. This could be the result of a mechanical failure, operator error or severe weather conditions such as a hurricane or tornado. This failure results in the release of the entire container's contents over a period of 30 minutes. The modeling results indicate that the maximum distance needed for the concentration of chlorine to reach the toxic endpoint (0.0087 ppm), because of a 40-minute release of 2,000 pounds of chlorine, is 0.3 miles. \r\n\r\nThe facility must prepare a five-year accident history in its RMP to assist in the prevention of future accidents. There have been no reportable accidents at the facility in the last five years.\r\n\r\nThe Accidental Release Prevention Policy involves an approach that integrates technologies, procedures, and management practices in compliance with all applicable EPA Prevention Program Level 3 requirements and OSHA Process Safety Management requirements. Chemical-specific prevention steps include availability of PPE that operators wear during connection/disconnection of chlorine, and staff awareness of the hazardous and toxic properties of chlorine.\r\n\r\nThe facility maintains safety information on its equipment used in the chlorine process.

In addition, the facility has prepared written procedures that provide clear instructions or steps for safely conducting activities associated with the chlorine process. \r\n\r\nThe facility maintains Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) and the manufacturers' equipment manuals in binders in the plant office.
