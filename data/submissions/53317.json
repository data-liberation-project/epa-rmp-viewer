The anhydrous ammonia system is designed, installed and maintained in accordance with ANSI Standard K61.1-1999 and State law.\n\nIn addition the company has specific operating procedures in place intended to minimize the potential for an accidental (and potentially catastrophic) release of anhydrous ammonia.  Finally, Terragro, Inc. has extended to the Moville Volunteer Fire Department the opportunity to visit our anhydrous ammonia plant, to participte in mock emergency simulation training and to avail themselves of specific anhydrous ammonia health hazard information and training provided by the company.\n\nFIVE -YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nTerragro, Inc., Moville, IA  has never had an accident involving anhydrous ammonia that caused death, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations or shelterings in place.\n\nTHE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM:\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving our anhydrous ammonia system, it is the policy of Terragro, Inc. to immediately notify the Moville Volunteer Fire Department and the Woodbury County, SD LEPC to request that they respond to the emergency.

In addition, copies of photographs taken of our plant have been provided (for reference) to both entities.\n\nThe plan is to minimize those hazards to human heaalth and to the environment that are associated with accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. Employees working at the bulk storage plant make routine observations prior to and during transfer operations of the anhydrous ammonia from the storage vessel(s) to nurse tanks. In so doing, they are able to detect problems before they arise. This routine inspection identifies any external portion of the system which may be under stress or about to fail.Repairs can be made before they become problematic. Employees are annually trained to recognize hazards associated with storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia. In addition to annual training for employees who have been on the job for a number of years, the company conducts training for new hires. This training includes classroom instruction, on-site training at the plant, and follow-up observation to determine the comprehension and understanding of the new hire. Finally, the company routinely invites local fire department personnel to visit the site. In the event that the local fire department requests assistance in training its employees on anhydrous ammonia, the company cooperates fully in their endeavors."
