      "SummaryText": "The Carpenter Co., Conover Division was initially built to produce flexible polyurethane foam for the furniture industry.  The pouring line has been expanded and modified several times over the ensuing years in order to improve the process, both with respect to equipment and with respect to chemistry, to conform to new state and federal regulations, and to meet ever increasing and changing demands by our customers.  A bonded polyester fiber batting has subsequently been added.\n\nTwo RMP regulated substances are used at this facility.  The line uses TDI (toluene-2,-4 diisocyanate and toulene-2,-6 diisocyanate), and pentane as a blowing agent.  Pentane is flammable but nontoxic. No other RMP-regulated substances are used at this facility.\n\n1. Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies\n\nCarpenter Co., Conover Division is committed to comply fully with all federal, state, and local rules and regulations regarding the proper handling, use, storage, and emergency response preparedness to prevent accidental release of chemicals, toxic or otherwise.  Furthermore, Carpenter Co. is committed to protecting the health and welfare of its employees, the community residents, as well as the environment.\n\nAn Emergency Response procedure for Carpenter Co. Conover Division has been developed and is located in the Contingency Plan.  This plan includes the procedures for informing the public and emergency response agencies when an accidental release occurs, documentation of proper first-aid and emergency medical treatment necessary to treat accidental human exposure, and procedures and measures for emergency response after an accidental release of a regulated substance.\n\n2. The stationary source and regulated substances handled\n\nThe Conover Division, located at 2009 Keisler Dairy Road, manufactures polyurethane foam products for use in furniture, bedding and other applications.  The manufacturing process incorporates the use of TDI as a reactant to produce the foam pro"

      "SummaryText": "duct. TDI is received primarily via railcars which holds approximately 190,000 lbs although tank trucks may be used if conditions warrant.  When required, the rail carrier moves the railcar from an outside holding area to the indoor unloading area.  Transfer hoses and associated equipment are connected and the unloading process is initiated.  TDI is transferred from the railcar to three 12,000 gallon storage tanks located in the interior tank farm near the pouring station.  TDI is pumped from the storage tanks to the pouring line through a strainer and heat exchanger prior to entry into the mix head.  In the mix head, TDI is combined with polyol, pentane, and other minor raw materials to initiate the foam production reaction.\n\nPentane is used as a blowing agent.  It is received by the facility in railcars which are off-loaded into a 30,000 gallon storage tank placed within a concrete containment. Pentane is held under a nitrogen blanket. Pentane is pumped directly from the storage tank to the pouring line where it enters the mix head.  There are monitors in the process areas to insure the accumulation of pentane is well below an explosive mixture.\n\n3.The general accidental release prevention program and the specific prevention steps.\n\nThis facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and all applicable North Carolina requirements.  Personnel training with protective equipment and practice drills for emergencies and spill response are an important part of our safety and preventive measures.\n\n4. Five Year Accident History.\n\nCarpenter Co., Conover Division has not had any TDI or pentane releases in the past five years from Carpenter Co., Conover Division. \n\n5. The Emergency Response Program\n\nAn Emergency Response procedure for Carpenter Co. Conover Division has been developed and is located in the Contingency Plan.

Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nEmployees are regularly scheduled for Hazardous Materials Handling training as well as spill drills. Emergency response training for the employees identified as responders is conducted regularly.  Also, numerous safety topics are addressed and discussed which promotes and emphasizes the importance of safety awareness at the Conover Division."
