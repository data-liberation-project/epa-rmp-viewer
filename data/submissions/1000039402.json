      "SummaryText": "The Agropur Luxemburg facility is a cheese manufacturing facility located in the Town of Luxemburg, Kewaunee County, Wisconsin.  The facility produces cheeses from milk purchased from local farmers.  The storage and processing of the milk into cheeses requires the use of anhydrous ammonia to provide cooling.  Milk that arrives at the facility for processing, as well as the cheeses produced must be chilled to maintain quality.  As a result of this need for chilling at the facility and due to a recent expansion of the facility, the total charge of the ammonia refrigeration system will exceed 10,000 pounds.\r\n\r\nAnydrous ammonia, while a necessary component of the cheese making industry, poses a threat to employees, contractors and the general public in the event of an uncontrolled release in a significant quantity.  Agropur has recognized the inherent risks involved with the use of anhydrous ammonia and has developed and implemented both a Process Safety Management (PSM) system to protect the onsite employees and a Risk Management Program (RMP) to protect the general public in the event of a release.\r\n\r\nAgropur's prevention program for the anhydrous ammonia system consists of the following elements:\r\n\r\n1) Safety information for ammonia has been gathered and evaluated to assist Agropur employees in understanding the hazards associated with working around an anhydrous ammonia system.  This information formed a basis for other prevention program elements to minimize the potential for accidental releases.\r\n\r\n2) A process hazard assessment (PHA) was performed in January 2014.  The purpose of the PHA was to identify inherent hazards involved in operating the ammonia refrigeration system and set a plan for creating procedures and controls to prevent releases from occurring.\r\n\r\n3) Written standard operating procedures (SOPs) are being developed so facility employees and qualified contractors have access to written step-by-step procedures for the safe operation and maintenance o"

Qualified operators of the ammonia refrigeration system will receive specialized training.\r\n\r\n5) A preventive maintenance program has been developed to assure that components of the ammonia refrigeration system are maintained in a good working order.\r\n\r\n6) Any proposed modifications to the ammonia refrigeration system will be evaluated and engineered via a documented management of change (MOC) process to confirm that the proposed changes will maintain a safe operating system.  Prior to the start-up of the new ammonia refrigeration system, Agropur, along with their qualified mechanical contractor, will perform a comprehensive evaluation of the changes and modify the RMP, if necessary, to reflect the changes made to the system.\r\n\r\n7) Employees at the Agropur Luxemburg facility have been active participants in the development of PSM and RMP programs, and will continue to have a role in the continuous improvement of both programs.\r\n\r\n8) Any incident, accident or near miss associated with the ammonia refrigeration system will be investigated thoroughly with a commitment to make improvements to the PSM and RMP as necessary to prevent future incidents, accidents or near misses.\r\n\r\n9) As part of the continuous improvement program, Agropur will conduct audits of the PSM and RMP programs at least once every three (3) years to identify and correct any parts of the PSM and RMP programs that are not performing as prescribed in the standards.  These audits will be conducted in addition to the regular continuous improvement program.\r\n\r\n10) Agropur will confirm through annual questionnaires that contractors working on or around the ammonia refrigeration system are aware of the hazards inherent to a facility with an ammonia refrigeration system in order to protect all"

For specific tasks that require a higher degree of oversight (hot work, cutting, grinding) in the vicinity of the ammonia refrigeration system, Agropur requires a hot work permit process be followed.\r\n\r\n11) Agropur has developed and implemented an emergency action plan (EAP) for the facility to protect its employees and the general public in the event of an emergency.  Employees and contractors are trained on the specifics of the EAP.  In addition, the local emergency responders as well as the Kewaunee County Emergency Government personnel have beed provided copies of the facility EAP and have been offered annual tours in order to become familiar with the facility.\r\n\r\nAlthough the main purpose of the Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions of 40 CFR 68 is to develop and implement programs to prevent releases of toxic substances, the Federal rule also requires that Agropur complete analyses of the theoretical impacts of worst case and alternate catastrophic releases from the facility.  These scenarios were evaluated using EPA's RMPComp online tool with populations obtained from MarPlot.  For the worst case scenario, we assumed a catastrophic failure of the high pressure receiver would result in the loss of 350 pounds per minute of anhydrous ammonia liquified under pressure from the high pressure receiver (HPR).  The HPR has a maximum allowable charge of 6,372 pound of ammonia.  This charge reflects 80% of the capacity of the HPR with the charge limited by engineering safety.  The worst case release scenario results in a 1.2 mile estimated distance to the toxic endpoint.  Per the census block information compiled in MarPlot, 143 individuals reside within 1.2 miles of the facility.  The alternate release scenario involves the release of 10 pounds of anhydrous ammonia for 30 minutes from a leaking pipe.  This scenario results in an estimated toxic endpoint of 0.1 mile.
