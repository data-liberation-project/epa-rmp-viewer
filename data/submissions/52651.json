The finished water was disinfected by chlorine before discharge. As of May 2008 One ton cylinders of chlorine are no longer utilized at this site and have been replaced with liquid Sodium Hypochlorite12.5%    Sulfur dioxide form one ton cylinders continues to be used to remove excess chlorine.residuals\n\n1.2 STORAGE \n\nChlorine and sulfur dioxide were both delivered to the treatment plant in one-ton containers. A maximum of ten one-ton containers of liquid chlorine was stored on site in the chlorine storage room. As of May 2008 liquid Sodium Hypochlorite12.5% has replaced the use of chlorine from one ton cyliders. A maximum of six one-ton containers of sulfur dioxide is stored on site in the sulfur dioxide storage room.\n\n1.3 PROCESS SAFETY MANAGEMENT (PSM) AT FACILITY \n\nThe Danbury Water Pollution Control Plant Risk Management Program (RMP) includes the following key elements to mitigate the effects of potential chlorine/sulfur dioxide release hazards\n\nOperator training\nPreventive maintenance program\nProcess specific safety equipment\nSafe and effective standard operating procedures, written with operator participation \u00bf\nHazard review of equipment and procedures\nAuditing and inspection programs\nComprehensive management program\n\nFurther, DWPCP maintains an active environmental, health, and safety program with the following elements specifically supporting the safe handling of chlorine/sulfur dioxide and the chlorination process.\n\nRespiratory protection (SCBA) program \u00bf\nChlorine/Sulfur Dioxide detectors\nChemical right to know program\nPersonal protective equipment program\n\n1.4 DESCRIPTION OF THE FACILITY AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nThe DWPCP has the design capacity to handle 15.5 million gallon per day.

The sulfur dioxide storage area is equipped with an exhaust fan that's intake is mounted near the floor.  The fan can be activated by a switch located outside the building.  Two exit doors are provided in the sulfur dioxide storage room.\n\n1.6 FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nDWPCP has never had an accident involving sulfur dioxide that required hospitalization or care by a physician, or that caused death, injury, property/environmental damage, evacuations, or shelterings-in-place.\n\n1.7 EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe DWPCP has a site-specific Chlorine/Sulfur Dioxide Emergency Response Plan (ERP), revised May 17, 1996, which outlines employee procedures in the event of an emergency.  The facility's ERP includes specific procedures for material handling, emergency planning, evacuation, contact for emergency response organizations, reporting, training, fire protection, and media relations.  A plant layout has also been given to the fire department.\n\n1.8 PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nNo changes to the safety procedures currently in place at the facility are planned at this time.\n\n1.9 OFF-SITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\n\nThe impact area of a potential release of  sulfur dioxide was determined using EPA guidance documents.  The worst case analysis is the potential release of chlorine or sulfur dioxide from a single one ton container over a ten minute period.  The alternative release is a more gradual release corresponding to a sixty minute period.  The results of the analysis are detailed in the RMP and are summarized below:\n\nDescription\t\t\t\t\tWorst-Case Release\t\tAlternate Release\nRadial Distance to Toxic Endpoint of 3 ppm\t\t1.3 miles\t\t\t0.1 miles\nQuantity of Sulfur Dioxide Released\t\t2,000 pounds\t\t\t1,260 pounds\nPopulation in Release Area\t\t\t\t11,518\t\t\t\t46\nSchools in Release Area\t\t\t\t3\t\t\t\t0\n\n\n\nRMP Vali"

The Chlorine/Sulfur Dioxide system is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with applicable codes and state law.\n\nThe treatment plant maintains a Self-Contained Breathing Apparatus (SCBA) and The Chlorine/Sulfur Dioxide Institute's Emergency Kit B for one-ton containers.  This equipment is stored in a room that is adjacent to the room that houses the ton containers.  DWPCP personnel receive training on the use of the breathing apparatus and the emergency kit.  The kit contains the necessary tools and other equipment to contain valve leaks and to repair small holes in a ton container, and capping devices for the fusible plugs in the ton containers.  Ton containers are equipped with fusible metal pressure relief devices.  Most ton containers have six fusible metal plugs, three in each end.  The fusible metal is designed to melt between 158\u00b0F and 165\u00b0F to relieve pressure"
