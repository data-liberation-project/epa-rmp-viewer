We have plans in place under the Annex R (chemical release) and Annex T (Terrorism) that fall under our Homeland Security Department and the 911 system. These plans are part of the RMP binder. If any type of incident should occur, we call 911 and seek high ground.\r\n\r\n2.\tYour facility and the regulated substances handled\r\n\r\nWe are the drinking water supply for St. Bernard Parish and we use chlorine for disinfection.  Our state requires and has approved of this type of disinfection in preparing potable water from the Mississippi River. \r\n\r\n3.\tThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps\r\n\r\nMaximum intended inventory was included in the hazard review. Safe limits, equipment specifications and codes were located in the safety information section of the RMP manual.  Signs warning that a toxic hazardous chemical, chlorine, is in the area are now properly posted. Chlorine cylinders are being stored in a sealed room.\r\n\r\n4.\tThe five-year accident history\r\n\r\nIn the past five years, we have had no accidental releases of chlorine.\r\n\r\n5.\tThe emergency response program\r\n\r\nOur facility has an emergency response plan in Section IX and Appendix E (Annex R and Annex T) of the Risk Management Plan. These sections include the procedures to be taken in the event of a chlorine leak being detected and the initiation of the 911 notification process. The St. Bernard Fire Department, St. Bernard Office of Emergency Preparedness, and State Police are included in the notification process. The fire department is designated as the On-Scene Coordinator in the event of a chlorine leak.\r\n\r\n6.\tChanges made to improve safety\r\n\r\nNew safety enhancements include tank mounted auto shut off valves and a 1-ton capacity Scrubber System. \r\n\r\n7.
