This commitment is embraced by each member of our team, no matter what position or area. Our active role includes an obligation to point out any deficient safety or environmental practices that are observed anytime, anywhere. Positive reinforcement will be our primary motivation tool to benchmark satisfactory performance. Safety hazards or environmental concerns are exposed and relayed to team members without fear of reprisal or resentment. Great safety and environmental records are a team effort.\r\n\r\nFACILITY DESCRIPTION AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED:\r\n\r\nThe facility is located on a nominal 7 acre site, with paved shipping and receiving areas. The major structures and their designated functions are: Warehouse w/ docks; Receiving Area w/ docks; Machinery Spaces; Production Areas; Coolers; and Warehouses. The facility produces cheese products. The facility operates two (2) anhydrous ammonia refrigeration systems. While the quantity of ammonia in only one of the refrigeration systems exceeds the 10,000 pound threshold for RMP-regulated anhydrous ammonia, each system is managed as though it were subject to the Risk Management Program regulations. \r\n\r\nThe single-stage ammonia refrigeration system is used to cool a secondary cooling agent: food-grade glycol. This secondary cooling agent is circulated to various heat exchangers for space cooling, product cooling, and process equipment cooling. The refrigeration system is designed to provide: optimal safety performance (through the minimization of ammonia piping and equipment); operating flexibility (through the availability of multiple operating equipment combinations); economy and efficiency of operations (through the use of operating pressures commensurate with the degree of cooling required); and, consistency of operation, utilizing programmable logic control"
