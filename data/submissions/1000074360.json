The CAA makes it clear that facilities that handle hazardous substances bear the primary responsibility for ensuring their safe use.  This statutory mandate required EPA to establish a list of regulated substances as well as propose elements of an accidental release prevention program.\n\n\n\nUnder the requirements of Section 112&reg;, stationary sources (facilities) must identify and assess their chemical hazards and implement certain activities that are designed to reduce the likelihood and severity of accidental chemical releases.  Also, facilities must submit a risk management plan {RMP) that summarizes these activities, and the plans will be available to state and local governments, the public and other stakeholders.  The hazard assessment data disclosed by facilities can be used by local emergency planning committees (LEPCs) and other local response agencies to improve community emergency response planning.  Also, the information in the risk management plan gives citizens the opportunity to work with industry to reduce risks to the community from chemical accidents.\n\n\n\nThe final RMP rule spells out requirements for the following basic components of a risk management program that regulated facilities must implement:\n\n\n\nA hazard assessment program that identifies and analyzes the potential onsite and offsite impacts of worst- case and alternative accidental release scenarios of regulated substances, and includes documentation of five- year accident histories involving regulated substances;\n\n\n\nA prevention program that covers operating procedures, maintenance, training, management of change, process safety information"

      "SummaryText": ", etc., for operations involving regulated substances; \n\n\n\nAn emergency response program to mitigate any accidental releases that occur; and\n\n\n\nAn overall system to manage the development and implementation of a risk management program.\n\n\n\nA description of the facility and the regulated substances handled: The Ghent Station is a coal-fired electric power generation station consisting of four individual units.  Units 1, 3, and 4 employ selective catalytic reduction (SCR) technology, which uses anhydrous ammonia, to reduce nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions at the stack.  Anhydrous ammonia, stored in two 90,000 gallon storage tanks, is the only CAA 112 RMP regulated substance at this facility above the threshold quantity levels established by EPA.\n\n\n\nAnhydrous ammonia (NH3) is a colorless gas at ambient temperature or pressure; it is, however, stored as a liquid under pressure.  The gas is less dense than air, but when liquid anhydrous ammonia is released it may aerosolize and behave as a dense gas.  The effects of anhydrous ammonia inhalation range from irritation to severe respiratory injuries to death.  Anhydrous ammonia is self-alarming; its strong odor is noticeable at concentrations above 50 ppm; the concentration that is immediately dangerous to life and health (IDLH) is 300 ppm.  In general, people will not remain in the presence of anhydrous ammonia so that the primary threat is to people who are unable to evacuate the area.\n\n\n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response policies: This facility complies with requirements for hazardous materials use, and it is Ghent Station's policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws.  If an emergency were to occur, it is Ghent Station's policy to notify the Carroll County LEPC and respond to the emergency.  A site specific emergency plan has been developed to address emergencies.\n\n\n\nFive-year accident history:  The Ghent Station has not had an accident in the past five years involving anhydrou"

The anhydrous ammonia system is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with applicable ANSI guidelines, engineering codes, manufacturer specifications, best management practices, and state law.  The Ghent Station is required to comply with the most stringent EPA RMP and OSHA prevention programs.\n\n\n\nThe emergency response program: In the event of an emergency involving the anhydrous ammonia system, the automated controls or the operator will close the main valves, shut down the system and evacuate the immediate area.  When staffing levels permit, the in-house response team will take appropriate measures including the use of standard fire hoses to contain the release.  Outside agencies are available to respond to releases beyond the capabilities, level of expertise, or availability of the in-house emergency response team.  If any release is likely to have off-site impacts, the local emergency services will be notified.  Ghent Station's in-house emergency response team members are trained to the Hazardous Materials Technician level as defined by 29 CFR1910.120.  Ghent Station employees are trained to use self-contained breathing equipment and have taken OSHA Hazard Communication training as well as anhydrous ammonia general awareness training.  \n\n"
