The Corporation's CCN boundary encompasses 973 square miles and either surrounds or is adjacent to 16 cities and/or communities that operate public water systems. The system presently serves over 43,200 meter connections (representing an estimated population of 140,000), which include households, numerous businesses, 31 schools and 15 other Public water Systems from 6 surface water treatment plants and 4 reverse osmosis (RO) treatment plants. The surface water treatment plants treat surface water conveyed by 6 irrigation districts. The original source of the raw water is the Rio Grande River.\n\n\n\nUnited States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) Regulation 40 CFR Part 68, Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions, requires the development of Risk Management Plans/Programs (RMP) for regulated facilities that store/handle certain substances above a listed threshold quantity. Such facilities must register with the US EPA, list their regulated substances, estimate the off-site consequences of worst-case and alternate-case release scenarios, document its applicable prevention measures and coordinate its emergency responses with appropriate local/state authorities.\n\n\n\nNAWSC Plant # 4 and Owassa RO is a regulated facility under 40 CFR Part 68, because of the presence of chlorine gas (Chemical Abstract Services [CAS] No. 7782-50-5) over a regulated threshold quantity of 2,500 po"

It is also subject to United States Occupational safety and Health Administration (US OSHA) Regulation 29 CFR Part 1910.119, Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals, because it stores chlorine in excess of a threshold quantity of 1,500 pounds. The OSHA PSM requirements are reflected in the Accident Prevention Program Level 3 of the US EPA RMP.\n\n\n\nFacility Information: The primary activity at the site is the potable treatment of raw water for sale to retail consumers and other water systems. Its overall treatment capacity is 6.0 million gallons per (MGD). The main treatment processes for Plant #4 consists of: aeration, clarification and filtration. The Owassa RO plant is adjacent and contiguous to Plant #4 and utilizes the reverse osmosis process to purify raw water. As part of conventional purification processes, chlorine is added as a solution in water between the aeration and clarification steps and as a gas prior to filtration. As a part of RO purification, chlorine is added as a gas post\n\nreverse osmosis treatment. Chlorine is stored on-site in: 2 - 150 pound pressurized steel cylinders and 4 - 1 ton pressurized steel containers. The total amount in storage is 8,300 pounds.\n\n\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario: Not listed in the executive summary for security purposes.\n\n\n\nAlternate-Case Release Scenario: Not listed in the executive summary for security purposes.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program: The facility has been reviewed for general compliance with applicable codes and standards and is developing a Process Safety Management Program (PSM) as required by US OSHA. That Program seeks to ensure the safe operation of regulated facilities for all aspects of construction and operation.\n\n\n\nFive Year Accident History: There have been no accidental releases of chlorine gas in the past 5 years that have caused any deaths, injuries or significant property damage, nor to the best of our knowledge, have resulted in any off-site deaths, injuries, ev"
