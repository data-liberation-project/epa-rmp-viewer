The Union Carbide facilities at South Charleston, Institute, Polyolefins Process Research & Development Plant (PPRD), and New Yard share leveraged support and management and are collectively called West Virginia Operations.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\n\n\nWest Virginia Operations (WVO) is strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety. This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. If such a release should occur, primary incident response is via municipal agencies activated by 911.  Incidents involving Union Carbide facilities are also responded to by the Union Carbide incident commander. We are also an active member of the Kanawha/Putnam Emergency Planning Committee which provides additional emergency response expertise.\n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n\n\nThe Polyolefins Process Research & Development Plant (PPRD) currently has 4 RMP regulated substances present in 2 covered processes. Union Carbide handles and stores threshold quantities of the following EPA RMP-regulated flammable substances at the PRD plant:\n\nPropylene Ethylene Isopentane\n\n1-Butene\n\n\n\nNo changes have been made with respect to flammable worst-case and flammable alternative-case scenarios from 2014 to 2019 RMP submittals.  However, there is an increase in the estimated population number within the modeled distance of impact associated with the worst-case scenario compared to 2014.  This is also true for the flammable alternative-case scenario.  This is only an "

Key elements include:\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nWe maintain a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes. Examples include Material Safety Data\n\nSheets for all the hazardous chemicals, Equipment Design Specification sheets, Reactive Chemicals Test results, and many others. This information is maintained up-to-date and is available to operating personnel.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified, evaluated, and controlled effectively. The methodology used to carry out these analyses include:\n\nChecklists, What If, Audits, Reactive Chemical/Process Hazard Analyses, Chemical Exposure Index, Fire & Explosion Index, and Layers of Protection Analyses. The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are "

These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround. The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\nOur facility has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes. Refresher training is provided on a continuing basis.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nWe carry out a highly documented Planned Preventative Maintenance Program (PPM) which provides checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations. Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls, pumps, and compressors. Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices. Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed. Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\n\n\nManagement of Change\n\nUnion Carbide facilities require management of all modifications to process equipment, procedures, raw materials, and processing conditions other than \"like for like\", by identifying and reviewing them prior to implementation of changes.

These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\n\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nSelf assessments and audits are conducted on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented. Audits are carried out at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\n\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nUnion Carbide Corporation promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a significant release of a regulated substance. These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring. All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nUnion Carbide Corporation believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort. Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements. In addition, our employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP rule, including information resulting from process hazard analyses in particular. Operators, Maintenance and Engineering Staff personnel participate in process hazard analysis, developing and improving operating procedures, accident investigations, safe work permitting, isolation of energy, hot work, self assessments, audits, emergency drills, pre-start-up safety reviews and management of change.\n\n\n\nContr"

      "SummaryText": "actors\n\nOur company hires contractors to perform specialized maintenance and construction activities. Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is performed. West\n\nVirginia Operations has a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related the\n\nContractor's work and the processes. Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.\n\n\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe emergency response program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations. Detailed emergency response plans are developed and coordinated with the Kanawha/Putnam Emergency Planning Committee and the community.\n\nThe operations at Polyolefins Process Research & Development Plant (PPRD) are included in the site wide Emergency Response Plan.  The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post- incident decontamination of affected areas. The plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within our processes that would require a modified emergency response.\n\n\n\nTo ensure proper functioning, emergency drills are conducted to enhance skills and tactics for responding to an accidental chemical release. Critiques are held on drills and actual events. Emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced. In addition to the on-site emergency squad, The Dow Chemical Company has Distribution Emergency Response Teams (DERT) throughout the United States that are available to distribution emergency within our area. \n\n\n\nKanawha Putnam Emergency Planning Committee (KPEPC) is the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) with which our emergency plan has been coordinated and verified."
