An accidental release of a regulated substance would be detected by strategically-located VOC monitors that would immediately alert production personnel.  All drums and cylinders are leakproof-tested after filling; all canisters are leak-tested each day of operation. All tank cars are physically disconnected, valved-off, and capped during off-hours.  Security fencing, cameras, and alarms exist throughout the entire production facility. Site periodically conducts Leak Detection And Repair monitoring (LDAR) for the Ethylene Oxide & Propylene Oxide connections, valves, etc., to  ensure no leakage of these substances.\n\n\n\nB.  An Emergency Action Plan has been prepared and submitted to the Colleton County Fire & Rescue Department and the LEPC specifying a response and warning system in the event of an accidental release of a regulated substance.  The facility also conducts quarterly evacuation drills according to the Emergency Action Plan.\n\n\n\n2.  STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n     -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nA.  The primary activity is the repackaging of chemicals into drums, cylinders, and canisters for medical sterilization businesses and for synthesis customers.\n\n\n\nB.  The regulated substances are: \n\n           - Ethylene Oxide  \n\n           - Propylene Oxide   \n\n          \n\n3.  RELEASE SCENARIO\n\n    The Accidental release prevention is accomplished through the RMP/PSM elements with emphasis on Management of Change, Process Hazard Analysis, Pre-startup-Safety Review, Mechanical Integrity and Employee Training. The site production, tank farm areas are monitored with cameras, chemical sensors, fire detection, etc. \n\n    \n\n4.  PREVENTION\n\n     --------------------\n\n\n\nA.  The two regulated substances at the Green Pond plant are covered by the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard. Drums, totes, Cannisters, rail cars, etc., comply with the DOT reg"

Accidental release prevention is accomplished through the RMP / PSM elements with emphasis on Management of Change (MOC), Process Hazard Analysis, Pre-startup & Safety Review PSSR), Mechanical Integrity and Employee Training.\n\n\n\n5.  FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n     ------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nA.  Approximately 1700 on May 15 to 0700 May 16, 2017 there was slow release of Ethylene Oxide (EO) vapor due to the improper closing of the wheel vapor valve on the dome of the railcar, as well as failure to seal the extension pipe with its CGA cap. It was determined that no hazard would be expected to the local area due to the slowness of the leak over time .  To ensure that future releases do not occur, immediate retraining of the employees on the importance of railcar procedures was completed. It was stressed how critical the CGA cap is to the system and to always ensure that the wheel valves are completely closed. Leak checks to be performed in order to ensure a proper seal has been made with the plug. \n\n\n\n6.  EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n     ---------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nA.  Evacuation drills have been conducted since 1997.  An evaluation of each drill is completed and changes are made based on the findings.\n\n\n\nB.  Walkie-talkies are used as a communication device in case of an emergency.\n\n\n\n7.  PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n     ----------------------------------------------------------------- \n\nA. Site is planning to acquire a computer based maintenance management system that would be more robust and flexible than the exist one. This would help to facilitate preventive maintenance activities, including work orders. Site would continue to participate with the local fire department, LEPC, etc., to ensure potential safety and environmental risks to be as low as reasonably practicable.\n\n"
