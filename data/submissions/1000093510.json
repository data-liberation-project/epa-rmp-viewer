This process safety information includes information pertaining to the hazards of Ammonia (anhydrous), information pertaining to the technology of the Ammonia refrigeration process, and information pertaining to the equipment utilized in the Ammonia refrigeration process.\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis: SPF will update and re-validated the PHA as necessary and at least every five (5) years. The PHA was conducted using the methodology specified in 40 CFR 68.67, and was performed by a team with expertise in engineering and process operations, including at least one employee who has expertise in the Ammonia refrigeration process, and at least one member knowledgeable in the specific PHA methodology used. A system has been established to promptly address the team's findings and recommendations; assure that the recommendations are resolved in a timely manner and that the resolution is documented; document what actions are to be completed ; complete actions as soon as possible; develop a written schedule of when these actions are to be completed; and communicate the actions to operating, maintenance and other employees whose work assignments are in the process and who may be affected by the recommendations or actions.\r\n\r\nOperating Procedures: SPF has developed and implemented written operating procedures to provide clear instructions for safely conducting activities at each operation where Ammonia (anhydrous) is utilized.
