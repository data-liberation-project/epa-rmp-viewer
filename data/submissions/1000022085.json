The Risk Management Plan (RMP) encompasses all the elements of the Risk Management Program. Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at the GAWWTP empha safety, training, and maintenance.\n\nThe GAWWTP is located in Pasadena, Texas, 10 miles east of Houston. Chlorine is used to disinfect wastewater and sulfur dioxide neutralizes the chlorine before discharge to the Houston Ship Channel. The facility treats an average flow of 5.5 million gallons per day (MGD) of wastewater and has the capacity to store approximately 16,000 pounds (lbs) of chlorine and 12,000 pounds (lbs) of sulfur dioxide on-site at any one time. Both chlorine and sulfur dioxide at the facility are contained in six 1-ton containers that are on a standby/on-line basis to ensure the chlorination/neutralization process is continuous. Chlorine and sulfur dioxide is drawn from the 1-ton containers in a gaseous state.\n\nThe GAWWTP preventive maintenance program maintains equipment related to chlorine and sulfur dioxide process to ensure it is fully operational.\n\nA worst-case scenario was estimated, per the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) guidance, to provide the greatest distance in any direction to the established toxic endpoint. The worst-case release quantity, established by the regulations, is the greatest amount of chlorine or sulfur dioxide held in a single vessel. The worst-case quantity of chlorine or sulfur dioxide at GAWWTP was determined to be a 1-ton container. In accordance with 40 CFR Part 68.25, it is assumed that the"

      "SummaryText": " gas is released over a 10 minute period; therefore, the release rate is estimated to be 110 pounds per minute (lbs/min).\n\nNo administrative controls or active mitigation measure were included in the worst-case scenario. The EPA's RMP Comp software was used to determine the distance to the toxic endpoint for the worst-case scenario, a distance of 0.9 miles. The facility is considered urban topography due to the nearby housing and commercial developments.\n\nThe GAWWTP has developed an accidental release prevention program that includes several key elements. GAWWTP is subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard and uses many elements of the PSM in its RMP accidental release prevention program. The primary safeguard for the chlorine and sulfur dioxide process is the on-duty operator. An operator is on-duty at GAWWTP eight hours a day, seven days a week.\n\nThe GAWWTP also has several programs in place to prevent accidental chlorine or sulfur dioxide releases. Specifically, the facility trains operators on the proper operation of the chlorination process, uses state-of-the-art safety equipment, and implements a preventive maintenance program to ensure the process equipment is operating properly.\n\nThe GAWWTP has developed and implemented an Emergency Action Plan and an Emergency Operations Plan that contain provisions for trained employees to respond to incidental chlorine or sulfur dioxide releases. However, in the event that the release is beyond the control of the operators, personnel have a mechanism in place to notify the Fire Department for assistance. Equipment available for handling chlorine or sulfur dioxide leaks at the GAWWTP includes Self-Contained Breathing Apparatus (SCBA). The Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) will provide additional support in the event of an emergency."
