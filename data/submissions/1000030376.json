The following provides an approximate order of priority for responding to emergencies:\r\n \r\nResponse to personnel injuries\r\nStopping leak/discharge\r\nContainment of leak/discharge\r\nCorporate notification\r\nNotification to governmental agencies\r\nSpill clean-up/decontamination\r\n \r\n\r\nOperation of the EOC should allow several of these priorities to occur simultaneously.\r\n\r\n5.9.3  \tSpecify Mitigating Actions\r\n\r\nOnce the immediate goals and objectives are established, a tactical plan should be developed which specifies the mitigating actions which are needed. The tactical plan should address the following questions:\r\n \r\nDoes the area need to been evacuated?\r\nDo hot and cold zones need to be established in the area?\r\nDoes anyone need to be rescued from the area?\r\nWill anyone require medical attention?\r\nWhat corrective actions should be taken which will contain, control, or stop the emergency conditions?\r\nWhat company personnel, off-site responders, or government agencies should be contacted?\r\n \r\n\r\nMitigating actions must be tailored to the type of hazard present. For example, containment might be appli"

This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers such areas as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  This program has been prepared pursuant to Part 68 of Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations.\r\n\r\nThis RMP is prepared for the Boskovich Farms, Inc. facility located at 711 Diaz Avenue, Oxnard, California.  The facility is a produce preparation, storage, and distribution facility which operates various ammonia refrigeration systems to cool vegetable or fruit as food produce prior to distribution.  Boskovich Farms, Inc. has approximately 34,600 pounds of anhydrous ammonia refrigerant at the site in several refrigeration systems including portable HydroVac units, the Hydrocooler, two ice machines, and the main refrigeration systems for the cooler buildings.\r\n\r\nIn July 1993 Boskovich Farms, Inc. prepared a Process Safety Management (PSM) Plan and a Risk Management and Prevention Program (RMPP).  The documents have been updated periodically as required.  These documents are referenced by this RMP because they contain some of the elements required by the EPA for the RMP.\r\n\r\nBoskovich Farms, Inc. designates Steven Marquez as the Compliance Officer.  Mr. Marquez has the responsibility to plan, organize, implement, monitor and control the associated risks of our hazardous materials management.  All records associated with the prevention program elements are retained for a minimum of five years unless otherwise specified in the CalARP regulation.\r\n\r\n1.1 \tACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE\r\n\r\nTo prevent the accidental release of ammonia, Boskovich Farms, Inc. has developed the following:"

This scenario is considered very improbable and would result in offsite impacts with a calculated Toxic Endpoint of 0.6 mile.  The Alternate Scenario considers a leaking valve.  This is a scenario that is moderately probable but should not result in offsite consequences.\r\n\r\nIn order to reduce the distance to the toxic endpoint from an accidental release the followi"

Recommendations from the Hazard Review and Seismic Assessment are expected to being  implemented.\r\n \r\nSECTION 2\r\n\r\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\r\n\r\n2.1 \tWORST-CASE SCENARIO\r\n\r\n2.1.1 \tChemical Name\r\n\r\nAnhydrous Ammonia (Chemical Formula: NHc; CAS No. 7664-41-7)  is commonly used for fertilizer production and an industrial refrigerant.   \r\n\r\nDepending on the concentration and duration release and exposure, the health effects of ammonia gas can range from mild to severe irritation to the lining of the nose, throat, eyes, and lungs.  Inhalation of concentrations above 1000 ppm may injure the lungs with potentially fatal results.  \r\n\r\nDue to its low odor threshold of 5 ppm, ammonia has very good warning properties.  However odor is not a safe nor recommended detector of ammonia in the work place.  On a time weighted average of exposure, or repeated exposure to low levels, which are either at or below the AIHA specified maximum airborne concentration known as EPRG-1, a release of ammonia may reduce a worker's ability to sense the presence of ammonia.\r\n\r\nThe level of concern(LOC) as mandated in the CalARP regulations, EPRG-2, maximum airborne ammonia concentration of 200 ppmv. At this acute concentration it is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or otherwise serious health effects or symptoms which could impair an individual's ability to take self-protective action.\r\n\r\nAn Offsite Consequence Analysis (OCA) was conducted to determine the potential consequences of an accidental chemical release at the Boskovich Farms, Inc. site.  This included looking at two release scenarios and estimating the distance from the release to a toxic endpoint outside the Boskovich Farms, Inc. property.

The Sithe AAARP plant is not part of this Risk Management Plan as it is covered by Sithe Energies.  However, since there is a large ammonia receiver vessel for the AAARP plant located on Boskovich Farms, Inc. property, this vessel was considered for the Worst Case Scenario (WCS).  \r\n\r\nU.S. EPA's RMP*Comp software was used to screen Worst Case Scenarios for the four largest ammonia refrigeration systems on site.

A 12' x 15' dike has been built around this pressure vessel to contain a potential spill.  Assuming all liquid released from the vessel will pool in this dike, release rate is rather low and the Toxic End Point (TEP) distance is less than 0.3 mile.\r\n\r\nWest Freezer/Pressure Cooler:  The entire inventory of ammonia in this system could potentially be contained by the new recirculator vessel.  This vessel is located in an equipment room inside the West Freezer building.  Assuming an air-tight building, RMP*Comp adjusts the release rate to 10% of the rate in open air.  For this case the rate would be 172 lbs/min.  This results in a TEP distance of about 0.6 mile.\r\n\r\nFresh Cut:  While the volume of the system is listed as 8,500 lbs., the single largest vessel in the system which is in the engine room can hold about 6,500 lbs.  Assuming the engine room is air-tight,  flow will be 65 lbs/min and the TEP distance is less than 0.4 mile.\r\n\r\nIce Plant:  The ammonia inventory listed for each ice plant is a little more than the receiver can hold, but the entire inventory of 1,725 lbs was use to evaluate this scenario.  A release rate of 190 lbs/min results in a slightly longer TEP than for the West Freezer case, but still about 0.6 mile.\r\n\r\nThe Ice Plant release scenario was selected as the WCS for the Boskovich Farms, Inc. site.  Total ammonia release would be approximately 1,725 pounds from the liquid receiver vessel (2' dia. x 16' long, volume approximately 50 cu. ft.) on top of the ice machine, in open air.

A walkthrough review was conducted in accordance with Guidance for California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program Seismic Assessments (January 2004) by an experienced civil engineer who found that a current seismic assessment was not indicated due to a lack of change to any structural component in the ammonia process equipment.  \r\n\r\nThe main refrigeration system at Boskovich Farms, Inc. is housed in and around the Machinery Room at the south end of the buildings on the property.
