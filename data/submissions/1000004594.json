Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies:\n\nThe Cytec Industries Inc., facility in Langley, South Carolina contains a RMP covered process, which is an acrylic polymer emulsions manufacturing process.  \n\nIt is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local rules and regulations as well as our own environmental, health, and safety standards.  The Langley Plant manages the safety of our facility by designing for safe operation, operating and maintaining the plant safely and by auditing our operations. Our accident prevention program is based on OSHA\u00c2\u00bfs Process Safety Management regulation and our emergency response program is based on OSHA\u00c2\u00bfs HAZWOPER regulation.\n\nThe Langley Plant  is committed to continuous improvement in all aspects of safety and environmental performance.  Cytec is a member of the American Chemistry Council and subscribes to the Responsible Care Program.  The plant is RC14000 certified. The Langley facility is actively involved with local organizations concerned with the safety of our community and the environment such as the Aiken County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC), Aiken County HAZMAT and a Community Advisory Panel.\n\n2.  The facility and the regulated substances handled:\n\nThe Langley manufacturing facility is located at 403 Carline Road, Langley, South Carolina.  To produce acrylic polymer emulsions, acrylate monomers and acrylonitrile liquids are polymerized in reactors to form acrylic polymer emulsions.  The acrylic emulsion is a non-hazardous, water based liquid.  The product is then shipped by bulk trucks, totes and drums to industrial customers for the production of graphic arts ink additives, paper coatings and adhesives. \n \n3.  The general accidental release prevention program and specific prevention steps:\n\nOur accident prevention program is based on OSHA\u00c2\u00bfs Process Safety Management regul"

The Langley Plant manages the safety of our facility by designing for safe operation, operating and maintaining the plant safely and by auditing our operations.\n\nOur facility is designed for safe operation through the use of emergency shutdown systems and alarms, automatic water deluge systems, fail-safe valves, and dikes for the unlikely case of a potential leak.  Systems and equipment are designed  to engineering standards and codes. Safety reviews are conducted prior to all projects and changes.  \n\nOur plant is operated safely by trained and certified operators who follow well maintained standard operating procedures with defined safe operating limits.  Routine process safety meetings are held for all personnel. Investigations are conducted for all incidents.\n\nWe maintain operational safety through preventative maintenance and equipment inspection programs.  We hold contractors to the same high safety training standards as our employees.  We utilize task observations and accident prevention techniques on jobs.\n\nWe routinely audit our operations for compliance with federal, state, and local regulation.  We also have a comprehensive program to audit the plant\u00c2\u00bfs performance against corporate environmental and safety standards.\n\n4.  Five year accident history:\n\nThere have been no incidents at the facility that meet the EPA Risk Management Program reporting requirements.\n\n5.  The emergency response program:\n\nThe facility's emergency response program is based upon OSHA\u00c2\u00bfs HAZWOPER standard.  Employees are  trained to the 40-hour HAZWOPER level, in order to respond to their own emergencies, if necessary.   The employees receive annual refresher training in their role in the emergency plan.  Emergency response activities have also been coordinated with the Aiken County LEPC and Langley Volunteer Fire Departments for awareness on potential hazards and locations of materials at the site.   \n\n6.  Planned changes to improve safety:\n\nAlthough we have no current plans"
