Our management philosophy goals are achieved by the personal commitments of our employees and contractors, and by open communication with our employees, customers, and neighbors.  The accidental release prevention and emergency response programs we have at our facilities are part of the high standards we strive for.  Our high standards are achieved by operating in compliance with all required environmental permits and regulations, by operating and maintaining our assets in such a manner that any unpermitted release will be unintentional and acknowledged as unacceptable by remedying any shortcomings found during regular audits of our facilities, and by reporting promptly to regulators any shortcomings found during the course of our audits as required by law.\n\nThe ProMix Fractionator is owned by K/D/S ProMix, LLC, which is a partnereship owned by Dow Chemical and Enterprise Products Partners.  Enterprise Products Operating, LLC (Enterprise) id the operator of the plant.\n\nAt the facility, the plant receives natural gas liquids (NGL) as feedstock from natural gas processing facilities.  The incoming plant feed is fed directly into the plant by pipeline with any excess feed being diverted by pipeline to the underground storage caverns located nearby.  When the quantity of feed supply from the process gas plants is insufficient, supplemental feedstock from the underground storage caverns are returned back to the plant feed system (by pipeline) as feedstock.  This feedstock is treated (for removal of CO2) prior to entering the fractionation process.  This is"

The purity products are stored either in tanks or underground storage caverns (by pipeline).  These products are distributed to various customers via pipeline, barge or transport trucks.  The fractionated hydrocarbon products listed above are flammable substances regulated under the RMP.  The facility is classified as a Program Level 3 under the regulation.  The purpose of the RMP is to provide information about our operations, our programs to prevent accidental chemical releases, our emergency response plans in case of an accidental release, our five-year accident history and our planned changes to improve safety at the facility.\n\nWORST CASE AND ALTERNATE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\nWe have analyzed and performed the simulated \"Worst Case and Alternate Release Scenario\" for the flammable substances.  Details of these models are contained in the reporting of the RMP that is being filed with the EPA.  All distance calculations were based on the EPA's RMP*Comp (Version 1.07) and the EPA OCA methods, which are known to over predict the impact potential release from such scenarios.  Although we have numerous controls to prevent such releases and manage their consequences, no credit for any control or mitigation measures were taken into account when evaluating the alternative release scenario.\n\nWe have discussed these potential releases with our employees and with local emergency response officials in the Assumption Parish, thereby further reducing the possibility of any impact on the public.\n\nPREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe ProMix Fractionator has been operating under the Occupational Safety"

Our ongoing analysis of the potential hazards of our process, detailed training of our employees, and constant emphasis on safety have helped us avoid any serious accidents over the last five years.  Part of this program has also involved identifying and taking steps to avoid potential accidental chemical releases.  A few examples of the additional prevention features implemented at this facility include:\n\n* Hydrocarbon gas detectors throughout the process area, which will sound an alarm in the control room upon detection of elevated hydrocarbon concentrations.\n* Fire Water system consisting of fire extinguishers, fire monitors and firewater deluge system for fire fighting purposes.\n* Emergency Shutdown (ESD) systems have been installed and recently upgraded for the entire plant.  ESD pull switches are located at various locations within the facility in order to safely shutdown the facility during an actual emergency.  An electrical ESD has been added which shuts off the entire electrical supply to the facility.  \n* Burner management system has been installed in order to provide a safe air purge of furnaces during emergency shutdown of the heaters.\n* Continuous pilots on the flare in order to ensure uninterrupted combustion of vented hydrocarbon gases\n* Truck drivers entering the facility to load/unload are required to chock wheels and to attach grounding cables prior to loading/unloading.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nWe take a systematic, pro-active approach to preventing accidental releases of hazardous chemicals.
