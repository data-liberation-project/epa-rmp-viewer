These requirements are:\n\n\u00a7 one worst-case release scenario for a toxic substance in a Program 3 process (i.e., one scenario       representing anhydrous ammonia)\n\n\u00a7 one alternative release scenario for a toxic substance in a Program 3 process (i.e., anhydrous ammonia.)\n\nBoth of these scenarios are included in this RMPlan.\n\n1.4  Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical - Specific Prevention Steps\n\nSince its inception in 1970, Inland New Johnsonville has used a prevention program to help prevent accidental releases of hazardous substances.  Beginning in 1992, Inland formalized this prevention program for the anhydrous ammonia production processes and storage requirements in order to comply with the 12 elements of the OSHA process safety management (PSM) prevention program.  In 1996, the EPA RMP rule established additional prevention program requirements for potential offsite migration of hazardous chemicals included in the OSHA PSM program.  Inland is affected by EPA RMP rules as follows:\n\nProgram 3 - essentially the same as OSHA PSM, except that the program also focuses on protecting the public and the environment\n\nThe following sections briefly describe the elements of Inland's prevention programs that address the EPA RMP rule prevention program requirements.  These elements are an integral part of the OSHA PSM program which governs these on site prevention and emergency response elements.\n\n\n1.4.1  Program 3 Prevention Program\n\nThe Inland Program 3 prevention program applies to the mill processes and storage systems which involve anhydrous ammonia.  This program consists of the following 12 elements:\n\na.  Process Safety Information.

These documents address (1) physical properties of hazardous substances handled at Inland (MSDS), (2) operating parameters of the equipment at Inland, and (3) design basis and configuration of the equipment at Inland.  Inland ensures that this process safety information is available to all Inland employees, the local emergency planning committee (LEPC), local fire departments, and other emergency responders.\n\nb.  Process Hazard Analysis.  Inland performs and periodically updates process hazard analyses (PHAs) of the covered processes to help identify process hazards and generate recommendations that might improve the safe operation of the process.  A team composed of personnel with engineering and process operating experience and a leader with process hazard analysis experience is assembled to analyze the hazards of the process.  Inland primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) technique, supplemented with checklists, to perform this analysis.  The PHA team prepares a written report describing the results of the analysis, including a list of recommendations.  Responsibility to resolve the recommendations is assigned to unit personnel and, when appropriate, changes to enhance the safety of the process are implemented.\n\nc.  Operating Procedures.  Inland production operators and supervisors work together to develop and maintain operating procedures to define how tasks related to process operations should be safely performed.  The operating procedures (1) are used to train employees and (2) serve as reference guides for appropriate actions to take during both normal operations and process upsets.  Operating procedures include:\n\n\u00a7 steps for safely conducting activities\n\n\u00a7 applicable process safety information, such as safe operating limits and consequences of process deviations\n\n\u00a7 safety and health considerations, such as chemical hazards, personal protective equipment requirements, and actions to take if exposed to a hazardous substance \n\nInland personnel"

The operating procedures are used both to help in operating the Inland processes and as a training guide.\n\nd.  Training.  Inland trains workers to safely and effectively perform their assigned tasks. Inland training programs include both initial and refresher training that covers (1) a general overview of the process, (2) the properties and hazards of the substances in the process, and (3) a detailed review of the process operating procedures and safe work practices.  Inland has trained a HAZMAT response team to respond to any hazardous release at the Inland site. \n\nTraining requirements are reviewed annually to evaluate the effectiveness and frequency of the training.  Recommendations from the mill operating departments/maintenance are reviewed, and changes to the training program are implemented as appropriate.  Documentation of training is incorporated into each employee's personnel file data base. \n\ne.  Mechanical Integrity.  Inland maintains the mechanical integrity of process equipment to help prevent equipment failures that could endanger workers, the public, or the environment.  The Inland mechanical integrity program includes (1) a comprehensive predictive/preventive maintenance program designed to minimize equipment deterioration and damage and to schedule replacement of equipment prior to failure;  (2) a quality assurance program to help ensure that new and replacement equipment meet the design standards required for service in the Inland process.

Process changes that are determined to be a replacement in kind (e.g., replacing a valve with an identical valve) are allowed without completing a full management of change program.  All other changes must be confirmed through the full management of change program to help ensure that inadvertent consequences of process changes are prevented, safety consequences of changes are addressed, affected process safety information and procedures are updated, and affected employees are notified of and trained in the changes.  A specific written procedure with designated approval authority is utilized for this process.\n\ng.  Pre-startup Review.  Inland performs a safety review of a new or modified process before the process is placed into service to help ensure that the process has been prepared to operate safely.  This review confirms that:\n\n\u00a7 construction and equipment are in accordance with design specifications\n\n\u00a7 adequate safety, operating, maintenance, and emergency procedures are in place\n\n\u00a7 employee training has been completed\n\n\u00a7 for a covered process, a PHA has been performed if the process is new or management of change requirements have been completed if an existing process has been modified\n\nh.

Inland developed an employee participation program for covered processes to help ensure that the safety concerns of Inland employees are addressed.  Inland encourages active participation of personnel in the prevention program activities of all processes at the facility.  Employees are consulted on and informed about all aspects of the RMP rule prevention program, including PHAs and operating procedures.  All Inland employees have received HAZOP and PSM training.\n \nk.  Hot Work Permits.  Inland developed and implemented a hot work permit program to control spark- or flame- producing activities that could result in fires or explosions although there are no covered processes for these hazards at the Inland facility.  Inland created a Hot Work Permit Form to comply with these requirements.  Inland and contractor personnel who are to perform hot work are required to obtain a Hot Work Permit prior to initiation of work activity.  The Inland Technical Laboratory reviews proposed work, ensures that adequate safe guards are in place and issues the Hot Work Permit before work can begin.

Inland participates in Humphreys County LEPC activity and is active in a local industry committee which addresses community awareness issues such as the RMP.  \n\nInland's written emergency response program has been communicated to all emergency responders including the LEPC.  This document is a part of the Risk Management Program's RMPlan. \n\n1.7  Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nInland constantly strives to improve process safety through both the incident investigation program and a program soliciting safety suggestions from the workers (STOP).  The following changes to improve process safety are planned or have recently been completed.\n\n\u00a7 An audible ammonia alarm system with speakers located throughout the site is installed on site.  Process control operators have received training for actuation of the alarm system and all Inland personnel have received awareness training.  The alarm system is tested weekly.\n\n\u00a7 Training on root cause failure analysis techniques has been completed to assist in the evaluation of the failure of process system components and the development of proper repair methods and/or modifications to operating procedures.\n\n\u00a7 Operating and maintenance procedures are audited periodically for compliance.\n\nInland is firmly committed to the Continuous Improvement (CI) principles and techniques for all aspects of Inland's business including safety and environmental activities.

The offsite consequence analysis consists of evaluating both a worst-case release scenario and alternative release scenario. The main objective of performing the offsite consequence analysis is to determine the distance at which the public might be affected in a certain way because of an accidental release (called the endpoint distance).  The following effects could occur at the endpoint distance.  As distances from the source are increased, the potential effect from the hazard is reduced.\n\nWhen considering the release of a toxic substance, most people at the endpoint distance would be able to walk away from the exposure without any long-term health consequences, although some short-term consequences (e.g., strong eye or throat irritation) are likely.  Some people wh"

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nInland New Johnsonville (Inland) is committed to operating in a manner that is safe for Inland workers, the public, and the environment.  As part of this commitment, Inland has established a system to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility.  One component of this system is a risk management program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at Inland and that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) regulation 40 CFR part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule).  One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit a risk management plan (RMPlan) describing the risk management program at Inland.  This document is intended to satisfy the RMPlan requirement of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of the RMP at Inland New Johnsonville.\n\n1.1  Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n1.1.1  Accidental Release Prevention Policies\n\nInland is committed to the safety of workers and the public, and to the preservation of the environment, through the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances.  Inland implements reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous substances.  These controls include training programs for personnel; programs to help ensure safety in the design, installation, operations, and maintenance of processes, and programs to evaluate the hazards at Inland.  The basic elements of this program are included in the Inland Process Safety Management (PSM) plan. \n\n1.1.2  Emergency Response Policies\n\nIn the event of a significant accidental release of a hazardous substance, Inland controls and contains the release in a manner that will be safe for workers and will minimize the effect on the public and the environment.  Inland provides response training to Inland personnel, utilizes a comprehensive facility emergency evacuation"
