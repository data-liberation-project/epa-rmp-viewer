The location of this facility is separated by expansive open space which serves as a buffer zone in the event of an accidental release.\n\nThe primary purpose of the WWTP is to treat domestic and commercial sewage collected throughout the area to a level where the water may be re-introduced to the environment. Also, the solids removed from the waste stream are converted into a usable product for soil enhancement. Chlorine is used in this water treatment process as a disinfection agent in the final effluent. Sulfur Dioxide is introduced into the chlorinated water as a dis-chlorination agent, or to remove the chlorine so as not to be toxic to the environment as it is discharged into the receiving stream.\n\nThe WWTP will inventory chlorine between the amounts of 1,000 lbs to 3,000 lbs with no more than 2,000 lbs being placed in service at one time. The WWTP also will inventory Sulfur Dioxide between the amounts of 500 lbs to 2,500 lbs with no more than 2,000 lbs being in service at one time. Additionally, since the reduction in the chemical inventory we are under the threshold quantity limit for each chemical 11 days out of each month. The WWTP chemicals are delivered from Thatcher Chemical of Salt Lake City, Utah in 2,000 lb containers. These containers are clearly marked by color and label. The containers are of heavy wall type construction and all joints are welded. Cylinders are clearly numbered and weighed for tare weight. Fusable plugs are also installed to prevent bursting in the event of overheating of the cylinders.\n\nThe WWTP has adopted several operational/management procedures to minimize the possibilities of accidental release and to maximize the control of and response to an event of accidental release.

Chemical cylinders are only to be connected to the gas controlls which allow separation of cylinders while offering alternate cylinder use.\n3. Chemical cylinders are to be moved only with the equipment specifically designed and designated for this purpose.\n4.

A minimum of two (2) operators shall be actively involved in the connection and/or disconnection of chemical cylinders.\n7.Self Contained Breathing Apparatus will be maintained in ready condition at all times. In the event that a chemical release prevents access to the primary storage area of these SCBA's, two additional sites will be established in progressively more distant locations to ensure that access is available. All SCBA's will be maintained and tested in accordance with manufactures recommendation.\n8. Chlorination and Sulfonation equipment shall be inspected daily.\n9. In the event of an alarm or accidental release, no less than two (2) operators will respond to the emergency.\n10. Upon confirmation of an alarm and establishment of the nature of the emergency, Carbon County Dispatch and the LEPC will be notified. Emergency response personnel will be notified.\n\nThe Price River Water Improvement District Wastewater Treatment Plant has been using chlorine for disinfection since 1971 and sulfur dioxide since 1986.
