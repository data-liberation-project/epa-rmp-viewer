      "SummaryText": "The Princeton Wastewater Treatment Facility uses chlorine and sulphur dioxide in the treatment of domestic waste sewage. The plant personnel are trained in the safe handling of these chemicals and the emergency repair of the ton cylinders the chemicals are stored in. They are trained through local seminars, sponsored by the chemical suppliers, and on the job training. The plant personnel are trained in the use of SCBA, provided by the local fire department. We have procedures to follow for delivery and off loading of these chemicals from the delivery truck. Both chemicals are delivered in one ton cylinders. We inspect each cylinder for damage and corrosion. As the cylinder is lifted, we observe how the cylinder is balanced. If the cylinder appears to be heavier on one end than the other, the cylinder is declined. The imbalance is an indication of foreign material in the chemical and could cause operational problems for our feeding equipment. Magnetic signs are used to indicate the status of the cylinder accordingly : FEEDING, FULL, or EMPTY. Each time a cylinder is connected to our feed header, the connection is tested multiple times during the span of that day. The chemical feed area for these chemicals are equipped with two exhaust fans that operate automatically when the doors are opened. We have two SCBA wall mounted units, located outside the chemical room for emergency use. We also have a ton cylinder repair kit, located outside the chemical room, for emergency use. Our feed system is vacuum operated and if a leak occurs during anytime, a loss of vacuum will occur. This loss of vacuum permits the shutting of the feed system down at the cylinder. All feed systems are rebuilt by the manufacturer. We have had no accidental chemical release emergencies during the past five years. Should a worst case scenario occur, an accidental chemical release, plant personnel would contact the Princeton Fire Department for assistance. The Mercer County LEPC would be notified al"

Should anyone enter the area without disarming the alarm, the system would contact the local police department as well as plant personnel to inspect the equipment and/or operation. Our General Manager is a board member on the Mercer County LEPC. Procedures are evaluated as operational changes dictate. Equipment is performance tested each time a new chemical cylinder is connected."
