The policy is supported by many programs such as compliance with OSHAs 29 CFR 1910.119 Process Safety Management regulation which includes communication of risks and hazards to the employees and contractors, the development of an employee training, certification, and retraining program with written operating procedures. Since the facility is subject to 29 CFR 1910.119, it qualifies as a Program 3 facility under EPA's Risk Management Plan regulation 40 CFR 68.  The facility management also stresses the development and documentation of the process safety information, a management of change procedure, pre-startup safety reviews, employee participation in safety reviews and an equipment mechanical integrity inspection program for all major equipment items and piping systems as well as new equipment purchases. The facility operations personnel also issue hot work permits and safe work permits for maintenance activities within the operating units. The facility conducts safety inspection on the basis as noted:\n\n1. Work Areas - as needed\n\n2. Portable Fire Extinguishers - monthly\n\n3. Pressure vessels - as specified in API\n\n4. Extension cords, motorized hand tools - every three months\n\n5. Yards, parking lots, roofs, etc. - annually\n\nCompliance audits are conducted every three years as required by OSHA 29 CFR 1910.119\n\nregulation. In addition, incident investigations will be conducted immediately after any accidental release or incident occurs. The cause of the incident will be determined, and appropriate steps are taken to prevent recurrence of the event.  An emergency action plan is in place in the event of an accidental release of a flammable material.  The following resources can support for the plant in the event of a fire:\n\n1. Chalm"

This consists of a cryogenic gas processing plant located at the Chalmette Refinery, an eighty mile long 10\" pipeline from Chalmette to Geismar, and a fractionation plant in Geismar.  Energy Transfer Geismar Olefins LLC  Chalmette Cryogenic Gas Processing Plant receives Chalmette Refining's off gas in two streams.  The first is saturated off-gas and the second is unsaturated off-gas. These gas streams are processed through compression and low temperature separation to extract natural gas liquids. The natural gas liquids are then pumped into the transmission pipeline to be delivered to the Energy Transfer Geismar Olefins LLC fractionation plant in Geismar, LA. The Cryogenic Gas Processing Plant returns the residual gas and hydrogen to the Chalmette Refinery.  A 15,000-gallon product surge tank receives product prior to injection into the transmission pipeline.  Several regulated flammable substances are handled at the Chalmette facility.

The process units and storage tanks are inspected as necessary prior to the introduction of hydrocarbons into the facility.  Since the facility is an OSHA covered facility, the various skids have undergone Process Hazards Analysis (PHA). The PHAs and subsequent safety analyses included employee participation at the unit operator level.  The facility has a written policy of periodic mechanical integrity inspections, depending on the type of equipment. The safety relief valves that protect vessels, tanks and piping systems, are integral parts of this program.\n\n\n\nThe Five-Year Accident History\n\nThe Energy Transfer Geismar Olefins LLC Chalmette Gas Processing Plant has never had an accident involving the covered\n\nmixture that caused deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering\n\nin place. On October 29, 2017 at 9:45 pm an unauthorized discharge occurred at the Chalmette facility.   The unauthorized discharge dispersed into the atmosphere and offsite.  No adverse effects or emergency conditions such as road closures were required.  The pressure safety valve was designed to lift at 1100 psig lifted at 1035 psig (94% of set point).

The responsibilities for various functions during the emergency are clearly defined in the response plan. Gathering places (primary and secondary staging areas, as well as, one off-site staging area) for employees evacuated from the control room and plant area by the emergency conditions are also listed.  The action plan contains reporting procedures for employees when the fire is too large to be extinguished by a portable handheld fire extinguisher. The plan identifies steps to be taken in case of an accidental release including first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, and notification of local emergency response agencies. Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary based on their specific emergency duties. The emergency action plan is updated when necessary based on modifications made to the process or plant facilities.  The overall emergency action plan for the facility has been coordinated with the Chalmette Fire Department. This coordination includes meeting with the Fire Department personnel. The facility is manned 24 hours a day and has around-the-clock communications capability with the Fire Department. This interface provides the means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.
