This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as the design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the ammonia refrigeration system at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate control measures to prevent possible releases of Ammonia (anhydrous).  Unforeseeable, if such a release does occur; our highly trained employees are on hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  We are also completely coordinated with the Fairdale Fire Department, who provides our off-site emergency response services.\n\n\n\nThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled:\n\n\n\nWe have one regulated substance present at our facility.  That substance is Ammonia (anhydrous).  The maximum inventory of Ammonia (anhydrous) that is expected to be present in this facility, based on process/operational requirements, is 11,000 pounds.\n\n\n\nThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical Specific Prevention Steps:\n\n\n\nOur facility has taken the following steps as required by 40 CFR Part 68 of the Clean Air Act.  Our Ammonia (anhydrous) process is subject to the OSHA PSM Standard 29 CFR 1910.119.  Our facility is also subject to EPCRA Section 302 reporting requirements.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the accidental release prevention program that is in place at our facility.\n\n\n\n\n\n5-Year Accident History:\n\n\n\nWe have had one accidental release of Ammonia (anhydrous) at this facility during the past 5 years; t"

The emergency response plan also includes information on emergency health care.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:\n\n\n\nSeveral developments and findings have resulted from the implementation of the various elements of our accidental release prevention program.  We will continue our annual facility emergency notification, evacuation and accountability training and drills.  All visitors, vendors, contractors and employees sign or check in and out of our facility.  In addition, they all receive emergency notification, evacuation and accountability training, or are the responsibility of another Sysco employee when they enter the facility."
