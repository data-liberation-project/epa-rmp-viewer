Al-Corn Clean Fuel is committed to the protection of its employees, the greater community and the environment from hazardous substances used in the ethanol fuel production process, specifically the natural gasoline used as the ethanol denaturant and the anhydrous ammonia. The natural gasoline is added to the ethanol to make the ethanol unfit for human consumption.  Anhydrous ammonia is used to control pH in the ethanol production process.   It is the policy of Al-Corn Clean Fuel to comply with all applicable federal, state and local laws.  Al-Corn Clean Fuel has complied with the EPA requirements under 40 CFR Part 68. Process safety information and operations/maintenance procedures are documented on-site. Periodic functions such as process hazard analysis, training, change management and incident investigation are conducted on a regular basis. Audits of the overall RMP are conducted on a regular basis to assure compliance with EPA regulations.\n\nREGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\nThe facility produces fuel grade ethanol from corn and a process by-product known as dry distillers' grain with solubles, which is used as a livestock feed. The fuel ethanol production process requires use of a denaturant (natural gasoline) which is reported to contain 30 to 40 percent pentane, an RMP regulated substance. The maximum amount of natural gasoline on-site is estimated to be 120,000 pounds. The natural gasoline is stored in a tank as a liquid and is introduced to the fuel ethanol in the final stage of production. The denaturant tank is located in the facility's tank farm area which is designed with secondary containment structure to keep stored materials within the tank farm area.  Anhydrous ammonia is also stored on-site and used in the ethanol production process for pH control.  The maximum anhydrous am"

According to RMP*Comp\u00bf, a software tool developed by the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration was used to perform an off-site consequence analysis for the Al-Corn Clean Fuel facility. The worst case scenario defined by RMP Guidance is a failure of the natural gasoline storage tank resulting in a vapor cloud explosion. The software modeling program considered release of the entire contents of the denaturant tank, a wind speed of 3.4 miles per hour and an air temperature of 77 degrees F. The analysis projected a maximum off-site distance from the facility's center to a one pound per square inch overpressure is 0.4 miles. This was an overconservative approach in assuming the denaturant release was 100 percent pentane.  In actuality, pentane content in denaturant is only 30 to 40 percent.  \n\nThe worst-case scenario defined bythe same guidance and software as above for the anhydrous ammonia tank assumed a toxic gas cloud of 100,800 pounds (entire contents of the tank) released in 10 minutes.  A wind speed of 3.4 miles per hour and air temperature of 77 degrees F were also assumed for this release.  The maximum distance from the facility for this worst-case release is 4.7 miles.\n\nOFF-SITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS--ALTERNATIVE CASE SCENARIOS\nAlternative case scenarios are a more realistic approach to any potential accidental release at the facility due to the fact that mitigating equipment is taken into account.  The alternate case analysis also used RMP*Comp\u00bf.  This scenario considered failure of the largest natural gasoline tank containing approximately 55,000 pounds of pentane, with an one pound per square inch overpressure release for 10 minutes and a subsequent vapor cloud fire.

The resulting endpoint was at a distance of 0.1 miles from the facility.\n\nThe alternative case scenario was evaluated for a release of anhydrous ammonia as a toxic gas due to a 10 minute release from a 2 square inch puncture or removal of the largest pipe.  This scenario will affect a distance radius of 0.3 miles from the plant.  \n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nAl-Corn Clean Fuel has not had a natural gasoline accident causing death, injuries, environmental or property damage, evacuations or in-place sheltering in the last five years at the fuel production facility.\nThe facility began operation in April of 1996. On September 24, 1997 a valve was left partially open in the tank farm containment area and approximately 9,900 pounds (1,500 gallons) of denatured ethanol were released within the containment area. Free product was removed and subsequent soil sampling did not indicate significant contamination of soil. The valve was modified to prevent reoccurrence of the problem.  Also Al-Corn Clean Fuel has not had any anhydrous ammonia accidents in the past five years.  \n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\nIn the event of an emergency, it is the policy of Al-Corn Clean Fuel to notify the City of Claremont Fire Department and evacuate all employees from the facility."
