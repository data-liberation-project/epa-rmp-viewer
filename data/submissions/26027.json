FACILITY ACCIDENTIAL RELEASE AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICY.\n\n     THE MANAGEMENT AND EMPLOYEES OF TWIN COUNTY SERVICE COMPANY ARE COMMITTED TO THE\n     PREVENTION OF ANY ACCIDENTIAL RELEASES OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA.  IF AN ACCIDENTIAL \n     RELEASE SHOULD OCCUR, THE FACILITY IS PREPARED TO WORK WITH THE LOCAL FIRE DEPT.,\n     OR OTHER AUTHORITIES, TO MITIGATE ANY RELEASE AND MINIMIZE THE IMPACT OF THE RELEASE\n     TO PEOPLE AND THE ENVIRONMENT.\n\n2.

ANHYDROUS AMMONIA IS RECEIVED, STORED AND DISTRIBUTED FOR DIRECT APPLICATION AS A CROP PRODUCTION NUTRIENT.  THE STORAGE AND HANDLING SYSTEM CONSISTS OF 1 STORAGE TANK (30,000  GALLONS), LOADING RISERS, ASSOCIATED PLUMBING AND NURSE TANKS.  ACCESS TO THE SITE IS RESTRICTED TO AUTHORIZED FACILITY EMPLOYEES, AUTHORIZED MANAGEMENT PERSONNEL AND AUTHORIZED CONTRACTORS.\n\n     THE MAXIMUM QUANTITY OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA THAT CAN BE STORED WOULD BE \n     284,000 POUNDS. THIS INCLUDES ANHYDROUS AMMONIA THAT COULD BE STORED IN NURSE\n     TANKS.\n\n\n3.  THE WORSE-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO AND THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO.\n\n     THE WORSE-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO WOULD BE THE RELEASE OF THE TOTAL CONTENTS\n     OF A STORAGE TANK AS A GAS OVER 10 MINUTES.  THE MAXIMUN QUANTITY RELEASED WOULD\n     BE 140,000 POUNDS, WHICH REPRESENTS THE VOLUME OF THE LARGEST STORAGE TANK AS \n     LIMITED BY DESIGN STARDARDS.\n\n     THE DISTANCE TO THE ENDPOINT OF .14 MG/L FOR THE WORST-CASE SCENARIO IS 1.1 MILES.\n \n     THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO BASED ON THE MOST LIKELY  POTENTIAL INCIDENT IS A\n      RELEASE FROM A BREAK IN A TRANSFER HOSE.
