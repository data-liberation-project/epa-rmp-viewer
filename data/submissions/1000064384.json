One of the major chemical ingredients used in the PU foam manufacturing process is Toluene Diisocyanate (mixed isomers) (TDI), CAS #  26471-62-5. Our TDI inventory is maintained above 10,000 lbs.  In accordance with the provisions of 40 CFR Part 68 (Chemical Accident Prevention Regulations), the worst case scenario was defined as the rupture of, and the immediate spillage of, the contents of a TDI railcar into a concrete containment area.  The impact of this spill was evaluated using the ALOHA model and resulted in the area of concern being confined within the facility's property boundary with no public receptors being affected.  The release rate, calculated by the ALHOA model, was 0.0368 lbs./min.  \n\n\n\nThis facility has a trained spill response team, which will provide initial response to spills of 10 gallons or less within the confines of the building.  A contract is in place to call an outside emergency response team for spills larger than 10 gallons in size.\n\n\n\nIf required, the assistance of the Tupelo fire department Hazmat Team will be requested.  This facility's Emergency Response Plan has been coordinated with the LEPC, local fire department and the local fire department Hazmat Commander.  \n\n\n\nAll employees responsible for the handling and control of hazardous substances are provided initial and refresher training in proper procedures as required by the USEPA, OSHA and DOT regulatory requirements. \n\n\n\nThere have been no accidental releases involving TDI (mixed isomers) which require reporting in the five-year accident history per the requirements of 40 CF"
