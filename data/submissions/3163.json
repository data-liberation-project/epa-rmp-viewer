Anhydrous ammonia is utilized at this facility as a refrigerant to cool the building and freezers.  The properties of ammonia that make it valvable as a refrigerant, make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to our own personal health as well as our co-workers, and to reduce the threat to nearby members of the community.  It is Odom's policy to adhere to all applicable Federal , state and local regulations.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle ammmonia combined with the safety devices inherent in the design of this facility combined with safe handling procedures that we use as well as the safety training of our personnel.\n\nThe emergency response program includes provisions for evacuation of employees at the facility and notification of the Little Rock Local Emergency Response Committee (LERC), as well as provisions to provide notification to any potentially affected neighbors.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nOdom's Tennessee Pride Country Sausage, Inc. manufactures raw and cooked pork sausage products for commerical and private industries.  The regulated stationary source at this facility is the ammonia refrigeration system in which anhydrous ammonia is the regulated substance handled in quanities that exceeds EPA's threshold quanity for Anhydrous Ammonia.  The ammonia is used a a refrigerate at the facility to cool the building and to provide the refrigerant to the freezers.  The maximum amount of ammonia handled at any one time in the regulated process is 39,458 pounds.\n\nWORST-CASE AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nThe w"

      "SummaryText": "orst-case release scenario of ammonia would be the failure of the vessel containing 10,505 pounds of ammonia.  Company policy limits the storage quantity to 85% of the vessels capacity, therefore the total amount released would be 8,929.25 lbs.  It is assumed that the entire contents are released over a period of 10 minutes.  The distance to the toxic endpoint of 200 ppm (0.14mg/L) for the worst-case scenario is 1.6 miles.\n\nThe alternative release scenario identified was the sudden uncoupling of the transfer hose to the ammonia filling tank.  The release rate was calcuated as 1,018.40 lbs./min. using Bernoulli's equation.  It is assumed that the entire contents of the filling tank (3,623 lbs) is released over a period of 5 minutes. The distance to the toxic endpoint of 200 ppm (0.14 mg/L) for the alternative release scenario is .3 miles.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe accidental release prevention program is based on OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (29 CFR 1910.119).  Odom's complies with all the elements contained in the PSM program, which includes employee training, mechanical integrity of the ammonia refrigeration equipment, management of change procedures, operating procedures for safe operations, and regular audits of the PSM program to ensure compliance with the standard and to ensure safe operations of the system.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nNo reportable accidental releases of ammonia which resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known offsite deaths, injries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage has occurred at this facility.\n\nTHE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nOdom's has developed an emergency response plan (in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.38)  that includes provisions to evacuate its employees from the facility in the event of an uncontrolled accidental release of ammonia.  It is Odom's policy to contact the Little"

The Little Rock Office of Emergency Services will notify any affected neighors in the event an evacuation is neccessary.\n\nPLANNED CHANGE TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nOdom's Tennessee Pride Country Sausage, Inc. is continous in improving the safe operation of the ammonia refrigeration system by implementing preventative maintenance programs, inspection programs, and employee training in the safe operation of the system.  Periodic auditing of the Process Safety Management Program of the Ammonia Refrigeration System ensures that system changes/modifications are evaluated and any necessary safety precautions/improvements are made."
