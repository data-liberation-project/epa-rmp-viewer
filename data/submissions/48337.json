      "SummaryText": "RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN\nFt. Pierce, Florida\nExecutive Summary\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nAllied Universal Corporation's accidental release risk management plan involves a unified approach that integrates technologies, procedures, and maintenance and management practices.  The elements of the plan are intended to prevent and minimize the accidental releases of extremely hazardous substances (chlorine and sulfur dioxide) used on site.  The Allied facility emergency response program involves the preparation of response plans that are tailored to the facility and the emergency response services available in the community.  Allied's emergency response program is in compliance with the EPA and OSHA Emergency Response Program requirements and is modeled after the \"One Plan\".\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE FACILITY AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nAllied Universal Corporation repackages chlorine and sulfur dioxide into 150-pound cylinders and one ton containers.  In addition, chlorine is utilized by Allied to manufacturer 10.5%-15% (by weight) sodium hypochlorite, and sulfur dioxide is utilized to manufacturer 40% (by weight) sodium bisulfite.  The facility includes a sidetrack for unloading 90-ton chlorine and sulfur dioxide railcars. A production building is used for packaging the cylinders and ton containers and for sodium hypochlorite and sodium bisulfite production.  All instrument controls for the chlorine and sulfur dioxide railcar unloading, cylinder and ton container packaging and sodium bisulfite production are located in the packaging building. The instrument controls for sodium hypochlorite manufacturing is located in the sodium hypochlorite manufacturing area.  The facility is staffed during all hours of operations.\n\nBased upon the program criteria as set forth in the Risk Management Rule, including EPA's definition of a \"covered process\", the chlorine and sulfur dioxide processes at this facility are subject to Program 3 planning.\n\nWORS"

      "SummaryText": "T-CASE AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nAn offsite consequence analysis was conducted that included consideration of two chlorine and one sulfur dioxide release scenarios, identified as \"worst-case release\" and/or \"alternative scenario\".  The worst-case scenario is defined by EPA, which states that the \"owner shall assume that the maximum quantity in the largest vessel is released as a gas over 10 minutes,\" due to an unspecified failure.  Because the probability of such a release occurring is very remote, an alternative scenario, defined as \"more likely to occur than the worst-case release scenario\", was also analyzed.\n\nAtmospheric dispersion modeling was performed to determine the distance traveled by the chlorine and sulfur dioxide releases before its concentration decreases to the \"toxic endpoint\" selected by EPA.  The American Industrial Hygiene Association defines toxic endpoint as the \"maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects or symptoms which could impair an individual's ability to take protective action\".  \n\nThe worst-case release scenario at Allied's Ft. Pierce facility involves the failure of a 90-ton railcar of sulfur dioxide. Although Allied utilizes numerous administrative controls and active mitigation systems to minimize the consequences of such a release, no credit was taken for any mitigating factors in calculating the extent of the release.  This is in accordance to the EPA Risk Management Program worst-case scenario requirements (40 CFR ?68.25).   \n\nThe alternative release scenario for sulfur dioxide and chlorine involves the rupture of the flexible connections connected to the either railcar, possibly due to human error, overpressurization or split or uncoupling due to equipment failure.   \n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe Allied acciden"

      "SummaryText": "tal release prevention program is based on the following key elements:\n\n? Compliance with OSHA's Process Safety Management rule (29CFR ?1910.119) and EPA's Risk Management Plan (40 CFR ?68),\n? Implementation of the National Association of Chemical Distributors Responsible Distribution Process Code (third-party Management Systems Verification in April 2001),\n? Operator Function Specific and Emergency Response Training,\n? Mechanical Integrity Program,\n? Use of Chlorine Institute, Compressed Gas Association and other industry  recommended equipment,\n? Use of effective operating procedures, written with the participation of the operators, facility managers and corporate managers,\n? Performance of a process hazard analysis,\n? Implementation of an internal and external auditing and inspection program.\n\nOperator specific safety steps include availability of self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA), worn by emergency response personnel during chemical emergencies to stop releases immediately.  The operators wear escape respirators and eye protection during connection/disconnection of the sulfur dioxide and chlorine supply and movement of the cylinders and one-ton containers.  Employees are trained on the hazards and toxic properties of chlorine and sulfur dioxide, presence of the gas detectors, equipment design and specifications and proper and safe handling procedures.\n\nAUDITS\n\nThis facility has undergone an internal RMP and PSM audit in 2006, and an external State of Florida Department of Community Affairs RMP audit in March of 2001.\n\n FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nNone.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe facility has an emergency response plan, which has been reviewed and updated in May 2007.  The plan includes the following elements: \n\n? description of chlorine and sulfur dioxide properties,\n? recommended first aid for chlorine and sulfur dioxide exposures,\n? a list of all emergency equipment onsite and where such equipment is located, \n? list of onsite and offsite emergen"
