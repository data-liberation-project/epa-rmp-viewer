The facility uses a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of its employees and the public, as well as protection of the environment.  EDCC maintains an open dialogue with local emergency responders and has provided them with a copy of its Emergency Response Plan, detailing important facility-specific information.  This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that have been designed and implemented, including the following:\n\nA?    A description of our facility and use of substances exceeding threshold           \n        quantities, in a single process, which are regulated by the EPAA?s RMP Rule;\nA?    A summary of the potential off-site consequences from possible accidental chemical \n        releases;\nA?    An overview of accidental release prevention programs;\nA?

The facility keeps a maximum quantity of approximately 6,000 lbs of 15% bromine chloride on site.  The threshold quantity for bromine is 10,000 lbs.\nAs this RMP will illustrate, accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning efforts enable the facility to effectively manage any potential hazards posed by these substances.\n&#8195;\n3.2  Accidental Release Prevention and Response Policies\n\nEDCC maintains a number of programs to help prevent accidental releases and ensure safe operation.  Also, EDCC parallels the RMP Rule by complying with Process Safety Management (PSM) as required by OSHA in 29 CFR 1910 119.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program in place at the facility.\n\n    3.2.1  Process Safety Information\n\nEDCC maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters, and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\n    3.2.2  Process Hazard Analysis\n\n    The facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses is the A?HAZOPA? and/or the A?what ifA? checklist.  These analyses are conducted by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering a"

Findings related to the process hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\n    3.2.3  Operating Procedures\n\n    For the purpose of safely conducting activities within covered processes, EDCC maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown, and startup after a turn-around.  Operating procedures are regularly reviewed and are readily accessible to operators involved in the process.  In addition, Daily/Shift Safe Work Permits (Procedure No. S-82) are required for any maintenance work completed at EDCC.\n\n    3.2.4  Training\n\n    EDCC has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Refresher training is provided continuously for operator certification.\n\n    3.2.5  Mechanical Integrity\n\n    EDCC carries out documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes:\n\nA?    pressure vessels, \nA?    storage tanks, \nA?    piping systems, \nA?    relief and vent systems,\nA?    emergency shutdown systems,\nA?    controls, and \nA?    pumps.  \n\nTrained maintenance personnel and the facilityA?s mechanical integrity engineer conduct the process maintenance activities.

Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of the safety performance of the contractor is carried out.  The facility has a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related to their work and the processes.  A Daily/Shift Safe Work Permit is issued prior to beginning work.  Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response, should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.\n\n3.3  Chemical Specific Release Prevention Steps\n\n    EDCC has instituted the following measures to prevent accidental releases from the following regulated substances used or produced at the facility:\n&#8195;\n    3.3.1  Nitric Acid and Ammonia\n\nSeveral process controls are in place to prevent and/or mitigate accidental releases of nitric acid or ammonia.  These controls include vents, relief valves, check valves, manual and automatic shut-offs, interlocks, alarms, keyed bypass system, emergency back-up power, back-up pumps, rupture disks, excess flow devices, and quench systems.  Passive mitigation includes earthen dikes that route spills to neutralization and the wastewater treatment system, a deluge system, water curtains, and enclosures.  pH probes and alarms are located throughout the plantA?s storm water system to alert staff of accidental spills or releases.\n    \n    3.3.2  Oleum\n\n    Process controls are in place to prevent and/or mitigate accidental release of oleum to the environment.  The tank is installed with a vacuum breaker, sumps that pump lost solution back to the process and a scrubber with an induced draft blower to collect all vents and remove any vaporized sulfur trioxide by dissolving it in water to form sulfuric acid.  The sulfuric acid is returned to the process.  A concrete di"
