This\ncommitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training of\npersonnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our\nprocesses.  Our standing practice is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable\nreleases of regulated flammable substances.  However, if a release does occur, trained gas plant\npersonnel will take appropriate action to control/mitigate the release.\n\nA DESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe Trinidad gas plant, located in Trinidad, Texas, operates a variety of processes to recover\npetroleum products (e.g., natural gas, propane, butane, condensate) from field gas.  The gas plant\nalso recovers the regulated flammables, pentane and ethane.  There are no threshold quantities of\ntoxic substances present.\n\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS RESULTS\n\nThe worst-case scenario (WCS) associated with a release of flammable substances in the\nProgram 3 process at the gas plant is a vapor cloud explosion (VCE) involving the full inventory\nof the storage tank containing 94,000 lb of natural gas liquids (NGL).  The maximum tank\ncapacity is assumed to release and ignite.  The maximum distance to the 1-psi endpoint for this\nWCS is 0.4 mile.  Although we have a number of controls to prevent such releases, no credit for\nmitigation measures were taken into account in evaluating this WCS.\n\nThe alternative release scenario (ARS) for flammable substances at the gas plant is a vapor cloud\nfire (VCF) involving the storage tank containing 94,000 lb of NGL.  The maximum distance to\nthe 1-psi endpoint for this ARS is 0.1 mile.  No credit for mitigation measures were taken into\naccount in evaluating this ARS.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the p"

Examples of employee participation range from updating\nand compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a\nprocess hazard analysis (PHA) team.  Employees have access to all information created as part of\nthe gas plant accident prevention program.  Specific ways that employees can be involved in the\naccident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is\nmaintained at the gas plant and addresses each accident prevention program element.  In\naddition, the gas plant has a number of initiatives in place that address process safety and\nemployee safety issues.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nThe Trinidad gas plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe\noperation of the processes.  These documents address chemical properties and associated\nhazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment\ndesign basis/configuration information.  Specific departments within the gas plant are assigned\nresponsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.

For specific process areas, the gas\nplant has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature,\nlevel, composition).  The gas plant ensures that the process is maintained within these limits\nusing process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective\ninstrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\n\nThe gas plant also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the\ndesign and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of\nconstruction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment.  This\ninformation provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as\nevaluating proposed changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\nThe Trinidad gas plant has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with\nthe various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is\nsystematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to\nmanage these hazards.\n\nThe gas plant primarily uses the What If analysis technique to perform these evaluations.

The final resolution of each finding is documented\nand retained.\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate\nsignificantly from the original design safety features, the plant periodically updates and\nrevalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every five\nyears and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.  The results\nand findings from these updates are documented and retained.  Once again, the team findings are\nforwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings is\ndocumented and retained.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nThe Trinidad gas plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process\noperations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4)\nemergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process.  These\nprocedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent\ntraining of new operators.

Both hourly and staff personnel may participate as audit team members. \nThe audit team findings are forwarded to plant management for resolution.  Corrective actions\ntaken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until completion.  The final resolution\nof each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are retained.\n\nCHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe processes at the Trinidad gas plant have hazards that must be managed to ensure continued\nsafe operation.  The following is a description of existing safety features applicable to prevention\nof accidental releases of regulated substances in the facility.\n\nUniversal Prevention Activities\n\nThe accident prevention program summarized above is applied to all RMP covered processes at\nthe Trinidad gas plant.

      "SummaryText": ", these prevention program activities help prevent potential\naccidents that could be caused by equipment failures and human errors.\n\nSpecialized Safety Features\n\nThe Trinidad gas plant has safety features to help (1) contain/control a release, (2) quickly detect\na release, and (3) reduce the consequences of (mitigate) a release.  The following types of safety\nfeatures are used in the covered processes:\n\nRelease Detection\n\n? Hydrocarbon detectors with alarms\n\nRelease Containment/Control\n\n? Process relief valves that discharge to a vent stack\n? Valves to permit isolation of the process (manual or automated)\n? Automated shutdown systems for specific process parameters (e.g., high temperature)\n? Curbing or diking to contain liquid releases\n? Redundant equipment and instrumentation (e.g., uninterruptible power supply for process\ncontrol system, backup pumps)\n? Atmospheric relief devices\n\nRelease Mitigation\n\n? Fire extinguishers\n? Trained personnel\n? Personal protective equipment\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe Trinidad gas plant has an excellent record of accident prevention over the past five years. \nThere have been no releases of regulated substances that resulted in deaths, injuries, property or\nenvironmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place.  Also, there has been a decreasing\ntrend in the frequency of incidental releases.\n\nEMERGENCY ACTION PLAN INFORMATION\n\nThe Trinidad gas plant maintains a written emergency action plan, which is in place to protect\nthe safety of workers and the public, as well as the environment.  There are no 112(r) threshold\ntoxic substances on the plant site.  For a non-incidental release of a flammable substance,\nincluding the possibility of a fire, response actions have been coordinated with the local fire\ndepartment, and mechanisms for notification are in place.  Employees receive training as\nnecessary to perform their specific emergency actions.  The emergency action plan is updated\nwhen necessary, and affected personnel are info"
