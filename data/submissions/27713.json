Facility Policy.\n\n     The owners, management and employees of Cooperative Agricultural Services, Inc. are committed to\n      the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should\n      occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, Thomas County Fire Department, and/or other authorities, to mitigate and minimize the impacts of the release to the people and the environment.\n\n2.  Facility Information.\n\n     The primary activity at the facility is the storage fertilizers of fertilizers for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous\n     ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application AS A NUTRIENT for crop production.\n     The maximum quantity stored would be 322,000 pounds in storage tanks and nurse tanks.\n\n3.  Worst-Case Scenario and Altermate Release Scenario\n\n     a.  The worst-case scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released as\n          gas over a period of 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 132,000 pounds, which\n          represents the volume of the LARGEST storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design\n          standards and administrative controls.  The distance to the end point (point of dispersion to 200\n          parts per million, or ppm) is 1.16 miles.\n\n     b.  The alternate release scenario, a 3-inch transfer hose is used as an altermate release scenario\n          fallowed by release of ammonia for 2 minutes before an automatic excess flow shut-down\n          valve intervenes or remote manual shut-off is closed and stops the flow of ammonia.  The \n          maximum quantity release would be 28,000 pounds.  The distance to the end point (point of \n          dispersion to 200 ppm) is .85 miles.\n\n4.

Five-Year Accident History.\n\n     There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that have\n     caused any deaths, injuries or significant property damage at the facility; nor to our knowledge,\n     has THERE BEEN ANY ACCIDENTAL RELEASES resulting in off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations,\n     property damage or environmental damage. \n            \n6.

Provided state and local authorities with the emergency planning and community right-to know\n          information as required under SARA Title lll (EPCRA).\n\n     c.
