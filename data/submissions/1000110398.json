      "SummaryText": "Description of stationary source and regulated substances handled:\nThe Lisburne Production Center (LPC) is located in the East Operating Area (EOA) of Prudhoe Bay. LPC processes crude oil production fluids received from various crude oil accumulations (collectively known as the Greater Pt. McIntyre area or GPMA) located on the North Slope of Alaska, including (but not limited to) Lisburne, Point McIntyre, Niakuk, West Beach State, and North Prudhoe Bay State. Production fluids consist mainly of crude oil, hydrocarbon gas, and water.\nCrude oil is processed to remove hydrocarbon gas and water in order to meet specific crude oil sales specifications. Sales oil then enters the Trans-Alaska Pipeline. Hydrocarbon gas is dehydrated, stripped of butane and heavier hydrocarbons that may be present, and compressed for re-injection into the reservoirs or used as fuel. Water is processed to remove entrained crude oil before injection into disposal or injector wells.\n\nLPC contains a propane refrigeration system as well as a NGL/MI processing system. The NGLs and MI consist of a mixture containing Methane, Ethane, Propane, Butane, Iso-Butane, Pentane, and Iso-Pentane. All other hydrocarbons at LPC are considered naturally occuring hydrocarbons mixtures and are not subject to 40 CFR \u00a768.3.\n\nDry Gas Refrigeration System:\nLPC utilizes propane in a dry gas refrigeration system. Liquid propane is generally prepared on site at LPC and added to the surge drum as needed. The propane refrigeration system is a closed circulating loop. Therefore assuming high liquid level in all vessels simultaneously was not considered credible. To be conservative the total propane quantify is based off of high liquid level in the Surge Drum and normal operating levels in all other equipment as follows:\n-\tThe propane accumulator/surge drum 42-1242 provides liquid propane storage. The surge drum has a maximum liquid volume of approximately 10,500 gallons @ 4.2 lbs/gal = 44,000 lbs.\n-\tThe interstage flash dr"
