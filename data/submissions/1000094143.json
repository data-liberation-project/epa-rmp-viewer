              "Description": "GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM STEPS:\n\nThe following is a summary of the general accidental prevention program in place at Seadrift Coke L.P.. Since all the processes subject to the EPA RMP regulation are subject to the OSHA PSM standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\n\n\nEMPLOYEES PARTICIPATION:\n\nIt is the policy of Seadrift Coke L.P. to encourage and provide opportunities for all employees to participate in all aspects of our safety program consistent with the standards of the OSHA?s Voluntary Protection Program.  Opportunities for participation range from updating and compilation of technical documents, participating as members of various teams addressing Accident Incident Reviews (AIR), Process Hazard Analysis (PHA), Management Of Change (MOC), and the employee-led Site Safety Committee. These teams typically consists of employees from various areas of the plant, including production, maintenance, safety, and plant management. While participation is voluntary, to provide the broadest possible involvement team membership may be required as a condition of employment. All information gathered and developed, as part of the accident prevention program is readily available to all employees. The employee participation policy is maintained and accessible to all employees on the plant computer. \n\n\n\nPROCESS SAFETY INFORMATION:\n\nSeadrift Coke L.P. maintains technical documents that are used in maintaining a safe operation. These documents address key process parameters, equipment design basis/configuration, chemical properties and associated hazards. Processes are maintained within limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instruments systems (e.g. automated shutdowns systems). Chemical-specific information, including emergency response/exposure treatment considerations is provided in Safety Data Sheets (SDS), which are available throughout the plant and on plant computers. Technical documents on design and construction of process equipment provide information about materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating, etc. This information is used as a basis for inspection and maintenance activities, and to evaluate proposed process and facility changes to ensure that process safety features are not compromised.\n\n\n\nPROCESS HAZARD ANALYSIS:\n\nSeadrift Coke L.P. is committed to an organized and systematic effort to identify and analyze potential hazards associated with the processing and handling of materials. All covered processes are evaluated and prioritized based on the extent of the hazards, age and history of the process, location (facility siting), consequences of failure of controls, human factors and potential impact of accidents. Seadrift Coke L.P. uses the HAZOP technique for revalidations and major projects (and checklists for low risk projects) to identify and evaluate hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures. Analyses are conducted using a team of employees and managers who have operating, maintenance, and engineering experience and expertise. PHA team findings and recommendations are presented to our plant leadership team for acceptance and resolution. The final resolution of each finding is documented, retained and communicated to all affected employees. Approved mitigation options are tracked until completion. Each analysis is revalidated at least every five years.                                                                                                                                                                                   \n\n\n\nOPERATING PROCEDURES:\n\nSeadrift Coke L.P. maintains written procedures which address various operating modes such as (1) initial startup, (2) normal operations, (3) normal shutdown, (4) temporary operations, (5) emergency operations, (6) emergency shutdown and (7) startups following turnaround or emergency shutdown.  The procedures emphasize operating limits and consequences of deviations. Operating procedures are reviewed annually and updated as needed to ensure safety and consistency with actual practice.\n\n\n\nSAFE WORKING PRACTICES:\n\nSeadrift Coke L.P. has written operating procedures to ensure worker and process safety. Procedures cover such specific tasks as: (1) lockout/tagout to isolate energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (2) confined space entry to ensure adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space, (3) control of entry into an area, (4) hot work permit to control spark-producing activities, (5) opening of process equipment to control safe removal of hazardous materials before process piping or equipment is opened. The procedures along with the training of affected personnel provide a system for ensuring that operation and maintenance activities are performed safely.\n\n\n\nTRAINING:\n\nIt is the policy of Seadrift Coke L.P. that all employees receive adequate training and demonstrated proficiency before being assigned to a task. Training is effected through the use of written task analyses and standard operating procedures, audio/visual aids, hands-on training through pairing with senior operators for process-specific duties and tasks. Proficiency is verified through job observations, oral and written examinations before operators can work independently. Upgrade or refresher training is provided to ensure that employees? knowledge and awareness of hazards, proper methods and procedures remain at an acceptable level. All affected employees receive refresher on mandated training no longer than every three years.\n\n\n\nCONTRACTORS:\n\nSeadrift Coke L.P. is committed to a program of selection, training, and monitoring of temporary and contract employees that will ensure the safe and efficient completion of their work. All contractors must go through an approval process with a third party prequalification company before a contract is awarded. All contractors are informed of known fire, explosion and toxic release hazards.  Seadrift Coke L.P. personnel periodically evaluate contractors and contract employees to ensure they are trained in safe work practices, properly informed of all known hazards and emergency procedures, and to ensure that Seadrift Coke L.P. is advised of any unique hazards their work may present.\n\n\n\nPRE-STARTUP AND SAFETY REVIEWS (PSSRs):\n\nSeadrift Coke L.P. conducts pre-startup safety review for all changes to equipment, materials, and operating parameters. PSSR is to ensure that safety feature; procedures, personnel, and the equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing equipment into service. Checklist and other methods are used for field verification of the proper implementation of all aspects of accident prevention program such as training, communication, drawing reviews, design and construction specifications.\n\n\n\nMECHANICAL INTEGRITY:\n\nSeadrift Coke L.P. has developed practices and procedures for identifying and categorizing process equipment and instrumentation to ensure the safe operation of pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdowns systems. The mechanical integrity program involves personnel training, developing written maintenance procedures, inspecting and testing process equipment, and correcting identified deficiencies.\n\nMaintenance personnel receive training on (1) process overview, (2) safety and health hazards, (3) applicable maintenance procedures, (4) emergency response procedures, and (5) applicable safe work practices to ensure that they perform their job safely. Inspections and tests are conducted at least as often as recommended by the manufacturer or in accordance with good engineering practices. When possible, identified deficiencies are corrected before placing equipment back in service or an MOC team is assigned to review the use of the equipment and determine actions needed to ensure continued safe operation of the equipment. The mechanical integrity program is evaluated periodically for compliance with company policy. \n\n\n\nMANAGEMENT OF CHANGE:\n\nIt is the policy of Seadrift Coke L.P. that all changes to equipment, materials, chemistry, operating parameters or other aspects of a covered process be subjected to a formal management of change program. This requires that changes be thoroughly reviewed and documented, that all affected personnel be informed, trained and certified if needed, and that all plant drawings, operating procedures, emergency procedures and records be updated and kept current. A team of employees from maintenance, production, and Safety departments evaluates proposed changes. The team determines the impact of planned changes on process hazard, material specification, safety, operating, maintenance and emergency procedures, and required training for affected employees.\n\n\n\nINCIDENT INVESTIGATION:\n\nSeadrift Coke L.P. investigates all accidents, incidents, and near misses.  From these investigations remedial actions are developed.  The Site Leadership Team reviews the remedial actions and the approved list of remedial actions is entered into a computer-based remedial action tracking system.  All approved remedial actions are followed up to completion, before the Accident/Incident Report is closed.   These incident reports are kept on file in the computer for at least 5 years.  The reports are available to all employees on the computer.\n\n\n\nCOMPLIANCE AUDITS:\n\nAs a PSM facility, the site conducts the required comprehensive compliance audits once every three years.
