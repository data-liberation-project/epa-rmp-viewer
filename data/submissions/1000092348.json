(ORM)\n\nGarden Creek Complex\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\n\n1.0    ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICIES\n\n\n\nThe Garden Creek Complex (Facility) has a commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of said processes and equipment. Our policy is to implement reasonable engineering and administrative controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated flammable substances. However, if a release does occur, facility personnel are trained to respond and control small releases. ONEOK Rockies Midstream (ORM) believes in maintaining a safe working environment for all employees. Our equipment and personnel reflect this belief, and our prime objective is to ensure the personal safety of every employee on the job-site and to safe guard company property through preventative measures. Employees of ORM are expected to be familiar with all company safety policies. Through continuing education, in-house training and management support, we will provide a safe and professional working environment for our employees as well as those whose lives and safety have been entrusted to us.\n\n\n\n2.0    DESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n\n\nThe Garden Creek Complex, located near Watford City, North Dakota, uses mechanical refrigeration, cryogenic extraction and fractionation to process wellhead gas into marketable natural gas and natural gas liquids (NGL). As a result of this operation, several EPA regulated flammable substances are processed, recovered, and stored at the facility (e.g., methane, ethane, propane, butane, pentane, gas condensate). There are three 60,200 gal (192,228 lbs), twelve 48,300 gal (181,494 lbs), fifteen 19,100 gal (68,114 lbs.), and twelve 33,500 gal (162,610 lbs) flammable mixture storage tanks.  The Facility does not use or store any "

The following is a description of existing safety features applicable to prevention of accidental releases of regulated substances in the facility.\n\n\n\n4.1    Universal Prevention Activities\n\nThe accidental release prevention program summarized previously is applied to all RMP-covered processes at the Garden Creek Complex. Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human errors.\n\n\n\n4.2    Specialized Safety Features\n\nThe Garden Creek Complex has safety features on many units to help (1) contain/control a release, (2) quickly detect a release, and (3) reduce the consequences of (mitigate) a release. The following types of safety features are used in the covered processes:\n\n    Release Detection\n\n    Daily operator inspection\n\n    Monthly valve, seal, and flange inspections\n\n    Release Containment/Control\n\n    Process relief valves that prevent vessel over pressurization\n\n    Valves to permit isolation of the process (manual or automated)\n\n    Automated shutdown systems for specific process parameters (e.g., high temperature)\n\n    Curbing or diking to contain liquid releases\n\n    Redundant equipment and instrumentation (e.g., emergency power supply, backup pumps, etc.)\n\n    Release Mitigation\n\n    Personal protective equipment (e.g., hard hat, safety glasses, protective clothing, FR clothing, etc.)\n\n\n\n5.0    FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nThe Garden Creek Complex experienced no reportable accidents in the las"

Releases that did occur at the facility involving a regulated substance were quickly contained and resulted in no deaths, injuries, significant property damage, evacuations, or shelter in place.\n\n\n\n6.0    EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\n\n\n\nThe Garden Creek Complex maintains a written emergency response plan, which is in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment. The plan consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released. The procedures address or reference all aspects of emergency response, including proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post incident cleanup and decontamination requirements.\n\n\n\nIn addition, the facility has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response. Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties, and participate in annual facility emergency drills to ensure emergency shutdown system (ESD) integrity and reinforce proper employee response.  The emergency response plan is updated when necessary based on modifications made to the facility process or other ONEOK Rockies Midstream facilities. The emergency response program changes are administered through the MOC process, which includes informing and/or training affected personnel in the changes. The overall emergency response plan for the Garden Creek Complex is coordinated with the McKenzie County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) which is responsible for preparing the community's emergency response plan.  The local responders for facility emergencies are the Watford City, ND Volunteer Fire Department and the McKenzie County Sheriff's Department. The Garde"
