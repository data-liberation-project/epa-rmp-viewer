These caverns, or wells, have a capacity of approximately two million barrels and contain brine as well as butane.\n\nWhen butane is pumped into a cavern, the brine is displaced and stored in brine pits.  When butane is transported to Port Arthur Refinery from the Sour Lake Storage Facility, brine is pumped from the pits into the cavern to displace the butane.\n\nThe Sour Lake caverns contain flammable hydrocarbons above the EPA RMP threshold quantity.  \n\n3.0  HAZARD ASSESSMENT RESULTS\n\nWorst Case Scenario and Alternate Release Scenario for RMP covered substances were evaluated and included in the report.\n\n\n4.0  GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM STEPS\n\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at Port Arthur Refinery.

Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team or incident investigation team.  Employees have access to all information created as part of the Refinery accident prevention program.\n\nIn addition, Port Arthur Refinery incorporates employee participation in The HSSE Steering Committee, The PSM Oversight Committee, The Joint Health & Safety Committee, Weekly Safety Meetings, Unit Team Meetings, Task Teams, The Safety Promotions Committee, The Emergency Response Team, Process Safety Initiatives work processes, daily operations meetings, and The Contractor Safety Committee.\n\n4.2  Process Safety Information\n\nPort Arthur Refinery maintains a variety of technical documents that help maintain safe operation of the Sour Lake Storage Facility.  These documents address the hazards of the chemicals in the processes, the technology of the processes, and the equipment used in the processes.  Standard Procedure Gen0030- Process Safety Information Required for PSM Compliance, outlines the Port Arthur Refinery procedure for developing, updating, and compiling process safety information.\n\nEmployees and contractors are informed of the location of process safety information that is relevant to their work.\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs).

Port Arthur Refinery also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the processes are not compromised.\n\n4.3  Process Hazard Analysis\n\nPort Arthur Refinery has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify reasonably foreseeable hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these potential hazards.\n\nPort Arthur Refinery uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating experience as well as engineering expertise.   This team identifies and evaluates potential hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\nThe PHA team's findings are entered into a computer database (ORBIT) and assigned to appropriate departments for resolution.\n\nImplementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options being implemented in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\nTo help ensur"

These periodic reviews are conducted at least every five years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.  Once again, the team findings are entered into a computer database and assigned to appropriate departments for resolution.  Final resolution of the findings is also documented in the database.\n\n4.4  Operating Procedures\n\nPort Arthur Refinery maintains Standard Procedure H-11, Operating Procedures and Operator Training, that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process.  These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.  The procedures are maintained current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.  Operating procedures are readily available to operators and for other personnel as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\nUpper and lower operating limits, consequences of deviation, and steps required to correct or avoid deviation from critical parameters, such as pressure, temperature, level, etc, are included in operating procedures.\n\nIn addition to Operating Procedures, Port Arthur Refinery has long-standing safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety.  Examples of these include (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sourc"

These procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\n\n4.5  Training\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, Port Arthur Refinery has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  New employees receive basic training in refinery operations if they are not already familiar with such operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator receives on the job training to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.\n\nSkills are maintained through refresher training.  The operating procedures are grouped into modules, and each operator is required to review the assigned modules and pass the prescribed tests over a period of three years.  Thus, refresher training is a continuing effort.  All operating training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\n4.6  Contractors \n\nPort Arthur Refinery uses contractors for routine maintenance activities, maintenance during shutdown periods, and for construction activities.
