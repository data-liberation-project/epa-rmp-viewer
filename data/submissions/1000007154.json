By upholding the management principles of the Chlorine Institute, MOST exercises facility-wide responsible care.\n\nMOST is a secondary aluminum smelter.  MOST utilizes chlorine to treat molten aluminum.  The chlorine treatment system utilizes liquid chlorine stored in 1-ton containers.  A maximum of three (3) 1-ton containers, or 6,000 pounds is stored onsite at any time.  \n\nMost's chlorine treatment system was developed utilizing numerous safety checks and release mitigation mechanisms.  The automatic shutoff valves will shut down the chlorine feed system in seconds in the case of a release.  Mechanical integrity inspections and preventive maintenance ensure the operational integrity of the process.\n\nEmployees involved with the chlorine process have a thorough understanding of pertinent operating procedures as well as the physical and chemical characteristics of chlorine.\n\nThere have been no accidents and no incidents in the past five years.\n\nThe Emergency Response Plan utilizes the Incident Command System, in which a plant incident commander provides mitigation direction to trained responders and communicates with local authorities as appropriate.  Annual training is provided for all chlorine process employees and quarterly evacuation drills are conducted.  "
