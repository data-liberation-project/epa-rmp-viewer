The facility is equiped with an automated chlorine leak detection system which automaticly activates the scrubber system and noitfies the DRC operator.  The chlorine scrubber is sized for the worse case scenario of netralizing two (2),  one ton cylinders of chlorine.  The facility was newly constructed in 1995 and has no accident or incident history to date.  Mitigation of chlorine leaks is handled by the chlorine scrubber.  The emergency response plan is out lined in the Chlorine Leak Alarm and Containment policy.  This resubmission is based upon Operations of the facility have been modified for the use of a single one ton (2,000 LB) cylinder for disinfection.  Back up and switch over capabilities will be accomplished with the use of a single 150-LB chlorine cylinder.  This modification to the operations results in the reduction of the chlorine in inventory to a maximum of 2,150 lb., which is below the RMP reporting threshold limit of 2,500 lb.  The facility is required to, and does have the required Process Safety Management Plan (PSM) as required by OSHA."
