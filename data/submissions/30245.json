The Facility Policy\n\n    MFA Incorporated, and the employees of the MFA Anhydrous Plant in New Franklin are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the Howard County Fire Department, and other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information\n\n    The primary activity at the facility is the receiving, storage and distribution of liquid fertilizer and anhydrous ammonia for direct application as a crop nutrient. The facility also handles pesticides and grain.\n\n    The maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia stored at any one time would be 322,509 pounds. The facility has (1) 18,000 gallon storage tank, (2) 12,000 gallon storage tanks, and the largest tank onsite would be the 18,000-gallon storage tank containing approximately 84,118 pounds. The maximum quantity handled would be the unloading of a transport delivery truck holding approximately 50,000 pounds. The facility also has (28) 1,000-gallon nurse tanks, (2) 560-gallon applicator tanks for product distribution. \n\n3. The Accidental Release Prevention Program.\n\n    The facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1, 1981\", published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc., the Missouri Anhydrous Ammonia Law and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\". The facility will adopt changes required to meet the 1999 ASNI Code as budgets and time will allow.\n\n4. The Five-year Accident History\n\n    There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years"
