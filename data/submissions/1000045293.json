      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\n\nThe Helena Chemical Company (Helena) Pasco, WA Facility has submitted this updated electronic RMP in compliance with the provisions of the Clean Air Act 112 (r) as codified by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency at 40 CFR Part 68. \n\n\n\nThis electronic submittal provides conservative estimates of the offsite consequences of an accidental release of aqua ammonia from the Pasco, WA Facility located at 1010 East Kartchner, Pasco, WA 99301.  The electronic RMP summarizes the policies and procedures implemented by the Pasco, WA Facility to minimize the likelihood of an accident.  The electronic RMP also summarizes the actions that the Pasco, WA Facility has taken to ensure that a response to a release will be implemented in a proper and timely manner.\n\n\n\nPURPOSE FOR UPDATING RMP\n\n\n\nHelena is submitting this as a Voluntary Update.  In the 2014 EPA Report (i.e. last 5-year update), the Facility had reported that it would operate two covered processes involving anhydrous ammonia: Anhydrous Ammonia Railcar Storage and Anhydrous Ammonia Fertilizer Blending.  The Facility has not operated these processes in several years and has decided that it will not operate these processes in the future.  Therefore, the Anhydrous Ammonia Railcar Storage and Fertilizer Blending covered processes are being removed from the EPA Report.  \n\n\n\nIn addition, in the 2014 EPA Report (i.e. last 5-year update), the Facility reported that it stored aqua ammonia in a 14,000 gallon tank having a total quantity of 22,006 lbs. of ammonia.  The actual size of the tank is 16,700 gallons (i.e. 26,250 lbs. of ammonia).  .  \n\n\n\nThe Facility will continue to operate the Aqua Ammonia Storage and Handling, and Aqua Ammonia Fertilizer Blending covered processes.  All relevant sections for a Program 2 RMP Facility have been reviewed and/or updated.  The updates are reflected in both the EPA RMP Report and the Facility RMPr Program Document.  \n\n\n\nFACILITY\n\n\n\nThe Pasco, WA Facility is an agricu"

      "SummaryText": "lture retail and fertilizer blending chemical facility that operates two (2) covered processes including: Covered Process 1: Storage and Handling (Aqua Ammonia); and Covered Process 2: Aqua Ammonia Blending.  Aqua ammonia is transported to the Facility via a commercial tanker truck (6,700 gallon) and then transferred to the single 16,700-gallon stationary storage tank.  The commercial tanker truck operator (Vendor/Contractor) performs these transfer operations.  \n\n\n\nHelena stores the aqua ammonia in the stationary storage tank.  From the stationary storage tank, the Facility transfers aqua ammonia to a blender where the aqua ammonia is blended with other ingredients (i.e. water, phosphoric acid, and micronutrients). All transfer and blending operations are performed in accordance with the covered process-specific operating procedure as provided in the RMPr Program Document.  \n\n\n\nOFF-SITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\n\n\n\nWorst case offsite consequence analyses (OCA) representing the regulated substance and the two (2) covered processes was completed for this Facility.  When this OCA was prepared, the Facility had future plans to use a 32,000-gallon storage tank in addition to the 16,700-gallon storage tank for the storage of its aqua ammonia.  Each storage tank is located in separate containment areas.  Both aqua ammonia storage tanks and their containments were modeled to determine the distance to the toxic endpoint.  The aqua ammonia was modeled as liquid spill and evaporation from the secondary containment system.  (Note - the Facility has not used the 32,000-gallon storage tank and may never use this tank.  Therefore, the release scenario reported to EPA is for the 16,700-gallon storage tank.)\n\n\n\nA single alternative (or more likely to occur) scenario was completed for the two covered processes.  The release from Covered Processes 1 and 2 assumes to take the form of a failure of the 3\" transfer hose used to load into the stationary storage tank from a commercial tanker tr"

The aqua ammonia was modeled as liquid spill and evaporation from the secondary containment system.\n\n\n\nAlthough these events are classified as an alternative scenarios, accidents of this type minimized due to the operating procedures that Helena uses to safeguard ammonia transfer operations.\n\n\n\nACCIDENT PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe Fertilizer Manager implements the risk management planning process at this Facility.  The Fertilizer Manager is assisted by other Helena staff, as directed.  The Fertilizer Manager is responsible for ensuring that Helena Staff are properly trained in the implementation of the Prevention Program which includes Process Safety Information, Process Hazard Analysis, Operating Procedures, Training, Mechanical Integrity, Compliance Audits, Incident Investigation, and Emergency Response.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nHelena's Pasco, WA Facility is a non-responding facility. Helena has coordinated emergency response activities with its local emergency response agency and local fire department.\n\n \n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nThere have been no on-site deaths, injuries, or significant property damage; or off-site deaths, injuries, property damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place, in the past five (5) years because of the ammonia operations at the Pasco, WA  Facility.\n\n\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n\n\nThe Risk Management Plan implemented by Helena Chemical Company at the Pasco, WA Facility complies with the requirements of the Clean Air Act, Section 112(r). The RMP will be updated as the Pasco, WA Facility adds, deletes, or changes processes. The Emergency Response Program has been coordinated with the Franklin County LEPC and the Pasco Fire Department.  \n\n\n\nNOTE: Sections 4, 5, 6 and 7 of the standard RMP produced by EPA's RMP Submit Program are not applicable to the Pasco, WA Facility.\n\n"
