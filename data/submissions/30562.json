      "SummaryText": "Farmers Coop Grain Company is an agricultural related business that sells anhydrous ammonia to area crop producers.  The anhydrous ammonia plant consists of four tanks:  1-30,000 gallon,1-18,000, and 2-12,000 gallon tanks with a total holding capacity of 314,568 pounds when filled to 85% of total capacity. There are 44 nurse tanks plus 5 farmer tanks totaling 214,081 pounds of possible rolling stock capacity.\n\nThe facility is designed and maintained in accordance with all local, state, and federal rules and regulations.  Each year the employees who work with NH3 are trained at state schools in safety information, hazards, operating procedures, and maintenance procedures. Note:  In reguards to ANSI standards, we use the most current version that has been adopted by the state of Kansas.  As the Kansas Department of Ag adopts newer versions of the ANSI standard we will make necessary changes and improvements to our facilities.  \n\nEmployees are trained on a rotational basis with all employees being trained at least once every three years.  In the last five years we had one accidental release.  The release did not result in any injuries, but did require evacuation of the office and a select group of houses for a brief period of time as a precautionary measure.  There were no injuries to employees, citizens, or pets.  An investigation into the event lead to the company purchasing \"smart hose\" as an additional safety measure to prevent such accidents from occurring in the future.  There was no property damage aside from the loading hose. \n\nIn addition, there was extensive re-training done.  We believe that training is the most important thing we can do to prevent accidents and incidents.   \n\nThe worst-case scenario and alternative scenario have been removed at the request of the EPA.  This is due to security concerns related to the Homeland Security Act.  Relevant information has been shared with the local fire department.\n\nOur emergency action plan has been discussed with"

We believe this crossover training as both supplier and responder makes our employees exceptionally well prepared to mitigate any release scenario and minimize its impact on the community and environment.  \n\nOur facility undergoes regular inspections from the Kansas Department of Agriculture.  Our plant will not operate without a current passing inspection.  \n\nIn addition, we have secured the services of a safety consultant who visits our location on at least a monthly basis to review policy and inspect facilities.  We have a number of administrative controls present to prevent accidents and releases.  These include the aforementioned training, requiring proper PPE (gloves, goggles), having respirators available for use, making safety and bleed-off water available at all times when loading or unloading, disconnecting the power source from the tank when filling, and the recent installation of \"smart hose\" that completely closes off both ends of the hose should the transfer hose fail or be compromised in any way.  \n\nThis facility has a written Emergency Action Plan as directed by the OSHA standard.  Our Emergency Action Plan allows only minor leaks, releases, or accidents to be handled in-house.  Any major release, accident, or scenario requiring an SCBA will require immediate evacuation and notification of applicable local authorities.  The meeting place, administrative assignments, and emergency numbers are included in our Emergency Action Plan.  The presence of several employees on the local fire department insures that our responders have a working knowledge of our facility and that the response time is exceptional.\n\nOur company provides state and local authorities with all applicable community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (Tier II).  \n\nSafety is an ongoing process at th"
