General accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps (Management System for Process Safety/Risk Management)\nD.Emergency response program\nE. Five-year accident history\nF. Planned changes\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nThe Westlake Polymers Corporation in Sulphur LA has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n\nA. DESCRIPTION OF FACILITY\n\nWestlake Polymers is located in an industrial complex in Sulphur Louisiana. It operates 5 low-density polyethylene units using minor variants of one process. The polyethylene product is sold to other companies who make a wide variety of things, from plastic films and bags to the little clear plastic shaker-caps on hot-sauce bottles. The first units were built in 1966, and the last major change, a re-start of an existing unit, occurred in 1993. \n\nWestlake uses several listed flammable chemicals as essential ingredients (they all react to form part of the final product) in its process: ethylene, propylene, isobutane, as well as one listed toxic chemical: vinyl acetate.\n\nB.

This is a physically impossible event, but at least represents an \"upper bound\" as no accident involving flammable could possibly lead to a bigger result.\n\nThe Worst-Case Scenario for a Toxic release on site involves a rupture of a vinyl acetate storage tank. This is a Liquid at ambient conditions and the dike around the vessel is an existing passive mitigation system that would certainly limit the consequence of such a scenario. In accordance with federal and state guidelines for calculation, this release is assumed to occur at the worst case weather conditions of 'F' Pasquill stability class and 1.5meters/second. Which occurs only on still, cloudy nights.\n\nThe Planning Case (Alternate Release) Scenario for a flammable involves a release and flash fire of ethylene gas from the incoming pipeline metering area. A >\" drain line was assumed to be knocked off completely, and it was assumed that no one would be able to shut off the flow for 15 minutes. No other active or passive mitigation was considered even though such systems exist. This is a very conservative assumption as there are remote-controlled valves in this area as well as detection capability, alarms, and fire-water monitors which our operators are trained to use to disperse leaks. This case was analyzed at average weather conditions for our area. There are other conditions that could lead to larger release rates, but these are a long way from the edge of the property. The analysis showed these other cases would have no offsite impact. \n\nThe Planning Case (Alternate Release) Scenario for the only toxic material involves a release of vinyl acetate liquid from the incoming pipeline metering area. A >\" drain line was assumed to be knocked off completely, with the liquid pouring out and spreading across the concrete pad. It was assumed that no one would be able to shut off the flow for 15 minutes."

SCOPE:\n\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at the Westlake Polymers Corporation. Because the processes at the site that are covered by the EPA RMP regulation are also subject to the OSHA PSM standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program. Westlake believes the requirements of the two regulations are so similar, or so complimentary, that only one management system is required to comply with all of them. And because our site is an OSHA Star worksite, (denoting the highest safety designation a plant can receive from OSHA), our programs are frequently reviewed by OSHA to ensure continuous improvements \n\nThe Management System for controlling process safety at the site includes a broad range of management programs as outlined in the Procedures Section below. This procedure describes the management system in general terms. Most of the detailed requirements are contained in more specific Safety, Process Safety, Operations and Maintenance policies and procedures as referred to below.\n\nC2. EMPLOYEE PARTICIPATION\n\nWestlake Polymers encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention. Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team. Employees have access to all information created as part of the site accident prevention program. Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employe"

In addition, the site has five committees onsite dedicated to safety (including one specifically dedicated to process safety issues) that include members from various areas of the plant, including operations, maintenance, engineering, and plant management. \n\nC3. PROCESS SAFETY INFORMATION\n\nThe Petrochemicals site keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes. These documents are available to all personnel onsite In paper form or through our computerized document management system. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters, and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information. Specific departments within the plant are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information. A list of reference documents and their location is readily available as part of the written employee participation plan to help employees locate any necessary process safety information. \n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs) that are available to employees through the computerized document management system and in the central MSDS file. This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with inadvertent mixing of chemicals. The plant ensures that the process is maintained within safe limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems). \n\nThe site also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment. This information materials of construction, design pressure and tem"

PROCESS HAZARD ANALYSIS\n\nWestlake Polymers has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled. Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nThe site primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) and checklists analysis techniques to perform these evaluations. The combination of HAZOP and checklists analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques. The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating, maintenance, and engineering expertise, as well as knowledge of the analysis technique being used. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to local management for resolution. Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team. This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention. All approved mitigation options being implemented in response to PHA findings are tracked until they are completed. The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety feature, the site periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results. These periodic"

The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained. Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\n \n C.5 OPERATING PROCEDURES\n\n The site maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as unit startup, normal operations, temporary operations, normal shutdown, and emergency shutdown. These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators. These procedures provide guidance on how to respond to upper or lower limit exceedences for specific process or equipment parameters. All this information is readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n These procedures are regularly reviewed and certified as current and accurate. The procedures are maintained current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change and ISO 9002 (quality) process.\n \n C6. TRAINING\n \n To complement the written procedures for process operations, the site has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process. New employees receive basic training in plant operations. After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks. After operators demonstrate (through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently. In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level. This refresher "

All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n \n C7. CONTRACTORS\n \n Westlake uses contractors to supplement its work force during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities. Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the site has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform site personnel of any hazards that they find during their work. This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work. In addition, the site evaluates contractor safety and performance during the selection of a contractor. Site personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n \n C8.PRE-STARTUP SAFETY REVIEWS\n \n The site conducts PSSR's for new facilities or facility modifications that requires a change in the process safety information. The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and the equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service. This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready. The PSSR review team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness. A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are proper"

The basic aspects of this program include: (1) conducting training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting identified deficiencies, and (5) applying quality assurance measures. In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process equipment.\n \n Maintenance personnel receive training on (1) an overview of the process, (2) safety and health hazards, (3) applicable maintenance procedures, (4) emergency response plans, and (5) applicable safe work practices to help ensure that they can perform their job in a safe manner. Written procedures help ensure that work is performed in a consistent manner and provide a basis for training. Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended, and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels). If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service (if possible), or a team will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment.\n \n  Another integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance. The site incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs. This action helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.\n \n The Mechanical Integrity (MI) program is the responsibility of the Maintenance and Reliability Managers.

FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n \n Westlake Polymers keeps records of all significant accidental chemical releases that occur at our facility. Every incident is investigated very carefully to determine ways to prevent similar incidents from occurring. The following is a brief summary of accidental chemical releases involving material covered under EPA/s RMP rule since June 1994. This incident history considers offsite impact such as shelter-in-place of the public and injuries to the public, and onsite impacts such as injuries or significant equipment damage.\n \n7 May 1995, a low-order decomposition occurred, causing a pipe to fail suddenly, which lead to a flash fire. There was one indirect injury and property damage exceeded $100,000. No off-site impact occurred.\n7 November 1995, A flash ethylene fire occurred in the F-line extrusion hopper. An employee standing nearby received thermal burns, but was able to return to work. No off-site impact occurred.\n\nF. PLANNED CHANGES\n\nWestlake Polymers is committed to the concept of continuous improvement, and has a number of active programs (as outlined in section C above) to identify opportunities for improvement, including reducing the possible impact of an incident on the community or the environment. For example, Westlake Polymers has reduced the use toxic chemicals by substituting a less hazardous water treatment chemical.\n\nFile: EXECSUM2.DOC"
