      "SummaryText": "Abbott Nutrition, a Division of Abbott Laboratories, located in Altavista, Virginia has an accidental release prevention program that combines the newest equipment technologies with operational procedures, training, and management practices.  All applicable procedures of the U. S. Environmental Protection agency (EPA) Prevention Program are adhered to.  The in-plant emergency response procedures have been developed at this facility consistent with the emergency response services available in the community.  Implementation and maintenance of the systems and programs discussed in this report have the full support of Abbott management.\n\n\n\nThe Altavista facility has a single, closed-looped ammonia system.  This system is used to cool water to 33 to 40 degrees F.  The frigid water is circulated throughout the plant to cool various processes and storage tanks used in the manufacture of nutritional products.  At no time does the ammonia come in contact with the water.  All ammonia handling equipment is located in the site's Powerhouse.\n\n\n\nThe system is comprised of three ammonia compressors, three precoolers, two condensors, one high pressure receiver, two ice banks, control systems, relief valve manifold system, safety equipment (such as ammonia monitors) and associated piping.  The small compressor has approximately 200 tons of cooling and the two large compressors have approximately 300 tons each.  Operation of the system is monitored and controlled by Powerhouse Operators 24 hrs per day, 365 days per year from the Powerhouse Control Room.\n\n\n\nLiquid ammonia goes from the high pressure receiver through the chill plates or ice bank coils while water is circulated over the outside of the chill plates and coils.  The liquid ammonia absorbs energy from the water and is turned into low pressure gas.  The water temperature is reduced from the loss of energy.  This water is circulated throughout the plant for cooling.  Compressors can be added or subtracted depending on the coo"

      "SummaryText": "ling load.  The low pressure gas is then returned to the intercooler and then to the ammonia compressors that turn the ammonia vapor back into a high pressure gas.  The high pressure gas goes to the condensors that use fans and water circulating over the ammonia carrying pipes to remove the heat from the ammonia and turn it back to a liquid.  The liquid then drains by gravity back to the high pressure receiver.\n\n\n\nAll ammonia equipment with the exception of the condensors is located in the Ammonia Equipment Rooms.  This area is equipped with exhaust fans that are regularly tested.  Testing is initiated by our Preventive Maintenance (PM) System to assure that the fans continue to work properly.  Each ammonia room has an ammonia detector that is connected to the monitoring/alarm system.  The low level detector is set at 25 ppm and the high alarm is set at 300 ppm.  If an alarm of 25 ppm of ammonia is detected, an alarm sounds in the Powerhouse Control Room.  If a level of 300 ppm is detected, an alarm sounds in the Powerhouse Control Room and exhaust fans in the ammonia area will switch to high speed.\n\n\n\nEach piece of ammonia equipment is in the Preventive Maintenance Program.  PMs are generated automatically at the designed frequency from a computer database.  Contractors check pieces of ammonia equipment such as piping, exchangers, etc. for corrosion every five years.  Safety relief valves allow the system to relieve over-pressurization in a controlled manner, avoiding a dangerous buildup of pressure.  All safety relief valves are piped into a manifold that contains an alarm and exhausts above the roof.  All ammonia safety relief valves are replaced every five years.\n\n\n\nAmmonia system valves are numbered to correspond to site process and instrumentation drawings (P & IDs) for the ammonia system.  Difficult to reach valves have been equipped with chain operation for ease of operation and faster response in the event of an ammonia emergency.\n\n\n\nThe site's general acci"

      "SummaryText": "dental release prevention program is based on the following key elements:\n\n\n\n          1.  High level of training of the operators.\n\n          2.  Preventive maintenance program.\n\n          3.  Use of state-of-the-art process and safety equipment.\n\n          4.  Use of accurately developed operating procedures, written with participation of the operators.\n\n          5.  Performance of hazard reviews of equipment and procedures.\n\n          6.  On-going auditing and inspection program.\n\n\n\nChemical-specific prevention steps include: availability of self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA), to be worn by the operators or Emergency Response (ER) Team members if ever needed; awareness of the hazards and toxic properties of ammonia; limited or controlled access to the ammonia area; the presence of ammonia detectors; and a fully implemented Process Safety Management Program.\n\n\n\nThere have been no accidental releases at this facility during the past five years.\n\n\n\nThis facility has a trained emergency response (ER) Team that has been trained specifically in aiding the Powerhouse employees should there be an emergency or release.  This facility participates with the Campbell County Department of Public Safety (LEPC).  Emergency response procedures and operations are reviewed or checked annually.\n\n\n\nThe basic ammonia system operation is unchanged since implementation of the PSM Program and the Management of Change Procedures; however, improvements have been made in the relief valve exhaust system; Preventive Maintenance procedures; P & ID documentation; and enhancement/clarification of operating procedures.  New solenoid valves have been installed that will allow Powerhouse Operators to isolate segments of the ammonia system in the event of an emergency. "
