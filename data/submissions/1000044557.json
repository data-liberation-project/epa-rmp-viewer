Installation Description\n\nThe Defense Supply Center Richmond (DSCR) is located just south of Richmond, Virginia and is an inventory control point within the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA).  DLA is charged with procuring and distributing supplies to the armed forces.  DSCR is DLA's aviation supply and demand chain manager and is the primary source of supply for more than 1.1 million repair parts and operating supply items supporting 1,800 major weapon systems.\n\n  \n\nDSCR consists of 611 acres of property situated between Falling Creek to the north and Kingsland Creek on its southern boundary in Chesterfield County, Virginia.  Land use principally consists of office buildings, warehouses, parking areas and open spaces.\n\n\n\n2. Types of Chemicals and Processes Present at DSCR\n\n\n\nOzone-depleting substances (ODS) form a substantial proportion of chemicals stored at DSCR.  However, ODS are not on the List of Regulated Toxic Substances (40 CFR 68.130) within the Risk Management Program (RMP) rule.  Among the chemicals on this list, the following chemicals are stored on DSCR and exceed the RMP reportable threshold; Methyl ether, propane, sulfur dioxide, and Teflon monomer.  These substances are regulated by the RMP rule as either a flammable substance and/or mandated by Congress. \n\nOther than storage of ozone-depleting substances, the Defense Distribution Depot performs an important function the reclamation and refurbishing of ODS and inert gases (such as oxygen, argon, and nitrogen).  While the ODS are recovered, inert gases are bled to the atmosphere.  After the ODS have been reclaimed, the empty cylinders are cleaned, tested, and re-certified (or rejected) by persons qualified by the Bureau of Explosives.  This process is known as the refurbishment of the ODS cylinders.\n\nFor this RMP update, the storage of materials and the refurbishment of containers were investigated but, several other activities which occur at the installation were investigated from the standpoint of "

      "SummaryText": "the RMP rule.  Building 80 houses the Equipment Maintenance Branch, consisting of Material Handling & Equipment and the Automotive and Heavy Equipment shop.  While there are many activities here that involve the use of chemicals, such chemicals are not covered by the RMP rule.  Examples of the chemicals handled are paints and solvents (in the automotive paint booth), degreasing solvents (mainly containing naphtha), new and spent engine oils, batteries, tires, and other materials generally associated with vehicle maintenance.  Similar operations are being conducted over at the Virginia Army National Guard Facility.  The results of the investigation determined that there are no chemicals present in Building 80, or over at the Virginia Army National Guard facility that are applicable to the RMP rule.\n\n\n\n3. Distribution and Warehousing of Materials\n\n\n\nOnce a substance arrives at DSCR, the substance is inventoried; a stock number is assigned, and in turn distributed to the appropriate warehouse or storage location.  Ozone-depleting substances are sent to Building 3, where the substances are reclaimed and the cylinders are refurbished.  DSCR also receives substances which are designated for redistribution to other supply centers in the Defense Logistics Agency.  These are stored in various locations throughout the Depot.  \n\n\n\n4. Data Management and Availability of Storage Records\n\n\n\nDue to the large number of items and materials that pass through DSCR, the volumes of these items and materials are logged in a computerized database named Distribution Standard System (DSS).  This system allows data to be sorted by materials, stock number, storage location, hazard code, available balance, and other data fields.  This database was invaluable in identifying RMP-regulated chemicals present at the Depot, their location, and the quantities in which they are being stored.\n\n\n\n5. Emergency Response Program\n\n\n\nAn emergency response program is currently being implemented at DSCR.  The "

      "SummaryText": "Fire Prevention and Protection Division (the Fire Department) at DSCR follows written procedures for emergency response notification and coordinates activities related to fire, rescue, and hazardous material response.  A memorandum of understanding (MOU) between DSCR and the County of Chesterfield, VA has been signed.  Mutual Aid agreements for assistance (fire protections, spill response, and medical assistance) are established with the Chesterfield County Fire Department.  Members of the LEPC attend and conduct training exercises in which DSCR personnel participates.\n\n\n\n6. Processes Subject to the RMP Rule\n\n\n\nThere are 4 substances stored at DSCR that are subject to the Environmental Protection Agency's RMP rule.  These substances are (1) Methyl ether (nonrecharge batteries), (2) Propane (aboveground storage tanks and boilers), (3) Sulfur Dioxide (nonrecharge batteries), and (4) Teflon Monomer (plastic tubing). Due to the nature of operations (warehousing) at DSCR, possibility of storing these chemicals above or below the RMP threshold cannot be ruled out.  All the reported substances directly involve the warehouse storage operations of DSCR to include propane to operate fork lifts to move inventory for shipment and in boilers.  A list of these processes, along with their storage locations and quantities (predictive or actual) of each regulated substance is given below.\n\n\n\nChemical                   Warehouse     Location    Quantity Stored (lb)      Threshold Quantity (lb)                              \n\nMethyl Ether                     13      Bay A         30,000 (predictive)           10,000\n\nPropane                           3      AST           10,000 (max)                  10,000\n\nPropane                           4      AST            1,000 (max)                  10,000\n\nPropane                          12      AST            1,000 (max)                  10,000\n\nPropane                          24      AST            1,000 (max)                  10,000\n\nPro"
