The same properties that make butane and propane valuable as a fuel also make it necessary to practice certain safety precautions in their handling to prevent leaks, spills and accidents.  First and foremost in our operations are the efforts undertaken to ensure employee and contractor safety while on site as well as minimize the risk exposure for the surrounding communities.  It is our company policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state and local rules and regulations.\n\nAs a corporation, AmeriGas staffs a professional Safety Department at our Corporate Headquarters in King of Prussia, Pennsylvania.  AmeriGas also has seven Regional Logistics Managers, a Terminal Operations Manager, a Safety and Technology Manager and a Supply and Logistics Safety Manager strategically located throughout the United States. These safety professionals are able to immediately respond to a serious incident and provide technical expertise to emergency response agencies as needed at the scene of the incident.  AmeriGas also maintains an around the clock Emergency Communications Center, located in Rocklin, CA, which handles all after-hours and emergency calls from around the country.  The ECC has the ability to contact AmeriGas field personnel or Chemtrec on any type of incident encountered at any AmeriGas location or by AmeriGas customers.\n\nThe primary purpose of the facility is to store and distribute Propane/Butane (LPG) to wholesale customers.  Propane/Butane is received and/or distributed to customers via railcar or transport truck and is stored in three horizontal tanks, each having a nominal capacity of 60,000 gallons.  The facility is equipped to load or offload railcars and transport trucks as needed.  Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, management per"

The maximum amount of LPG inventory that can be stored on site is 640,000 pounds.\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Policies and Practices\n\nThe site and the company continually strive to improve operations performance including the prevention of incidents, injuries and releases at the facility.  Primary elements of this continuous improvement effort include making capital improvements to the facility as required, maintaining up to date procedures and continual training of personnel in both regulatory and job specific subject matter.  The integrity and reliability of major equipment, including pumps, compressors, pipelines and storage tanks is assured through periodic inspection and preventive maintenance practices.  The chemicals handled do not present significant internal corrosion hazards and corrosion to external surfaces of pipelines and storage tanks is minimized via extensive inspection and painting programs.  \n\nStrategically located Emergency shutdown switches are located within the plant and automatic systems include automatic positive shutoff valves at the storage tanks and other critical interlocks designed to shutdown affected equipment or isolate a problem once detected either through pressure sensors or manually by the operations staff.  \n\nShould an actual leak occur operators would isolate the parts of the plant affected by the leak, or the Emergency Shutdown system could be activated to close all of the supply and return lines on the storage tanks.  \n\nThis distribution and storage facility is subject to and abides by OSHA\u00bfs Process Safety Management (PSM) rule for sites handling hazardous chemicals.  In addition, the site complies with EPA\u00bfs Accidental Release Prevention Rule and all other applicable federal, state and local codes and regulations, including the Arizona Corporation Commissi"

When built, this facility was designed in accordance with NFPA-58.  \n\nAll of our AmeriGas transport drivers have been thoroughly trained using the National Propane Gas Association\u00bfs (NPGA) Certified Employee Training Program (CETP).\n\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nThis facility has not had an accident or release meeting RMP criteria within the last five years.\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nThis facility is considered a non-responding site and as such it maintains only an Emergency Action Plan (EAP) that includes procedures for notification of local fire, law enforcement and medical organizations.  Notification of potentially affected neighbors would be coordinated through the fire department or law enforcement after consultation with site personnel.  Should an actual incident occur the EAP gives guidance to employees on how to respond to minor accidents, incidental spills and/or small fires.  Larger emergencies require assistance from local emergency response organizations and on-site personnel are knowledgeable as to when that outside assistance is required.\n\nThe plan is reviewed periodically to ensure that it remains up-to-date, reflecting current activities on site and employees are trained on their responsibilities in an emergency to ensure prompt response should a situation arise.  This site\u00bfs EAP is based upon the following guidelines and standards:\n\n1) NPGA LP-Gas Safety Handbooks:  Guidelines for Developing Plant Emergency Procedures and How To Control LP-Gas Leaks and Fires.\n2) OSHA\u00bfs Occupational Safety and Health Standards for General Industry, specifically: 29 CFR 1910.38, \u00bfEmergency Action Plans\u00bf, 29CFR 1910.39, \u00bfFire Prevention Plans\u00bf, 29 CFR 1910.119, \u00bfProcess Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals\u00bf and 29 CFR 1910.120, \u00bfHazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response\u00bf\n3) National Fire Protection Association Guidelines, NFPA 58, \u00bfLiquified Petroleum Gas Code\u00bf and"

New programs were developed to track and replace existing Pressure Relief Valves (PRV) in the piping system and Truck rack area.  The Rail terminal offloading PRV\u00bfs were also replaced.   The existing truck rack loading arms were replaced in the spring of 2005 in order to reduce fugitive gas emissions.  Continuing improvements of the nature described above will be made as needed to improve plant reliability, integrity, and safety."
