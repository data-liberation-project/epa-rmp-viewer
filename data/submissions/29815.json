The Facility Policy \n\nThe owners, management, and employees of Cargill. of Aylesworth   are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of Anhydrous Ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the various fire departments, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information.\n\na The primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers.\n\nb  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application of product nutrients to farms.\n\nc The maximum quantity stored would be 230,520 pounds in our two storage tanks. The largest of which is 144,075 pounds. The maximum quantity handled would be the unloading of a semi truck holding 40,000 pounds.\n\n3. The Worst Case Release Scenario And The Alternative Release Scenario. \n\na. The worst case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a 30,000 gallon storage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes. The maximum quantity released would be 118,142 pounds which  represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 PPM) is 5.6  miles.\n\nb The alternative release scenario based on the five year accident history (or the most likely potential incident) is a release from a break in a transfer hose. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 PPM) is 1.2 miles.\n\n4. The Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K41.1\", published by The American National Standards institute, inc., and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.1 1"
    },
    {
      "ESSeqNum": 1,
      "FacilityID": 29815,
      "SummaryText": "1, \"Storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia\". This facility has also complied with the Ammonia Law regulated by the Office of the State Chemist.\n\n5. The five-year Accident History\n\n There have been no accidental releases in the past five years that have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant properly damage at the facility; nor to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, and evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n\n\n\n6. The Emergency Response Program\n\nThe facility has:\n\n\na.A written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910 38;\nb.Provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right to know information as required under SARA Title 111 (EPCRA).\n\nc.A written emergency response program. In accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910120, including pre emergency planning and employee training.\n\n7. Planned Changes To Improve Safety.\n\nSafety improvement is an on going process at the facility. Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions. There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
