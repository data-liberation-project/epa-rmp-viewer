In this way we promote overall plant, worker and public safety. These programs enable our facility to prevent the occurrence and minimize the consequences of significant releases of toxic substances as well as fires, explosions and other types of catastrophic accidents. Overall these programs prevent accidental fatalities, injuries and illnesses and avoid physical property damage. Our safety programs are applied to any activity involving hazardous chemicals including any use storage, manufacturing, handling or the on-site movement of such chemicals or combination of these activities. Any group of vessels which are interconnected and separate vessels which are located such that a hazardous chemical could be involved in a potential release shall be considered a single process. Our safety programs prevent accidents because they focus on the rules, procedures and practices which govern individual processes, activities or pieces of equipment. These rules are detailed and improved as necessary. They are also communicated to and accepted by all employees at this facility.Failure of the high pressure receiver containing 13,000 pounds of ammonia with the receiver quantity limited to 6,316 pounds of the vessel capacity by facility prodedures resulting in a ten minute release. Under worst case weather conditions, ammonia could travel .2 miles before dispersing enough to no longer pose a hazard to the public. This scenario is unlikely for the following reasons: worst case weather conditions are uncommmon; the vessel is enclosed in a building that would withstand and help to contain such a release; industry standards for the manufacture and quality contro"
