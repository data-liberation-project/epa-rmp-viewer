This is due to security concerns as brought to light by the Homeland Security Act.

In addition, the Department of Agriculture inspects our plants on an annual basis.  We also meet the current underwriting guidelines of Farmland Insurance and undergo annual loss control surveys based on both physical property and safety/operational procedures.  NOTE:  The state of Kansas has not yet adopted the latest version of the ANSI standard.  When the Department of Agriculture adopts the latest version we will budget the needed time and funds to insure that all facilities meet the new guidelines.  \n\nOur firm has an outstanding safety record at this location.
