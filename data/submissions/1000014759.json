      "SummaryText": "Cibolo Creek Municipal Authority owns, operates and maintains a 6,200,000 Gallon per Day Regional Wastewater Treatment Facility located on the Bexar/Guadalupe County line of Cibolo Creek in Schertz, Texas. The Authority presently owns the surrounding property which is a total of 310 acres. There are no residence within 900 feet of the present chlorine storage and operation area. The Authority operates under a Wastewater Discharge Permit issued by the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, Permit # 11269-001. The plant is located in a sparsly populated area along the South bank of Cibolo Creek. It is the chlorine usage and storage in one ton containers for effluent disinfection that qualifies for this submittal.\n\nThe wastewater plant utilizes two (2) one ton containers of chlorine gas on-line for disinfection of our effluent flow as per our permit requirements. In addition there are also two (2) one ton containers in a stand-by mode for automatic switch-over when the first set of cylinders become empty. Chlorine gas is fed under vacuum to injectors for mixing with the eflluent in our chlorine contact basins. The chlorine storage and operation area is equipped with an air pump alarm system by Hydro Instruments Co. This system produces both visual and audio alarms (horn). Self-contained breathing apparatuses are on site and in a stand-by mode. These SCBA's are available at all times. Operation team members also use filter pack devices when handleing chlorine. Cylinders are unloaded from trucks and handled according to specific written procedures. Operators are trained by supervisory personnel on these procedures. There are never more than four (4) cylinders on site for effluent chlorination. \n\nPlant operations are performed by a fifteen member staff under the direction of the Plant Superintendent for the Authority. The Plant Superintendent is under the direction of the Utility Director. Management is governed by a five member, elected board of directors. The operat"

There are two (2) Type \"B\", 1 ton chlorine emergency repair kits on-site as issued by the Chlorine Institute. \n\nWe have experienced leaking gaskets on cylinder connections from time to time which have been corrected with no incidents. In July of 1999, following submittal of our first RMP, we experienced a major leak in one of the cylinder connections. The Universal City Fire Department was contacted and the Randolph Haz-Mat Team was dispatched. Evacuations of the surrounding area had begun when the Haz-Mat Team managed to secure the cylinder. Our worst case senario became a reality. In follow-up reviews of the response, it was determined that all procedures were followed correctly with the exception of calling the Universal City Fire Department, when 911 should have been the first response. There was no loss of life or property damage from this incident. In events such as this one, procedure calls for immediate shut down of the cylinders themselves if possible. If cylinders cannot be shut down, Haz-Mat is called for assistance. If possible, operations team members prepare to assist Haz-Mat to the best of their ability. This includes having cylinder repair kits available should they be required. System is under vacuum all the way to the cylinder pressure regulators which makes small leaks easier to repair. The vacuum systems would pull any remaining chlorine in the system to the chlorine contact basin where it would mix with effluent water. Major leaks also require contact with all three fire departments within our area. The City of Schertz and the City of Cibolo jurisdictions are within the patterned areas of release. We would have already been in contact with the City of Universal City for they are the core of the Randolph Haz-Mat Team.\n\nThe predominate winds are from the south at the plant lo"

There is also a bank, restaurant and several small business's located within this area. Should we experience a worst case senario, procedures call for an evacuation of a one mile area in the direction of prevailing wind. With this model, that distance is expanded to the required 1.3 mile distance. The evacuations would be accomplished with the assistance of the Fire, Police, EMS and utility department personnel from Schertz and Cibolo.\n\nThe Texas Commission on Environmental Quality periodically inspects our WWTP and we have never incountered any discrepancies to date.
