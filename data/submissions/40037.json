The management and employees of the Hopewell facility are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous Ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to the community and the environment.\n\nThe facilities primary operation is the producton of Carbon Dioxide where the covered material, anhydrous Ammonia is used in the refrigeration system. Ammonia is received and stored in 4 high pressure receiver and process refrigeration system that contains up to 32,500 pounds of anhydrous Ammonia in all systems combined.\n\nThe worst-case scenario, based on the EPA's definition for a toxic gas release and the alternatice release scenarios were conducted and endpoints were determined using EPA?s RMPComp* 1.07.  Discription and results may be reviewed by contancting the facility.\n\nPassive and Active Mitigation systems in place that would reduce the likelihood of a release or the release itself. These include check valves in the fill lines, a preventive maintenance schedule for the system, and safeties. The system is also located within an enclosure.\n\nThe facility has developed a comprehensive prevention program designed to prevent accidental releases of Ammonia.  The program utilizes state-of-the-art technology, sound engineering practices, administrative controls and active employee participation.  Employees serve on task groups and teams in developing and maintaining risk management program elements.  They are frequently consulted concerning the various aspects of the program and ways to continually improve the safety of the process.  \nWritten process safety information was developed for the Ammonia system to enable managers, supervisors, and employees to identify and underst"

This information was utilized to develop a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) which assists management and employees in making decisions for improving safety and reducing the consequences of releases of Ammonia. The PHA focuses attention on equipment, instrumentation, utilities, human actions, (routine and nonroutine), and external factors that might impact the process by identifying potential failure points or failure modes in the process. The PHA was review and updated on June 10, 2004 and will be updated at least every 5 years. \n\nDetailed 0perating procedures exist which describe tasks to be performed, dates to be recorded, operating conditions to be maintained, and safety and health precautions to be taken.  The procedures were reviewed/approved to ensure they are technically accurate by employees, managers and personnel with the technical expertise/knowledge of the process.  The operating procedures were review in June 2004  and are annually reviewed/revised as necessary to reflect current operations.\n\nEmployees are thoroughly trained, including maintenance and contractor employees.  The training meets and exceeds the requirements as outlined in OSHA?s hazard communication standard 29 CFR 1910.1200.  Training includes operating procedures, safe work practices, emergency procedures (including alarms), special assignments, evacuation and emergency response; safety rules and procedures; routine and nonroutine work authorization; and other pertinent process safety information.  Each employee trained has a defined and documented program based on their job duties.  The training goals and objectives have been established and written in clear and measurable terms.  Hands-on training is provided to employees to enhance their senses beyond listening.  In addition, employees receive traditional classroom instruction computer assisted training (IMSS), videos, programmed and on-the-job instruction.  Employees are encouraged to actively participate.

The training program was last reviewed in June 2004.\n\nA contractor screening process has been established and is designed to ensure that contractors hired or used can accomplish their assigned tasks without compromising the safety and health of employees and the public.   The screening program involves obtaining information on the contractor's safety performance, including injury and illness rates, and experience.  In addition, the contractor's safety performance, job skills, knowledge, and certifications (such as pressure vessel welders) are also verified. The contractors safety procedures were last review in June 2004.  \n\nPreStart-up Safety Reviews (PSSR) are used for new or modified processes to improve the design and construction of the process from a reliability and quality stand point.  The PSSR recommendations are resolved before final installations are complete. Other items completed prior to initial process startup include piping and instrument diagrams, operating procedures, and ensuring operating personnel are fully trained.  The initial startup and normal operating procedures are fully evaluated as part of the PSSR to assure a safe transfer into the normal operating mode for meeting the process parameters. The last PreStart-up Safety Review was conducted on .\n\nAn on-going mechanical integrity program (maintenance) is used to ensure safe process operations. Equipment used to store, process, or handle Ammonia has been designed, constructed, installed, and maintained to minimize releases.

The BOC Hazardous Work Program describes the steps that a supervisor, contractor representative or other authorized issuer needs to follow to manage hazardous work.   The program references and coordinates applicable lockout/tagout procedures, line breaking, hot work authorization, elevated work/fall protection, controlling access to covered process areas, and excavation procedures. BOC's Confined Space Entry Program is a separate permitting system designed to manage it's employees/contractors in performing this type of work. This Program was review in June 2004 for both employees and contractors.\n \nManagement of Change (MOC) procedures have been developed for permanent changes to process chemicals, technology, equipment and facilities.  MOC procedures are designed to ensure that prior to any change occurring, that technically qualified personnel with knowledge and expertise of the chemical process, reviews and approves the proposed changes.  This would include both technical and mechanical changes.  Process changes include all modifications to equipment, procedures, raw materials and processing conditions other than \"replacement in kind\".  A Process Change Authorization is required for all changes.
