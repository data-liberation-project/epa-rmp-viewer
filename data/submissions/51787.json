In addition, the nine sections of the plan were reviewed and verified. The bulk of the changes are in Section 7, Prevention Program 3. The changes in this section reflect recent FHR efforts to immediately address deficiencies in the facility\u00bfs PSM program by conducting a safety turnaround that focused on emergency response procedures and training. No changes have occurred that affect sections 1-5. Three recent incidents, a flaring event in the Olefins plant due to a broken cooling tower supply line and two small reactor fires in the polyethylene plant were added because they involved significant (greater than $25K) on-site property damage. Section 9 was changed to reflect the improvements to the emergency response plan and training resulting from the safety turnaround.  Flint Hills Resources, LP (FHR) purchased the Odessa Facility in an asset purchase on August 1, 2007.\n\nElements Descriptions\n1. Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies: FHR Odessa is committed to providing a safe, healthy, and environmentally conscious work place for its employees and neighbors. Since purchasing the facility in an asset purchase on August 1, 2007, FHR\u00bfs focus has been on safety and environmental compliance.  The Odessa facility is an OSHA VPP STAR status and ISO 14001 certification.

The Odessa site operates five Program Level 3 processes. These processes receive, handle, and store flammable hydrocarbon feed stocks for the production of olefins and specialty grade polymers. End uses include medical and personal care products, electronic cable coatings, adhesives and sealants, as well as boat and vehicle trims. FHR Odessa has large volumes of several regulated flammable substances, such as ethane, ethylene, propane, propylene, butane, and butene. The Odessa site uses small volumes of toxic chemicals, which are consumed in the process. The toxic chemicals are: \n- Chlorine - Used for water treatment.\n- Vinyl Acetate - Used as a comonomer in the manufacturing of polyethylene.\n- Hydrochloric Acid - Used for water treatment.\n\n3. General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps: Following is a brief summary of the elements that FHR\u00bfs Odessa Site has implemented to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements outlined by EPA as well as with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard.\n\nProcess Safety Information (PSI)\nIt is the FHR Odessa facility\u00bfs objective to maintain safety information to identify and understand the hazards of the process. This includes information pertaining to:\n- Hazards of regulated substances: For each regulated substance, a Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS).\n- The technology of the process: process chemistry, process temperature and pressure, and chemical reactivity.\n- Equipment in the process: for example, materials of construction, diagrams of the piping and instrumentation, safety systems, and design codes.\nHoweve"

FHR plans to make the required updates and improve the system for PSI maintenance.   \n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nA process hazards analysis (PHA) that identifies potential hazards, adequacy of the engineering and administrative controls, and ways to minimize those hazards is available for each covered process.  The PHAs on file are mostly Hazards and Operability Studies (HAZOPS) and \u00bfWhat If\u00bf, a structured brainstorming method of determining what things can go wrong and judging the likelihood and consequences of those situations occurring,  performed by third parties prior to FHR\u00bfs ownership. FHR is currently using the most recent PHA date for each covered process to establish revalidation schedules.  FHR intends to improve the quality of the PHAs in the areas of documenting and considering past incidents and human factors.\n\nThe Odessa site assigns employees to the HAZOP team who are knowledgeable in the process HAZOP methodology and the specific expertise as required.  FHR plans to improve procedures and policies to assure the proper people are assigned to each PHA team. \n\nThe HAZOP team will continue to develop recommendations to reduce the potential hazards.  FHR is implementing an effective tracking system to assure that the approved HAZOP team recommendations will be implemented within a reasonable period of time. \n\nOperating Procedures\nThe FHR Odessa facility\u00bfs policy is to maintain written operating procedures that were developed with operator participation and provide clear instruction for safely conducting activities associated with a covered process.

The training emphasizes safety and health hazards, routine and emergency operations, safety systems and their functions and safe work practices. All operators receive refresher training in accordance with applicable standards. A gap in this program has been identified regarding the recordkeeping of refresher training. We are addressing this as part of the review of operating procedures. \n\nMechanical Integrity\nFHR Odessa has written procedures for maintaining the operating components of the process (including pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown system controls, and pumps) through the mechanical integrity program. There are trained personnel who follow maintenance, testing, and inspection procedures that ensure proper function of process equipment.  However, FHR has noted deficiencies in the areas of fixed equipment inspection, piping circuitization and rotating equipment preventive maintenance (PM). FHR has effectively addressed the delinquent fixed equipment inspections.  A piping circuitization project is progressing and a new tracking and management system is being implemented as a tool to better manage the PM program. \n\n\nManagement of Change\nThe Odessa facility has written procedures to manage change to process chemical technology, equipment and procedures and changes to stationary sources that affect covered processes.

For reporting purposes, the release was quantified over a four-day period. For emergency response purposes, the release was only six hours in duration. The initial response for the incident included the closure of several major roads in the immediate area. There were no on-site or off-site injuries or deaths. \n- On September 2, 2005, there was a piping rupture due to elevated temperatures and pressures directly related to ethylene decomposition inside the discharge piping of Cold Shot Compressors C-165 A/B. Area personnel activated the Emergency Shutdown Device and Emergency Response personnel were called to secure the area. There were no off-site consequences resulting in deaths, injuries, evacuations, shelter-in-place warnings, property damage, or environmental impact. \n- On December 19, 2005 at approximately 5:50 AM, an employee received 2nd degree cryogenic burns to the abdomen area after opening the truck liquid valve prior to connecting unloading hose on a Propane/Propylene transport truck. \n- On July 25th, 2006 at approximately 2:28 PM, a \u00bd\u00bf nipple on a bleed valve on an incoming feedstock supply line was severed by a forklift transporting media to the C4 carbon filter (D8.0917R1), resulting in the release of approximately 27,983 lbs of Y-Grade (Flammable Mixture) to the atmosphere.\n-"

      "SummaryText": "On January 18, 2008, approximately 6:30 PM, the 30-inch East Cooling Tower supply line failed.  The failure occurred above grade at a set of flanges, in a vertically oriented pipe, approximately 200 feet west of the East Cooling Tower.  In this area the supply line transitions from carbon steel to polyethylene (PE) pipe. This event resulted in releases to both air (via the air and steam flares) and surface waters (via the storm water system). This event resulted in releases to both air (via the air and steam flares) and surface waters (via the storm water system). The cause of this failure was fatigue due to severe piping stress resulting from extreme misalignment.\n- On January 19, 2008 at 7:45 PM a fire occurred at the polyethylene unit \u00bfG\u00bf reactor recycle intermediate knock-out pot (V-281G) The reactor was shut down and the fire was extinguished at 8:15 PM by Operations personnel. The fire appeared to start under the insulation and the fuel source was a waxy polymer build-up from a rupture disk vent pipes. It is suspected that the temperature of the steam jacket was sufficient to ignite the wax/polymer mixture.\n- On January 24, 2008 at 7:33 PM. a fire occurred in the polyethylene unit \u00bfB\u00bf reactor bay. The reactor was shut down and Operations personnel extinguished the fire at approximately 8:05 PM.A \u00bfcold gas\u00bf (ethylene gas) leak was initiated either by contact with a hot surface or electrostatic discharge (ESD). Reactor and high pressure separator pressures indicate the ethylene gas leak was at high pressure and fueled the fire.\n\n6. Emergency Response Program: FHR has a written emergency response program that contains procedures to be followed in case of an accidental release. These procedures include steps for informing local emergency response agencies and the public. In addition, FHR Odessa provides training to its emergency response team members and to local emergency responders who may be called upon to assist in emergency response. FHR Odessa participates w"

Other community activities include cooperative training between the Odessa site and the Odessa Fire Department, as well as making available technical information, personnel, and supplies for county mutual aid. The emergency response management plan and its procedures were recently reviewed and revised, and extensive training exercises and drills were provided at the operational emergency shutdown, Emergency Response Team and Emergency Operations Center levels.  Additional emergency response equipment has been purchased to adequately equip and protect the ERT.  The equipment is maintained, tested, and inspected in accordance with prescribed standards. FHR has recently added a professional firefighter, ERT Captain to supplement ERT on each shift. \n \n\n7. Planned changes to improve safety: FHR has an on-going commitment to improve safety, health, and to protect the environment. In addition to frequently scheduled internal company audits and inspections, the site undergoes an annual self-evaluation as part of the OSHA's Voluntary Protection Program (VPP). Improving safety is a continuing process at FHR, and a number of significant safety improvements have been made. Recent safety improvements include:\n- Updated lock out tag out program \n- Emergency response preparedness training \n- Addition of professional firefighters to supplement ERT on all shifts \n- Improved corrective action tracking system for high visibility and timely resolution of corrective action\n- Implemented stress and agility testing for ERT\n- Instituted a program to ensure psi on PSVs are as built\n- Instituted program to bring a higher level of attention to near misses and minor incident (Supervisor\u00bfs Immediate Report) \n\nThe following safety, health, and environmental improvements are anticipated d"
