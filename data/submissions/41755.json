      "SummaryText": "The Hillsborough County Water Department  (HCWD) has an accidental release prevention policy integrating technology, established procedures and management practices into an unified approach to risk management. The HCWD operates a number of water and wastewater facilities throughout unincorporated Hillsborough County, Florida.  All applicable procedures of the United States Environmental Protection Agency, the Florida Deparment of Environmental Protection and the Department of Community Affairs are stringently obeyed.  The HCWD emergency response policy involves the preparation of response plans specific for each facility. Each facility is in compliance with the EPA emergency response program requirements.\n\nThe River Oaks Advanced wastewater  Treatment Plant is located at 8425 North Sheldon Road, Tampa, Fl  33556.  The site is located north of the intersection of Waters Avenue and Sheldon Road.  In addition to the treatment facility, the complex includes wastewater transmission facilities, a reclaim water system and surface water discharge facilities.\n\nThe off site consequence analysis includes consideration of two chlorine release scenarios, identified as worst case release and alternative scenario.  The first scenario is defined by the EPA, which states the owner or operator will assume that the maximum quantity in the largest vessel is released as a gas over 10 minutes, due to an unspecified failure.  The alternative scenario is identified as more likely to occur than the worst case scenario.\n\nThe HCWD has utilized the EPA lookup tables for its release modeling.\n\nThe worst case scenario at ROAWT involves an unspecified failure of an one ton container of chlorine.  The EPA specified conditions assume the release of the entire amount as a gas in ten minutes, use of the one hour ERPG-2 as the toxic endpoint, and the consideration of the population residing within a full circle with radius corresponding to the toxic endpoint distance.  EPA set these conditions to faci"

      "SummaryText": "litate the performance of the offsite consequence analysis.  The Water Department believes the EPA assumptions to be unrealistic.\n\nA.  Only a fraction of the compressed liquified chlorine released to the atmosphere will flash to vapor.   The remaining liquid forms liquid droplet aerosols. This results in the formation of a very dense vapor cloud consisting of vapor and liquid droplets, with the dispersion characteristics significantly different than a cloud of chlorine gas.\n\nB.  Only the population within an elliptical plume extending downwind of the release point is potentially affected.  The plume area, or footprint, is approximately six percent of the full circle.\n\nEPA mandated meterological conditions, stability F, wind speed of 1.5 m/second, highest daily maximum temperature and average humidity were used for the modeling.\n\nMitigation systems at ROAWT include chlorine leak detection systms and vacuum piping.  The ROAWT chlorine injection system is a vacuum system.  This type opf systemwill significantly reduce the amount of chlorine released in case of a pigtail or piping failure/\n\nRelease prevention program.\nTraining of all staff.\nPreventative maintenance program.\nState of the art process and safety equipment.\nHazard review of equipment and procedures.\nAccurate, effective operating procedures.\nIn house inspection pregram.\n\nChemical specific prevention steps include the avail;ability of Self Contained Breathing Apparatus (SCBA) worn by operators during connection/disconnection of the chlorine containers, awareness of hazardous and toxic properties of chlorine and the presence of chlorine detection system.  River Oaks aklso maintains a chlorine repair kit on site."
