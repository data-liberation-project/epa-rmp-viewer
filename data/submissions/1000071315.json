This means that we will contact emergency responders (911) in the event of an emergency.\n\n    Preventative maintenance and training is provided at this facility to employees to ensure the safety of all workers and customers.  A worst case scenario for this facility has been analyzed as well as one alternate release scenario.\n\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance:\n\n\n\n    This facility has two storage tanks as well as a filling station for each storage tank.  The regulated substance handled is Anhydrous Ammonia (NH3).\n\n\n\nPrevention Program:\n\n    \n\n    Employees are provided with safe operating and maintenance procedures concerning the storage and transfer of Anhydrous Ammonia. They are then tested to ensure competence and safe operating procedures.  Refresher training is administered before every application season.  This facility also has hazard review program.\n\n\n\n\n\n5-Year Accident History:\n\n\n\n    Accident history for the previous 5 years is kept on file as required by the RMP program.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response:\n\n\n\n    Manning Grain employees are to get up wind of any releases of anhydrous ammonia and contact the authorities (911).  We have contacted and coordinated with our local Fire Department and LEPC regarding emergency situations that may arise.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:\n\n    \n\n    We are currently looking into new classroom training for employees regarding anhydrous ammonia safety training.  Continued maintenance and inspections will work to improve safety at this facility.  \n\n"
