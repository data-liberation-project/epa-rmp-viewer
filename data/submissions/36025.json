The facility maintains an ongoing emergency response program that prepares for safe evacuation and timely response by trained personnel.\n\n2.0  Montco Research Products and Anhydrous Hydrogen Chloride.\n\nMontco Research Products uses hydrogen chloride gas in a reaction/distillation process in order to produce 1-Chloromethylnaphthalene and Ethyl Benzyl Chloride. A maximum quantity of 42,000 lbs. of anhydrous hydrogen chloride is stored on site in two compressed gas tube trailers. Each trailer contains seven tubes with a capacity of 3000 pounds of hydrogen chloride. A Risk Management Plan has been developed as required and is maintained in order to reduce the possibility of an accidental release of hydrogen chloride gas from the system. \n\n3.0  Accidental Release Prevention Program and Prevention Steps.\n\nMontco Research Products is responsible for full compliance with all rules and regulations that pertain to the safe storage and use of anhydrous hydrogen chloride. Specific regulations include: OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) rule; OSHA Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response (HAZWOPER); OSHA Hazard Communication (HAZCOM); OSHA Employee Emergency Plans and Fire Prevention Plans; EPA Risk Management Plans (RMP). \n\nKey elements of the prevention program include:\n\n*     Employee participation\n*     Process safety information\n*     Process hazard analysis\n*     Incident investigation\n*     Standard operating procedures\n*     Mechanical integrity program\n*     Management of change procedures\n*     Pre-startup review\n*     Training program\n*     Contractors safety program\n*     Compliance audits\n*     Hot work permit program\n\nThe following briefly states the be"

      "SummaryText": "nefits of the following prevention program elements: employee evacuation alarms; fire alarm system with pull boxes; two way communication with lead operators; standard operating procedures, mechanical integrity program, employee training and the process hazard analysis.\n\nThe facility staff has developed written standard operating procedures (SOPs) to ensure that operators have clear instructions for safe operation of the hydrogen chloride gas system.  Effective SOPs, when combined with operator training, are instrumental in ensuring safe operation of the system and in preventing accidental releases.\n\nThe purpose of the mechanical integrity program is to ensure the continued integrity of the process equipment.  An effective mechanical integrity program is integral to preventing accidental hydrogen chloride releases that may result from mechanical failure of improperly maintained equipment. The Montco integrity program includes maintenance and inspection procedures and maintenance personnel training.\n\nKnowledgeable well-trained personnel are essential to prevent and mitigate the effects of accidental chemical releases. The Montco facility training program ensures that personnel working on or near the hydrogen chloride system are adequately trained in operation and maintenance procedures, and that appropriate response actions are taken in case of an accidental hydrogen chloride release.\n\nThe process hazard analysis is a valuable risk reduction tool that outlines deficiencies in equipment and procedures, identifies potential system failure modes, and provides recommendations for system and operational improvements.\n\nSpecific prevention steps that have been implemented to increase overall production safety and awareness include: daily inspection of the hydrogen chloride gas system, ongoing operator training, and ongoing emergency response training. \n\n4.0  Five Year Accident History.\n\nThere has been no accidental releases of anhydrous hydrogen chloride at Montco Research "

The program includes ongoing safety training for employees who respond to releases or potential releases. The program includes written procedures for proper first aid and emergency medical treatment to treat human exposures; general and specific responsibilities of the site emergency coordinator and site personnel; incident reporting and emergency equipment on site. The facility emergency response plan is coordinated with the local fire department as required by the Emergency Planning and Community Right to Know Act.\n\n6.0  Planned Changes to Improve Safety at Montco Research Products .\n\nFuture plans to improve anhydrous hydrogen chloride system safety at Montco Research Products include:\n\n*     Annual refresher training for emergency response personnel\n*     On-going operator training\n*     Periodic Process Safety Management Program audits\n*     Improving the security of the gas delivery tubing from the storage trailer to the point of use \n*     Purchasing a NOAA radio to improve response to changes in weather\n*     Arrange with gas supplier to remove tube trailers in the event of hurricane\n*     Implementing additional preventative maintenance and inspection procedures for the system\n       and components\n*     Continuing management of the facility PSM and RMP Program elements."
