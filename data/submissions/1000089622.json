Chemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in safety\t\r\ndata sheets (SDSs). This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known concerns.

This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment.

The Sherrod Compressor Station site has an active safety program covering both employees and contract workers. This program encompasses promotion of safe work practices to prevent personal accidents, and incidents that would adversely affect the community. \r\n\r\nXTO recognizes their commitment to accident prevention through continuing programs including personnel training. Consideration is also given to safety in the design, installation, and operation of natural gas production and gathering systems and modifications to the Site. The safety commitment is also carried forth as evidenced by an aggressive maintenance program. \r\n\r\nReasonable controls have been implemented to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. In the unlikely event that a release does occur, arrangements have been made within the local community to provide response and control of any catastrophic releases. Passive mitigation, such as vents, is present at the site to manage any overpressure conditions that may occur.\r\n\t\r\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES:\t\r\n\r\nThe facility is located off CR 101 From Midkiff, Texas, drive east on FM 2401\u00a0for 6 miles to FM 1357.\u00a0Turn south and drive 8 Miles to Byrd Road.\u00a0 Turn West and drive 3 miles to CR 101.\u00a0Drive South for approximately 0.5-1Mile and the station is on the right in Reagan County Texas. \r\n\r\nInherent with the operation of an oil and gathering and stabilization process, the process stores regulated flammable substances above the threshold quantity.

The procedures address aspects of emergency response by outside experts and include proper first aid and medical\t\r\ntreatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs,and post incident cleanup and any decontamination requirements. Employees receive appropriate training in\t\r\nprocedures necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties which includes contacting trained responders. The emergency response program is updated when necessary based\ton modifications made to Site processes or other facilities within the Site.\t\r\n\r\nThe overall emergency response program for the Site is coordinated with the Reagan Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC). This coordination includes periodic meetings, which include local emergency response officials, and local government officials.

However, there is a system in place to investigate any incident that could result, or could reasonably result in, a\t\r\nfire/explosion, flammable gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal\tinjury. The goal of an investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident. The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to management for resolution. Corrective actions potentially taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations will be tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each finding or recommendation will be documented, and the investigation results reviewed with all\temployees and contractors who could be affected by the findings."
