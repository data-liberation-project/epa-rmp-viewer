As such, the information, procedures, policies, and documentation that make up this program must be made easily accessible and updated as necessary. To accomplish this, Zero Grocery has elected to use PSMWriter, software developed and distributed by Resource Compliance, Inc. This software will assist us with updating, maintaining, scheduling, and tracking RMP/PSM/CalARP related activities. \r\n\r\n1.1 Zero Grocery, Risk and Process Safety Management Program\r\n\r\nThis is to inform all interested persons, including employees, that Zero Grocery has updated/developed their unified RMP/PSM/CalARP Program.

The facility has an ammonia refrigeration system that provides refrigeration capacity to the following:\r\n(3) Cold Storage Rooms\r\n(1) Hallway\r\n(1) Loading Dock\r\n(2) Production Rooms\r\n(1) Water Chiller\r\n\r\n1.2.2 Facility Location\r\n\r\nZero Grocery is located at 1810 Academy Ave. Sanger, CA 93657. The latitude and longitude of the high pressure receiver is 36.690350, -119.552927. The facility is located approximately 3 miles south of state highway 180 in an industrial area surrounded primarily by businesses.\r\nAccording to FEMA Flood Map Service, the facility is located in \"an area of minimal flood hazard\".\r\n\r\nZero Grocery is not located in an Alquist-Priolo Fault Zone as defined by the California Department of Conservation. In addition, a review of United States Geological Survey (USGS) fault maps revealed that there are no faults in close proximity to the site. The USGS 2018 One-Year Model revealed that Zero Grocery has a 1-2% chance of experiencing \"potentially minor-damage\" due to ground shaking in 2018.\r\n\r\n1.2.3 Description of Covered Process\r\n\r\nThe refrigerated areas are either equipped with air-cooling evaporators and accumulators as required for flooded operation or they are supplied from a recirculator as required for pumped overfeed operation.\r\n\r\nMost control valve groups are located on the roof to provide easy access. The refrigeration machinery is contained within or directly above the machinery room."
