      "SummaryText": "GEMENT PROGRAM\nThis is to inform all interested persons, including employees, that Sanger Poultry has prepared a unified Risk & Process Safety Management Program.  The program is in compliance with California's Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program (in California CCR Title 19, Chapter 4.5 Program Level 3 Elements.  At the Federal level, Title 40 CFR Part 68), and California OSHA's \"Process Safety Management (PSM) of Acutely Hazardous Materials\" standard (in California CCR Title 8, Section 5189, \"Process Safety Management of Acutely Hazardous Materials,\" and Federally Title 29 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 1910.119).  This program has been prepared to address the risks involved with the presence of anhydrous ammonia in an amount in excess of 10,000 lbs., which is contained in our refrigeration system. \n\nOur program promotes overall plant, worker, and public safety. The program enables our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of anhydrous ammonia. Overall, the program is designed to prevent accidental fatalities, injuries and illnesses and avoid physical property damage.\n\nOur company has an exemplary safety record, one that we are quite proud of. Our company has many policies and procedures in place to promote overall plant, worker and public safety.  We have: (1) prepared a unified program based on the PSM plan to meet CalARP obligations as well; (2) reorganized the program so that it meshes more closely with general Sanger Poultry business practices; and (3) reviewed plan documentation forms and responsibilities.  The unified Risk & Process Safety Management Plan sets forth rules, procedures, and practices that will help our employees protect themselves and our neighbors.\n\n2. DESCRIPTION OF AMMONIA SYSTEM\nSanger Poultry operates a processing plant and freezer for poultry products.  Our facility has one  ammonia system which holds a charge of 10,000 lbs.

High pressure liquid from our main receiver is piped to each refrigeraiton zone, where it passes through an expansion valve into low temperature & pressure accumulator vessels.  From the accumulators, cold liquid ammonia is circulated through the evaporators.  As heat is absorbed, the liquid ammonia vaporizes to form low temperature & pressure gas which is returned to the accumulator vessel.  The ammonia vapor is returned from the accumulator vessels through a suction return line to our engine room, where it passes through the compressors.  The high pressure discharge from the compressors is sent to a water cooled evaporative condenser where the high pressure gas ammonia is cooled, liquified and returned to our receiver. \n\nThe facility was built by professional refrigeration engineers in accordance with standard design, and installation of ammonia mechanical refrigerating systems.  It was also built in compliance with the Uniform Mechanical Code and Uniform Building Code applicable at the time of construction. The system contains numerous safety devices including sensors which stop the compressors if temperatures or pressures exceed or drop below established limits, and safety relief valves which vent ammonia gas to the atmosphere if the pressure in the system exceeds their set point. \n\nThe ammonia system at our facility consists of vessels which are interconnected, or which are co-located such that a release of ammonia could impact the ability to operate vessels that are not directly connected.  Therefore, we are treating our facility as a single process.\n\n3. AMMONIA RELEASE SCENARIOS\n3.1 Worst Case Scenario\nOur worst case scenario is the failure of our high pressure receiver which can contain up to 7,850 lbs of ammonia.  Following the instructions set forth in EPA's \"Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration (40 CFR Part 68),\" we considered the f"

This vessel is located in the mechanical room, and the release would be passively mitigated.  The ammonia would be released over a ten minute period.  Using the program RMP*Comp we estimate that the ammonia would travel 0.8 miles (urban conditions) before dispersing enough to no longer pose a hazard to the public.  The potentially affected area can be found on a site map in Appendix A.\n\nIn our opinion, it is extremely unlikely that the worst-case scenario will ever take place.  Our receiver meets industry standards for manufacture and quality control of pressure vessels; ammonia is not corrosive in this service; pressure safety relief valves limit the operating pressure in this vessel; and our operators are trained in the safe operation of our system.\n\n3.2\tAlternative Case Scenario\nThe alternative release scenario selected by Sanger Poultry is as follows. A high-pressure safety relief valve lifts abruptly and fails to reseat.  This can occur when the inlet pressure exceeds the valve setting pressure.  The purpose of these valves is to prevent over-pressurization, which can lead to ruptures or pipe bursts.  These valves are designed to open and close with accurate performance, but occasionally the piston or diaphragm set gets caught on debris and causes the valve to stick in the upright (open) position.  The industry rated release rate for our high-pressure safety relief valve is 57.6 lbs/min.   It is assumed that the leak would continue for 10 minutes until the header pipe was switched over to the backup safety relieve valve. Following industry practice Sanger Poultry relief valves are installed in pairs with a switch over valve.  The discharge is piped to a release point that is remote from the faulty valve, so the valve can be serviced or replaced in an area that is free from the hazard of the ammonia release.  The discharge would be released to the atmosphe"

      "SummaryText": "re, and under this scenario approximately 600 lbs. of ammonia would be released over a time period of about 10 minutes.\n\nThe likelihood of this release scenario is decreased by the fact that our relief valves are set at the ASHRAE 15 standard -- 25% above maximum system pressure.  This safety factor provides sufficient spring force on the valve seat to maintain a tight seal and still allow for setting tolerances, external temperature extremes, and other factors that cause settings to vary.  In addition, we visually inspect our relief valves on a regular basis and replace them per the manufacturers recommendations.\n\nThe EPA program RMP*Comp was used to estimate the distance ammonia would travel before dispersing enough to no longer pose a hazard to the public. This program uses approved data for variables such as wind speed/atmospheric stability class, ambient temperature/humidity, height of release, surface roughness, dense or neutrally buoyant gases, and temperature of released substance.  The RMP*Comp program calculated that the ammonia would travel less than 0.1 miles (unmitigated urban conditions) before dispersing enough to no longer pose a hazard to the public. The potentially affected area can be found on a site map in Appendix A.\n\n4. GENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE & AMMONIA SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\nThe ammonia refrigeration systems at the  Sanger Poultry facility are an integral part of the overall business.   The system contains a total charge of approximately 10,000 lbs. It is extremely important that it is maintained and operated in a safe and efficient manner.  Management is committed to making sure that all employees are made aware of the potential danger of an ammonia leak.\n\nOur refrigeration personnel monitor the ammonia refrigeration system/process and keep an active journal of all procedures and transactions that pertain to ammonia.  We inform our employees of the dangers of an accidental release of ammonia in safety meetings.  New employees are made awa"

During these meetings we also discuss preventative measures, such as evacuation, in order to be prepared for a release.\n\nOur ammonia refrigeration system was designed and built by professional refrigeration engineers in accordance with industry standards at the time of construction.  It was also built in compliance with the Uniform Building Code and Uniform Mechanical Code applicable at the time of construction.\n\n5. FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nSanger Poultry has not had any reportable accidents within the last five years.\n\n6. EMERGENCY ACTION PLAN\nThis facility's emergency response program is based on the Cal/OSHA requirements for Emergency Action Plans (in California CCR Title 8, Section 3220, \"Emergency Action Plans.\"  Federally, Title 29 CFR 1910.38 and 1910.119), HAZWOPER (standard (in California CCR Title 8, Section 5192, \"Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response,\" and Title 29 CFR 1910.120). \n\n*****Strategically, we will respond offensively to a release.  Under this plan our ammonia refrigeration personnel will take whatever steps are necessary to bring a release under control. The first priority will be to operate the ammonia system to bring a release under control safely, from a distance, without donning personal protective equipmen (PPE)t. If this proves unsuccessful then furthers steps can be taken including the donning of PPE to bring the release under control.  To better prepare for this type of action, refresher training to the offensive level will be kept up to date. All response activities will also be done in coordination with the local fire department and the Fresno County Fire Department HazMat Team.\n\nEvery year at the beginning of the season we review with our employees our evacuation procedures in the event of an emergency, including an ammonia release. *******\n\n7.\tPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\nOur company has an outstanding safety record, one that we are quite p"

Nevertheless, Sanger Poultry continually strives to improve in all areas, including safety.  Preparation of this Risk & Process Safety Management Program has been the primary recent improvement, and implementation of the program is our plan for improved safety in the near future.\n\nThe Risk & Process Safety Management Program has been written so that program elements are aligned with Sanger Poultry business practices rather than the order presented in the law.  Thus, Safe Operating Procedures are grouped together for the benefit of our system operator.  Safe Operating Policies are grouped together so that appropriate office staff may administer them.  The Emergency Action Plan is now separated out and distributed widely through the plant for easy reference.  \n\nThe Risk & Process Safety Management Program documentation forms and company policy forms pertaining to employee, contractor, and community safety have been carefully reviewed so as to prevent unnecessary complexity and redundancy.  Our operator assisted in the writing of Standard Operating Procedures, and they are presented in a format that is easy to use.  \n\nFor the future, Sanger Poultry now thinks of the Risk & Process Safety Management Program as a \"living document\".  It is an interactive framework that guides safe action for Sanger Poultry employees, but allows for feedback and continual improvement.  Through the Risk & Process Safety Management Program Sanger Poultry will continue to profit while maintaining overall plant, worker and public safety."
