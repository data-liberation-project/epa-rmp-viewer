      "SummaryText": "The Des Moines Water Works accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates technologies, procedures, and management practices. All applicable procedures of the Iowa Department of Natural Resources and the U.S. Environment Protection Agency (EPA) are adhered to. The Des Moines Water Works emergency response policy involves the preparation of a response plan tailored for our facility and to the emergency response services available from the community, and is in compliance with the EPA Emergency Response Plan.\n\nThe Des Moines Water Works Treatment Plant at Maffitt is a relatively facility that went online May 15, 2000. The hazardous substances stored and used on this site allow us to disinfect and purify the water we provide to our customers. The covered process involves a chlorine room, chlorinators, monitoring and detection equipment, instrument panels and additional safety equipment. The amount of chlorine handled inside the room is normally eight one-ton containers. The facility is normally unmanned, and is operated via computer controls from our Fleur Drive treatment plant which has operators present 24 hours per day.\n\nThe offsite consequence analysis includes consideration of two chlorine release scenarios, identified as \u00bfworst case scenario\u00bf and \u00bfalternate scenario\u00bf. The first scenario is defined by the EPA, which states that the \u00bfowner or operator shall assume that the\u00bfmaximum quantity in the largest vessel\u00bfis release over 10 minutes,\u00bf due to an unspecified failure. The alternate scenario is defined as \u00bfmore likely to occur than the worst case scenario\u00bf.\n\nAtmospheric dispersion modeling has to be performed to determine the distance traveled by the chlorine release before its concentration decreases to the \u00bftoxic endpoint\u00bf selected by the EPA of 3 ppm, which is the Emergency Response Planning Guideline Level 2 (ERPG-2). This is defined by the American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA) as the \u00bfmaximum airborne concentration be"

The residential population within a circle with radius corresponding to the toxic endpoint distance has to be defined, \u00bfto estimate the population potentially affected\u00bf.\n\nThe worst case scenario at the Des Moines Water Works Treatment Plant at Maffitt facility involves a failure of one one-ton container for a total loss of 2000 pounds of chlorine. The offsite consequence analysis for this scenario was performed using a model program developed jointly by the American Metropolitan Sewerage Association and the EPA. Using the EPA\u00bfs criteria for a worst case scenario the toxic endpoint is 1.3 miles.\n\nThe alternative release scenario involves the failure of the connections (pigtails) or a valve connected to one container. The amount of chlorine released is 317 pounds over 60 minute duration with a maximum average release rate of 10.5 pounds per minute. The distance to the toxic endpoint is 0.01 miles. The chlorinators are of the vacuum type which reduces the amount of chlorine should a pigtail rupture. This release would occur inside the facility which would activate a scrubber, removing the chlorine gas from the air.\n\nThe Des Moines Water Works accidental release prevention program is based on the following:\n1.\tHigh level of training of the operators.\n2.\tPreventative maintenance program.\n3.\tUse of state-of-the-art process and safety equipment.\n4.\tUse of accurate and effective operating procedures, written with the participation of the operators.\n5.\tPerformance of a hazard review of equipment and procedures.\n6.\tImplementation of an auditing and inspection program.\n\nChemical specific prevention steps include availability of an in-house hazmat team, operators trained in release response, awareness of the hazardous and toxic pr"

The facility has plans to bring the Bloomfield Volunteer Fire Department to the site for an information session. The Des Moines Water Works has also coordinated with the Des Moines Fire Department (DMFD) HazMat team in the past.
