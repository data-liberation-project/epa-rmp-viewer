      "SummaryText": "The Goforth Processing Plant (\"Goforth Plant\" or \"Facility\") utilizes more than the threshold quantity of a \"regulated flammable substance (10,000 pounds)\" in the processing of natural gas, where natural gas liquids (NGL) are extracted from the inlet gas using a propane refrigeration process and treated by an amine unit prior to being delivered to the pipeline for further market distribution. Therefore, this Facility is subject to the Risk Management Plan (RMP) requirements codified in Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations Part 68 (40 CFR 68) administered by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).\r\n\r\nNo public receptors are located within the worst-case release scenario for the Facility; the Facility has not had an accidental release of a regulated substance where exposure to the substance, its reaction products, overpressure generated by an explosion involving the substance, or radiant heat generated by a fire involving the substance led to any off-site death, injury, or response or restoration activities for an exposure of an environmental receptor; and the Facility coordinates emergency response procedures with the local fire department.  Therefore, the Goforth Plant is subject to Program 1 requirements as stated in 40 CFR 68.10. \r\n\r\nThe Goforth Plant employs five (5) full-time employees on-site who will ensure the proper operation and maintenance of the Facility. \r\n\r\nEnLink Midstream Operating, L.P. (EnLink), formerly Crosstex Energy, last submitted a full RMP 5-year update to the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) in January 2013 for the Goforth Plant.  The current RMP includes administrative updates associated with the change from Crosstex Energy to EnLink.   \r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\r\n\r\nThe Goforth Plant maintains a policy of safe NGL extraction operations, reducing to the greatest extent possible hazards associated with the extraction processes, and reducing subsequent risk to the surro"

NGL is a regulated flammable mixture that is an aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbon mixture. The regulated flammable chemicals contained in the NGL mixture include methane, ethane, propane, isobutane, N-butane, isopentane, and N-pentane. The maximum inventory of NGL at the Facility at any given time is 12,713 gallons (58,316 lbs).  The largest vessel containing NGL at the Facility is 2,854 gallons (13,090 lbs)\r\n\r\nThe Goforth Plant also utilizes propane, a regulated flammable mixture that contains: propane, ethane, iso-butane, and N-butane, as part of the process. The propane is handled in various aboveground vessels and associated piping and valves. The maximum inventory of propane at the Facility at any given time is 5,842 gallons (26,312 lbs). The largest vessel containing propane at the Facility is 4,228 gallons (19,040 lbs).\r\n\r\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\n\r\nBecause the Facility is regulated under RMP Program Level 1, it is not subject to the RMP Prevention Program required under 40 CFR 68.  However, the Facility is subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) program. The Goforth Plant's PSM Plan is kept on-site as a separate document. \r\n\r\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENTAL HISTORY\r\n\r\nThe Goforth Plant has not had an accidental release of NGL or propane occurred that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on-site, or off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or any environmental impact for the period of five (5) years pr"

However, the Facility does maintain a written Emergency Action Plan (EAP) that provides guidance for emergencies expected at the Facility. In addition, operating procedures and equipment design codes and standards associated with the operations at the Facility are maintained. Furthermore, the Facility has coordinated the emergency response plan with the Benbrook Fire Department, which is also designated as the first responder in the event of NGL or propane release.   \r\n\r\nA site map, MSDSs, and a list of chemicals kept on-site are maintained at the Facility, along with their PSM Plan, which is kept on-site as a separate document.  \r\n\r\nSAFETY IMPROVEMENTS\r\n\r\nMaintenance checks, compliance audits, management of change procedures, and incident investigations will identify changes to improve safety. The Goforth Plant has a continued commitment to update equipment and improve safety pertaining to the covered process when necessary."
