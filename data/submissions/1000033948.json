The storage facility is located approximately 5.5 miles southeast of Putnam, Oklahoma (OK), and approximately 9 miles northwest of Thomas, OK.  The storage facility receives NGL from the Putnam Oswego Facility, which provides gathering system compression for the Putnam Oswego Unit.\n\n\n\nThe Putnam Oswego NGL Storage Facility is equipped with four pressure vessels (aka tanks) for NGL storage. The vessels' maximum operating pressure is 30 psig with a typical operating pressure of approximately 15 pounds per square inch gauge (psIg). There are two longer bullet vessels with dimensions of 8 feet in diameter by 30 feet long. The two shorter bullet NGL vessels have diameter of 8 foot in diameter and 15 feet in length. These larger vessels have a capacity of 10,920 gallons. The vessels have a common manifold with manual valves on the feed to each of the tanks. Normal operation would be to fill into all tanks jointly, unless maintenance or loading was being performed.\n\n\n\nThe vessels will vent back to an adjacent field gas gathering pipeline based on any over pressure within the vessels via back pressure control valve. The pipeline will route the vapor from the top of the vessels back to the field gathering system. With this venting, the normal maximum operating liquid level of the vessels is typically at a 90% level. \n\n\n\nWhiting does not have any employees assigned to the Putnam Oswego NGL Storage Facility.  Routine checks are performed by the field pumpers. The truck loading is conducted as needed, approximately once every three days.  There is an emergency shutoff for the load out pump and loading line manifold for safe pumping to the NGL tank truck. In addition, there are excess flow valves on each bottom loading line at the vessels. There"

Whiting's Corporate Emergency Preparedness and Response Policy involves assessing the hazards and risks of an unplanned incident, developing a plan for managing those hazards and risks, communicating relevant information to employees, contractors, and appropriate agencies, and conducting emergency exercises.\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n\n\nWhiting Oil and Gas Corporation encourages employees to participate in all facets of hazard assessment, hazard elimination, and safe work practices.  An example of employee participation is mandatory attendance of all safety meetings and training sessions.  Employees have access to all accident prevention programs via Whiting's Intranet website.\n\n\n\nWhiting keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the storage and loading at the Satellite 5 site.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters, and specific chemical inventories and equipment designs basis/configuration information.  Chemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs).\n\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nThe Putnam Oswego NGL Storage Facility is a new facility and thus has had no releases from the RMP Covered processes in the previous five years.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\n\n\n\nThe Putnam Oswego employees receive annual safety training that serves to maintain worker and public safety.
