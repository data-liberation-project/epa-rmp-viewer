      "SummaryText": "Heartland Grain Fuels, L.P. is a fuel ethanol plant operating in Aberdeen, SD.  This facility is able to process approximately 3.45 million bushels of grain per year and produces up to 8.9 million gallons of denatured ethanol per year. The facility produces dry and wet distiller?s grain and solubles as a saleable by-product.\n\nCorn is conveyed from an independently owned and operated elevator silo on adjacent property into a weighing and hammer mill system. The hammer mill grinds the grain into flour which is blended with hot water and enzymes to produce a mash.  The mash is pumped to the fermentation process. In the fermentation process, yeast and enzymes are added to the mash to convert the starch to sugars, which are then converted to ethanol and carbon dioxide. The resulting liquid (beer) contains ethanol. After approximately 54 hours, the beer in the fermentation tank(s) is pumped to a beer well.    \n\nIn the distillation process, the beer from the beer well is pumped to the top of the stripper column and is heated. The ethanol vaporizes and is collected in the rectifier, producing approximately 186 proof ethanol (93% ethanol and 7% water). The 186 proof ethanol is superheated and sent to one of two molecular sieve beds where the remaining water is removed to produce 200 proof ethanol (100% ethanol). The 200 proof ethanol is condensed and pumped to outside storage tanks.\n\nThe whole stillage (beer without the ethanol) is centrifuged to produce thin stillage and a solid fraction. The thin stillage is sent to an evaporator where the water is evaporated to produce a syrup containing about 27 to 30 percent solids. The syrup is added with the solid fraction, which is referred to as wet distiller?s grain and solubles. Heartland will sell the wet distillers grain and solubles or transfer it to a dryer. The dryer will dry the wet distiller?s grain and solubles to about 12 percent moisture, which is referred to as dried distillers grain and solubles. \n\nThe 200 proof ethano"

The gasoline used may either be unleaded gasoline or natural gasoline (sometimes referred to as well head gasoline or well head drip gas).  The facility has chosen natural gasoline, due to restrictions on specifications of impurities for fuel ethanol in some states.  Fuel ethanol can be combined with 15% gasoline to make E85 (85% ethanol) for use in Flexible Fuel Vehicles (FFV), or with 90% unleaded gasoline to make E10 (10% ethanol) for use in common automobiles.  Ethanol is added to gasoline as an oxygenation agent to aid in combustion and reduce pollution.  It replaces the current additive, methyl-tert-butyl-ether, which has been found to be a contaminate in ground water in many areas.\n\nThe process of making fuel ethanol at a plant this size does not subject it to the regulations of the Risk Management Plan (RMP).  However, natural gasoline contains carbon chains greater than 5 carbon atoms, making pentane (a hydrocarbon molecule with 5 carbon atoms) a component.  Pentane is listed as a regulated chemical subject to the RMP, and therefore making the storage of natural gasoline for denaturing an RMP covered process.\n\nFor Heartland Grain Fuels, L.P., this RMP is completed only on the natural gasoline storage tank, associated piping, pumps and metering controls.\n\nHeartland Grain Fuels, L.P. (HGFLP) has an active preventive maintenance program that incorporates the inspection of the natural gasoline (denaturant) storage tank and the associated piping and equipment.  In an effort to assure protection of the environment, the denaturant tank is situated in a bermed area to provide secondary containment for the denaturant tank contents in the event of an accidental uncontrolled release.  HGFLP uses the local fire department to respond to emergencies, but also has an emergency action plan.  In the event of a large release of denaturant, the Plan calls for contacting a"

This valve closes in the event of a fire, preventing the tank to drain through a damaged header or ruptured pipe.  The facility also maintains a portable trailer with a fire-fighting foam eductor capable of connecting to a fire hydrant to foam flammable liquid fires.  This trailer has been made available for local fire department use in the event of a community emergency.\n\nHGFLP is instituting Process Safety Management (PSM) as a voluntary program (the facility size does not subject it to the OSHA regulations of PSM).  We believe this is another tool to enhance employee safety programs, protect the environment and continue safe operation of equipment.  As a rule, very few hazardous chemicals are stored on site in a quantity to cause significant problems in a release situation.  HGFLP actively trains employees on chemical use and handling procedures.  \n\nOnly one substance is present at this facility in sufficient quantities to be regulated under the Risk Management Planning regulations.  A single tank of natural gasoline, sometimes called drip gas, stores a maximum capacity of 12,085 gallons.  This tank measures 11 feet in diameter and is 17 feet tall.  During the course of the year, approximately 500,000 thousand gallons are cycled through this tank, or the equivalent of filling the tank just over 41 times.  This tank contents are used to denature ethanol to render it unfit for human consumption.  \n\nHGFLP is subject to and complies with several federal and state regulations.  These regulations govern the storage and use of hazardous chemicals, purity of waste waters, air emissions and product tracking.  The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regulates worker and chemical safety, with provisions of Worker Right-to-know.  "

Waste waters are analyzed before releasing to a surface stream and under a state permit, and discharging to a publicly owned treatment works under a city permit (by agreements with the EPA to enforce the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination Act).  Surface storm water runoff content is monitored to comply with the Clean Water Act regulations, and HGFLP maintains a Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan.  The facility maintains and complies with a Title V air permit under the Clean Air Act Amendments (administered by the State of South Dakota).  In addition to regulations for similar production facilities, the production of ethanol is under the purview of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, which requires the facility to maintain a license and surety bond, and regulations overseen by the Department of Transportation.\n    \nThe fuel ethanol facility in Aberdeen has not experienced any major accident or injuries in the past 5 years in any portion of the plant.  For the process subject to the RMP (the storage of natural gasoline), a valve was discovered to be leaking on November 26, 2004.  At that time, a slow leak was discovered due to a defective valve.  Less than 50 gallons of denaturant had dripped from the line (based on the tank inventory level change during the previous 24 hours) to the concrete pad where trucks connect to fill the tank.  The pad was outside the bermed secondary containment area.  The spill was cleaned up and all appropriate regulatory agencies were notified.
