      "SummaryText": "The Delaware Water Treatment Plant is a municipal water plant that uses chlorine as a disinfectant for the local water supply.  We have developed an emergency plan in conjunction with the County Emergency Management Team in the event of a chlorine release incident.  All the Operators are trained on how to handle and deal with the chlorine feed system and we feel that the likelihood of a chlorine release is relatively small.  The operators have been trained in the use of self contained breathing apparatus and how to handle a small chlorine release if necessary.   It is the policy to call the fire department if they feel that the release is of a magnitude that they cannot or do not wish to handle the chlorine release.\n\nManagement conducts refresher training on a regular basis (usually annually) for the Operators involved in the chlorine process as well as with the local firefighters.\n\nIn the past five years we have not had any accidental releases of chlorine in our treatment process in our plant.  We also have installed chlorine gas monitors in the areas where a release is possible to happen.  These monitors are connected to an audible alarm system so that everybody in the facility is made aware should a chlorine release occur.   The chlorinators work on a vacuum system and if a break or hole in the feed lines occurs, it will cause a break in the vacuum which will automatically shut down the chlorinators.  We feel that this is the best and safest method of feeding the chlorine.\n\nIn the event of a major release the Delaware County Emergency team in conjunction with the local fire departments and police department will be in command of the situation.  The staff here at the plant will be available for information purposes only."
