The Safety-Kleen (Bridgeport) facility is a USEPA and NJDEP Part B permitted hazardous waste incinerator located in southern New Jersey. The facility manages organic waste from a variety of sources, including industry and government. Organic wastes are treated in a rotary kiln/ liquid injection incinerator. The incinerator treats the organic waste to a minimum 99.99% destruction and removal efficiency. All combustion gasses are scrubbed to remove acids, particulate, and metals.\n\nDuring the past two years, Safety-Kleen (Bridgeport), Inc., has participated in discussions regarding the most recent Risk Management Program requirements with state and local officials and community groups. These informative interactions have included educational sessions with local corporations, emergency response personnel, and community activist to discuss the facilities prevention programs, emergency response preparedness, and possible worst-case and alternate-case release scenarios. An open- house information session was held at the Safety-Kleen, Bridgeport facility on May 1, 1999.\n\n1.0  ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION & EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\n1.1 SAFETY POLICIES\n\nEvery Safety-Kleen (Bridgeport) [S-K (BP)] employee is responsible for identifying all safety, health and environmental hazards in their working environment. The primary consideration in every effort is to evaluate the safety, health and environmental aspects, and to take any necessary precautions to avoid any detrimental exposures and/or releases. To accomplish this, we must provide a safe work place, safe equipment, proper materials and the necessary training, and obtain full knowledge and understanding of our safety, health and environmental responsi"

The duration of the release is 10 minutes, until a remote valve is used to shut off the flow. The distance from the source of the plume to its' endpoint is 0.81 miles. In addition to the safeguards, administrative controls, mitigation and management processes identified in section 3.1.1 above, additional safeguards include: \n\n7 Designated hoses for unloading this waste are pressure tested before each use\n7 Placards are placed around and on the tanker to highlight its' presence on site. Also \n  during unloading operations, warning signs are placed at the main gate to alert all \n  personnel travelling through the gate that HF is being unloaded.\n7 A Safety Watch, in full turn out gear, is provided at all times when the Tank \n  Farm Operator is connecting or disconnecting the unloading hose from the Tank \n  Trailer.\n7 Special Teflon gaskets are used for the hose connections and the dome gasket.\n7 Specific training on the processing of HF waste at the Direct Burn Station which   \n  includes the safe operations, inspections, normal shut down, emergency shut down \n  steps, hazard communication, emergency procedures, incident reporting, medical \n  procedures for HF exposures; and other related tasks given to employees.\n7 Additional mitigation capacities include adding calcium hydroxide (a neutralizer)\n  to any contained spill or leak. This will neutralize the liquid which should then be \n  vacuumed and processed as waste water.\n\n3.2.2. ALTERNATE CASE SCENARIOS FOR FLAMMABLE SUBSTANCES\n\n3.2.2.1 Flammable Mixture\n\nThe alternate case scenario for the flammable mixture (contains three regulated flammables: 2-Butene-cis; 1,3-Butadiene and Vinyl Chloride) is a < inch leak in the unloading hose of a tank trailer.

Guidelines have been established for the orderly handling and reporting of emergency situations occurring or foreseeable events developing at S-K(BP).\n\n2.0  STATIONARY SOURCES AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n\n2.1 The Incinerator and Associated Process Feeds into the Incinerator.\nThe following processes are connected by piping to the Incinerator which is made up of the Kiln, Loddby & Afterburner: Phase I Tank Farm, Direct Burn Station, PDP Station, Glove Box and the Drum Pad. The Drum Pad is in close proximity of the Phase I Tank Farm and in the event of a major incident at the Drum Pad, it could have a severe impact on the Tank Farm and therefore is included as part of the incineration process. \n\nIncineration at the S-K(BP) facility is carried out primarily in a rotary kiln. The Kiln is a large cylinder made of steel and lined with heat resistant brick (refractory). The existing kiln, installed in 1988, is 3.6 meters (12 feet) in diameter and approximately 22 feet in length. The Kiln typically operates at temperatures between 1600 deg. F and 2000 deg. F. Solid waste materials, which are generally received in containers such as steel drums, plastic drums, fiber (cardboard) drums and boxes can be placed directly into the kiln. These solid materials are fed into the Kiln via elevator and chute, which drops the materials into the front end of the Kiln.  The Kiln rotates slowly, and is inclined to facilitate movement of material through the kiln. The waste moves from the drop area (front end) to the opposite end (discharge end). By the time the waste reaches the discharge end, all combustible components of the waste have been incinerated, and only ashes, unburnable materials and gases generated by the combustion process remain. The ash falls out of the discharge end of the Kiln, cooled via a water bath, and is collected in a bin. The bins are emptied into trucks, and the material is sent to a secure"

In addition to solid materials, sludge's, liquids and gases for incineration can be fed to the Kiln through a group of burners and lances located at the front end of the Kiln.  The individual units that feed these wastes are described in the following sections.\n\nThe Afterburner is a rectangular chamber attached to the Kiln. Like the Kiln, the Afterburner is lined with refractory.  Gases produced by the burning of waste materials are swept into the Afterburner where they are subjected to temperatures between 2000 F and 2400 F.  The Afterburner is designed to ensure that gases are subjected to these temperatures for at least two (2) seconds (residence time).  The temperatures and residence time ensure that any unburned volatilized organic materials and particles created by the combustion in the Kiln are further combusted, if necessary.  \n\nThe Loddby burner is a device attached to the Afterburner, which allows liquid and gaseous wastes to be injected directly into the Afterburner for incineration. The wastes processed through the Loddby burner are pumped from the storage/blending tanks (Phase I Tank Farm) and/or from Direct Burn Station (described below). \n\nPhase I Tank Farm: Many of the wastes treated at the S-K(BP) facility are received as liquids. Some of the liquids are received in small containers (i.e., drums) while others are received in tank trailers. Most liquids are pumped into one or more of the four tanks for storage prior to incineration. To ensure the safe storage of waste in tanks, all blending/storage tanks are blanketed with nitrogen to prevent an explosive atmosphere in the headspace of the tanks. In addition, all tanks are surrounded by concrete containment to contain leaks, and are equipped with high level alarms and automatic cut-offs to prevent overfilling.

A piping system connects the trailer on the Direct Burn Station to the Loddby or Kiln burners. A sump is built into this area to assure that any spilled or leaked wastes are contained within the area. Incompatible and highly reactive wastes are processed using the direct burn system to ensure they are handled safely, and remain segregated from other waste materials during storage and processing.\n\nThe PDP Station is similar to the Direct Burn Station except that a positive displacement pump is utilized to transfer viscous substances to the Kiln for incineration. A sump is built into this area to assure that any spilled or leaked wastes are contained within the area.\n\nThe container pump station, also known as a Glove Box, is a small plexiglas enclosure located adjacent to the Kiln staging area. Pneumatically operated doorways are opened to allow the placement of containers inside of the enclosure.  After the containers are positioned inside the enclosure, the doors are closed creating a seal, which prevents escape of vapors from the unit. A jet pump is utilized to draw a negative pressure (i.e., vacuum) on the enclosure. The pump discharges all vapors to the Afterburner for incineration instead of releasing them to the atmosphere. Operators access the inside of the enclosure using glove inserts attached to the wall of the enclosure. Observation windows are provided to allow the operator to remove the container top or bung or to open the valve on a gas cylinder to remove the contents. For liquid materials, the operator inserts a hose or wand into the container, and the contents are pumped to the Kiln for incineration.
