This eliminated what was known at the Utilities covered process at the facility as well as the facility's only toxic release scenarios. \r\n\u00bf\tThe facility added a new tower in order to expand capability to produce Polymer Grade Propylene.  This tower reflected a significant change to the PHA but did not impact the release case scenario analysis. \r\n\u00bf\tA re-evaluation of atmospheric storage tank inventory has led the facility to conclude that the Tankage covered process no longer needs to be reported because the 4 storage tanks that made up this covered process do not store NFPA 4 covered chemicals nor do they contain listed flammables.  Additionally, their location outside of the plant fence line eliminates their coverage for interconnectivity and co-location."

This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of our processes. FHR-PA adheres to process safety policies, guidelines, and best practices that have been developed based on company and industry experience over the years. FHR's practice is to implement the controls necessary to prevent releases of regulated substances to the environment. However, if a release does occur, trained FHR personnel will respond, to control and contain the incident.\r\n \r\nPrevention Program \r\nFHR-PA is operating under the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Program.

FHR's management philosophy goals are achieved through the implementation of its Environmental, Health, and Safety Management Systems, by the personal commitments of employees and contractors, and by open communication with employees, customers, neighbors, and regulators.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this Risk Management Plan is to provide information about operations at the facility, programs to prevent accidental chemical releases, emergency response plans in the event of an accidental release, the five-year accident history of the facility, and planned changes to improve safety at the plant. \r\n\r\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances \r\nFHR-PA is an olefins plant located in Port Arthur, Texas. The facility produces 1.4 billion pounds of ethylene and 700 million pounds of propylene, which are both sold into the merchant market pipeline. Ethylene and propylene are basic chemical building blocks of a variety of plastic products. \r\n\r\nThe cyclohexane unit produces approximately 1.8 million barrels of cyclohexane a year which are shipped out by tanker from the facility.  Cyclohexane is used to produce nylon, resins and films. \r\n\r\nThere are two covered processes at FHR-PA- the Light Olefins Unit (LOU) and Cyclohexane Unit. There are approximately 28 EPA RMP regulated substances use at FHR-PA in amounts greater than the threshold quantity.\r\n\r\nThe facility is subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management Standard, 29 CFR 1910.119, and regulated under EPA Risk Management Program 40 CFR Part 68 - Program Level 3 requirements. \r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies \r\nThe accidental"
