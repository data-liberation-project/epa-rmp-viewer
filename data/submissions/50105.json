Our management philosophy goals are achieved by the personal commitment of our employees and contractors, and open communication with our employees, customers, neighbors, and with regulators.  The accidental release prevention and emergency response programs we have at our facilities are part of the high standards we strive for through Responsible Care programs.  Our high standards are achieved by operating and maintaining our assets in such a manner that any unpermitted release will be unintentional and acknowledged as unacceptable, by remedying any shortcomings found during regular audits of our facilities, and by reporting promptly to regulators any shortcomings found during the course of our audits as required by law.\n\nOleum is the only toxic substance regulated under the Risk Management Program (RMP) that is present at the Tulsa facility.  There are no RMP-regulated flammable substances at the facility.  The facility is classified as Program Level 3 under the regulation.  The purpose of this Risk Management Plan (RMPlan) is to provide information about our sulfuric acid manufacturing operations at the facility, our programs to prevent accidental chemical releases, our emergency response plans in case an accidental release should occur, our 5 year accident history, and our planned changes to improve safety at the facility.\n\n\nPrevention Program\n\nThe Tulsa facility has been operating under the strict guidelines of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Program since 1998.  Our ongoing analysis of the potential hazards of our process, detailed training of our employees, and constant emphasis on safety have helped u"

      "SummaryText": "s avoid any serious accidents over the last 5 years.  Part of this program has also involved identifying and taking steps to avoid potential accidental chemical releases.  A few examples of the additional prevention features implemented at this facility include:\n\nWe have installed pH alarms to detect low pH wastewater from any potential leakage of the oleum process.\n\nWe have installed level indicators and high level alarms on our oleum storage tanks and vessels.\n\nWe have installed a SO2 monitor on our stacks in order to control the SO2 concentration in the stack gases, thus helping to maintain a permit limit of 4 lbs SO2/Ton of acid produced.  When the SO2 concentration exceeds 200 ppm, an alarm will sound which will enable the operator to take necessary corrective actions. \n\nOur operators visually inspect equipment and take readings every hour.  Our facility is manned continuously on 24-hour basis.\n\nWe have provided several safety interlocks on the sulfuric acid process that will shutdown the process in question when the safety interlocks are activated.\n\nThese safeguards as well as the vigilance of our trained employees will help us operate safely at this facility.\n\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nNo incident caused by a covered RMP process has occurred at the Tulsa facility within the last five years.  Although we take pride in that record, we also place daily emphasis on our prevention and safety programs to ensure this record continues.\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nWe will continue to conduct emergency response preparedness activities and coordinate any emergency response actions necessary for the Tulsa facility with the Berry Hill Fire Department and the Tulsa County Sheriff.  Also involved in emergency response is the Tulsa Area Local Emergency Planning Committee and the facilities Plant Management who is responsible for coordinating all emergency actions.  A specific Emergency Response Plan for the facility is in place and that plan has been coordinated with lo"

Our Emergency Response Program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nDiligent compliance with our RMP Prevention Program forms the framework on which we will continue to improve the level of safety at the Tulsa facility.  Some of the key components of the safety improvements we expect to achieve are as follows:\n\nThe Management of Change provisions ensure that we consider the potential safety and health impacts of any change we make to process chemicals, technology, equipment or procedures.\nThe Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) provisions serve as a tool to ensure continual evaluation of potential hazards, thereby leading to continual improvements in our safety standards.\nThe Mechanical Integrity provisions ensure that process equipment and instrumentation are designed, constructed, installed and maintained to minimize the risk of hazardous releases, thereby serving as an integral part of our safety program.\nInternal and third party compliance audits will ensure we maintain and increase our level of safety protection.\nAn ongoing dialogue with the Tulsa County Emergency Management Director or his designate will ensure a constant state of readiness to respond to any potential emergencies, as well as a means to implement improvements as the need develops.  In this way, we shall bolster our strong commitment to the safety of our workers and the community.\n\nWe encourage all interested citizens or community organizations to contact the Tulsa County Emergency Management Director for the latest information on emergency response for the county.  We plan to diligently integrate our response capabilities and personnel with those of the county on an ongoing basis."
