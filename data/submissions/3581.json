Highway 1611, Business Highway 74, and the Shoe Heel Creek border this facility.  LOF employees approximately 430 people from the surrounding community.\n\nThe LOF Laurinburg facility is subject to 40 CFR Part 68 for ethylene, hydrogen, and silane due to on-site storage quantities that exceed the RMP threshold of 10,000 pounds.  Hydrogen is stored on-site in a tank, while silane and ethylene are delivered to the plant in tube trailers.\n\nThe \"worst-case release scenario\" for flammable compounds is the catastrophic release of 11,000 pounds of hydrogen.  The impact area from this release extends just beyond the plant boundary, over Highway 74 East.  The impact area does not extend to the railroad tracks.  A review of the area indicates that there are no public or environmental receptors within this distance and the facility will be subject to Program Level 1.  \"Worst-case release scenarios\" for ethylene and silane do not result in any off-site impact.  \n\nThe LOF Laurinburg facility has worked to maintain a safe environment for their employees and the surrounding community.  There have been no reportable incidents involving RMP-regulated compounds at the facility.  \n\nThe facility currently maintains emergency response activities in the Hazardous Material Emergency Response Plan (HMERP).  The facility is in the process of preparing an Integrated Contingency Plan (ICP).  Once the development of the ICP is complete, the HMERP will be phased-out and the facility will begin using the ICP.  THE ICP will detail specific actions to be taken in the event of an incident involving ethylene, hydrogen, and/or silane.  The facility has trained its employees on response actions and coordinated response activities with the Scotland County Emergency Coordinator.\n\nDiscussions with the Scotland County Emergency Coordinator indicate"
