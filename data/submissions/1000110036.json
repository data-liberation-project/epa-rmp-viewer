The Pekin Fire Department provides first response for all Facility emergencies. For these reasons, Alto Pekin meets the exceptions listed in 40 CFR 68.90(b) and therefore the Facility is not required to an Emergency Response Program. A site map, SDSs, and a list of chemicals kept on-site are maintained by the Facility. Complete details on the EAP required under the PSM Rules are included in Alto Pekin's PSM/RMP Program.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety \nAlto Pekin completed a Process Hazard Analysis Revalidation in September 2021.

      "SummaryText": "Facility Description\nAlto Pekin, LLC, located at 1300 South 2nd Street Pekin, Illinois, and operates a dry mill & wet mill ethanol facilities to produce ethyl alcohol or fuel ethanol from primarily corn.  As a requirement of the Clean Air Act Amendments 112(r) Accidental Release of Hazardous Air Substances program, Alto Pekin completed a risk management plan (RMP) for any chemical stored on-site that is stored in quantities above the applicable RMP reporting threshold. This information represents a 5-year update to the current facility RMP.\n\nRegulated Substances Handled\nThe Facility produces fuel grade ethanol from corn using both wet mill and dry mill processes. The fuel ethanol production process requires use of a denaturant to render the distilled alcohol unfit for human consumption; denaturant is added to the distilled alcohol at a concentration of approximately 2 percent by volume. Alto Pekin uses natural gasoline as a denaturant, which is a flammable mixture that may contain the following RMP-regulated components: iso-pentane (40%), pentane (57%). Percentages represent the maximum quantity from 4 manufacturer Safety Data Sheets.  The maximum amount of denaturant on-site is estimated to be 788,340 pounds. The denaturant is stored in an above ground tank as a liquid and is introduced to the fuel ethanol in the final stage of production. The denaturant tank is located in the Facility's tank farm area, which includes secondary containment. Alto Pekin has evaluated worst and alternative case scenarios. Emergency response actions for these scenarios have been prepared and implemented. Alto Pekin has coordinated emergency response with the local authorities and conducts drills.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nAlto Pekin is committed to the protection of its employees, the greater community and the environment from hazardous substances used in the ethanol fuel production process, specifically the flammable mixture natural gasoline, which"
