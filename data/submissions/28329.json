      "SummaryText": "INTRODUCTION\n\nThe Hunterstown Power Plant Complex originally included only the combustion turbine (CT) site, which is an 81-megawatt (winter load) electric generating unit comprised of three oil/natural-gas-fired CTs that first went into operation in May of 1971.  The facility was significantly expanded with the addition of the Reliant Energy, LLC Hunterstown Power Project, known as the combined-cycle power plant (HCCPP).  This project is a three-on-one combined-cycle plant, 890 MW nominal rating. The plant has three General Electric PG7251FB combustion-turbine generators, each 180 MW nominal rating, three Alstom triple-pressure heat recovery steam generators (HRSG) each equipped for supplemental firing capability, and one General Electric reheat condensing steam turbine generator, 350-MW nominal rating. \n\nThe facility is located on about 307 acres in Straban Township, Adams County, Pennsylvania, one mile southwest of Hunterstown.  The CT and HCCPP provide electricity to the PJM network. The site and equipment are owned by Reliant Energy Hunterstown LLC (Reliant) of Houston, Texas.\n\n\n1. ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES AT THE STATIONARY SOURCE\n\nReliant Energy?s policy is to comply with all applicable regulatory requirements, including those for accidental release prevention and emergency response.\n\n\n2. THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\na. PRIMARY ACTIVITIES ? This facility is a gas- and oil-fired electric-power generating station.\n\nb. USE OF REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe aqueous ammonia injection system at HCCP is designed to remove NOx from combustion gas by selective catalytic reduction.  This will be accomplished by injecting a 29-percent ammonia solution into the combustion gas before it is passed over a catalyst. \n\nNo other toxic or flammable materials will be stored at the facility in quantities above the regulatory threshold.\n\nc. QUANTITIES HANDLED OR STORED \n\nThe aqueous ammonia system is comprised of one 30,000"

THE WORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO AND THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\na. WORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\nA 30,000-gallon tank is used to store aqueous ammonia.  The WCS assumes that the entire contents of the storage tank are released instantaneously, and the ammonia evaporates over time.  The WCS can include the effects of passive mitigation systems, and for HCCPP this is the use of secondary containment to minimize ammonia liquid spills.  The quantity released is calculated as::\n\n     30,000 gallons * 7.43 lb/gal = 222,911 lb\n\nPer EPA guidance, because the horizontal surface area of the secondary containment system (1,950 ft2) is less than that of the worst-case liquid pool (no secondary containment, one-centimeter deep pool) the rate at which the material is released is calculated as:\n\n     QR  = 1.4 ? LFA ? A\n\nwhere: QR = Release rate (pounds per minute)\n            1.4 = Wind speed factor\n            LFA = Liquid Factor Ambient\n            A = Diked area (square feet)\n\n     1.4 x 0.026 x 1,950 ft2  = 71 lb/minute\n\nTherefore the WCS release duration is:\n\n     222,911 lb / 71 lb/minute x 1 hour/60 minutes = 52 hours\n\nb. ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO \n\nThis scenario assumes that some of the contents (1,000 gallon) of an ammonia tanker truck are spilled due to hose rupture (no secondary containment).  The quantity released in the event is calculated as:\n\n     1,000 gallons / 7.43 gal/ft3 = 134 ft3\n\n     1,000 gallons x 7.43 lb/gal = 7,430 lbs\n\nPer EPA guidance, the horizontal surface area of the spill is that of the worst-case liquid pool (no secondary containment, one-centimeter deep pool).  The pool area is calculated as:\n\n     134 ft3 / 0.033 = 4,051 ft2 (1-cm deep pool)\n\nThe quantity released is thus calculated as:\n\n     QR  = QS ? 1.4 ? LFA ? DF\n\nwhere: QR = Release rate (pounds per minute)\n            QS = Quantity"

DISTANCES TO ENDPOINT ? The offsite consequences of this accidental release were evaluated with a screening computer dispersion model (RMP*Comp, version 1.07).  Offsite consequence analysis of the worst-case scenario must include the following weather conditions: a wind speed of 1.5 m/s (3.4 mph), \"F\" atmospheric stability class, a temperature of 77?F, and relative humidity of 50%.  The more typical meteorological parameters used in analyzing the alternative release scenario include a mean wind speed of 3 m/s (6.7 mph) and \"D\" atmospheric stability.\n\nThe maximum calculated distances to the endpoint using the RMP*Comp model is 0.5 and 0.3 miles for the worst-case and alternate release scenarios, respectively.  This represents the maximum downwind distance that the catastrophic release (under worst-case or alternative weather conditions) could pose a hazard to the public.  There are public receptors in the impact areas for the worst-case scenario, and thus this facility is subject to RMP Program 2.\n\n\n4. GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThere are many safety programs in place at the station to minimize the potential for the accidental releases of ammonia considered by this plan.  For example:\n\n? The ammonia storage tank is a registered pressure vessel that is built to exacting standards.\n\n? Ammonia tank trucks will only be unloaded during daylight hours.\n\n\n5. FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY ? Not applicable; this is a new facility.\n\n\n6. THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM ? In the unlikely event that an accidental re"
