Improvements to heater safety systems\r\n4. Improvements to relief valve protection\r\n5. Improvements to instrumentation systems\r\n6. Improvements to gas detection systems\r\n7. Improvements to operator shelters\r\n \r\nThe Holly Tulsa Refinery is resolved to have a program of continued improvement for safety and risk reduction investments.

The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, post-incident cleanup and decontamination requirements. In addition, the Holly Tulsa Refinery has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment, as well as instructions that address the use of emergency response equipment. Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties. The emergency response program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to refinery processes or other refinery facilities. Affected personnel are trained on the changes to the emergency response program.\r\n\r\nThe overall emergency response program for the Holly Tulsa Refinery is coordinated with the Tulsa County - Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC). This coordination includes periodic meetings of the committee, which includes local emergency officials, local government officials, and industry representatives. The Holly Tulsa Refinery has around the clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., fire departments). This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident. In addition to periodic LEPC meetings, the Holly Tulsa Refinery conducts periodic emergency drills and provides training to the Tulsa Fire Department rookie classes. The Holly Tulsa Refinery"

This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\r\n\r\nThe Holly Tulsa Refinery operates a variety of processes to produce petroleum products (e.g. gasoline, fuel oil, propane, butane, lubricating oils, wax and coke) from raw crude oil. The refinery has the multiple flammable mixtures that include the following RMP-regulated flammables; methane, ethane, propane, propylene, isobutane, butane, butene, isopentane, pentane, 1-pentene, and hydrogen. The refinery does not have any of the listed regulated toxic chemicals above the threshold quantity for reporting. The refinery's process units containing RMP-covered flammable materials are considered a single program 3 covered process.\r\n\r\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM STEPS\r\n\r\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at the Holly Tulsa Refinery.
