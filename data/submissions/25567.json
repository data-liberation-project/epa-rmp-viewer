If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the Morris Fire Department, Grundy County LEPC or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\nThe primary acitivity at the facility, which is located on Lisbon Road is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distgributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient.  The storage and handling system consists of 30,000 gallon storage tank, loading riser, associated plumbing and nurse tanks. Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel and authorized contractors.  \n\nThe maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia that can be stored would be 280,000 pounds, this includes the amount of anhydrous ammonia that could be stored in nurse tanks.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a(storage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maxium quantity released could be 140,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank as limited by design standards.  \n\nThe distance to the endpoint of .14 mg/l for the worst-case scenario is 2.7 miles.\n\nThe alternative release scenario based on the most likely potential incident is a release from a break in the transfer hose.  Emergency shutdowm procedures, which include the closing of tank valves, was the only active mitigation considered to limit the amount of product released.\n\nThe distance to the endpoint of .14 mg/l for the alternative scenario is 0.4 miles.  This release has the possibility of extending beyond the facility boundary.  \n\nThis facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations.  This facility has implemented "

Compliance with these regulations and on-going training of our employees make up our accident release prevention program.\n\nThere has been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that: have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, shelter in place, property damage, or environmental damage.  \n\nThe facility has:  a written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.38; provided state and local authorities the meergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA). In the event of an emergency involving anhydrous ammonia, it is our policy to notify the Morris Fire Department on the Grundy County LEPC and request that they respond to the emergency.  OUr emergency action plans have been coordinated with both the fire department and LEPC.\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to asses the maintenance of sale conditions.  There are no specific safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
