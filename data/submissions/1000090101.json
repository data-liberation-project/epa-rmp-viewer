      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\r\n\r\n1. INTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the 1900s water-borne diseases were a leading cause of death in the United States (U.S.).  Epidemics of typhoid, cholera, dysentery and other water-borne diseases occurred.  After chlorine's introduction into public water supplies, deaths from typhoid in the U.S. dropped dramatically from 25,000 in 1900 to less than 20 in 1960.  Water-borne disease is even still a leading cause of infant mortality in many countries throughout Asia, Africa, and Latin America where infant mortality rates are 10 to 20 times greater than in the U.S.  In the U.S., however, water-borne disease has been virtually eliminated due to an effective public health strategy of utilizing chlorine for drinking water disinfection.  Chlorine disinfection is arguably one of the greatest achievements for public health worldwide in the last hundred years and is credited with increasing the life expectancy of Americans by more than 50 percent.\r\n\r\nThe use of chlorine is not risk free, however.  Historically it is clear that utilities have recognized the risks and have been successful in developing procedures to handle chlorine safely and to protect the off-site public and the environment from potential accidental releases.\r\n\r\nAs an added layer of protection, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) promulgated the Risk Management Program (RMP) rule in volume 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) part 68.  The goal of these regulations is to reduce the risk to employees, the public, and the environment by preventing the accidental release of hazardous chemicals.  The City of Homestead Harris Field Water Treatment Plant (WTP) is regulated because it stores chlorine above the threshold quantity defined in these regulations. The Harris Field WTP includes a chlorine system located at Well No. 5 (referred to as the Tennessee Road Pump Station) and a chlorine system at Well No. 6 (located near the water storage tower). Well Nos. 5 and 6 are"

EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM SUMMARY\r\n\r\nA comprehensive emergency response program has been prepared which outlines the procedures and lines of communication that are necessary to effectively respond to and mitigate a potential chlorine gas release.  The City of Homestead Public Works and Engineering Department personnel do not have the specialized equipment or training to respond to a major release. Therefore, this program focuses on procedures to identify chemical releases, safely evacuate plant personnel, and notify the local emergency responders (fire, police, and hazardous materials [HAZMAT] team) who are responsible for implementing the incident command system (ICS) and coordinating all response actions.\r\n\r\nThe Harris Field WTP is equipped with automatic vacuum shutoff regulators which prevent accidental release of gases if vacuum is lost. The facility emergency response program includes procedures for notifying the local HAZMAT teams of the incident and procedures for evacuating the facility.  There are local HAZMAT teams in Miami-Dade County that can respond to and mitigate a chlorine leak. Facility staff have coordinated with the local HAZMAT team and Fire Department to ensure that they are fully trained and equipped to quickly respond to an incident.\r\n\r\n16. PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\n\r\nNo changes to the existing safety systems were identified in the September 2020 PHA."

Although Florida public sector employees are not covered by federal OSHA regulations, Miami-Dade County Administrative Order 7-14 requires compliance with OSHA regulations. \r\n\r\nThe Harris Field WTP has always understood the risks associated with chlorine and has maintained a well-trained staff and a safely operated and maintained facility.  The Harris Field WTP's track record is exemplary with respect to handling hazardous chemicals.  Furthermore, the Harris Field WTP has taken a comprehensive approach to be in full compliance with the RMP and PSMP regulations.\r\n\r\nThe key element of complying with the RMP and PSMP rules is development of policies, operating procedures, maintenance programs, and emergency response program to ensure the safety of employees and the public.  The City of Homestead is committed to providing a safe and healthy work environment to its employees and protecting the public, on-site and off-site property, and the environment from releases of chlorine.
