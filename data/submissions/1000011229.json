      "SummaryText": "The McKamie Gas Plant is an on-shore natural gas processing facility located on County Road 36, Lafayette County, near Stamps, Arkansas.  The facility was constructed in the early 1940s by the predecessors of Arco and Exxon, and was designed to process sweet and sour natural gas.  Phillips Petroleum acquired the Plant in 1969.  In December 1998, MKP Production Company, L.L.C. (MKP), who owned and operated the facility at that time, and affiliated entities, filed voluntary Chapter 11 petitions under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.  Energy Income Fund, L.P. (EIF), the primary secured creditor of the McKamie Gas Plant assets, filed a Plan of Liquidation with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court to protect EIF's security interest in those assets. Under the plan of liquidation approved by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Longview Gas Company, an EIF affiliate will become the owner of the facility.  The plant was acquired by Macquarie Group, Ltd. in October, 2006 and was operated under the nameMacquarie Longview Acquisitions, LLC.  Bonanza Creek Energy Co.,  LLC became the current owner in April 2008.\n\nThe Plant produces butane liquids, propane liquids, and natural gasoline from gas feed.  Major plant equipment consists of two residual compressor engines, a steam boiler, an emergency flare, two refrigerant compressor engines, one overhead compressor engines, a glycol reconcentrator, a regeneration gas heater, a heat medium heater, a nitrogen rejection unit and an acid gas compressor.\n\nThe Plant is capable of processing up to 10 million standard cubic feet per day (mmscf/d) of natural gas; however, it is only processing 3 to 4 mmscf/d of natural gas at this time.  \n\nThe following is a summary of the facility's risk management program.\n\n\n1. ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\nThe McKamie Gas Plant has had a long-standing commitment to worker protection and public safety, as demonstrated through the accidental release and emergency response programs previously implemented"

It is Bonanza Creek Energy Resources policy to implement reasonable controls to prevent accidental releases of regulated substances, as well as train personnel to respond, control, and mitigate releases, if necessary.   \n\n2. FACILITY AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\nThe McKamie Gas Plant processes gas from the following production fields:\n\n* Low-pressure sour gas and liquids from the McKamie-Patton Unit; and,\n\n* High-pressure sweet gas and liquids from the Dorcheat-Macedonia Field.\n\nLow-pressure sour gas from the McKamie-Patton Unit enters an inlet separator where gas and condensate are separated.  High-pressure sweet gas from the Dorcheat-Macedonia Field enters the high-pressure inlet separator where the gas and condensate are separated.  Condensate from both separators is directed to the condensate stabilization unit where light ends are volatilized.  Condensate from the stabilization unit is blended with liquids from the de-propanizer.  This blend is sent to the de-butanizer where butane is removed and sent to pressurized storage.  The remaining liquids (natural gasoline, pentanes and heavier) are also sent to pressurized storage.\n\nLow-pressure sour gas from the low-pressure inlet separator and the volatilized light ends from the condensate stabilization unit are compressed and combined with the high-pressure sweet gas stream.  This combined stream is sent to the amine contactor where Hydrogen Sulfide (H2S) and Carbon Dioxide (CO2) are removed by the lean amine solution in the contactor.  Acid gas produced during the amine regeneration, consisting mostly of H2S and CO2, is sent to the acid gas compressor, compressed and piped to a nearby injection well.  \n\nThe sweetened natura"

Natural gas encounters a counter-flowing stream of lean TEG in the contactor where water vapor is absorbed from the gas stream.  The dehydrated natural gas exits the contactor and the rich TEG (water laden) is sent to the TEG reboiler for regeneration.  A natural gas fired reboiler heats the rich TEG to approximately 375: F.  This heating produces a gas stream consisting mostly of water and TEG vapor, with entrained Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs).  This gas stream is sent to a reflux condenser where the gas is cooled, allowing the TEG to condense.  The lean TEG is then routed back to the contactor.  The cooled gas stream, now consisting mostly of water vapor and entrained VOCs, exits the reflux condenser vent and is further cooled in a secondary condenser where water and condensable VOCs (mostly benzene, toluene, ethyl benzene and xylene - (BTEX)) are removed and sent to storage.  Vapors from the secondary condenser vent do not vent to the atmosphere, but are recycled back into the process.\n\nThe sweetened, dry natural gas is sent to a mole sieve dehydration unit for additional water vapor removal in preparation for the cryogenic unit.  The only air emissions associated with the mole sieve unit are from the regeneration gas heater used to regenerate the mole sieve beds.  The natural gas stream is next sent to the Joule-Thompson cryogenic unit where ethane and heavier components are extracted from the gas in liquid form, and sent to pressurized storage.  \n\nThe ethane and heavier liquids stream is sent to the de-ethanizer where ethane and lighter components are separated and mixed with the residue gas for compression into the sales pipeline.

In this program, each process was systematically examined to identify potential hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards should it become necessary.  A team of employees and engineers familiar with the operation and maintenance and the engineering specifications of each process evaluated process operations using the HazOp method.  The team identified the potential hazards associated with each process, evaluated the existing accident prevention and mitigation measures for each process, and made recommendations for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures as necessary.  The PHA team findings were forwarded to management for resolution.\n\nImplementation of the mitigation measures identified by the PHA team will be based on the relative risk ranking assigned by the team.  This risk ranking method ensures that potential accident scenarios with the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All management-approved mitigation measures identified by the PHA team will be tracked from start to finish.  The final resolution of each PHA team finding will be documented and retained in the PHA files.\n\nThe PHA team will conduct a hazard analysis review every five years for the life of the process to ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards will not significantly deviate from the original design safety features.

The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment will be appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service, that all construction will be completed in accordance with design specifications, and that all supporting systems will be operationally ready.  The PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves as a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements will be properly implemented.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nThe McKamie Gas Plant has established practices and procedures for maintaining process equipment.  The basic aspects of this program includes employee training, a written process equipment maintenance manual, regularly scheduled inspections and tests of process equipment, the correction of any process equipment deficiencies as needed and within a timely manner, and the application of quality assurance measures in equipment purchases and repairs. Ultrasonic thickness tests of critical equipment, vessels and piping are performed as prescribed by industry standards. Pressure Relief Valves (PRV) in H2S service are tested annually. Other PSV are tested every 3 years. In combination, these practices will form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process. \n\nSafe Work Practices\nThe McKamie Gas Plant has established safe work practices to ensure employee safety during process operation and maintenance activities.

OFF-SITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS RESULTS\nThe EPA-RMP*Comp Model was used to predict the worst-case and alternative release scenarios for flammable and toxic substances present at the McKamie Gas Plant.  \n\nThe off-site consequence analysis for the McKamie Gas Plant was performed for two processes: sulfur recovery and natural gas processing. The sulfur recovery process involves the regulated toxic substance H2S in amounts that exceed the threshold quantity. This means that the worst-case and alternative-case analyses for the toxic substance need to be addressed for H2S. The natural gas process involves regulated flammable substance such as propane, butane, pentane, ethane, natural gasoline, and condensate in amounts that exceed the threshold quantity. This means that the worst-case and alternative-case analyses also need to be addressed for these substances. \n\nThe worst-case scenario for flammable substances is focused on a release consisting of the entire contents of all three pressurized storage tanks located in the same area, and the contents from two storage tanks located on the other side of the facility (a total of five vessels).

This scenario is based on the assumption that the entire quantity of the flammable substance will form a vapor cloud and no liquids will be released due to inadequate pressure.  Therefore, the use of passive mitigation systems, such as storage tank containment dikes, will not be applicable due to the nature of the substance released.  It is predicted that a worst-case release will have an off-site impact.  The end point or point at which the vapor cloud is reduced to 1 psi overpressure is estimated to be at a distance of 0.6 miles from the Plant.  A series of safety devices on the system (e.g. high pressure alarms and pressure relief valves) makes it extremely unlikely that the worst case scenario would occur.\n\nAlternative Case:\n\nThe alternative-case release scenario for flammable substances at the McKamie Gas Plant consists of the rupture of one of the NGL pressurized storage tanks.  This scenario differs from the worst-case scenario in that it is assumed that a smaller volume of NGL is being stored in the tanks (75% of the tank maximum capacity) and that this volume is released to the ground.  It is assumed that the NGL will vaporize due to the absence of adequate pressure and the vapors will ignite in a vapor cloud fire. The end point or point at which the vapor cloud is reduced to the Lower Flammable Limit is estimated to be at a distance of 0.4 miles from the Plant.
