The Facility Policy\r\n\r\nThe owners, management, and employees of Brandt Agronomic Services LLC are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the Auburn Fire Dept., Sanagmon Co. LEPC or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\r\n\r\n2. Stationary Sources and Regulated Substances\r\n\r\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers, farm chemicals and related agricultural products, for sale to the farmer.\r\n\r\nThe maximum quantity of Anhydrous Ammonia stored would be 760000 Lbs in our storage tank(s), to include fixed and nurse tank storage. The maximum quantity handled in the largest tank (1-30,000 gal. ) would be 140,200 pounds of Anhydrous Ammonia.\r\n\r\n3. The Worst-Case Release Scenario and the Alternative Release Scenario.\r\n\r\nWorse-Case:  Not Released\r\n\r\nAlternative Case:  Not Released\r\n\r\n4.
