(Rinchem) is totally committed to safety and the implementation of safe procedures. Its commitment is exemplified by its overall safety policy which states:\n\n\"No job is more important than the health and safety of our employees, our communities and the environment.\"\n\n\n\nThis policy is supported by everyone at Rinchem, but first and foremost by senior management.\n\n\n\n1.2 THE FACILITY AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE HANDLED\n\n\n\nRinchem's Hillsboro Chemical Warehouse at 5650 N.E. Huffman Hillsboro, Oregon, stores chemicals for industry. There is one substance regulated under 40 CFR part 68 - Hydrochloric Acid 37% solution  - that is stored above the threshold quantity at this facility. The Hydrochloric Acid 37% solution  is not involved with any processes at this location other than handling and storage of closed containers.\n\nRinchem is located in an isolated urban industrial setting with very few nearby residential neighbors. The Hillsboro Warehouse was built taking into consideration fire codes, building codes and industry standards for warehouses that store hazardous materials. There are many features designed into the building that help to prevent a liquid release of any of the stored substances to the environment such as secondary containment at the docks and dikes in the rooms where the materials are stored. The materials in the warehouse are segregated by hazard class according to the applicable federal and state regulations.\n\n\n\n1.3 GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nThe three key elements of Rinchem's release prevention program are (1) compliance with federal and state regulations, (2) use of engineering and administrative controls, and (3) dedication to training and safety.\n\nThe areas of compliance include:\n\n- having an OSHA Process Safety Management Plan for Hydroxylamine 8-15% solution at the facility\n\n"

During the unloading the drums and containers are checked for any sign of leakage or damage, if damage is found it's reported to the supervisor or Manager to verify containers is safe for storage. The facility is inspected daily to ensure that all operations are running safely and smoothly and to determine if any of the containers in storage are leaking. It is Rinchem's policy that any time a release is detected, the supervisor is notified and it is cleaned up immediately by properly trained technicians.\n\n\n\nTraining is an essential element of Rinchem's prevention program since an informed and trained workforce can prevent most accidents. The training includes classroom and on-the-job training for all new employees as well as annual reviews of the operating procedures with the employees and supervisors who perform the tasks at the facility.\n\n\n\n1.4 FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere has never been a reportable accident involving Hydrochloric Acid 37% solution at this facility.\n\n\n\n1.5 EMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN\n\n\n\nRinchem has a comprehensive emergency action plan. The plan includes evacuation and notification procedures for the employees of Rinchem and for the public. The facility is included in the written community emergency response plan. Our employees are fully trained to the site BCP emergency action plan in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.38.  Rinchem's technicians and supervisors attend annual emergency action plan refreshers where tabletop drills are"

Facility-wide drills are also performed.\n\n\n\n1.6 PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nRinchem believes that no changes are necessary at this time to address improvement to safety at our facilities. Rinchem's procedures, safety policies, facility design and many other preventative measures are adequate to keep its employees, the community and the environment safe. However, we are committed to continue working our corrective action process to monitor and improve the safety of all operations.\n\n"
