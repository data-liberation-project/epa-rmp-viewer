The WTP is classified as a Program 2 facility. The Borough's Program 2 Prevention Program summarizes the pertinent safety information, hazard review procedures, operating procedures, training requirements, maintenance procedures, compliance audits and incident investigation policies.\r\n\r\nThe facility has standard operating procedures (SOPs) in effect for operation and maintenance of the chlorination system. The Borough has also developed SOPs for changing cylinders, chlorine leak response, preventive maintenance, start-up and shut down of chlorine system, storage, troubleshooting leaks, testing chlorine feed systems and unloading cylinders.\r\n\r\nThe SOPs are readily accessible to the chlorine building. Safety precautions include, checking the chlorine detector before entering the chlorine storage room, use of a face mask and other appropriate personal protective equipment, and testing for leaks with ammonia solution. A chlorine emergency kit B for 1-ton containers is available to contain small leaks and for minor repairs. Appropriate training on the use of the chlorine kits is provided to all employees. Other training plant operators are offered include: confined space entry, right-to-know, first aid and CPR. Documentation of the training events for each employee is maintained in the\r\nemployees' personnel file.\r\n\r\nThe Borough maintains an Emergency Response Plan for the water system based on PA DEP's template for water systems. The Emergency Response Plan provides communication procedures, notification protocols, description of the water system, water source and distribution information, treatment information, assessment of available resources, emergency response procedures, reporting requirements and corrective actions, and coordination efforts of"

      "SummaryText": "The Borough of Chambersburg (Borough) takes pride in observing the required safety precautions in preventing hazards in the workplace, and has an emergency response plan in effect in the event of accidental releases of regulated substances. The emergency response plan is tailored for the water treatment facility owned and operated by the Borough. The Borough employs the latest technology in process controls and monitoring detection systems. Active and passive mitigation systems are designed to minimize the impacts of any accidental releases of regulated substances.\r\n\r\nThe Borough Water Treatment Plant (WTP) provides water service to residential, commercial and industrial users in the Borough of Chambersburg, Greene, Guilford and Hamilton Townships, as well as to the Bear Valley Water Authority through an interconnection, all in Franklin County. The Borough WTP utilizes one (1) chemical at the WTP which is subject to the Chemical Accident Prevention provisions found at 40 CFR Part 68. This toxic substance is chlorine, which has a threshold quantity of 2,500 pounds under Part 68. Chlorine is used for disinfection of the treated drinking water prior to its distribution to customers.\r\n\r\nTypically, there are six (6) one-ton cylinders of chlorine present onsite at any given time, for a combined total quantity of 12,000 pounds, thus making the WTP subject to the RMP reporting requirements. The chlorine cylinders are located in the chlorine room, a room with two (2) means of egress near the entrance to the water treatment plant. The room vents to the outside. Chlorine deliveries are scheduled in advance and an operator is always available to assist with the delivery.\r\n\r\nA remote alarm system is employed to notify employees of any releases of chlorine gas. Safety equipment is located nearby. The facility is manned 16 hours per day from 0700 to 2300 hours, 7 days per week. Gates to the facility are locked when personnel are not present so that the chlorination building is not"
