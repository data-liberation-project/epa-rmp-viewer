This starts with receiving aqueous ammonia in DOT approved tank-trailers and then transferring the product into a 12,500-gallon, carbon steel aboveground storage tank (AST).   Unloading activities are conducted in a coated concrete containment area that will catch any accidental spills. The ASTs are in concrete containment basins that are equipped with high level indicators to help prevent accidental overflow.  All tanks, piping and containment areas are constructed and maintained in accordance with Minnesota Rules (?7151) and/or the requirements set forth in the facility?s Aboveground Storage Tank Permit (if applicable).  \n\n\n\nPrevention continues by having employees trained in proper handling procedures and using unloading checklists. Employees are also equipped with proper equipment to safely store raw materials and manufacture and package additives for customer delivery. \n\n\n\nAdherence to OSHA workplace rules is just another part of our safety program.
