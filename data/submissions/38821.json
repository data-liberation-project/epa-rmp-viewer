Should be accidental release occur, the facility has oriented the local fire department and the local emergency planning committee so they can plan for response to any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\nFacility Information:\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage for sale to farmers. Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a crop productiuon nutrient. The maximum quantity stored would be200,000 pounds in the facility's 3 tanks. The capacities of these tanks are: Tank#1 60,000 Tank#2 60,000 Tank#3 80,000.\n\nWorst-Case release Scenario:\nWould be the release of total contents of the storage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes. The maximum qunatity released would be 80,000 pounds, which represents 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards and company procedures. The distance to the endpont of dispersion based on the model used is .94 miles.\n\nThe alternative-case release scenario is assumed to be a release from the rupture of a 2 inch transfer hose, with 12,000 pounds released over 2 minutes. The distance to the endpoint of dispersion is .56 miles.\n\nThe Accidental Release Program:\nThe facility complies with the Rules and Regulations relating to The Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia and Low Pressure Nitrogen Solutions, Equipment, Containers and Storage Facilities. These regulations administered by the Illinois Dept of Ag are consistent with ANSI K 61.1 and OSHA 29 CFR 1910.111 regarding storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia.\n\nThe Five-year Accident History:\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia for the covered process in the past five years that have caused any de"

Our emergency response action plan has been reviewed with the local fire department and provided to the local emergency planning committees for coordination in the community response planning.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:\nSafety improvements is an on-going process at the facility. Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe practices and operations. There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implentation at this time."
