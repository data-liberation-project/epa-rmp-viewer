      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\n\nMayfield Dairy Farms, Birmingham, Alabama, processes ice cream and frozen desserts.  The facility utilizes anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant to maintain the proper temperature of ice cream and frozen desserts within the facility.  Anhydrous ammonia is an effective refrigerant that has been used for many years by most food processing facilities.  Ammonia is normally a gas at ambient temperatures but is handled as a gas liquified under pressure.  The refrigeration system consists of a high-pressure receiver, evaporators, compressors, piping and valves.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nMayfield Dairy Farms is committed to promoting safety for the plant, its employees, and the surrounding area.  The facility is complying with OSHA's Process Safety Management Standard (PSM), Title 29 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 1910.119 and EPA's Risk Managemnet Program regulation (RMP), Title 40 CFR Part 68.  The purpose of these programs is to ensure that the refrigeration system is operated safely in order to minimize releases in the event that they do occur and to outline appropriate emergency response steps to take in the event of a release.\n\nWorst Case Scenario\n\nEPA's \"Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration\" (November 1998) and the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigerations's (IIAR) Risk Management Guidelines (1998) were the primary documents used to develop the worst case release scenario.  The worst case release is one that is unlikely to occur.  The purpose of the worst case release analysis is to support a dialogue with the communnity on release prevention.  It is a conservative analysis and is not to serve as a reational basis for actual emergency response planning.\n\nThe worst case scenario (as defined by the EPA) is the release of the largest quantity of ammonia from a vessel or process line failure that results in the greatest distance to a toxic endpoint.  The worst case release scenario for"

      "SummaryText": " the refrigeration process is assumed to be a case where the total quantity of ammonia in the largest vessel is released.  The release scenario was performed assuming that the vessel was filled to 100% capacity (the greatest amount that would ever be placed in the vessel).  The vessel, however, is normally filled to 75% capacity.  There were no passive mitigation systems (dikes, berms, drains, sumps, or enclosures) considered in the analysis since the vessel is located outdoors.\n\nThe toxic endpoints used for this scenario must be where the ambient concentration of ammonia is 0.14 mg/L or less.  This endpoint is a concentration below which nearly all individuals could be exposed to for one hour without serious health effects.  Based on Exhibit 4-4 in EPA's guidance, a release from the vessel would result ina situation where public receptors would be within the distance to the toxic endpoint.\n\nAlternative Case Release Scenario\n\nThe alternative case release scenario selected is one in which a pressure relief valve is activated.  EPA's \"Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration\" (November 1998) and the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration's IIAR) Risk Management Guidelines (1998) were the primary documents used to develop the alternative release scenario.  The alternative release scenario is one that is more likely to occur than the worst case scenario.\n\nThe alternative release scenario must meet two criteria:\n1.  Must be more likely to occur than the worst case scenario, and\n2.  Must reach an endpoint off site unless no such criteria exists.\n\nA possible scenario is one in which a pressure relief valve is lifted to relieve a build up of pressure with in the system.  Relief valves are set at a minimum to activate when assumed the release would occur outside, or if inside the building, in close proximity to an open window.  The facility is however equipped with emergency shutdown systems.\n\nThe toxic endpoint used for this scenario must be wher"

Based on EPA's guidance, the alternative release scenario would result in a situation where public receptors would be within the distance to the toxic endpoint.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\nAs a part of its PSM Program, Mayfield Dairy Farms has established numerous programs thatserve to prevent accidental releases of ammonia.  These programs include:\n\n1.  Process Safety Information\n2.  Process Hazard Analysis\n3.  Operating Procedures\n4.  Training\n5.  Mechanical Integrity\n6.  Managemnet of Change\n7.  Pre-Start-up Review\n8.  Compliance Audits\n9.  Incident Investigations\n10.  Employee Participation\n11.  Hot Work Permits\n12.  Contractor Safety\n\nEmergency Response Information\n\nAs a part of the PSM Program, the facility maintains an Emergency Action Plan that was prepared in order to improve responsiveness to an emergency incident and to increase the reliability of actions taken during an incident.  The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evaluations, notification of local emergency response agencies, as well as the public.\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving the ammonia system, it is the policy of the facility to request assistance as necessary by calling 911, which will notify the Homewood Fire Department.  I addition, the Jefferson County LEPC has included Mayfield Dairy Farms in its local emergency response planning.\n\nFive-year Accident History\n\nMayfield Dairy Farms has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last five years.  Due to the strigent release prevention policies of the facility, there has been no accidental releases during this period. \n\nSteps to Improve Safety\n\nSeveral developments and findings have resulted form the implementation of the various elements of our accidental release prevention program.
