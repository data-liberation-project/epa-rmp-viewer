(Ashley) is committed to protecting facility personnel, the public, and the environment from any workplace and accidental release hazards. An appropriate response to releases of Toluene Diisocyanate (TDI) is in the written Risk Management Program. Safety, environmental, and risk management programs will be fully implemented and coordinated with community emergency responders for emergency planning and response efforts. \r\n\r\n(b) Stationary Source and Regulated Substance Handled\r\n\r\nThe Ashley facility produces polyurethane foam for mattresses and sleep products and is located at 108 Lipford Avenue in Verona, MS.  Polyurethane foam is a product made by combining chemicals (i.e., isocyanates, polyols, and additives) that undergo a chemical reaction as they are injected into a mold cavity. One such chemical is Toluene Diisocyanate (TDI) with a threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds which is used as an ingredient in the polyurethane foam manufacturing process. The facility will exceed the threshold quantity when operations begin in approximately late August 2021. After reviewing the facility operations and the RMP regulations, it was determined that the entire facility is considered one process. Based on the facility processes and applicable regulations, it was determined that the facility is subject to Program 2 of the RMP regulations.\r\n\r\n(c) General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information:  Ashley completed a compilation of written process safety information to be used in conducting the process hazard analysis (PHA). The last PHA was conducted on June 12 and 13, 2021, using the process safety information gathered in order to identify and understand the hazards posed by the TDI process.

These written operating procedures are consistent with the process safety information and address steps for each operating phase, operating limitations, safety and health considerations, and safety systems and their functions. These operating procedures are readily accessible to employees who work in or maintain the TDI process. These operating procedures are reviewed as often as necessary to assure that they reflect current operating practice, including changes that result from changes in process chemicals, technology, and equipment, and changes to the facility.
