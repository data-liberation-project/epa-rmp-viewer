As part of this commitment, Domtar has established a system to help ensure safe operation of the hazardous chemical processes at this facility.  One component of this system is a Risk Management Program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at the facility and addresses compliance with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Regulation 40 CFR 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule).  One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit a Risk Management Plan (RM Plan) describing the Risk Management Program for the Nekoosa Mill.  This document is intended to satisfy the RM Plan requirements of the RMP Rule and to provide the public with a description of the Risk Management Program at the facility, with regards to the manufacture, storage, and use of chlorine dioxide at the company's pulp bleaching plant.  This plan has been updated, as of June 2019, to satisfy the five-year update requirement of the RMP rules.\r\n\r\nThe Risk Management Program at the facility consists of four elements:\r\n\r\n1.\tA hazard assessment to help understand (a) the potential off-site consequences of hypothetical accidental releases and (b) accidents that may have occurred during the last five years associated with the use of the substances regulated by the RMP rule (Chlorine Dioxide) - see topic 1.2;\r\n\t\r\n2.\tA prevention program to help maintain and safely operate the processes containing more than the threshold quantity of the regulated substances (covered processes) - see topic 1.4;\r\n\t\r\n3.\tAn emergency response program to help respond to accidental releases of the regulated substances from the covered processes - see topic 1.6; and \r\n\t\r\n4.\tA management system that delineates responsibility for implementing and maintaining the Risk Management Program.\r\n\r\nInformation f"

In fact, the facility has a comprehensive safety program in place establishing many levels of safeguards that are designed to minimize the potential for the release of any hazardous substance and to minimize injuries and damage resulting from the release of a hazardous substance.\r\n\r\nDomtar/Nekoosa minimizes the potential for releases of the hazardous substances used at the facility.  When hazardous substances are used at the facility, the equipment is carefully designed, built, and operated to reduce the likelihood of an accidental release.  Industry and government standards are adhered to in design, construction, and operation of the equipment.\r\n\r\nDomtar/Nekoosa limits damage from a release, if such a release occurs.  The facility trains workers to respond to upset conditions, reducing the consequences of a release if it occurs.  In addition, the facility will be working with the Local Emergency Planning Commission (LEPC) to help ensure that injuries and/or environmental damage will not occur in the event that a release does occur.\r\n\r\nThe safety programs at Domtar/Nekoosa consist of a number of elements, only some of which are required by the RMP Rule.

Domtar/Nekoosa provides response training for upset conditions to facility personnel, designates an emergency response coordinator to oversee response activities, and coordinates response efforts with the local emergency response organizations.\r\n\r\nIn order to effectively implement these policies, the facility has established a management system directed by the General Manager, Nekoosa Mill.\r\n\r\n\r\n1.2\tDescription of Regulated Process / Substance \r\n\r\nDomtar/Nekoosa is a pulp and paper facility primarily involved in the manufacture of bleached paper products.  As part of this manufacturing process, the facility produces and stores chlorine dioxide (ClO2) for the use of bleaching pulp. \r\n\r\nThe ClO2 solution is stored at a concentration of approximately 1.0-1.2% (weight percent ClO2 in water) in two identical storage tanks, each with a capacity of 90,000 gallons.  The unpressurized, aboveground storage tanks are interconnected and equalize with each other.  The storage tanks are located in the bleach plant area of the facility.  ClO2 gas in solution at this concentration will rapidly off-gas at ambient temperatures.  Therefore, the ClO2 solution in the two tanks is stored at a temperature of approximately 40 to 54 degrees Fahrenheit.  A concrete wall, capable of providing containment in the event of a catastrophic spill of solution, surrounds the storage tanks.  Passive mitigation is also available in some circumstances when solution is released inside the ClO2 Plant building, in the form of curbing and an acid sewer drain, and the building itself.  The containment area and sewer could contain the release"

Beginning in 1992, the facility formalized this prevention program for the Chlorine Dioxide Solution System to comply with the 14 elements of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) prevention program.  In 1996, the EPA RMP Rule established that a Program Level 3 prevention program would become a requirement for this process as well.  The facility's Program Level 3 Prevention Program under the RMP Rule is essentially the same as the OSHA PSM Program, except that the program also focuses on protecting the public and the environment.\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t1.4.1 The following sections briefly describe the elements of the Domtar/Nekoosa Program Level 3 Prevention Program that addresses the EPA RMP Rule prevention program requirements for the Chlorine Dioxide Solution System.\r\n\t\r\n\t1.

The quantity of ClO2 stored in each tank, based on a maximum concentration of 12 grams per liter (g/l) (1.2%), is 9,013.6 pounds.  Because each tank will contain ClO2 in an amount greater than the threshold quantity (1,000 lbs), the RMP Rule covers both tanks.\r\n\r\n\r\n1.3\tOff-Site Consequence Analysis\r\n\r\nDomtar/Nekoosa performed an off-site consequence analysis to estimate the potential for an accidental release of regulated substances to affect the public or the environment.  The off-site consequence analysis consists of evaluating both the worst-case release scenario and an alternative release case scenario.  The facility does not expect a worst-case release scenario to ever occur.  An alternative release scenario represents a release that (1) might occur at a facility like Domtar/Nekoosa and, (2) would result in an off-site consequence if the release occurred.  The alternative release scenario will help the Local Emergency Planning Committee improve the community emergency response plan.\r\n\r\nThe main objective of performing the off-site consequence analysis is to determine the distance at which certain effects might occur to the public because of an accidental release (called the   endpoint distance).  At distances less than the endpoint distance, the effects would be greater; at distances greater than the endpoint distance, the effects would be less.\r\n\r\nWhen considering the release of a toxic substance such as chlorine dioxide, most people at the endpoint distance would be able to walk away from the exposure without any long-term health consequences, although some short-term consequences (e.g., strong eye or throat irritation) are likely.\r\n\r\nThe RMP Rule includes specific requirements for the worst-case and alternative release scenarios that must be reported by Domtar/Nekoosa.  These requirements include:\r\n\r\n - One worst-case release scenario fo"

The facility mechanical integrity program also includes:\r\n\t\r\n\t-\tSpecifications for inspection and testing of process equipment;\r\n\t\r\n\t-\tSpecifications for replacement parts and equipment;\r\n\t\r\n\t-\tStandard maintenance procedures for inspecting, testing, and maintaining process equipment;\r\n\t\r\n\t-\tProcedures for safe work practices such as lockout/tag out, hot work and confined space entry;\r\n\t\r\n\t-\tTraining of maintenance personnel; and \r\n\t\r\n\t-\tDocumentation of maintenance activity.\r\n\t\r\n\t9. Hot Work Permit   Domtar/Nekoosa has established a hot work permit program to control spark- or flame- producing activities that could result in fires or explosions in covered processes at the facility.  The facility reviewed OSHA's fire prevention and protection requirements in 29 CFR 1910.252(a) and created a Hot Work Permit form to comply with these requirements.  Personnel who are to perform hot work are required to fill out the Hot Work Permit form.  The supervisor reviews the completed form before work can be initiated.\r\n\t\r\n\t10. Management of Change   The Domtar/Nekoosa management of change program evaluates and approves all proposed changes to chemicals, equipment, and procedures for a covered process to help ensure that the change does not negatively affect safe operations.  Process changes that are determined to be a replacement in kind are allowed without completing a management of change form.  All other changes must be confirmed through the full management of change program to help ensure that inadvertent consequences of the process changes are prevented, safety consequences of the changes are addressed, affected process safety information and operating procedures are updated, and affected employees are notified of the changes.\r\n\t\r\n\t11.

Compliance Audits   Domtar/Nekoosa audits the covered processes to be certain that the facility's prevention program is effectively addressing the safety issues of the operations.  The facility assembles an audit team that includes personnel knowledgeable in the RMP Rule and in the process, and this team evaluates whether the prevention program satisfies the requirements of the RMP Rule, and also whether the prevention program is sufficient to help ensure safe operations of the process.  The results of the audit are documented, recommendations are resolved, and appropriate enhancements to the prevention program are implemented.\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t1.4.3\tChemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\n\t\r\n\tIn addition to the required prevention program elements, Domtar/Nekoosa has implemented safety features specific to the Chlorine Dioxide Solution System.  Chlorine dioxide is produced at the facility and stored as a diluted aqueous solution to avoid the necessity of transporting large quantities of the solution.  Chlorine dioxide is produced in the chlorine dioxide generator and piped to an absorber column, where as high as 12 gram-per-liter strength in solution is absorbed.\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t1.5\tFive-Year Accident History\r\n\t\r\n\tIn the last five years, the facility has not had an accidental release from the covered process that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage.\r\n\t\r\n\t1.6\tEmergency Response Programs\r\n\t\r\n\tDomtar/Nekoosa has established a written Eme"

Process Hazard Analysis   Domtar/Nekoosa performs and periodically updates process hazard analyses (PHAs) of the covered processes to help identify process hazards and generate recommendations that might improve the safe operation of the process.  A team composed of personnel with engineering and process operating experience and a team leader with experience in performing process hazard analyses is assembled to analyze the process.  The facility primarily uses the Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) and/or What If / Checklist techniques to perform this analysis.  The PHA team prepares a written report describing the results of the analysis, including recommendations.  Responsibility for resolving the recommendations is assigned to personnel and, when appropriate, changes to enhance the safety of the process are implemented.\r\n\t\r\n\t4. Operating Procedures"
