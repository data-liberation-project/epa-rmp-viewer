The Facility Policy:  The owners, management, and employees of the East Peoria Wastewater Treatment Plant are\r\n     committed to the prevention of any accidental release of chlorine by utliization of proper equipment, regular inspections,\r\n     maintenance and training of all persons that work with the chemical.  Should an accident occur, the facility has oriented the    \r\n     local file departmetn and local emergency planning committee so they can plan for resopnse to any release and minimize the\r\n     impact of the release to people and the environment.\r\n\r\n2.  Facility Information:  The primary activity at the facility is Wastewater Treatment and in conjunction with this operation,  \r\n     the handling, storage, and use of chlorine for disinfection of wastewater.  Chlorine is received, stored and used for\r\n     wastewater disinfection.  The maximum quantity of store in a facility \"process is 2,500 pounds (2 containers).  One \r\n    container is in use and the other on hand.  The  capacities of the individual storage container are 1,000 pounds each.\r\n\r\n3.  The Worst-case scenario: would be the release of the total contents of a storage container release as a gas over 10\r\n     minutes.  The maximum quanitity released would be 2,000 pounds, which repersents the volume of a single storage\r\n     container.  The distance to the toxic endpoint of dipersion based on the RMP*Comp V!.07 model is 1.3 miles.\r\n\r\n    The alternative case release scenario is assumed to be a release from the rupture of container (or line) with a 0.2\r\n    inch dimater hole, releaseing 2,000 pound over 20 minutes.  The chlorine storage room is enclosed and the model\r\n    includes mitigation by the enclosure.  The distance to the end point of dipersion is 0.2miles.\r\n\r\n4.  The accidental release program:  The facility complies with the Rules and Regulations as set forth under USEPA   \r\n    40CFR 69, EPCRA 302, and IDOL.\r\n\r\n5.  The Five-year accident histo"

The Emergency Response Program:  The facility has a written emergency action plan in accordance with OSHA\r\n     standard 29 CFR 1910.38 and provides state and local authorities the emergency planning and communtiy right-to\r\n     -know information as requried under SARA Title III of EPCRA.  Our emergency response action pland has been reviewed\r\n     with the local fire department and provided to the local emergency planning committee for coordination in the community\r\n     response planning.\r\n\r\n7.  Planned changes to improve safety:  Safety improvements are an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are\r\n     performed to assess the maintenance of safe practives and operations.  There are no additional specific chlorine safety \r\n    recommendations for implementation at this time piping upgrades where completed in 2008."
