Employees working at the bulk storage plant make routine observations prior to and during transfer operations of the anhydrous ammonia from the storage vessel to the nurse tanks. In so doing they are able to detect problems that are readily visible and easily identifiable before they arise. This routine inspection identifies external portions of the system which may be under stress or about to fail. Repairs can be made before they become problematic. Employees are annually trained to recognize hazards associated with storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia. In addition to annual training for employees who have been on the job for a number of years, the company conducts training for new hires. This training includes classroom instruction, on-site training at the plant, and follow-up observation to determine the comprehension and understanding of the new hire. Finally, the company routinely invites local fire department personnel to visit the site. In the event that the local fire department requests assistance in training its employees on anhydrous ammonia the company cooperates fully in their endeavors.",

It is our policy to adhere to applicable Federal, State, and local regulations. If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to immediately notify the Burr Oak Fire Department (via 911 call) and request that it respond to the emergency. Incidental to the notification to the fire department, a call to the Winneshiek County, Iowa Emergency Management Agency and the Iowa Department of Natural Resources will be made. If there is a reportable quantity (RQ) release a call will also be made to the National Emergency Response Center.\n\nWhile we have planned for an emergency it is acknowledged that a real emergency will be unexpected and may very well be much different and cannot be ensured to duplicate what may have been planned. In reality the situation that develops may not happen in the manner in which it was planned. In that event what may have been planned will serve only as a guideline to follow.\n\nThe Emergency Action Plan for this facility describes certain procedures that are intended to minimize hazards associated with human health and the environment from fires, explosions, the sudden and unexpected release of chemicals (i.e., anhydrous ammonia), tornadoes, bomb threats, or other accident or acts of God which might occur on our premises.\n\nThe primary emergency coordinator for Winneshiek Cooperative Association is Travis Holhaus, location manager. His work and 24-hour emergency response telephone numbers are provided in the Registration Section of this document. In addition, the following individuals (with associated work and 24-hour emergency response numbers) are to be contacted in order:\n    \n        Travis Holhaus, location manager\n        WORK:     (563) 735-5427\n                Home:    (563) 735-5799\n        Cell:       (563) 419-5930\n\n    Calvin Spalla, plan"

The anhydrous ammonia that is stored at this facility is distributed to agricultural producers in the surrounding area who utilize the anhydrous ammonia for crop nutrient purposes.\n\nThe system consists of one (1) storage tank with associated piping, valves, liquid pump, and other miscellaneous equipment. From time-to-time throughout the year numerous portable nurse tanks may also be present at the site. The anhydrous ammonia plant is only operated on a seasonal basis (Spring and Fall). Full-time equivalent employee numbers were computed on this basis. At a maximum, the plant operates a total of three months (1/4 of the year). The FTEs for this company locatio9n is fifteen (15).\n\nTHE WORST CASE AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS:\n\nThe worst case scenario is the failure of the largest storage tank when filled to the greatest amount allowed (85% of capacity), resulting in the release of the total volume in a gaseous (hazardous ammonia vapor cloud) form. According to EPAA?s RMP*Comp Program (Version 1.07), the distance to endpoint is 4.4 miles.\n\nThe alternative release scenario involves the transport delivery vehicle pulling away from the intake lines into the storage tank without disconnecting the transfer hoses. The resulting release, according to EPAA?s RMP*Comp Program has a distance to endpoint of 0.1 mile.\n\nThe system is protected from major releases by internal excess flow valves, check valves, relief valves, manual shut-off valves, and remote emergency shut-off valves. The loadout risers used in filling nurse tanks are protected by breakaway couplers designed to immediately stop the flow of ammonia if the line or a hose breaks. All of the main storage tank valves are locked when not in us"

The anhydrous ammonia system is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with ANSI Standard K61.1-1989 with amendments and state law.\nIn addition the company has specific operating procedures in place intended to minimize the potential for an accidental (and potentially catastrophic) release of anhydrous ammonia. Finally, Winneshiek Cooperative Association has extended to the Burr Oak Fire Department the opportunity to visit our aanhydrous ammonia facilities, to participate in mock emergency simulation training, and to avail themselves of specific anhydrous ammonia health hazard information and training provided by the company.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\n\nInnovative Ag Services Co. has never had an accident involving anhydrous ammonia that caused death, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations or sheltering-in-place. The exception to this statement is an incident that occured on 4/12/2004 in which an employee at this plant was injured when asmall release of anhydrous ammonia came in contact with a portion of his body.\n\nTHE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM:\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving anhydrous ammonia, it is the policy of Winneshiek Cooperative Association to immediately notify the Burr Oak Fire Department and the Winneshiek County Emergency Management  Agency to request that they respond to the emergency. In the unlikely event that the Burr Oak Fire Department is unable to adequately respond to the emergency, the fire department(s) with whom Burr Oak Fire Department has mutual aid agreements will be summoned.
