      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\nIt is the policy of the City of Bryan, Texas, to operate safe water and wastewater treatment facilities, reducing to the greatest extent possible any hazards associated with our processes, and reducing any subsequent risk to the surrounding community, our employees, and the environment. It is also our policy to work with the surrounding community and local emergency response agencies, and promote a spirit of cooperation and teamwork, to orchestrate an effective contingency plan in the unlikely event that a process incident occurs at one of our plants.\nPrimary Activity\nThe primary activity at the Burton Creek Wastewater Treatment Plant is Municipal Wastewater Treatment.\nUse of Regulated Substances\nChlorine is used primarily as a disinfectant to kill pathogens prior to discharge of treated water.\nSulfur Dioxide is used in the dechlorination process to remove residual chlorine from the treated water prior to discharge to the local creek.\nQuantities Handled or Stored\nChlorine: 12,000 pounds\nSulfur Dioxide: 12,000 pounds\nWorst-Case Release Scenario\nThe EPA-defined worst case scenario is a failure of a 2,000-pound container full of chlorine. The 10-minute release is mitigated by a factor of 0.55 because a building encloses the process.  This is the equivalent of 1,100 pounds of chlorine being released. Under worst case weather, chlorine could travel 1.55 miles before dispersing enough to no longer pose a hazard to the public.  In the case of a sulfur dioxide leak, the EPA-defined worst case scenario is a failure of a 2,000-pound container full of sulfur dioxide.  The 10-minute release is mitigated by a factor of 0.55 because the process is sheltered by a building.  Under worst case weather, sulfur dioxide could travel 1.85 miles before dispersing enough to no longer pose a hazard to the public.\nAlternative Release Scenarios (ARS)\nA more conceivable chlorine release, although still remote, is a failure of a flexible connection at the ton containers.

      "SummaryText": "release would be mitigated by an enclosure, resulting in a release rate of 5.8 pounds per minute and a distance from the Plant of 0.26 miles. However, the plant policy is to replace the flexible connections at prescribed intervals.  A more conceivable sulfur dioxide release, although still remote, is also a failure of a flexible connection at the ton containers.  The release would be mitigated by an enclosure, resulting in a release rate of 5.8 pounds per minute, and an offsite distance of 0.31 miles.  This is about the most realistic release that would ever be expected to occur.  However, the plant policy is to replace the flexible connections quarterly, four times more frequent than the manufacturer\u00bfs recommendations.\nAccidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nBurton Creek WWTP is in compliance with the RMP Rule, 40 CFR 68. Burton Creek WWTP has conducted a comprehensive review of all systems, as well as administrative, technical, operating and maintenance procedures, in addition to the other required program elements of the Rule. As a result of a Hazard Review at this plant, recommendations were developed to install or upgrade some safety items. \nFive Year Accident History\nBurton Creek WWTP has never had a significant release of a hazardous substance as defined by this Rule.\nEmergency Response Program\nThis facility has an Emergency Response Program that is coordinated with the community plan.\nProgram Modifications & Planned Changes to Improve Safety\nThe following recommendations were made as a result of the Burton Creek WWTP Risk Management Program. Some of the recommendations are currently being implemented. Others are being prioritized and budgeted accordingly.\nBecause Burton Creek WWTP is within close proximity to a moderately populated urban area, the City of Bryan is considering commissioning a study to investigate either emergency scrubbing systems or non-chlorine alternatives to disinfection.  In the meantime, the followin"
