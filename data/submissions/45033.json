Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nSara Lee Foods US Supply Chain (formerly Hillshire Farm & Kahn?s) at Spring Grove Avenue, in Cincinnati, Ohio complies with EPA?s Accidental Release Prevention Program Rule (40 CFR Part 68), OSHA?s Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard (29 CFR 1910.119) and OSHA Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response (HAZWOPER) rules (29 CFR 1910.120).  The enclosed Risk Management Plan addresses the requirements of 40 CFR Part 68 as they relate to the storage, handling, and processing of a highly hazardous chemical, ammonia.  Through our compliance with Part 68 and 29 CFR 1910, we promote overall plant, worker, and community safety.  Our Risk Management Program enables our facility to prevent the occurrence and minimize consequences of significant releases of ammonia, including leaks, spills, fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents. \n\nIn order to reduce the likelihood and severity of accidental chemical releases that may affect on-site workers and off-site populations and environmental receptors, the Company policy is to fully comply with the spirit and the letter of EPA?s Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions rules (40 CFR Part 68).  The Company has developed a formal Risk Management Plan in compliance with 40 CFR Part 68.  All employees are expected to understand their role in developing and implementing the plan and to diligently adhere to its provisions.  The Cincinnati facility?s Risk Management System has clearly defined lines of authority and designation of responsibilities to ensure that the risk management plans are developed, implemented, and revised.  Sara Lee Foods Cincinnati?s safety and risk programs prevent accidents because they focus on the rules, procedures, and practices which govern individual processes, activities, or pieces of equipment.\n\n\n2.

      "SummaryText": " 3241 Spring Grove Avenue, Cincinnati, Ohio, is subject to the requirements of 40 CFR Part 68, the Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions (112?) of the Clean Air Act, due to one on-site process containing a regulated chemical above its threshold quantities.  Anhydrous ammonia, a regulated toxic substance, is present in the facility refrigeration system in a quantity greater than its 10,000 pound threshold as established in the 112? regulations.\n\n Anhydrous ammonia is present as the refrigerant in the plant refrigeration system.   The system consists of high pressure tanks, compressors, piping, pumps, chillers, and associated equipment located at the facility, can contain quantities over the 10,000 pound threshold.  This process is a Program 3 process as defined by the risk management program rule 40 CFR Part 68.\n\n\n3.  Worst-Case and Alternative Case Scenarios\n\nAmmonia\n\nIn accordance with 40 CFR Subpart B, Sara Lee Foods evaluated off-site consequences for releases of anhydrous ammonia.  Both a worst case scenario and an alternate case scenario were developed.\n\n\n4.  Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe Cincinnati facility complies with EPA?s Chemical Accident Prevention Provision rules and OSHA safety rules under 29 CFR 1910 for ammonia.  All elements of the accidental release prevention requirements under Part 68 have been developed and implemented for ammonia at the Cincinnati facility.\n\n The ammonia refrigeration system was designed and constructed in accordance with ANSI/IIAR 2-1992 Standard for Equipment, Design, and Installation of Ammonia Mechanical Refrigerating Systems.  A process hazard review was conducted for ammonia  using a ?What-If Checklist? and all identified problems were addressed.  Written operating procedures associated with all facets of ammonia storage, handling, and transfer are in place.  All persons working with ammonia or ammonia containing equipment have been trained on operating procedures and understand the consequences of deviati"

Five-year Accident History\n\nAn accidental release of Ammonia occurred on January 20, 2006, in which 263 lbs of ammonia was released to the atmosphere.  One individual (off site)  received medical treatment due to this incident.\n\n\n6.  Emergency Response Program\n\nThe emergency response program at the Cincinnati facility is based on the OSHA requirements for Emergency Action Plans (29 CFR 1910.38 and 1910.119) and HAZWOPER (29 CFR 1910.120).  We have trained employees for emergency response and maintain a written emergency response plan. The plan is coordinated with the Hamilton County (Ohio) Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC), the Cincinnati Fire Division and the Greater Cincinnati Hazardous Materials Unit (GCHMU).  The Sara Lee Foods Cincinnati response team trains and drills quarterly. The emergency response plan includes procedures for notification of the fire department who in turn would notify any potentially affected neighbors.\n\n7.  Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nAs part of the Sara Lee Foods continuous efforts to improve safety of the system, continual evaluation of the current system is ongoing to prevent anhydrous ammonia releases.  Evaluation of existing equipment is evaluated and will be replaced as necessary at the facility."
