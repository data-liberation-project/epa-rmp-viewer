An RMP for the facility was originally filed on June 18, 1999, and has been resubmitted once on June 16, 2004. Therefore, Western Refining Southwest, Inc. (Western) has updated Bloomfield RefineryA?s RMP and is resubmitting by the specified date.   \n\nThis document includes all of the RMP elements required by 40 CFR 68. The RMP is not a single document. It is composed of the facilityA?s Process Safety Management (PSM) program, the emergency response plan, an analysis and evaluation of offsite consequences of an accidental release, and other related environmental and health and safety documents and programs. This executive summary presents an overview of the plan and describes briefly the key elements of the RMP.\n\nBloomfield Refinery consists of a number of interrelated activities and processes, some of which meet the RMP or PSM definition of A?processA?. The individual processes within the facility are roughly grouped into three functional areas, physically separated from one another. The individual processes within the physical areas were considered here as a single process for purposes of determining RMP applicability. This is a very safety-oriented interpretation of the regulation, fully compliant with its spirit, as it results in the largest possible volume of each potential RMP substance being evaluated. It is also physically realistic, as a release occurring at one of the physical areas is likely to affect the other areas.\n\nTwo of these processes involve more than the threshold quantities of RMP-regulated substances, propane and butane, and are therefore RMP processes. No accidental releases have occurred within the last five years involving these substances or processes. \n\nSince the RMP processes involve both propane and butane, each of the two processes is considered a single process involving propane and butane, rather than as "

This is a safe and reasonable assumption.\n\nMost elements of the PSM and RMP programs at Western are applied facility-wide rather than in a limited sense to only the PSM and RMP processes. Hazard information and analyses, training, operating and work practices, etc. apply to the entire facility, not just the PSM and RMP-affected portions. For example, an event triggering a modification to the management of change procedures which occurred at a non-RMP process affects the procedures as they apply to the RMP processes, even though the event did not occur at the RMP processes.\n\nThe following discussion summarizes each element of the RMP at Western.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\nWestern is committed to employee, public and environmental safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our facility. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. In the unlikely event that a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.  \nSOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES \nThe facility is located near Bloomfield, New Mexico. It operates a variety of processes to produce petroleum products including gasoline, diesel, and other fuels, and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) components including propane and butane from crude oil. RMP-regulated substances present in threshold quantities in refinery processes are propane and butane. The facility also has hydrogen, chlorine, ammonia, and hydrogen sulfide present in process quantities less than the threshold amounts.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM \nThe facility has taken all necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements established at 40 CFR 68.

Because processes at the refinery that are regulated by RMP are also subject to the OSHA PSM standard, this summary addresses each of the PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\n1. Employee Participation\nBloomfield Refinery encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention. Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis team. Employees have access to all information developed as part of the accident prevention program. Specific ways that employees may be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in the PSM plan that is maintained at the facility and addresses each accident prevention program element. \n\nIn addition, the facility has a number of initiatives under way that address process safety and employee safety issues. These initiatives include extensive employee awareness and training programs, rewards for suggestions leading to improvements in safety, and both in-house and third-party safety evaluations.\n\n2. Process Safety Information\nThe facility keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design information. Departments within the refinery are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response and exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs). The facility safety department is assigned the responsibility for keeping the MSDSs current and up to date. In addition, all employees "

This information is distributed such that all employees and contractors have ready access to the information on chemicals that they might handle or otherwise come into contact with.\n\nInformation specific to the technology of the processes is also maintained at the facility. This information includes block flow diagrams, a discussion of the process chemistry, the maximum intended inventory, safe upper and lower operating temperatures, pressures, flows, and chemical compositions, and the consequences of deviations from the limits.\n\nInformation relating to the process equipment is also maintained at the facility. This information includes information about construction materials, piping and instrumentation diagrams, electrical information, relief system design, ventilation system design, safety system design, relevant design codes and specifications, and material and energy balances. \n\nThis information in combination with written procedures and trained personnel provides a basis for inspection and maintenance activities and for evaluating proposed changes to ensure that safety features in the processes are not compromised. \n\n3. Process Hazard Analysis\nAs part of the facilityA?s Process Safety Management (PSM) program, facility activities were evaluated for PSM applicability and process hazard analyses (PHAs) were conducted for PSM processes. The PHAs establish the maximum potential release quantity for each PSM process. \n\nThe facility has a comprehensive program to ensure that hazards associated with the processes are identified and managed. Each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage the hazards. Processes are re-examined periodically to verify the effectiveness of the controls.\n\nProcesses and activities at the facility were identified, grouped according to function and area, and reviewed to establish"

An initial process hazard analysis was then conducted for each of these processes using the Question and Answer, Hazop, and What-if methods. The findings of these analyses were forwarded to appropriate departments for evaluation and resolution.\n\nIn addition, facility processes were re-evaluated by an independent contractor in August 1996 using the Fire and Explosion Risk Analysis (F&EI) method to establish and rank the magnitude of potential accidents. The findings of this PHA were also forwarded through the Safety Management Department for resolution. The findings and resolutions are being tracked and documented to assure completeness. \n\nTo assure that the process controls and hazards do not deviate significantly from the designed safety features the facility periodically updates and revalidates the PHAs at least every 5 years. The updates will be conducted with this frequency until and if the process is no longer operating. The results and findings from the updates are documented and retained. Again, the findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the resolution is documented and retained.\n\n4. Training\nTo complement and implement written procedures Western has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees. New employees receive basic instruction in refinery operations if they are not already familiar with such operations. \n\nEmployees involved in process operations receive specific training in the processes they are assigned to. This training includes emphasis on health hazards, emergency operations, and safe work practices, in addition to the daily routine tasks. The training programs are periodically evaluated to insure that employees have an understanding of current procedures and that they have the necessary skills and knowledge. \n\nProcess operators receive additional refresher training at least every three years, or oftener.

Contractors\nWestern uses contractors to supplement its work force during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities, and for special projects. Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the facility has procedures in place to ensure that contractors perform their work in a safe manner, have the appropriate knowledge and skills, are aware of the hazards in their workplace, understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, and inform refinery personnel of hazards they find during their work. WesternA?s and the contractorsA? obligations under this policy are as follows.\n\nWestern\na. Obtains and evaluates information on contractor safety as part of the selection process.\nb. Informs contractors of known hazards.\nc. Informs contractors of applicable safety rules or work practices.\nd. Explains applicable provisions of the emergency plans.\ne. Maintains a contractor injury and illness log.\nf. Evaluates contractor performance.\n\nContractors\na. Assure that each contract employee is trained in the necessary safe work practices.\nb.

Pre-Startup Safety Reviews\nBefore a process involving hazardous materials is initiated or significantly changed a pre-startup safety review (PSSR) is conducted in accordance with the PSM. The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that construction and equipment is within design specifications; safety operating, and maintenance and emergency procedures are in place and adequate; PHAs have been performed, if appropriate; Management of Change policies and procedures have been followed; and employees have been trained appropriately.\n"

Mechanical Integrity\nWestern has well-established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition. The basic aspects of this program include: conducting training, developing written procedures, performing inspections and tests, correcting identified deficiencies, and applying quality assurance measures. In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process equipment.\n\nMaintenance personnel receive training on an overview of the process, safety and health hazards, applicable maintenance procedures, emergency response plans, and applicable safe work practices to help insure that work is performed in a consistent manner and provide a basis for training. Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended, and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels). If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service (if possible), or plant personnel will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment.\n\nAnother integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance. Western incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs. This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.\n\n8.

Changes are reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change. The management of change system considers (1) the technical basis for the change, (2) the impact of the change on safety and health, (3) necessary modifications to operating procedures, (4) the necessary time period for the change, and (5) what authorization is required for the change. Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures, are updated to incorporate these changes. In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on the change.\n\n10. Incident Investigation\nWestern promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, personal injury, the exposure of employees to serious danger, a fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, leaks or spills, m"

The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident. Investigations commence within 48 hours of the incident. The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to refinery management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings. Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years so that the reports can be reviewed during future PHAs and PHA revalidations.\n\n11. Compliance Audits\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, Western periodically conducts an audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented. Compliance audits are conducted at least every 3 years. Both hourly and management personnel participate as audit team members. The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to refinery management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are retained.\n\n12. Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nThe processes at Bloomfield Refinery have hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation. The accident prevention program summarized previously is applied to all covered processes at Western. Although it is not required, the program 1 processes are included in the accident prevention program as well. Collectively, these preve"

The following types of safety features are used in various processes:\n\nRelease Detection\na. Hydrocarbon detectors with alarms\n\nRelease Containment/Control\na. Process relief valves that discharge to a flare to capture and incinerate episodic releases\nb. Scrubber to neutralize chemical releases\nc. Valves to permit isolation of the process (manual or automated)\nd. Automated shutdown systems for specific process parameters (e.g., high level, high temperature)\ne. Vessel to permit partial removal of the process inventory in the event of a release (e.g., dump tank)\nf. Curbing or diking to contain liquid releases\ng. Redundant equipment and instrumentation (e.g., uninterruptible power supply for process control system, backup firewater pump)\nh. Atmospheric relief devices\n\nRelease Mitigation\na. Fire suppression and extinguishing systems\nb. Deluge system for specific equipment\nc. Trained emergency response personnel\nd. Personal protective equipment (e.g., protective clothing, self-contained breathing apparatus)\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nBloomfield Refinery has an excellent record of accident prevention; there have been no incidents with off-site consequences. We have investigated every incident very carefully to determine ways to prevent similar incidents from occurring. \n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\nWestern maintains a written emergency response program, which is in place to protect workers and public safety as well as the environment. The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally re"

The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first-aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post-incident cleanup and decontamination requirements. In addition, Western has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment, as well as instructions that address the use of emergency response equipment. Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties. The emergency response program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to refinery processes or other refinery facilities. The emergency response program changes are administered through the management of change process, which includes information and/or training affected personnel in the changes. \n\nThe overall emergency response program for the Bloomfield refinery is coordinated with the San Juan County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC). This coordination includes periodic meetings of the committee, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials, and industry representatives. Western has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., fire department). This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident. In addition to periodic LEPC meetings, Western conducts periodic emergency drills that involve the LEPC and emergency response organizations, and the refinery provides annual refresher training to local emergency responders regarding the hazards of regulated substances in the refinery.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\nWestern resolves all findings from PHAs, some of which result in modifications to the process.
