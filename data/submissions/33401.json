The health and safety of our employees, customers, and communities and\nprevention of pollution are among Sealed Air's primary concerns. Sealed Air is committed to\nproviding safe working conditions for our employees, to promoting the safe design, use and\nhandling of Sealed Air products and to complying with laws relating to the protection of the\nenvironment. Each employee is expected to promote these goals in his or her tasks. We also work\ntoward safety and environmental excellence as an integral part of our World Class Manufacturing\nprogram.\n\nEach Division General Manager has ultimate responsibility for the administration of EHS\nprograms and regulatory compliance; however, compliance with this Policy is the responsibility\nof every Sealed Air employee.\n\nThe plant has a multi-faceted safety programs that support public health, safety and\nenvironmental issues.

One of the cornerstone programs for flammable materials is the Process\nSafety Management program.\n\nYour facility and the regulated substances handled\n\n\n\nOverview of Process\n\nThe Sealed Air Corporation Scotia facility manufactures polyethylene foam products used as\npackaging or recreational material. The foam is polyethylene material with bubbles encased\nwithin sheets, or blocks. These bubbles within the foam are called cells.\n\nPolyethylene foam sheets, planks, rounds, etc. are produced using an extruder. The extruder\nperforms three distinct functions: melts and plasticizes the polyethylene (polymer), disperses and\nmixes the"

The blowing agent is pumped into the\nextruder under pressure.. Once the polyethylene / blowing agent mixture leaves the die, and the\nmixture is no longer under pressure, the blowing agent vaporizes and begins to expand the\nmaterial into foam.\n\n\nOverview of Blowing Agent System\n\nThe blowing agents are stored in approved pressure vessels as non-odorized liquid petroleum\nunder pressure (under 150 psi). The liquid is pumped at low pressure to the plant's high pressure\npumps. A metering station regulates and controls the flow of the blowing agent into the injection\nport of the extruder.\nThe facility has two blowing agent tanks rated for 250 psi (30,000-gallons and 3900 gallons.).\n\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps\n\nThe plant has a multi-faceted safety program that supports health, safety, and environmental\nissues. One of the more in-depth programs is Process Safety Management of highly hazardous\nchemicals that was promulgated by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration of the\nUnited States Department of Labor (29 CFR 1910.119). The purpose of this requirement is to\nprevent or minimize the consequences of catastrophic releases of toxic, reactive, flammable, or\nexplosive chemicals.\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps\ninclude mitigation, prevention and abatement procedures. These include:\n\nA. Employee education and training:\na)All employees receive initial and yearly refresher training in our Hazardous         Commutation program, and spill and emergency spill response plans.\nb)The production and maintenance personnel are trained to operate the blowing agent systems under safety procedures outlined in the plant's Process Safety Management program.\n\nB.
