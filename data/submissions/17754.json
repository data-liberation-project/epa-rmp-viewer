It contains a worst case scenario, management's response to a chemical release in the form of a Team Assignment Checklist and a summary of discussion with police  and fire departments.\n\nDetermining the Worst Case Scenario         \nThe worst - case scenario was determined by finding the largest vessel allowed containing the most ammonia. This vessel is also located outside. This vessel is the ammonia receiver located on the south side of the plant.  According to the Plant Engineer, this vessel could contain as much as 10,000 lbs. of ammonia, which is the maximum capacity of the receiver. This amount used as the quantity Q since for the worst - case scenario, the vessel is assumed to be full.  The time of release is 10 minutes. The rate of release, R, is calculated as 10000 lbs. / 10 minutes = 1000 lbs. / minute.\t\n\nQ = 10000 lbs. ammonia\nT= 10 minutes\nR=1000lbs. ammonia / minute    \t\n\nUsing Exhibit 4-4 from the EPA's Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration with a release rate of 1000 lbs / min, the distance to the endpoint is 1.2 miles. This radius and the surrounding area are drawn on the city map of Omaha.  Using information from the Census Bureau, the population  enclosed by a radius of 1.2 miles from the source is 2,370.\t\t\t\n\nContinuation of Executive Summary Management's Response to a Chemical Release Enclosed is a Team Assignment Checklist which assigns responsibilities to members of management in the event of a chemical release.\n\nDiscussion with Local Police and Fire Departments Kathleen Krantz and Ross Ashbacher met with officials from both the Omaha police and fire departments. Topics that were discussed included vapor cloud monitoring, public notification, site, and traffic control, and emergency rescue.\n\nVapor Cloud Monitoring Greater Omaha, the police department, and fire department, will collaborate on vapor cloud monitoring and keep each party informed of its progress."
