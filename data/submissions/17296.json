The District\nalso operates one other stationary source subject to the federal RMP regulations. A separate RMP\nhas been submitted for that facility.\n\nThe purpose of this document is to comply with me risk management planning requirements as\nset forth in Section 25535(d) of ~Article 2 of Chapter 6.95 of the California Health and Safety\nCode (also known as the California Accidental Release Prevention Program - CalARP) and Part\n68 of Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations (40CFR Part 68), also known as the federal\nAccidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs or the federal RMP.\n\nThe scope of the RMP includes all operations conducted at the facility which involve the storage,\nhandling and/or use of chlorine.\nES 1.0 DESCRIPTION OF STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\nHANDLED\n\nThe Crestline Sanitation District was formed on January 21, 1946 to provide sewer service to the\nLake Gregory area of California. The Crestline Sanitation District is the largest enterprise\nSanitation District in San Bernardino County and presently serves over 5200 residential and\ncommercial connections. At present, the District has approximately 90 miles of sewer lines. Raw\nsewage flows via gravity to the Seeley Creek Wastewater Treatment Plant.\n\nThe Seeley Creek Wastewater Treatment Plant has been in operation since 1974. In 1986, the\nplant underwent a modification and expansion. The facility is classified as a secondary treatment\nplant and process units consist of flow equalization, comminution, primary clarification, primary\nsludge holding tank, standard rate trickling filter, secondary clarification and disinfection. As a\npart of the wastewater treatment process, chlorine "

Provided\nbelow, is a brief description of the storage, handling and use of chlorine at the facility.\n\nSTORAGE, HANDLING AND USE OF CHLORINE\n\nChlorine is utilized to disinfect cleaned/treated water prior to discharging (this is also known as\nfinal disinfection of the effluent). Chlorine is a regulated substance subject to the federal RMP\nrequirements. The chlorination process consists of four main components:\n\n          A maximum inventory of 4000 pounds of chlorine (usually as one one ton\ncontainer and several 150 pound\n\ncylinders);\n\n  Fixed and paced rotameters;\n\n  The chlorine injector to control the injection of chlorine and maintain a vacuum on the gaseous\nchlorine system; and\n\n  System piping.\n\nFigure ES-I presents a simplified flow diagram of the process. One ton containers and 150\ncylinders containing liquid chlorine are delivered to the facility via truck. Before the containers\nand/or cylinders are accepted, plant operators inspect the containers/cylinders and valves for any\nsigns of leakage or improper alignment of the valves. Once accepted, the one ton containers are\noff-loaded utilizing the hoist, placed in special cradles, chained to the floor, dated, and the\ncylinder identification numbers are recorded on the chlorine inventory forms maintained in the\nstorage room. The 150 pound cylinders are strapped and safety chained to anchored cradles in the\nwalls of the storage room.\n\nOne ton containers and 150 pound cylinders are connected to the plant chlorination system. The\none ton container is always placed in \"lead\" service while the 150 pound cylinder is placed in\n\"standby\" service. The primary supply of chlorine is via the one ton container. The 150 pound\ncylinder will only supply chlorine to the system if the one ton container runs out.\n\nES-I\n- ~N\n\nChlorine gas travels (under vacuum) from the container, through the container-mounted\nregulator, and into an automatic switchover module. From there the chlorine gas travels "

The fixed rotameter is set manually while the paced rotameter is tied to the\nplant effluent flow meter and increases or decreases with water flow.\n\nChlorine gas then exits the rotameters and enters a hard piped injector. The injector injects\nchlorine gas into the water stream. As a result of having chlorine injected into it, the water\ncontains elevated levels of diluted chlorine. This chlorine solution is then transferred via piping\nto the chlorine contact tank where it is mixed with the water to be treated.\n\nES 2.0 ACCIDENTAL RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nThe RMP regulations require that at least two types of release scenarios be evaluated for their\npotential to impact off-site populations:\n\n  the worst case release; and\n\n  an alternative release (that is more credible).\n\nA number of hypothetical accidental release scenarios were postulated and evaluated for the\nRMP. These scenarios were categorized into worst-case release scenarios and alternative release\nscenarios. Each of these categories of hypothetical accidental release scenarios is discussed\nbelow.\n\nchlorine\nWorst-Case Release Scenario\n\nIn this scenario, one of the one-ton containers of chlorine on site experiences a catastrophic\nfailure due to an unknown external event. This scenario could be initiated by an external event\n(i.e., an airplane, missile or meteorite impacting the chlorine building where the ton containers\nare located). It is highly improbable that this scenario would be initiated by a seismic event.\nHowever, the possibility of this scenario being initiated by a seismic event can not be completely\ndiscarded. This scenario is considered to be extremely unlikely. In the highly unlikely case that\nthis scenario occurs, approximately 2,000-pounds of chlorine would be released. The release of\nchlorine could occur outdoors or indoors. Since the release can occur out-doors (i.e., outside of\nthe ch"

Rather, it was assumed that the chlorine released\nduring the catastrophic accident was released outdoors forming a cloud of chlorine vapor. The\nresulting vapor cloud was assumed to freely migrate off-site. Utilizing the methodology specified\nby USEPA, the estimated vulnerable zone for this accidental release scenario is approximately\n1.3-miles.\n\nFigure ES-2 presents a graphical representation of the vulnerable zones for the worst-case release\nscenario for accidental releases involving chlorine. Table ES-I provides a listing of sensitive\nreceptors located within the vulnerable zone.\n\nAlternative Release Scenarios\n\nAlternative release scenarios which are considered to be more likely to occur are those which\nmay result in the release of anywhere from less than one-pound to up to 10-pounds of chlorine.\nThese scenarios include situations such as delivery of a leaking one-ton container of chlorine to\nthe facility, a pinhole leak in the chlorine transfer piping and a partial or complete failure of the\nchlorine transfer lines (either 100-percent vapor or chlorine dilution water) at various points in\nthe system (either in-doors or out-doors). In order to be conservative in the estimation of the\nvulnerable zone, it was assumed that 10-pounds of chlorine was released during an accident\ninvolving the complete failure of a vapor transfer line from a one ton container. In such a\nsituation, the loss of vacuum from the system would result in the automatic isolation of the one\nton container at the container valve. However, in order to be conservative, it was assumed that\nthe material was released directly outdoors (although the full\n\nES-2\n\nlength of the vapor transfer lines is located indoors.

As a result of this\nhazards analysis a number of recommendations were made to improve the safety of the\noperations conducted. A summary of the recommended actions is provided in Table ES-3.
