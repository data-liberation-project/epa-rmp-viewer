Approximately 76 Engineering Standards are used to support and standardize pipeline system design and construction. Colonial's Engineering Standards are based on regulatory requirements, industry standards, and best practices.

A schedule for completion of action items is published noting each action item, responsible party, and target date for completion.\r\n\r\n3\tOperating Procedures\r\nOperators, supervisors, and other qualified personnel work together to develop, publish and follow operating procedures for each PSM-covered process task.

A PHA is an organized and systematic effort to identify and analyze the significance of potential hazards associated with the processing or handling of highly hazardous chemicals. It provides management and facility personnel with information that will aid in improving safety and reducing the consequences of unplanned spills or releases of hazardous materials. A PHA is directed toward analyzing potential causes and consequences of fires, explosions, releases of toxic or flammable chemicals and major spills of hazardous materials. A PHA focuses on equipment, instrumentation, utilities, human action (routine and non-routine) and external factors that might impact the process. These considerations assist in determining the hazards and potential failure-point or failure modes in a process.\r\n\r\nPHAs are performed using a team approach with at least one member of the team being knowledgeable of the process under review.

The IMP establishes the foundation for assessing, repairing, and maintaining the integrity of Colonial's assets, with the targets of error-free operations, improving asset performance and reliability, ensuring compliance and managing risks, reducing impacts to the environment, and dedication to providing for the safety and security of personnel and the surrounding community. Colonial's IMP provides well-established practices and procedures to maintain the pipeline and related systems such as relief, control systems, emergency shutdown systems, and rotating equipment in safe operating condition.\r\n\r\nThe IMP and related documents meet the written procedures requirements of 1910.119(j)(2) and fully describe the inspection and testing requirements of OSHA mechanical integrity under 29 CFR 1910.119(j)(4). These internal documents also cover the requirements for equipment deficiencies at 1910.119(j)(5) and provide the information needed to address the requirements for quality assurance 1910.119(j)(6).\r\n\r\nAll site personnel who perform inspection, testing and service or repair work on PSM-\r\ncovered equipment are trained on the content of this procedure. Each person performing maintenance activities on critical equipment is trained on the applicable procedure(s). Training is documented in accordance with the Conduct of Operations Manual.\r\n\r\nThe mechanical integrity element of a PSM plan requires a listing of all critical equipment, written procedures, maintenance training documentation, inspection, testing and calibration documentation and quality assurance of construction and maintenance. Equipment critical to operations or identified in the process hazards analysis as a safeguard has been installed at Colonial's Baton Rouge Junction.\r\n\r\nWritten procedures to enable personnel to consistently perform equipment ma"

The procedure applies to all Colonial employees and contract employees working in or near PSM covered areas within Colonial facilities. All Colonial and contractor employees working in or near PSM-covered areas are informed of the provisions of this procedure upon initial assignment. Contractors must have programs that meet the regulatory standards for the activities they perform and will comply with those programs as a minimum.\r\n\r\nIn addition to this written plan, Colonial shall consult with employees and their representatives on the conduct and development of process hazard analyses (PHAs) and on the development of the other elements of PSM; and shall provide to employees and their representatives access to PHAs and to all other information required to be developed under the PSM standard.\r\n\r\nAll Colonial and contractor employees working in or near PSM covered areas are encouraged to participate in the following activities when trained and requested to do so:\r\n1)\tReview and update maintenance and operating procedures;\r\n2)\tServe on PHA teams;\r\n3)\tServe on PSM Incident Investigation teams;\r\n4)\tServe on audit teams;\r\n6)\tParticipate in the review and/or development of PSM related training materials;\r\n7)\tAssist in training new employees; and\r\n8)\tParticipate in Management of Change reviews.\r\n\r\nResults of PHAs, PSM audits, incident investigations and associated open action items are shared with and accessible to all affected employees and contractors. \r\n\r\n11\tCompliance Audits\r\nColonial audits the covered processes to evaluate the effectiveness of the PSM activities and to comply with the requirements of 29 CFR 1910.119(o)(1) which requires a compliance audit at least every three years.

      "SummaryText": "Colonial Pipeline Company (Colonial) Baton Rouge Facility, located near Jackson, Louisiana, has a standing commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, training of highly qualified personnel, and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of our processes.  Colonial policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent chemical releases.  However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will respond to control, contain, and mitigate the release. Industrial Emergency Services and local fire departments will also respond to releases.\r\n\r\nColonial Baton Rouge Facility includes a gasoline blending operation.  The blending operation consists of additional storage capacity and the ability to blend butane and other components into gasoline.  The blending operations utilize butane, naphtha, and/or natural gasoline as blending components.  Butane is sourced via a pipeline connecting to a truck supplied storage facility located near the facility and/or the Transmontaigne barge dock. Naphtha and natural gasoline are sourced via the Transmontaigne barge dock, Colonial Line 01, or the truck supplied storage facility.  Butane is the only chemical maintained on site and listed on the EPA's list of flammable chemicals above EPA's threshold quantity.    Naphtha and natural gasoline, flammable chemical mixtures, are also maintained on site but do not meet the regulatory definition (NFPA) of flammable mixtures and are therefore not subject to RMP.\r\n\r\n\r\n1\tProcess Safety Information\r\nColonial compiles and maintains written information pertaining to chemicals, technology and equipment used in Colonial Process Safety Management (PSM) covered processes to enable assessment of the hazards of those processes. This information is made available to affected employees and applies to all Colonial employees working in or near PSM-covered areas within Colonial facilities. Contractors must"
