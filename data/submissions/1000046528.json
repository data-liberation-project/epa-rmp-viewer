It is the policy of RR to adhere to all applicable federal and state safety and environmental regulations.\n\n\n\nRR refrigeration personnel do respond to ammonia releases less than 300ppm and have received training in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.120, in addition to training specifically for ammonia.  An emergency plan has been developed covering notification to public safety agencies and the public.  An evacuation plan for the plant has also been developed and all employees receive initial hire and yearly refresher training on this plan.\n\n\n\nAt RR anhydrous ammonia is used on-site. Ammonia is considered hazardous by EPA and is listed on the Extremely Hazardous Substance (EHS) list.  Chemical properties of ammonia make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling ammonia in order to:\n\n\n\nPrevent unnecessary human exposure to the EHS\n\nReduce the threat of exposure to our personnel\n\nReduce the threat to the community and the surrounding ecosystem\n\n\n\nB.Facility and Regulated Substance Handled\n\n\n\nRR is a fruit processing and cold storage facility, located approximately one mile south-south east of Royal City, which is located in Grant county and within the state of Washington.\n\n\n\nThe regulated substance used at RR is anhydrous ammonia.  Chemical Abstract Number (CAS) # 7664-41-7.  The substance is used as a refrigerant. There is approximately 17,176 pounds of anhydrous ammonia in the system as of this revision.  \n\n\n\nRR uses other hazardous substances on-site, however they do not meet or exceed the threshold limits established in 40 CFR 68.130.  However, RR believes in the concept set forth in the General Duty Clause of the Clean Air Act.  To this effect, RR plans to established policies, procedure"

The worst case scenario is defined by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), which states that the owner or operator shall assume that the maximum quantity in the largest vessel is released.  The alternative scenario is defined as more likely to occur than the worst case scenario.\n\n\n\nWorst-Case Scenario - Failure of the largest vessel would release 14,461 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.  The release would occur inside the compressor room; its walls are in direct contact with the outside, however the effects of building mitigation were not considered.  \n\n\n\nThe distance to the toxic end-point of 0.14 mg/L is .3 miles.  The risk radius extends past the boundaries of the plant, into public receptor areas. Distance was determined by use of RMP-COMP version 1.07.\n\n\n\nAlternative Release Scenario  Several alternative scenarios were modeled, using ALOHA, version 5.3, however a release from the bottom (liquid space) of the receiver, under normal operating conditions, was chosen.  This alternative scenario provided the greatest risk radius of .2 miles.  There was no building mitigation used for this scenario.  It was, however, assumed that the safeties and computer control would limit the release to the amount in the receiver.\n\n\n\nBoth the worst-case and alternative scenarios are unlikely due to the safeties on the system such as temperature and pressure cutouts, computer controls and pressure relief valves to prevent an over pressure situation.\n\n\n\nA more realistic scenario would be that of a pressure relief valve lifting, discharging ammonia vapor from vents on top of the building, approximately 40 feet above the ground.  In scenarios modeled for this type of an event, the risk"

Piping and equipment is secured and protected; compressor (engine) room doors are tight fitting and open outwards.  Other safety systems RR utilizes include:\n\n\n\nComputerized controls, which can be operated remotely from a company laptop-modem system or from the manufacturers location in Yakima\n\nSuction trap hi-level float\n\nHigh discharge pressure shut down\n\nLow suction pressure shut down\n\nHigh discharge temperature shut down\n\nOil pressure failure shut down\n\nHigh amperes shut down\n\nAutomatic timer to prevent short cycling via computer controls\n\nOil filters plugged shut down\n\n250 psi relief valves on high pressure side, to prevent over pressure situations\n\n150 psi relief valves on low pressure side, to prevent over pressure situations\n\n100 psi liquid relief valves on liquid line, to prevent over pressure situations\n\n75 psi liquid relief valves on liquid line, to prevent over pressure situations\n\nOperating Procedures and checklists have been prepared by RR to be used by employees performing operational functions.

These procedures are part of the ongoing training.\n\n\n\nRR coordinates its response efforts with Grant County Fire District #10, which is the closest fire department.\n\n\n\nPlanned Safety Improvements\n\n\n\nSince the last RMP, RR added 64,000 square feet of freezer and storage area to its initial facility.  This new structure is connected to the computerized monitoring and control systems.  All safety components of this system were incorporated into the construction.  \n\n\n\nAdditionally, a floor heating system was installed as part of the projects freezer room.  Heating the floor keeps the soil below, thawed during the winter and reduces the possibility of frost heave and thus potential damage to the Anhydrous Ammonia (NH3) piping that is anchored to the floor."
