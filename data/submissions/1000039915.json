The City of Salisbury Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP) has developed an Emergency Response Plan which complies with OSHA's 29 CFR 1910.119, Process Safety Management standard and the US EPA's Emergency Response Plan.  The plan provides employees guidance on what to do in case of a chemical discharge emergency.  \n\n\n\n    \n\n\"    In the event of a leak, the Salisbury Fire Department will be contacted to provide Haz - Mat Team response.  The LEPC will be contacted as well. \n\n\"    WWTP Leadership/personnel will act as liaison to the FD Command and Control.  \n\n\"    All other WWTP personnel will be evacuated.   \n\n\n\n2.

As stated previously, training will be brought to up to a proper level, with associated documentation. \n\n\"    Standard Operating Procedures, including transferring and changing cylinders has been formulated and instituted.  \n\n\"    A process safety management and risk management audit was performed by the Wicomico County Emergency services on August 19, 2013.    There have been no reportable accidental releases of chlorine or sulfur dioxide, at the WWTP, since the initial RMP/PSM Plan submittal. \n\n\n\n7.  The following changes to improve safety for ourselves and the community have been accomplished:\n\n\"    A documentation form for cylinder hoist inspection has been instituted.\n\n\"    Replacement of the tank flexible feed lines once per year. The chemical dispensing equipment and chemical distribution lines were replaced with new equipment in the summer of 2012. \n\n\"    A permanent water feed line was installed, serving the Chlorination/Dechlorination Building.\n\n\n\n\"    \n\n8.
