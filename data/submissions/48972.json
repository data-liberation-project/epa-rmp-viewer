(Linn WO) is the owner and operator of the Stearns Gas Plant. It is the policy of Linn WO that its employees, environment, property, and the general public be protected from any off-site impacts that may occur as a result of its operations. To achieve this end, Linn WO strives to operate its facilities in compliance with applicable federal, state, and local safety, health, and environmental regulations. Linn WO has a longstanding commitment to worker and public safety at the Stearns Gas Plant. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention (e.g., training of personnel, considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the facility, etc.). It is Linn WO's philosophy to implement reasonable mitigation measures to eliminate preventable releases of regulated substances as well as other substances.\n\nCompany emergency response policies are implemented to comply with the overall corporate policy of providing its workers with a safe workplace and minimizing risk to the public. This is considered to be of prime importance; therefore, all procedures must be carried out in the appropriate manner. The safety of emergency and non-affected personnel has the highest priority. Only then can safely executed rescue and medical activities be considered. Protection of the environment is another high priority. Only after life, safety, and environmental concerns are addressed will the focus shift to the secondary issues of property conservation and business recovery.\n\n1.2  Facility Description\n\nThe Stearns Gas Plant is located in the unincorporated area of Brea approximately 10 miles northeast of the Pacific Ocean. The plant is bounded by oilfields on the lease and the entrance to these oilfields and the gas plant is at 2000 Tonner Canyon Road, Brea, CA. The entrance is secured with by a locked gate with 24-h"

Public roadways in the area are Tonner Canyon Road to the north, Lambert Road to the south, Valencia Ave to the east, and State Freeway 57 to the west.\n\nGas from the surrounding oilfields is processed at the Stearns Gas Plant. The incoming gas is treated by removing water and other contaminants and then separated from the other heavy hydrocarbon components. The hydrocarbon liquids which are separated out are sent to pressure vessels for storage before being trucked offsite to distributors. The natural gas from the process is dry gas which is sold as a product.\n\n1.3  Regulated Substances\n\nRegulated flammable mixtures containing methane, ethane, propane, butane, iso-butane, pentane and isopentane are present at the facility. There are no regulated toxic substances present at the facility in excess of the federal threshold quantities.\n\n1.4 Summary of Offsite Consequence Analysis Results\n\n1.4.1  Worst-Case Release Scenario - Flammable\n\nThe worst-case release for flammables, as defined in the regulation, is a release of flammable materials resulting in a vapor cloud explosion of the maximum inventory of the largest vessel. Even though the normal operating inventory for this equipment is less than the maximum capacity, and this equipment is protected by high level alarms/shutdowns, pressure relief valves, periodic inspections, and routine monitoring by operating personnel, this maximum inventory must be assumed to be released in 10 minutes and ignited at the point of release. The worst-case release scenario modeled for the Stearns Gas Plant is a release of the entire volume of the flammable material stored in one of the Butane/Propane storage vessels. Please refer to the Hazard Assessment for more information. \n\n1.4.2  Alternative Release Scenario - Flammable\n\nThe alternative release scenario for flammables is a release of natural gas liquids which results in a vapor cloud fire.

Through compliance with the PSM standard (with minor additions), Stearns Gas Plant has implemented the requirements of the Program 3 prevention program. Compliance with PSM's comprehensive program ensures the integrity of the processes which handle flammable materials. The objective of the Company's PSM Program is to prevent unwanted releases of hazardous chemicals. To control these types of hazards, Linn WO has developed the necessary expertise, experiences, judgment and proactive initiative within their workforce to properly implement and maintain an effective process safety management program. An effective PSM program requires a systematic approach to evaluating the whole chemical process. Using this approach, the process design, process technology, process changes, operational and maintenance activities and procedures, non-routine activities and procedures, emergency preparedness plans and procedures, training programs, and other elements that affect the process are all considered in the evaluation. The various lines of defense that have been incorporated into the design and operation of the process to prevent or mitigate the release of hazardous chemicals have been evaluated and strengthened to assure their effectiveness at each level. Process safety management is the proactive identification, evaluation and mitigation or prevention of chemical releases that could occur as a result of failures in process, procedures or equipment. The elements of the company's PSM and accidental release prevention program are summarized below:\n\nProcess Safety Information - This includes complete and accurate written information concerning process chemicals, process technology, and process equipment esse"

The Process Safety Information includes information pertaining to the hazards, technology and the equipment of the natural gas processing system.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA) - This is an organized and systematic effort to identify and analyze the significance of potential hazards associated with the processing or handling of flammable materials. The PHA provides information that will assist the company and its employees in making decisions for improving safety and reducing the consequences of unwanted or unplanned releases of flammable materials. As part of the company's PSM program, a PHA has been conducted for the Stearns Gas Plant.\n\nOperating Procedures - As part of the PSM program, all procedures for operating and maintaining the natural gas processing system are documented and accessible to employees whose work involves this system. As needed, changes or updates to the natural gas processing system operating procedures are incorporated under the company's Management of Change program.\n\nEmployee Training - Personnel performing specific tasks which affect the natural gas processing system must be qualified to perform their assigned tasks. The company has an established training program that ensures the training and competency of employees whose jobs require them to perform work which affect the natural gas processing system.\n\nMechanical Integrity - Under the PSM program, equipment used to process, store, or handle flammable materials has to be designed, constructed, installed, and maintained to minimize the release of such chemicals. As required, elements of the mechanical integrity program include identifying and categorizing equipment and instrumentation, inspections and tests and their frequency; maintenance procedures; training of maintenance personnel; criteria for acceptable test results; and documentation of manufacturer recommendations for equipment and instrumentation.\n\nManagement of"

The company has established and implemented procedures to manage changes (except for \"replacements in kind\") to process chemicals, technology equipment and procedures, and changes to facilities that affect the natural gas processing system.\n\nPre-Startup Safety Review - As one of the requirements of PSM, the Company is required to perform a pre-startup safety review for new facilities and for modified facilities when the modification is significant enough to require a change in the Process Safety Information. A PHA will be performed prior to start up for new processes which require a hazardous material above the regulatory threshold. For existing processes that have been shutdown for turnaround or modification, company policy ensures that any changes other than \"replacement in kind\" made to the process during shutdown go through the management of change process.\n\nCompliance Audits - Periodically the Company performs an audit of their PSM program as required by the PSM standard. An audit is a technique used to gather sufficient facts and information, including statistical information, to verify compliance with the PSM standards. The audit includes an evaluation of the design and effectiveness of the PSM system and a field inspection of the safety and health conditions and practices to verify that the PSM program elements are effectively implemented.\n\nIncident Investigation - A crucial part of Linn WO's PSM program is a thorough investigation of incidents to identify the chain of events and causes so that corrective measures can be developed and implemented. Accordingly, the Stearn's Gas Plant has an incident investigation program which requires the investigation of each incident that resulted in, or could have reasonably resulted in, release of a flammable material.

It is essential that emergency pre-planning and training make employees aware of, and able to execute, proper actions.  For this reason, an Emergency Response Plan (ERP) for the entire facility has been developed and implemented.  The ERP includes procedures for handling small releases.\n\nThe facility developed written emergency response procedures to address all elements that may be encountered during planning, responding or following up to an emergency at the Stearns Gas Plant.  The basic concept of the emergency procedures is to provide a comprehensive approach for managing emergencies.  The last revision date for the Emergency Response Plan is May 10,2007.  The date of the most recent emergency response training for employees is June 3, 2004.\n\nThe following topics are either addressed in the Emergency Response Plan for the Stearns Gas Plant or available at the facility as part of the Emergency Response Program:\n?Public and agency notification requirements;\n?Emergency medical care and local hospital information;\n?List of emergency equipment including location and;\n?Employee emergency response training;\n?Revision procedures and update requirements. \n \n1.8.1.Incident Command System (ICS)\nThe facility?s response operations will be managed and directed by company personnel using the Incident Command System (ICS) which is used by most public agencies, including fire departments, U.S. Coast Guard, Department of Fish & Game, etc.  During the course of an incident or an emergency, the first responder will initially act as the Incident Commander (IC), a"
