The RMP is required under the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) risk management program codified in 40 Code of Federal Regulations, Part 68 (40 CFR 68).  Refining operations are primarily conducted in Areas 1 and 2, which are on contiguous properties.  ABR also has shutdown delayed coking operations and several storage tanks containing flammable mixtures in Area 3, which is not adjacent to Areas 1 and 2.  A separate RMP submittal has been prepared for Area 3.\n\n\n\nThe purpose of the risk management program is to identify and prevent potential accidental releases of specific \"regulated substances\" that have the potential to cause harm to the public and the environment.  \"Regulated substances\" are hazardous chemicals identified by EPA.  ABR has quantities of various \"regulated substances\" above the threshold amounts.  \n\n\n\nThe remainder of the Executive Summary is organized as follows:\n\n\n\nSection 1: Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies at ABR\n\nSection 2: Overview of Regulated Substances at ABR\n\nSection 3: Worst-case Release Scenarios and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nSection 4: ABR Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nSection 5: Five-year Accidental Release Summary\n\nSection 6: Emergency Response Program\n\nSection 7: Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\n\n\nSection 1:  Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies at ABR\n\n\n\nEquipment at the various units must be designed, operated, and maintained in full compliance with applicable internal engineering standards, accepted industry codes, or industry standards.

Written policies and standards are in place to ensure:  \n\n\n\n* The safety and health of employees and other workers at the site;\n\n* Protection of the environment;\n\n* Reliable and efficient operation of the facilities;\n\n* Minimization of the risk of product or property losses; and\n\n* Maintaining a positive relationship with the communities adjacent to our facility.  \n\n\n\nThese written policies and standards are discussed further elsewhere in this submittal.\n\n\n\n\n\nSection 2:  Overview of Regulated Substances at ABR Areas 1 and 2\n\n\n\nABR began operations as Mohawk Petroleum in 1932.  Under different owners, regular expansion and improvements of facilities have occurred over the years, including the integration of an adjacent refinery in 1986 that doubled gasoline production.  In 1998, the refinery became a part of Equilon Enterprises, LLC, a joint venture of Shell Oil Company and Texaco Inc.  Shell Oil Products US acquired Texaco's interest in 2002.  On March 16, 2005 Big West of California, LLC acquired interest in the refinery.  Alon Bakersfield Property, Inc. took over the site in 2010.  Several units previously reported in May 2007 Risk Management Plan submittal to the U.S. EPA have been de-inventoried, or the inventories have been reduced.\n\n\n\nABR processes vacuum gas oils into a number of consumer products, including gasoline, diesel, and liquefied petroleum gases (LPG).\n\n\n\nSummary of Covered Process Units below lists the covered process units that are subject to the federal risk management program, defines the appropriate RMP program level, and identifies the regulated substances handled in these units.\n\n\n\n\n\nSummary of Covered Process Units - ABR Areas 1 and 2\n\n\n\nUnit: Hydrocracking Unit (Unit 21)\n\nHigh temperature and catalyst are used to break or "

The results of the analyses are used to assist the Kern County Environmental Health Services Department and Fire Department in their emergency response planning.\n\n\n\n3.1  Worst-case Scenarios\n\n\n\nABR conducted offsite consequence analyses for the worst-case scenarios (WCS) using EPA's \"RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidelines\" (OCAG).  This methodology was used because the RMP rule set forth specific criteria that must be followed for modeling the worst-case scenarios.  The worst-case scenarios must incorporate very conservative, simplified assumptions about the nature of the releases and the resulting emission rates into the air.\n\n\n\nA worst-case release scenario is defined as the scenario that results in the greatest distance from the point of release to a specified \"endpoint.\"  As defined by the rule, the endpoint for toxics substances is a specified concentration, and for flammables is a specified overpressure from a vapor cloud explosion (VCE).  \n\n\n\nThe WCS for a regulated toxic is one where the total quantity in the largest vessel or pipe is released over 10 minutes, resulting in acute health effects associated with airborne exposure.  For a regulated flammable, the WCS is one where the total quantity of regulated flammables in the largest vessel or pipe is assumed to vaporize and instantaneously result in a VCE.\n\n\n\nA summary of the WCS for ABR Areas 1 and 2 is provided below.  As required by the RMP rule, the results are shown for one vessel containing a toxic substance (anhydrous ammonia) and one vessel containing flammables.  These scenarios produced the greatest distance to their respective toxic and flammable endpoints.  An additional WCS is reported for the RMP Program 1 process, De-isobutniz"

Process safety information (PSI), which addresses chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters, limits for specific chemical inventories, and equipment design information, was compiled for each process unit.\n\n\n\nPSI is used in process unit hazard analyses, inspection, maintenance, and training activities.

Under this program, each process is systematically examined by a multi-disciplinary team to identify hazards that could result in an accidental release of a regulated substance and to ensure that adequate control is in place to manage those hazards.  ABR has used the hazard and operability study methodology as the refinery's primary PHA technique.  Pertinent parameters, such as flow, temperature, pressure, and liquid level, were reviewed.\n\n\n\nIn order to help ensure that the process controls or process hazards do not deviate significantly from the original design safety features, ABR updates and revalidates the hazard analyses every 5 years.  \n\n\n\nA seismic review of the refinery was conducted as part of the technical studies.  The refinery is located in an area that is prone to earthquakes.  A site walkthrough was conducted in 1996 by a qualified engineering company for Shell, the previous owner.  The objective of seismic assessments was to provide reasonable assurance that a release of regulated substance having offsite consequences would not occur as a result of a major earthquake.  The results and findings from the seismic review are documented and retained in the computerized tracking system.  A revalidation of the seismic assessment has been initiated by ABR.\n\n\n\n4.3  Operating Procedures\n\n\n\nABR has developed and implemented written operating procedures that provide clear instructions for safely conducting activities involved in each process.

Employees who understand the process and how to safely operate a process can significantly decrease the number and severity of incidents.  \n\n\n\nRefresher training for all operations and maintenance employees in Safety, Health, and Environmental subjects and operating procedures (as appropriate) is provided at varying intervals, depending upon requirements. \n\n\n\n4.5  Management of Change\n\n\n\nA management of change (MOC) review is required for modifications to facilities or changes to process unit operating conditions.  The procedure does not apply to \"replacement in kind,\" which is defined as replacements that satisfy the design specifications and are functionally identical to the item being replaced.\n\n\n\nThe MOC process is intended to assess the impact of proposed changes on process safety, the environment, operability, reliability, and product quality in process units.

ABR maintains a certification record that each inspection and test has been performed, which includes the date of the inspection, the name of the inspector and test, and the serial number or other identifier of the equipment.
