The results of the analyses are used to assist the Kern County Environmental Health Services Department and Fire Department in their emergency response planning.\r\n\r\n3.1  Worst-case Scenarios\r\n\r\nABR conducted offsite consequence analyses for the worst-case scenarios (WCS) using EPA's RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidelines (OCAG).  This methodology was used because the RMP rule set forth specific criteria that must be followed for modeling the worst-case scenarios.  The worst-case scenarios must incorporate very conservative, simplified assumptions about the nature of the releases and the resulting emission rates into the air.\r\n\r\nA worst-case release scenario is defined as the scenario that results in the greatest distance from the point of release to a specified endpoint.  As defined by the rule, the endpoint for toxics substances is a specified concentration, and for flammables is a specified overpressure from a vapor cloud explosion (VCE).  \r\n\r\nThe WCS for a regulated toxic is one where the total quantity in the largest vessel or pipe is released over 10 minutes, resulting in acute health effects associated with airborne exposure.  For a regulated flammable, the WCS is one where the total quantity of regulated flammables in the largest vessel or pipe is assumed to vaporize and instantaneously result in a VCE.\r\n\r\nA summary of the WCS for ABR Areas 1 and 2 is provided below.  As required by the RMP rule, the results are shown for one vessel containing a toxic substance (anhydrous ammonia) and one vessel containing flammables.  These scenarios produced the greatest distance to their respective toxic and flammable endpoints.  An additional WCS is reported for the RMP Program 1 process, De-isobutniz"

Under this program, each process is systematically examined by a multi-disciplinary team to identify hazards that could result in an accidental release of a regulated substance and to ensure that adequate control is in place to manage those hazards.  ABR has used the hazard and operability study methodology as the refinery's primary PHA technique.  Pertinent parameters, such as flow, temperature, pressure, and liquid level, were reviewed.\r\n\r\nIn order to help ensure that the process controls or process hazards do not deviate significantly from the original design safety features, ABR updates and revalidates the hazard analyses every 5 years.  \r\n\r\nA seismic review of the refinery was conducted as part of the technical studies.  The refinery is located in an area that is prone to earthquakes.  A site walkthrough was conducted in 1996 by a qualified engineering company for Shell, the previous owner.  The objective of seismic assessments was to provide reasonable assurance that a release of regulated substance having offsite consequences would not occur as a result of a major earthquake.  The results and findings from the seismic review are documented and retained in the computerized tracking system.  A revalidation of the seismic assessment has been initiated by ABR.\r\n\r\n4.3  Operating Procedures\r\n\r\nABR has developed and implemented written operating procedures that provide clear instructions for safely conducting activities involved in each process.

The procedures are maintained current and accurate by revising them to reflect changes made through the management of change process and through annual certification.\r\n\r\n4.4  Training\r\n\r\nABR's general policy requires operating personnel to be trained in the safe operation of facilities, handling process upsets, emergency response, and personal safety.  Employees who understand the process and how to safely operate a process can significantly decrease the number and severity of incidents.  \r\n\r\nRefresher training for all operations and maintenance employees in Safety, Health, and Environmental subjects and operating procedures (as appropriate) is provided at varying intervals, depending upon requirements. \r\n\r\n4.5  Management of Change\r\n\r\nA management of change (MOC) review is required for modifications to facilities or changes to process unit operating conditions.  The procedure does not apply to replacement in kind, which is defined as replacements that satisfy the design specifications and are functionally identical to the item being replaced.\r\n\r\nThe MOC process is intended to assess the impact of proposed changes on process safety, the environment, operability, reliability, and product quality in process units.  The requirements for MOC are documented in a written procedure.  MOC information is kept for the life of the process unit.\r\n\r\n4.6  Pre-startup Safety Reviews\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the pre-startup safety review is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides additional assurance that construction is in accordance with the design speci"

ABR maintains a certification record that each inspection and test has been performed, which includes the date of the inspection, the name of the inspector and test, and the serial number or other identifier of the equipment.  Every recommendation made by an inspector is resolved and documented.  In so doing, ABR will correct deficiencies in equipment that are outside acceptable limits (as defined by the PSI) before further use, or in a safe and timely manner that ensures safe operation.\r\n\r\n4.8  Compliance Audits\r\n\r\nTo ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, ABR conducts audits every 3 years to ensure that the accident prevention program is being implemented.

The RMP is required under the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) risk management program codified in 40 Code of Federal Regulations, Part 68 (40 CFR 68).  Refining operations are primarily conducted in Areas 1 and 2, which are on contiguous properties.  ABR also has shutdown delayed coking operations and several storage tanks containing flammable mixtures in Area 3, which is not adjacent to Areas 1 and 2.  A separate RMP submittal has been prepared for Area 3.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the risk management program is to identify and prevent potential accidental releases of specific regulated substances that have the potential to cause harm to the public and the environment.  Regulated substances are hazardous chemicals identified by EPA.  ABR has quantities of various regulated substances above the threshold amounts.  \r\n\r\nThe remainder of the Executive Summary is organized as follows:\r\n\r\nSection 1: Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies at ABR\r\nSection 2: Overview of Regulated Substances at ABR\r\nSection 3: Worst-case Release Scenarios and Alternative Release Scenarios\r\nSection 4: ABR Accidental Release Prevention Program\r\nSection 5: Five-year Accidental Release Summary\r\nSection 6: Emergency Response Program\r\nSection 7: Planned Changes to Improve Safety\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 1:  Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies at ABR\r\n\r\nEquipment at the various units must be designed, operated, and maintained in full compliance with applicable internal engineering standards, accepted industry codes, or industry standards.

The purpose of the program is to protect workers, the public, and the environment from harm due to refinery emergencies.  The program includes procedures to provide for comprehensive emergency response through the following:\r\n\r\n* First aid and medical treatment\r\n* Emergency incidents, including fire, potential fire, hazardous materials releases, and natural disasters such as floods, winds, earthquakes, and electrical storms\r\n* Emergency evacuation and rescue\r\n* Notification of local, state and federal emergency response agencies and the public if an incident occurs\r\n* Post-incident cleanup and decontamination\r\n\r\nThe emergency response program provides training of all refinery staff, which varies in level of detail based on assigned roles and responsibilities for staff under the program.  Routine audits are routinely performed by ABR staff and third parties (the Kern County Fire Department and ABR's insurance company) to ensure compliance with portions or the entire emergency response program.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 7:  Planned Changes to Improve Safety\r\n\r\nABR has a comprehensive hazard identification and mitigation program to ensure process safety.  This program includes periodic PHAs, investigations of near misses, and audits of processing units.  Management is notified of deficiencies or potential hazards, and a mitigation plan is developed.\r\n\r\nCurrent plans to improve safety include installation of more reliable process controls and process area detection systems."
