We will communicate effectively to management, effected employees and the community the necessary awareness and preparation for the response to any potential events based on the probability of the risk.  Next, we will integrate all potentially compatible safety requirements and guidelines that are expected and implied for use at all company facilities and that enhance the capability of this system.  Finally, it is our goal to maintain ongoing compliance of all PSM requirements.\n\nOur company has an extensive safety audit program.  Each facility is audited annually.  The Corporate Safety Director performs the annual audit.  The audit scores are tied in with overall plant ratings.  Management is accountable for the facility rating.  Emergency response, evacuation, PSM, Hazcom, etc. are all covered by the safety audit.  Each audit includes specific recommendations for correcti"
