Immediately initiate plant evacuation procedures.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nIt is the intent of the Morningstar division to become proficient in emergency response by training the workforce as an emergency response team.  The make up of the team and planned response will be under the review and direction of the Corporate Safety and Training Director.\n\nThe process safety management policy of Dean Foods is as follows: Identify, evaluate and continually improve on processes that effect the ability to prevent and mitigate the risk of release of acutely hazardous materials at each facility. We will communicate effectively to management, effected employees and the community the necessary awareness and preparation for the response to any potential events based on the probability of the risk.  Next, we will integrate all potentially compatible safety requirements and guidelines that are expected and implied for use at all company facilities and that enhance the capability of this system.  Finally, it is our goal to maintain ongoing compliance of all PSM requirements.\n\nOur company has an extensive safety audit program.  Each facility is audited annually.  The Corporate Safety Director performs the annual audit.  The audit scores are tied in with overall plant ratings.  Management is accountable for the facility rating.  Emergency response, evacuation, PSM, Hazcom, etc. are all covered by the safety audit.  Each audit includes specific recommendations for correcti"
