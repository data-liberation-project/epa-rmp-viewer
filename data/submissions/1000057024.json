These resources include safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of the process at the NW Toyah Gas\n\nProcessing Facility (NW Toyah), and training of operations personnel and contractors. EMV\n\nimplements reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.\n\nEagleClaw places emphasis on prevention, prompt detection, and expeditious correction of unsafe conditions by periodically conducting internal inspections and regularly training responsible personnel. Should a release occur, trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release, and prevent or mitigate any off-site consequences.\n\n\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nNW Toyah, located in Reeves County, Texas, is owned by EMV. NW Toyah is a natural gas processing plant comprised of natural gas liquid recovery, natural gas liquids fractionation, and natural gas treatment and compression equipment. Produced gas is delivered to the\n\nNW Toyah Facility via pipeline. The natural gas liquid recovery equipment is designed to recover natural gas liquids from the inlet gas. NW Toyah produces natural gas, and natural gas liquids. The NW Toyah equipment operates to separate, stabilize, compress (gas), dehydrate (gas), store (natural gas liquids), and transfer gas, and natural gas liquids to sales. Natural gas and Natural Gas Liquids are transported by pipeline from NW Toyah.\n\n\n\nThe listed flammable substance above the threshold quantities at the NW Toyah is a flammable mixture containing methane, ethane, propane, isobutane, butane, 2,2 dimethylpropane, isopentane and pentane. No toxic substances are present in the process. The NW Toyah complies with Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Proce"

The NW Toyah process has been designed using current equipment design codes and standards with appropriate safety controls. The process design includes control systems to maintain operating parameters, such as temperature, pressures, flow, and level within allowable limits. Operating procedures for the process are periodically reviewed for safe operations.\n\n\n\n Personnel operating the process are trained on the operating procedures to familiarize them with the consequences of exceeding allowable safety and operability limits and steps to correct deviation from normal operating parameters. Additionally, EMV has developed maintenance procedures to maintain equipment integrity. \n\n\n\nEMV has implemented safe work practices to help ensure worker and process safety at the East\n\nToyah. Examples of these include: (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel; (2) a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance; (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous substances before process piping and equipment is opened; (4) a permit and procedure to control spark-producing activities (i.e., hot work); and (5) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space. These procedures, along with training of involved personnel, form a system to ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\n\n\n\nSpecific Prevention Steps\n\nHazards in the process at NW Toyah are continually managed to ensure safe operations.
