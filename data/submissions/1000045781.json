      "SummaryText": "Alabama Power Company's Plant E.C. Gaston, located near Wilsonville, Alabama, is a 5 unit steam electric generating plant.\r\n\r\nIt is the policy of Plant Gaston to provide and maintain safe and healthful working conditions, and an efficient and environmentally safe operation.  The plant has a safety program designed to ensure that the employees' working environment is safe.  This program includes training and instruction.\r\n\r\nPlant Gaston has 2 processes that use chemicals that exceed the threshold quantities.  These chemicals are chlorine and anhydrous ammonia.  \r\n\r\nPlant Gaston has two (2) cooling towers to help reduce the temperature of the water that is discharged into the Coosa River.  In order to treat the water, chlorine is injected into the cooling tower system.  The total quantity of chlorine exceeds the threshold limit of 2500 lbs. \r\n\r\nIn order to insure that releases of chlorine do not occur, daily visual and documented weekly inspections are performed by plant personnel.  Plant Gaston also has an outside contractor perform yearly maintenance inspections on the chlorination system.  We feel these programs greatly reduce the possibility of an accidental release of chlorine.\r\n\r\nThe process that makes Plant Gaston subject to  RMP regulations for anhydrous ammonia is the ammonia storage and dilution system.  This system is part of the Selective Catalytic Reduction system used to control emissions of nitrous oxides generated from the combustion of coal to generate electricity.  \r\n\r\nThe accidential release prevention program at Plant Gaston is focused on the safe management of chlorine and ammonia.  The first step in the prevention program was the establishment of a management system to assign overall responsibility and responsibility of the individual program elements.  Additional steps include: ensuring process safety information on the ammonia storage and dilution system is accurate, complete, up to date and accessible, assuring the system is designed and modif"

      "SummaryText": "ied safely by periodically conducting process hazard analyses; ensuring that the system is operated and maintained in a safe manner by developing, maintaining and implementing Standard Operating and Preventive Maintenance procedures; ensuring contractors are qualified, and oriented to the site hazards; and ensuring periodic Compliance Audits and incident investigations are conducted including the resolution of recommendations made during these investigations/reviews. \r\n\r\nPlant Gaston is included in the Shelby County LEPC emergency response plan.  In addition, Plant Gaston has in place an emergency response plan that includes procedures to be followed in the event of a release of chlorine or ammonia.  The plan covers the following: evacuation plan, recognizing emergencies, emergency action procedures, coordinating personnel, first aid procedures, notifying the public and local response agencies, emergency response contacts, emergency response equipment,emergency alarm system, training and pre-emergency coordination with the Shelby County LEPC.  This plan would be implemented immediately.    \r\n\r\nNo chemical spills have occurred at this facility in the past 5 years."
