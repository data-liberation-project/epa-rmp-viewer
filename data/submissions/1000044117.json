      "SummaryText": "ETC Texas Pipeline, Ltd (ETC) owns and operates the Rebel Gas Plant natural gas processing facility located in Glasscock County, Texas.  The facility is designed to treat and process wellhead natural gas and recover natural gas liquid (NGL) products from the gas stream by physical and cryogenic separation.  NGL captured upstream of the plant's cryogenic process is stabilized to lower the vapor pressure to, or near, atmospheric pressure.  These stabilized NGLs are then trucked away.  The NGL recovered from the cryogenic process exit the facility via a liquids pipeline and high pressure pumps.  The residue market quality natural gas exits the facility in a natural gas pipeline.\n\n\n\nTwo requirements of this section specifically apply to operations at the Rebel Gas Plant:\n\n\n\n1. Purpose and General Duty Clause - The essence of the general duty clause is that an owner/operator that stores and uses hazardous chemicals in any quantity has a fundamental obligation to ensure a safe operation and to have plans in place in the event of an accident to appropriately manage the situation. ETC is committed to ensuring the safe operation of the Rebel Gas Plant, as well as all of its other operations, to ensure a safe workplace for our employees and a safe location for our neighbors in the community. ETC, therefore, has procedures in place to prevent accidents and is committed to emergency preparedness both for our facility and community-wide by coordinating with the Glasscock County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).\n\n\n\n2. Risk Management Plan - The Rebel Gas Plant processes wellhead natural gas to produce market quality natural gas which meets tariff specifications.  This process removes the heavier hydrocarbons from the gas stream, resulting in a methane gas.  The heavier hydrocarbons are recovered from the process as natural gas liquids and must remain under high pressure to maintain the liquid phase.   Natural gas liquids also exist upstream of the gas process and must be"

The gas process and stabilization process involve a hazardous chemical (flammable substances) in excess of the thresholds specified in Section 112(r).  ETC management is very aware of the potential hazards posed by processing natural gas, natural gas liquids, and storing natural gas liquids.  Programs have been established to help prevent any accidental releases and to train personnel for emergency response in the event of a release.  These programs are documented and described in the Risk Management Plan.\n\n\n\nFor planning purposes, ETC has considered the impact of a worst case accident, defined to be the total loss of containment of the 90,000 gallon NGL surge tank, resulting in the instantaneous formation of a vapor cloud which explodes.  Using RMP*Comp, a potential radius of impact due to the explosion was calculated to extend 0.6 miles.  Demographic information indicates there are not any residences within this radius, although three (3) industrial public receptors were within the 0.6 mile radius.  However, it should be noted that the probability of the worst case catastrophic event evaluated in this report is extremely remote.  Far less than natural catastrophes such as tornadoes and floods that could produce much more severe and extensive damage and injury.  A consideration of the 0.6 mile radius has been incorporated into ETC's notification and emergency response planning.  ETC also considered the impact of a more likely loss of containment.  This alternative release scenario is characterized as a smaller accident resulting in a release of flammable liquids through a small hole at the NGL surge tank lasting up to 10 minutes.  Using RMP*Comp, the impact distance of a potential vapor cloud explosion resulting from this release was calculated to be less than 0.1 mile.  There were not any off-site public receptors such as a residence, schoo"

ETC's management is committed to the following:\n\n-Preventing accidents;\n\n-Training our employees in correct response procedures in the event of an accident;\n\n-Participating in community emergency preparedness;\n\n-Addressing any citizen concerns by fully explaining potential hazards associated with ETC operations and all steps being taken to prevent and mitigate accidents; and\n\n-Being a good corporate citizen in Glasscock County.\n\n\n\nWith these objectives in mind, the Risk Management Plan has been developed to provide information about our management of the risks associated with the natural gs treatment and liquids recovery process. Most important, we stress our commitment to ensuring a safe operation for our employees, our visitors and our community."
