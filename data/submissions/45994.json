It is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws. Copies of emergency response, process hazard analyses and process safety management plans and all technical drawing (P&IDs) for process equipment are maintained onsite for reference. Regular inspection and testing of the pentane and thermal oil systems are performed to ensure equipment integrity is maintained. The facility is equipped with a network of leak detection equipment, automatic shutdown logic controls, insulation, safety relief valves, fire detection monitors. OREG provides high levels of training in operating procedures, safety and emergency response. If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to implement the emergency response procedures to mitigate damages, and to notify the nearest fire department and request their assistance.\n\n\n\nDescription of Stationary Source\n\n\n\nThe OREG power units are fueled by waste heat form a compressor turbine exhaust that is transferred from thermal energy into mechanical energy.  This is accomplished by utilizing the organic Rankine cycle (ORC) technology.  The hot gases of the turbine exhaust flow through a Waste Heat Oil Heater (WHOH), where the heat from the gases is transferred to a thermal oil heat transfer fluid.  The thermal oil is then circulated to the shell and tube vaporizer of an Ormat Energy Converter (OEC).  The motive fluid on the shell side is vaporized and these vapors drive a special organic fluid turbine.  This turbine, which rotates at 1800 rpm drives a generator which produces grid compatible power.  The motive fluid then passes through a heat exchanger and enters the cycle again as a liquid.  After exiting the various heat "

The power from this project is sold to Basin Electric Power Cooperative based in Bismarck, ND. \n\n\n\nThe basic Rankine cycle model consists of four components:\n\n1? Pump - Work Input\n\n2? Boiler - Heat Input\n\n3? Turbine - Work Output\n\n4? Condenser - Heat Rejection\n\n\n\nThe Rankine cycle consists of pressurizing a liquid (pentane), vaporizing the high pressure liquid, expanding the high pressure vapor and condensing the low pressure vapor for reuse. The energy necessary for the vaporization is provided by thermal oil at a maximum temperature of 572?F. The thermal energy is transferred to the pentane working fluid via tube and counter-current shell heat exchangers. The OREG facility uses a commercial pentane with a dry cooling heat rejection system.\n\n\n\nPrimary Activities\n\n\n\nWaste thermal energy is converted to electric power. The facility is rated at 6.3 MW. The net power output to the electrical grid is rated at 5.4 MW. Power output is reduced in warm weather due to limitations of the air cooled heat exchangers.\n\n\n\nUse of regulated substance\n\n\n\nPentane, a flammable vapor/liquid is used as a binary working fluid. Liquid pentane is pumped from a condenser to shell and tube heat exchangers. Thermal energy provided by thermal oil is transferred to the pentane. The thermal oil heat input causes the pentane to change physical states from liquid to high pressure superheated vapor that is passed through a turbine to produce electric power. The vapor is condensed and recycled back to a pressurized liquid recuperator vessel to complete the Rankine cycle.  A pentane storage tank is available for makeup.  The facility design is segregated into multiple sections, each having its own design specifications dictated by the pentane conditions in that section. The sections include: the low pressure process equipment, the high pressure process equipment, p"

This CMMS contains information on all equipment in the facility requiring maintenance, inspections, testing, certification, calibration, etc. NFPA, OSHA, manufacturer's recommendations and operations experience have been utilized to produce a comprehensive maintenance work order system that produces maintenance requests at appropriate frequencies. Employees report any equipment deficiencies to the Operation and Maintenance Manager who generates \"Work Orders\" for the repair or assessment of the problem. Routine comprehensive inspections are performed using checklists.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Plan:  The emergency response plan is intended to identify and coordinate personnel in the event there is an emergency.  \n\n\n\nTraining:  Some equipment in the OREG 1 Facilities poses potential fire, explosion, and electrical hazards that could cause serious personal injuries and costly property damage if safety procedures are not followed correctly.

Safety training is supplemented by the use of the Industrial Hygiene and Standard Safety Procedures Manuals.\n\nCall out Procedure:  If any of the following Alarm conditions are indicated by the OREG 1 monitoring system, this Call-Out procedure must be followed: OEC failure, OEC low output, security/fire alarm trip.  If any of these events should occur the monitoring staff will immediately contact the Operation and Maintenance Manager.  If the operation and maintenance manager is not reached in a timely manner the parent company, Ormat Nevada Inc. will be notified on the 24 hour phone number (775)-852-1912.  If a fire is detected the monitoring staff shall notify local emergency personnel including fire and police departments.    \n\nNotification of Northern Pipeline Personnel: Any Northern Border Personnel which may be at the site during the alarm condition must also be notified through Northern Border procedures.  Northern Border Personnel should not attempt to respond to the alarm conditions unless they have been trained and certified to do so.\n\nThe principal methods of accident prevention include equipment design safeguards, written procedures and operator/employee training. Safety systems are present in the facilities and have various methods of operation.  \n\n\n\nPressure safety systems typically have three levels of degree. The initial degree is an alarm that is presented audibly and visually to the Control Room Operator.
