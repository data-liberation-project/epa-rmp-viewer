      "SummaryText": "SouthWest Dairy is a milk processing plant owned and operated by Brookshire Grocery Company in Tyler, Texas. SouthWest Dairy produces whole milk, 2% milk, reduced fat milk, 1% milk, skim milk, chocolate milk, reduced fat chocolate milk, butter milk, eggnog, and orange juice under the Brookshire Grocery Company private lable Dairy Pride. SouthWest Dairy uses Anhydrous Ammonia to keep products at federal mandated temperature levels. There is approximately 21,500 pounds of Anhydrous Ammonia on site.SouthWest Dairy has not had a reportable release of Anhydrous Ammonia.\nThe main hazards associated with Anhydrous Ammonia at this facility would include a release of the entire system to the atmosphere. Because of the safeties that are in place at the facility this would be unlikely to occur. A catastrophic event such as earthquake or tornado could however cause such a release.\nThe entire facility is behind a eight foot security fence with authorized personnel access only to and from premises. The entire facility is guarded by armed security personnel 24 hours a day 365 days a year. \nSouthWest Dairy's maintenance department has over 100 years of combined experience with Anhydrous Ammonia. Maintenance personnel responsible for the ammonia system are trained every six months in donning and doffing emergency response equipment such as SCBA, Ammonia Respirators, Level A Suits, and other required PPE.\nSouthWest Dairy and Brookshire Grocery Company maintains close ties with the LEPC, Tyler Fire Department, and Hazmat Team. Annual tours are conducted to maintain familiarity with the facility. The Tyler Fire Department and Hazmat Team have both recognized the experience that SouthWest Dairy personnel have in respect to Anhydrous Ammonia response and have requested that the Hazmat Team backup SouthWest Dairy personnel in the event of an ammonia release.\nAll on site partners are trained in emergency evacuation annually. All new partners are trained in emergency evacuation and ammonia"

      "SummaryText": "awareness during the new partner orientation process.\nSouthWest Dairy's ammonia equipment is in an enclosed room that is vented to the atmosphere. All piping is routed to the roof so that if there was a release the release would be outdoors. All piping from our silos have been tied into one main header that has been run to the roof and placed an additional twenty feet in the air. An Emergency Anhydrous Ammonia Control Box is located outside the facility that would allow the entire system to be shut down in the event of a major release.\nSouthWest Dairy has implemented and continues to conduct a preventative maintenance program to ensure that any and all hazards are addressed to reduce the risk of an Anhydrous Ammonia release.\nIn the event of a suspected release of Anhydrous Ammonia SouthWest Dairy has a Pollution Crisis Management and Emergency Response Contingency Plan in place. This plan is updated annually or when ever deemed necessary by Management or the Environmental Health and Safety Coordinator. The plan was developed to protect our partners and community. SouthWest Dairy, Supervision, Security, LEPC,  Tyler Fire Department, and Hazmat Team all have copies of the Emergency Response Contingency Plan. This plan consist of an emergency notification call down list containing 24 hour contact numbers for all trained responders, the duties for Ammonia Specialist/Responders, contact information for the LEPC, SERC, NRC, TCEQ, and a  MSDS  for Anhydrous Ammonia."
