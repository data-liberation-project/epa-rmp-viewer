      "SummaryText": "Welsh Power Plant is one of two coal fueled power generating facilities in the Southwestern Electric Power Company (SWEPCO) subsidiary, which includes a total of 8 generating facilities located in east Texas, Louisiana and Arkansas. This site is located in Titus County near Pittsburg, Texas. The facility has 105 full time employees.\n\nSouthwestern Electric Power Company (SWEPCO) is an investor-owned utility. The company's common stock is held by American Electric Power Co., a registered public holding company headquartered in Columbus, Ohio..\n\nThe facility is a three-unit power generation facility with a total generation of  approximately 1584 MW.  Subituminous coal is the primary fuel with fuel oil being burned only during startup and while putting mills in and out of service.  The three Westinghouse units were installed in 1977, 1980 and 1982. \n\nThe following information is part of a complete Risk Management Plan (RMP) that was prepared for the SWEPCO Welsh Power Plant outside of Pittsburg, TX.  The information includes accident prevention and safety programs, emergency preparedness and response programs, chemical description, five year accidental release history, alternative release scenario and the worst case scenario.  The sharing of this type of information is a means to improve community safety, not a prediction of the probability that either a worst case or more likely scenario would ever occur.  These scenarios are estimates required by the Environmental Protection Agency and are used to illustrate the importance for risk reduction, safety, prevention and emergency preparedness and response.\n\nThe Welsh Power Plant has been producing electricity for over 25 years. During this time, there has not been any chlorine release that adversely impacted the plant or the surrounding community.\n\nThe release scenarios, a worst case scenario and an alternative release scenario, are designed to be exercises which calculate the potential impact on the community, based upon "

      "SummaryText": "extreme conditions, defined by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).  A worst case scenario is defined as the complete release of the largest inventory of the chemical over 10 minutes under weather conditions that would allow the chemical to travel as far as possible.  The distance(s) used in this plan are from the EPA Offsite Consequence Analysis Guide (April 1999). It also assumes that none of the site?s mechanical controls or safety systems are operational for this theoretical exercise. \n\nThe worst case scenario for the Welsh Power Plant involves a cylinder containing 2,000 pounds of chlorine. The entire quantity is released and vaporizes over a 10-minute period and the resulting vapor cloud travels down wind.  A level of concern to the community extends 2.2  miles down wind. \n\nGiven these unrealistic guidelines of a worst case scenario, more realistic scenarios or alternative release scenarios were also developed. These scenarios involve smaller releases and allow a site?s safety systems to work.  The alternative release scenario may be used by local government and industry to prepare emergency response plans.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for the Welsh Power Plant involves the failure of a ?-inch pigtail or similar connection releasing chlorine for a duration of 60 minutes. The resulting cloud extends 0.1 miles down wind.\n\nSWEPCO?s chlorinating systems are built and installed with safety controls designed to prevent accidental releases. Some of the typical safety equipment and systems used at the plant include:\n?    Storage cylinders meeting American Society of Mechanical Engineering requirements\n?    Automatic shut-off devices\n?    Interlocks and relief valves\n?    Specifically designed pressure gauges, fittings, connections, tubing and piping.\n?    A chlorine detection/warning system is located at the chlorine house and at the bottles.\n\n    Plant employees, including plant operators, electricians, mechanics, and laboratory technicians, receive training in the operatio"

Documentation of equipment deficiencies\n?    Timely and appropriate repair of all deficiencies.\n    \n    A Process Safety Management System has been specifically developed for the chlorination system at this plant in compliance with the Occupational Safety and Health Act Process Safety Management rule. This management system requires:\n?    An initial and periodic analysis of engineering and administrative controls\n?    Investigation procedures designed to resolve and correct potential incidents\n?    Formal audits performed by trained individuals with knowledge of chlorination systems.\n    \n    All Plant personnel handling chlorine are specially trained. This training includes:\n?
