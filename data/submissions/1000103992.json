Any other measures identified by employees during workplace hazard surveys, or as a result of audit activities, will be thoroughly reviewed and considered for implementation. Any incidents that occur on site will be investigated thoroughly to avoid repeated occurrences. \n\nADMINISTRATIVE CONTROLS\n\nAdministrative controls in effect at Sewerage Commission Oroville Region which were considered to mitigate the severity of the Worst Case and Alternative Case release scenarios include Sewerage Commission Oroville Region's written policies and procedures for training of operators and maintenance personnel, written procedures for control of the inventory of chlorine and sulfur dioxide at the facility, and policies regarding quality level of replacement materials and components for the chlorine and sulfur dioxide systems."

      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nSewerage Commission Oroville Region has instituted a Risk Management Program for their wastewater treatment facility, SC-OR Wastewater Treatment Plant, as required by the Federal Chemical Accident Prevention Program regulations at 40 CFR Part 68. The Risk Management Program identifies the equipment, procedures, maintenance, inspection, and training associated with Regulated Substances (RS's) handled at this facility in excess of Federal threshold quantities; describes the structured assessment of hazards which was conducted to assess possible effects on employees and offsite public and environmental receptors; provides the results of an offsite consequences analysis; defines a prevention program, emergency response program, and mitigation measures to reduce the probability and magnitude of accidental releases of RS's; and establishes a schedule and responsibilities for implementation of mitigation measures and auditing of program elements. This Risk Management Plan (RMP) is being filed as required by ARP regulations in order to report the elements of the current Risk Management Program and to describe further measures planned to mitigate or prevent accidental releases of RS's.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nIt is the policy of the SC-OR that the receipt, storage, and handling of chlorine and sulfur dioxide at its facility be done in a manner which meets regulatory requirements. This minimizes the probability and severity of accidental releases of chlorine and sulfur dioxide to the atmosphere to protect the health and safety of workers, the public, and the environment. To accomplish this goal, the SC-OR has gathered safety information on chlorine and sulfur dioxide, and on the process, equipment, and procedures involving both regulated substances; performed a structured assessment of hazards of the process and external events which might affect the process; performed an offsite consequences analysis of defined relea"

Fifth Avenue, Oroville, California. The facility is located in an industrial area of Butte County and currently has 10 full-time employees. The following describes how the regulated substances of chlorine and sulfur dioxide are handled at the SC-OR WWTP:\n\u0095 Approximately 6 tons of chlorine is stored on site which exceeds the State and Federal threshold for chlorine. The chlorine wholesaler is Thatcher Group Inc. and is received in 1-ton cylinders by truck. The chlorine containers are handled with an electric hoist and stored on ton container scales inside a secured fenced area behind a locked gate. The chlorine is used for odor control of the influent wastewater, disinfection of the wastewater effluent, and for other process uses. Pressurized gas within a ton container is reduced to vacuum at a vacuum regulator valve. From there, the gas under the vacuum is metered through rate valves and rotameters in chlorinators located in a separate room and drawn into a water solution by the passage of pressurized water through an eductor.\n\u0095 Approximately 6 tons of sulfur dioxide gas is stored on site which exceeds both the State and\nFederal threshold for sulfur dioxide. The sulfur dioxide wholesaler is Jones Chemical Inc. and are\nRisk Management Plan October 2022 Sewerage Commission Oroville SC-OR Wastewater Treatment Plant also received in 1-ton cylinders by truck. The sulfur dioxide containers are handled with an electric hoist and stored on ton container scales inside a secured fenced area behind a locked gate. Sulfur dioxide is used to neutralize chlorine and reduce all forms of chlorines to chlorides. This dechlorination process protects the aquatic life of the river.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL REL"

This constitutes the general accidental release prevention program for Sewerage Commission Oroville Region's operations. The program and document management procedures included in the PSM Program will be used as the management system for the Risk Management Program. General accidental release prevention programs instituted by Sewerage Commission Oroville Region are categorized as administrative (management) programs; procedures, training, and engineering controls; and emergency response programs. Chemical-specific prevention steps for each regulated substance is stated below. Release prevention steps specific to chlorine and sulfur dioxide have been identified and implemented. These include, among other things, creation of numerous facility-specific operation procedures with check boxes for completion of critical steps:\n\u0095 Chemicals Covered Under this Prevention Program: Chlorine (Cl2) and Sulfur Dioxide (SO2)\n\u0095 NAICS Code: 221320\n\u0095 Date of last Hazard Review or Update: May 2019\n\u0095 Technique Used: Guide Words and What-If Methodology\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere have been no accidents involving chlorine at this facility within the past five years resulting in injuries or offsite consequences. There have been no accidents involving sulfur dioxide at this facility within the past five years resulting in injury or offsite consequences.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nSewerage Commission Oroville Region's Emergency Response Program applicable to chlorine and sulfur dioxide has been coordinated with the City of Oroville Fire Department.
