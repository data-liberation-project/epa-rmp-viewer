The Risk Management Plan (RMP) encompasses all the elements of the Risk Management Program, accidental release prevention, emergency response polices, safety, training and maintenance.\n\n\n\nThe WWTP stores and uses chlorine to disinfect wastewater.  The facility treats an average flow of 10 million gallons per day (MGD) of wastewater and has the capacity to store approximately 16,000 lbs. on site at any one time.  Chlorine at the facility is contained in eight 1-ton containers that are on a standby/on-line basis to ensure the chlorination process is continuous.  Chlorine is drawn from 1-ton containers in a gaseous state.\n\n\n\nThe WWTP preventative maintenance program maintains equipment related to chlorine process to ensure it is fully operational.\n\n\n\nThe worst case scenario was estimated, per the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) guidance to provide the greatest distance in any director to the established toxic endpoint.  The worse-case release quantity established by the regulations is the greatest amount of chlorine held in a single vessel.  The worst-case quantity of chorine was determined to be a 1-ton container, 2,000 lbs.  In accordance with 40 CFR Part 68.25, it is assumed the gas is released over a 10 minute period; therefore, the release rate is estimated to be 200 pounds per minute (lbs/min).\n\n\n\nNo administrative controls or active mitigation measure were included in the worst-case scenario.  The EPA's RMP Comp software was used to determine the distance to the toxic endpoint for the worst-case scenario, a distance of 2.2 miles.  The facility is considered in a rural topography.\n\n\n\nAn accidental release prevention program that inc"

The WWTP is subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard and uses many elements of the PSM in its RMP accidental release prevention program.  The primary safeguard for the chlorine process is the on-duty operator, and alarms.\n\n\n\nThe WWTP also has several programs in place to prevent accidental chlorine releases.  Specifically, the facility trains operators on the proper operation of the chlorination process, uses state of the art safety equipment and implements a preventive maintenance program to ensure the process equipment is operating properly.\n\n\n\nThe WWTP has developed and implemented an Emergency Action Plan and an Emergency Operations Plan that contain provisions for trained employees to respond to incidental chlorine releases.  However in the event that the release is beyond the control of the operators, personnel have a mechanism in place to notify the Fire Department for assistance.  Equipment available for handling chlorine included Self-Contained Breathing Apparatus (SCBA).\n\n\n\nNo accidental chlorine releases have occurred at this facility in the last 5 years.\n\n\n\n\n\n"
