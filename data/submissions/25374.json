This system contains ammonia in the amount over the threshold requiring an RMP. \n\nC\nWorst - Case Scenario\nThe worst - case scenario was determined by finding the largest vessel containing the most ammonia. This vessel is also located outdoors. This vessel is the ammonia receiver located on the east side of the plant. According to the Plant Engineer , this vessel could contain as much as 10000 lbs. of ammonia, which is the maximum capacity of the receiver. This amount is used as the quantity Q since for the worst - case scenario, the vessel is assumed to be full. The time of release is 10 minutes. The rate of release, R, is calculated as 10000 lbs / 10 minutes = 1000 lbs. / minute. \n\nQ = 10000 lbs. ammonia\nT = 10 minutes\nR = 1000 lbs. Ammonia / minute\n \nC\nUsing Exhibit 4-4 from the EP"

This radius and the surrounding area are drawn on the city map of Omaha. Using information from the Census Bureau, the population enclosed by a radius of 1.2 miles from the source is 850.\n\nAlternative Scenario\nThe alternative scenario was chosen by contemplating scenarios involving off \u00bf site consequences.
