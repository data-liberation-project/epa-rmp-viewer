The facility has three (3) tanks (1-18,000 gallon and 2-11,000 gallon) that are designed and maintained in accordance with all applicable local state and federal rules and regulations.  Worst case scenario would release 79,000 pounds of Ammonia on approximately 800 citizens with a distance to end point of 1.89 miles.  This companys' policy is to train its employees in the safe handling of NH3 on a regular basis.  This allows us to report that there have been no accidents at this plant in the last five (5) years.  Our Emergency Response Plan is shared with our local fire department each year during our annual inspection tour of the facilities.  The Waterville Fire Department will be our first responder and have agreed to provide emergency service to this company."
