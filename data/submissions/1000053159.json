      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\n\nThis executive summary provides a brief overview of the Risk Management Program (RMP) and the associated policies at the Sandy Run Water Pollution Control Plant (Plant #2), owned by the City of Warner Robins and operated by ESG Operations, Inc.\n\n\n\n1.0    Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nESG Operations, Inc. believes it is important to provide a safe workplace to its employees and minimize the impact of its operations on the surrounding community and the environment.  Accordingly, ESG has developed proactive safety and environmental programs, which rely upon active employee participation and management leadership and support.  This same proactive philosophy was employed in the development and implementation of the Sandy Run WPCP RMP for the chlorine system.  ESG Operations, Inc. has determined that the OSHA Process Safety Management standard also applies to the chlorine storage and chlorination process and therefore has prepared this RMP to comply with the RMP Program 3 requirements.  By doing so, ESG affirms its proactive safety and environmental philosophy and acknowledges the inherent value of full RMP compliance.\n\n\n\nThe RMP prevention program is arguably the most important element of the rule.  It's program elements require the active participation of facility employees and management in conducting activities aimed at preventing accidental releases of chlorine, a regulated chemical under the RMP regulation.  If prevention activities could be completely successful, there would be no need for emergency response activities, since no releases would occur.  Accordingly, a well-developed and properly implemented prevention program will lower the possibility of an accidental release and minimize the consequences of a release should one occur.\n\n\n\nESG Operations, Inc. takes an active role in preventing accidental releases by ensuring that its employees are well-informed regarding the hazards associated with chlorine at the S"

The employees that work on the chlorine system are properly trained in the safe operation and handling of the chlorine system.  Refresher training is provided to the employees annually.  They are aided in this work by standard operating procedures.\n\n\n\nESG Operations, Inc. management understands its duty to provide a safe working environment and to take measures to prevent accidents which may have an effect on the surrounding community.  Additionally, ESG Operations, Inc. has established procedures for emergency notification and response. \n\n\n\n2.0 Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nThe Sandy Run WPCP owned by the City of Warner Robins is located in Warner Robins, Georgia.  The 12 MGD facility treats wastewater through a series of physical and chemical treatment operations.  Incoming wastewater initially passes through automated bar screens before being treated in aeration basins.  Clarification is accomplished in the secondary clarifiers for final solids precipitation followed by sand filtration.  Final effluent is disinfected by chlorination prior to discharge to the Sandy Run Creek.  Solids are digested aerobically and de-watered by gravity and belt filter press prior to landfill or are hauled for land application.\n\n\n\nThe Sandy Run WPCP utilizes chlorine as a biocide in the treatment of wastewater.  The chlorine is stored in one-ton cylinders with a maximum intended as indicated in the onsite plan.  Therefore, the Sandy Run WPCP is regulated under the RMP rule due to the volume of chlorine stored and used at the facility.   As required by the RMP Regulation, ESG Operations, Inc. has updated the Offsite Consequence Analysis.\n\n\n\n3.0     General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-specific Prevention \n\nSteps\n\n\n\nThe prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps are described in detail in the Sandy Run WPCP RMP manual.  The prevention program includes the following ele"

Management of Change procedures will be used for the upgrades to the chlorine system.\n\n\n\n4.0    Five Year Accident History\n\n\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of chlorine.\n\n\n\n5.0    Emergency Response Program\n\n\n\nThe facility has established and maintains an Emergency Response Program that is coordinated with local response agencies, including the Warner Robins Fire Department.  The program is described in detail in the manual and meets the requirements of 40 CFR 68.95, which includes facility notification to emergency responders and evacuation procedures.  The goals of the program are to protect onsite employees from the hazardous effects of chlorine release and to minimize the effects of such releases on the general public.  This program is routinely reviewed and updated to reflect personnel and regulatory changes.\n\n\n\n6.0    Planned changes for Improved Safety\n\n\n\nIdeas for changes to improve safety are actively sought from employees.  Employee participation meetings which focus on safety issues are held regularly at the Warner Robins WPCP.  Employees are encouraged and trained to recognize hazards and to present ideas to eliminate them or to minimize the potential consequences of such hazards.\n\n\n\nAs part of the development of the Warner Robins WPCP program, the PHA and the entire program was redone.  In June of 2007, the Warner Robins facility, under contract operations by Operations Management Incorporated (OMI) was subject to a massive police records seizure.  As such no records prior to 2007 are available for historic documentation purposes and consequently the plan was completely rewritten.  All deficiencies were addressed by Jan"
