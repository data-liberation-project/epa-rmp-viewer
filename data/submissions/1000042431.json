The Facility Policy:\n\n     The owners, management, and employees of Walters Cooperative Elevator Assoc., Walters, OK are committed to the \n\n     prevention of any accidential releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility\n\n     is prepared to work with the local fire department and other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the \n\n     impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n\n\n2.  Facility Information:\n\n   -The primary activity at the facility is the storage of fertilizer for sale to farmers.\n\n   -Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for the direct application of fertilizer for crop\n\n    production nutrients.\n\n\n\n3.  The worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario:\n\n   a.  The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes\n\n   b.  The alternative release scenario based on the most likely potential incident is a release from a break in a transfer hose. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion 200ppm) is 1.3 miles.\n\n\n\n4.  The accidental release preventation program.\n\n\n\n     The facility has\" referred to the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous\n\n     Ammonia, Kk-611.1\" published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc., and the standards of the\n\n     U.S. Occupatinal Safety and Health Admisistration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111,  \"Storage and handling of\n\n     Anhydrous Ammonia\".\n\n\n\n5.  The five-year Accident History:\n\n\n\n    -There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that:\n\n\n\n   -Have caused any death, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor\n\n   -To our knowledge have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage\n\n    or environmental damag"

Provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as\n\n     required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).\n\n\n\n7.  Planned Changes to Improve Safety.\n\n\n\n    Safety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are preformed to assess the\n\n    maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no additional anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations\n\n    for implementation at this time."
