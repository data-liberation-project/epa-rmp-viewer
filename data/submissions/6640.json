The Gilardi Foods facility has a thorough emergency training program for on-site emergency responders.  The facility has implemented Gilardi Food's HAZWOPER plan (emergency response program) which is a plan designed for the safety of its employees', the community and the environment.  This detailed emergency response program includes procedures for handling an emergency - the established action plan and appropriate personnel involved in containing a hazardous release (HAZMAT team).  As part of this emergency response program, Gilardi Foods emphasizes a thorough training program and medical surveillance of the HAZMAT team prior to and after an incident.  With the potential dangers associated with a hazardous chemical release, Gilardi Foods has researched and developed safe containment and disposal procedures as well as an evaluation procedure following an emergency response.  All of these components make the Gilardi Foods HAZWOPER plan a thorough and comprehensive plan for release prevention and emergency response.\n\nThe emergency response policies at the Gilardi Foods facility ensure that there is emergency response coverage 24 hours - 7 days per week.  There are also provisions for coordination with outside agencies such as the Troy Fire Department in the event of an emergency.\n\n*From this point in the Executive Summary, anhydrous ammonia will be synonymous with ammonia.\n\n\n2.0    Process Description and Regulated Substances\n\nGilardi Foods is a producer of prepared frozen food products, specifically process cheese, dry sausage, and frozen pizza.

      "SummaryText": "hese processes at this facility is 311412.  Many areas of the plant are refrigerated to preserve the food products. \n\nGilardi Foods has one regulated substance under 40 CFR 68: ammonia.  Ammonia is used as a refrigerant in the refrigeration of the foods in the various areas of the plant.\n\nThe ammonia threshold for triggering applicability to 40 CFR 68 is 10,000 pounds. The Troy plant has two separate ammonia refrigeration processes for the preservation of the food products.  The quantity of ammonia stored in the Engine Room #1 and Engine Room #2 refrigeration processes is approximately 13,631 pounds and 14,354 pounds, respectively.  Both of the processes exceed the threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds as set by 40 CFR 68 and are thus regulated.\n\n\n3.0    Worst-case and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nWorst-Case Scenario Description\n\n     40 CFR 68 requires that a single worst-case release be developed for a facility regardless of how many processes are present.  The largest potential release of ammonia would occur with a puncture in the liquid portion of the high pressure receiver.  Taking the specific definition of the worst-case from 40 CFR 68.25, the largest quantity of ammonia that can be stored in a vessel is in the high pressure receiver in Engine Room #2 during a pumpout condition.  The total quantity of ammonia that can be stored in the high pressure receiver is 20,736 pounds without administrative and passive controls.  The release would reach offsite endpoints and nearby receptors.\n\n    Alternative Release Scenario No. 1- Engine Room #1\n    \nThe alternative release scenario that meets both selection criteria is an ammonia release from a broken sight glass on the high pressure receiver.  The glass is located two feet above ground level.  Administrative and passive controls are not applicable to this scenario.  Active mitigation of the release is human intervention (system shutdown at 20 minutes from the start of the release).  The release would reach offsite endpoints and"

The line is located on the northern portion of the high pressure receiver at eight feet above ground level.  Administrative and passive controls are not applicable to this scenario.  Active mitigation of the release is human intervention (system shutdown at 20 minutes from the start of the release).  The release would reach offsite endpoints and nearby public receptors.  \n\n\n4.0    General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nGilardi Foods has developed an OSHA PSM program for their ammonia refrigeration systems. At Gilardi Foods, ammonia falls under the RMP Program 3 prevention program, which is identical to the OSHA PSM program.  EPA has said that if the process is in compliance with OSHA PSM, then it is compliance with RMP Program 3.  Thus, Gilardi Foods' ammonia PSM has been reviewed and determined to be complete for the RMP document.  \n\nThere are several aspects of the ammonia prevention program that are key:\n\n1.    The ammonia PSM program at Gilardi Foods includes provisions for employee involvement, procedures for working with contractors, pre-startup safety reviews and managing change within the system. The different sections of the PSM document detail employee participation (hazard analysis team), process safety information, process hazard analysis (PHA - what-if/checklist), operating procedures, training, mechanical integrity, hot work permits, management of change, incident investigation, compliance audits and emergency planning and response (HAZWOPER plan).  The plant, therefore, maintains good training, certification, and employee awareness of operating procedures.\n\n2.

Block flow diagrams and P&ID's have been developed and are updated as the ammonia refrigeration system audits are completed.\n\n3.    Gilardi Foods has established a hazards analysis team (comprising of plant employees) responsible for updating existing operating procedures for the refrigeration system and also verifying and documenting the mechanical integrity of the system.\n\n4.    In the event of a catastrophic release or an incident which could have resulted in a catastrophe, investigations will be undertaken (this is a policy of the PSM document).  Necessary preventative measures will be taken to reduce the risk of incident reoccurrence.\n\n\n5.0    Five-year Accident History\n\nThe review of Gilardi Foods' accident history includes the following range of dates: June 22, 1994 - June 21, 1999. According to 40 CFR Part 68.42(a), there have been no accidental releases at this facility.\n\n\n6.0    Emergency Response Program\n\nAs mentioned previously, the Gilardi Foods facility has developed an OSHA hazardous substance emergency response program called HAZWOPER. The HAZWOPER document contain detailed procedures for: 1) pre-emergency planning and coordination; 2) personnel roles and lines of authority; 3) training; 4) communication; 5) emergency recognition and prevention; 6) safe distances and places of refuge; 7) site security and control; 8) emergency alerting and response; 9) ammonia decontamination; 10) emergency medical treatment and first aid; 11) critique of response and follow-up; 12) personal protective and emergency equipment; and 13) medical surveillance.\n\nGilardi Foods' emergency response plan (HAZWOPER) is a detailed document, which discusses the role of employees and management in an emergency situation.
