Our policy is to integrate process controls and administrative procedures that are designed to prevent the release of regulated substances.

      "SummaryText": "ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICIES\r\n\t\r\nThe Willard CO2 Separation Plant is committed to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and consideration of safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  This facility, commissioned in August 1988, was designed and constructed utilizing generally accepted industry codes and recommended practices such as ANSI American National Standard Institute, ASME American Society of Mechanical Engineers, TEMA - Tubular Exchanger Manufacturers Association, and API American Petroleum Institute.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, plans have been developed to control and contain such a release.\r\n\t\r\n\tDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\r\n\t\r\nThe Willard CO2 Separation Plant is located in a rural area four (4) miles North of Denver City, Texas.  Denver City has a 2000 census population of approximately 3900.  Denver City is located in West Texas approximately 90 miles South of Lubbock, Texas and 90 miles North of Midland, Texas.  The plant processes a wet (H20) carbon dioxide rich (83% CO2) gas stream to produce a dry CO2 rich (86% CO2) natural gas stream for use in tertiary oil recovery projects in the immediate area.  Natural gas liquids (NGLs), sulfur, and hydrocarbon condensate oil are also produced from this process.  The plant has several regulated flammables, such as methane, ethane, propane, butanes and pentanes.  The propane storage is the most significant volume.  The Willard CO2 Separation Plant current capacity is 160 million standard cubic feet per day (MMSCFD).  \r\n\r\n\r\n        ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\r\n\r\n        The Occidental Permian Ltd.
