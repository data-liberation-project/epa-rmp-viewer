We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public as well as the protection of the environment.  Our goal is zero incidents.\n\nThe SPMWD follows and enforces a comprehensive safety program which includes a written Safety Manual and Risk Management Program Manual, an on-site safety officer who monitors the daily activity of the facility, as well as an independent consultant who provides on-site training and inspections.   The SPMWD is a member of the San Patricio Emergency Planning Committee and actively participates in emergency response drills with its industrial neighbors.\n\nFACILITY DESCRIPTION\n\nThe San Patricio Municipal Water District?s Ingleside Water Treatment Complex is located between Reynolds Aluminum and OxyMar Chemical on Highway 361 near Ingleside, Texas.  The area is rural and farming in nature.  The SPMWD treats and converts raw Nueces River and Lake Texana surface water into potable drinking water for the citizens of San Patricio, Nueces and Aransas Counties.  A separate facility located at this site treats water to industrial standards for OxyMar Chemical.  Raw untreated water is supplied to Dupont Chemical and Reynolds Metals from this site.  In the disinfection process, the SPMWD uses the RMP regulated chemical Chlorine.  The maximum amount of chlorine stored on the Ingleside Site is ten tons.\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND CHEMICAL -SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS \n\nThe SPMWD Maintenance and Operational Staff are highly trained and motivated in all areas of water processing.  A staff safety officer performs daily safety inspections.   An independent, professional safety cons"

The SPMWD Management is dedicated to the safe operation of all facilities.   All operational and maintenance personnel are trained in the handling and maintenance of the chlorination systems used at the Ingleside Facility.  A complete vacuum system has been installed to minimize the chance of an accidental release.  Chlorine leak detectors are in place and the entire chlorine system is computer monitored and controlled on a twenty-four hour basis.  The SPMWD has thirty-five years of experience in the safe handling of chlorine. \n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe SPMWD maintains records of all accidental releases.  It is the SPMWD?s opinion that any release would be a serious release.  The SPMWD Ingleside facility has an excellent safety and release prevention record; there have been no releases of RMP regulated substances (chlorine) in the past five years. The SPMWD has operated and maintained the Ingleside water plant for thirty-five years.  There has not been a chlorine release that produced off-site consequences during this entire thirty-five year period.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe SPMWD?s Emergency Response Program is in place and updated as necessary.  A nearby Emergency Response Team is available immediately on a 24-hour basis.  If a release were to occur, the LEPC (or CHEMTREC) would be notified, who in turn would contact the OxyMar Emergency Response Team, who as our neighbor would be the closest response team.  The San Patricio County Emergency Management Coordinator (who is also the LEPC contact) would be notified, this coordinator would then inform citizens by various means.  The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, and the Department of Public Safety would also be notified.  Once the emergency has passed, an incident investigation would be conducted and corrective action would be taken\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nT"
