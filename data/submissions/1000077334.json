Senior managment at Edwards Power Station is committed to offering superior service, and to maintain safety and environmental programs that promote a safe environment for all its employees and the surrounding communities.  Edwards Power Station administers safety and environmental policies at the facility to ensure compliance with the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) and the EPA Risk Management Program (RMP).  These programs include employee participation, training, written operating procedures, maintenance, inspections, safety committee meetings, and safety reviews/evaluations.  The facility also has a PSM/RMP Committe that meets regularly to review the Program components and ensure that all requirements are being met.  All of these programs are in effect at the facility to prevent the accidental release of ammonia.\n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\n\n\nEdwards Power Station is located at 7800 South Cilco Lane, Bartonville, Illinois 61607.  The system was designed and constructed in accordance with all applicable federal, state, and local regulations.\n\n\n\nThe system stores approximately 133,000 pounds of ammonia per year for the Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) system to help maintain air quality compliance of the stack emissions, specifically reducing NOx (NO and NO2) emissions.  The SCR process occurs naturally with the ammonia mixing and reacting with the flue gas.  Anhydrous ammonia is used as the reducing agent.  When in operating mode, the anhydrous ammonia system is automatically controlled based on system demand.  The anyhdrous ammonia is stored in two 30,420-gallon tanks, which are located outside of facility walls.  Site specific Program Operating Procedures limit the total amount of ammonia sto"

Much of the safety of the system is inherent in the policies and procedures that govern the operation of the system.  Edwards Power Station operates in accordance with the OSHA Process Safety Management and EPA Risk Management Program regulations.\n\n\n\nPolicies and procedures are utilized to ensure safe practices are being performed.  The ammonia system employed at the Edwards Power Station facility is equipped with various system controls and status indicators intended to minimize potential ammonia related accidents and to allow operators to monitor system operations.  The monitoring system is comprised of pressure indicators, as well as other system safeguards and methods for allowing facility operators to effectively monitor control operations.  These safety features in the SCR system include: ammonia sensors that sound a facility-wide alarm, an emergency shut down button that cuts off power to the SCR equipment, and relief valves on all pressure vessels.  \n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nThere have been no reportable ammonia releases at Edwards Power Station that exceeded the Federal Reportable Quantity of 100 pounds.  In addition, there have been no injuries resulting from any non reportable ammonia release.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nEdwards Power Station has an Emergency Response Plan in effect at the facility.  This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n\n\n  1.)  To save lives.\n\n  2.)  To minimize and avoid injuries.\n\n  3.)  To protect the environment.\n\n  4.)  To minimize property damage.\n\n\n\nEdwards Power Station maintains a safety committee whose members are the designated emergency coordinators for the facility.

This Plan will be reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations, as well as to incorporate any facility changes.\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nSince the last CDX submittal, the Edwards Power Station facility has evaluated or implemented the following improvements to the program: \n\n\n\n1. During the 2015 compliance Audit, a recommendation was made to evaluate the facility Hot Work program.  Corporate evaluated the program and issued a revised Hot Work procedure.\n\n\n\n2. Installed a Color Code Index for the Ammonia System to identify liquid ammonia, vapor ammonia, relief vent piping and direction of flow. \n\n\n\n3. Implemented an improved notification system for Contractor employees working near the Ammonia system.  \n\n"
