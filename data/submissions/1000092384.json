The owners, management and employees of Farmers Union Cooperative Company are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, the Saline County LEPC (part of 5-county Homestead LEPC), and/or other authorities, to mitigate and minimize the impacts of the release to the public and the environment.\n\n\n\n2.  Facility Information.  The primary activity at the facility is the distribution of products to farmers.  The fertilizer product, anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application as a nutrient for crop production.  Anhydrous ammonia is stored in tanks designed for this purpose.\n\n\n\n3.  Accident Release Prevention program.  This facility complies with state rules relating to the storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia. These regulations administered by the Fire Marshall are consistent with industry standard CGA G-2.1 (formerly ANSI K61.1) and the provisions of the U. S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia.\"\n\n\n\n4.  Five-Year Accident History.  There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia during the past five-years that have caused any deaths, injuries or significant property damage at the facility, nor to our knowledge, has there been any accidental releases resulting in off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n\n\n5.  Emergency Response Program.  The facility has an Emergency Action Plan in accordance with OSHA Standard 29 CFR 1910.38 and provides state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).  We do not plan to have our employees response to a major release.  I"
