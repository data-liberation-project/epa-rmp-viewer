Box 520\r\nOrange, Texas 77631\r\n\r\n|====================|\r\n|RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN|\r\n|====================|\r\n\r\nThe City of Orange, Meeks Drive Water Production Plant is a water production facility that stores chlorine.  Processes occurring at the Meeks Drive Water Production Plant are disinfection of water with chlorine and iron sequestration.  U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulation Title 40 Code of Federal Regulations Part 68 (40 CFR 68), Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions, requires The City of Orange, Meeks Drive Water Production Plant to comply with the Risk Management Program (RMP) rule because the quantity of chlorine stored on-site exceeds threshold quantities.  Iron sequestration does not involve any chemicals regulated by the RMP rule.\r\n\r\nThe RMP rule requires a facility to report the unit inventory for each RMP substance that exceeds threshold quantities, along with an EPA approved chemical release prevention program. In addition, 40 CFR 68 requires all RMP covered facilities to update its Risk Management Program Plan (RMP Plan) within (6) months of an RMP reportable incident or every five (5) years, whichever comes first.  In compliance with 40 CFR 68, the City of Orange, Meeks Drive Water Production Plant is submitting this five (5) year update to the plan that was initially submitted in 1999 and updated in 2004.  The City of Orange, Meeks Drive Water Production Plant currently holds the following RMP-regulated substances above threshold quantities:\r\n\r\nRegulated Chemical\tCAS Number\tCharacteristic\tThreshold (lbs)\r\nChlorine\t        7782-50-5       Toxic           2,500\r\n\r\n\r\n|================================|\r\n|KEY OFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS|\r\n|================================|\r\n\r\n40 CFR 68 requires all facilities, subject to the rule, to conduct an offsite consequence analysis to provide information to the public and state and federal environmental agencies about"

The Offsite Consequence Analysis (OCA) comprises 2 elements, a worst-case scenario (WCS) and an alternative release scenario (ARS).\r\n\r\n\r\n|===================|\r\n|WORST-CASE SCENARIO|\r\n|===================|\r\n\r\nAn offsite consequence analysis for the worst-case scenario (WCS) was conducted using the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidelines.  The RMP sets forth specific criteria that must be incorporated in modeling the worst-case scenario.  The EPA defines a WCS as one that results in the greatest distance from the point of release to a specified endpoint.  As defined by the rule, the endpoint for a toxic substance is a specified concentration while for flammables it is a specified overpressure from a vapor cloud explosion (VCE).\r\n\r\nThe WCS for the City of Orange, Meeks Drive Water Production Plant operations was calculated using the EPA RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidelines and the EPA OCA Look-up Tables.  Although numerous controls are in place to prevent chemical releases and manage such consequences should an incident occur, no credit for active mitigation measures was taken into account in evaluating this scenario.\r\n\r\nThe WCS for chlorine is a rupture, puncture, or valve failure that leads to total evacuation of the chlorine storage cylinder, which would result in a release of 2,000 lbs of chlorine with a release rate of 200 lb/min.  Based on the release rate of chlorine, the distance to the toxic endpoint is 3.0 miles.  This includes a population of approximately 17,306.\r\n\r\n\r\n|============================|\r\n|ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO|\r\n|============================|\r\n\r\nAlternative Release Scenarios (ARS) assess the potential hazards that are more realistic than worst-case scenarios and are designed to assist in the development of emergency response pl"

Although numerous controls are in place to prevent chemical releases and manage such consequences should an incident occur, no credit for active mitigation measures was taken into account in evaluating this scenario.\r\n\r\nThe ARS for chlorine is a failure of the compression fittings and loss of pressure in the chlorine lines in which the contents of a 15 foot section of 1/4-inch diameter tubing is released.  This would lead to a release of one (1) pound of chlorine.  Based on the release rate, the distance to the toxic endpoint is 0.1 miles.
