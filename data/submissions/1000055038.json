(FFS) has prepared a Risk Management Plan (RMP) for the Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant (PGDP) in accordance with the requirements set forth in 40 CFR Part 68.  The PGDP facility is subject to Process Safety Management (PSM) and RMP requirements. \n\n\n\n2.  MANAGEMENT AND ORGANIZATION \n\n\n\nIt is FFS's policy to provide a safe and healthy workplace for all people supporting the project. FFS is dedicated to the belief that all injuries, accidents, and incidents are preventable and is committed to integrating safety and other operational requirements (e.g., environmental, quality, security) into all aspects of work planning and execution.\n\n \n\n3.  GENERAL DESCRIPTION\n\n\n\n3.1  Facility Description and Location\n\n\n\nPGDP formerly enriched uranium using the gaseous diffusion process.  PGDP is located at 37A? 6' 55\" N. latitude and 88A? 48' 34\" W. longitude measured at the approximate center of the plant, on a 3,423-acre tract (and 133 acres in easements) in McCracken County, Kentucky. The site is in a generally rural area and previously was part of Kentucky Ordnance Works.  PGDP occupies approximately 650 acres within the Controlled Access Area. Highway U.S. 60 is the closest major highway and intersects the plant access road 3.5 miles south of the plant. Interstate Highway 24 is to the east of the plant and intersects U.S. 60 near the present city limits of Paducah.  The north, east, and west boundaries of the plant are defined by the West Kentucky Wildlife Management Area.  Adjoining the reserve on the north is the Tennessee Valley Authority's Shawnee Fossil Plant, which is located on the Ohio River. The entire PGDP facility is owned by the U. S. Department of Energy (DOE).  \n\n\n\nUSEC leased and operated a portion of the PGDP facility for enrichment operations. The leased portion contained the facilities that handled chemicals that required an RMP. USEC ceased enrichment operations and returned the facilities to DOE and its dea"

This update of the RMP reflects this change to deactivation operations by FFS. \n\n\n\n3.2  Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nChlorine and fluorine are the only substances listed in 40 CFR 68.130 present in quantities exceeding their respective threshold quantity.  Chlorine and fluorine are managed in accordance with the requirements of 29 CFR 1910.119, PSM program.\n\n\n\n3.3  Use of Regulated Substances\n\n\n\n3.3.1  Chlorine\n\n\n\nRaw water is taken from the Ohio River, treated, and supplied to PGDP for numerous uses.  A portion of the water is filtered and post-disinfected, using chlorine, and then used to supply potable water, fire system water, cooling water, and for other uses.  Raw water treatment takes place at the C-611 Water Treatment Plant, which is located to the west of the plant.  Chlorine is used at two locations at C-611.  \n\n\n\nDuring deactivation, the recirculating cooling water system no longer treats cooling water with chlorine. For this reason, four RCW pump houses (C-631, C-633, C-635, and C-637) to control the growth of microorganisms in the RCW system have been deleted from the RMP.   \n\n\n\n3.3.2  Fluorine\n\n\n\nFluorine is used as a fluorinating agent for conditioning new equipment surfaces prior to uranium hexafluoride exposure and may be used to dry equipment after exposure to wet air.  The fluorine system primarily consists of the C-410-K Fluorine Facility, the C-410-D Fluorine Storage Building, and the distribution piping, valves, and instrumentation.  Fluorine is purchased as a 20% fluorine/80% nitrogen molar mixture, and it is delivered in U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT)-approved multi-tube trailers.  A full DOT-approved trailer nominally contains 1,800 lb of fluorine at 2,000 psig that is distributed in eight separate tubes (i.e., nominally 225 lb of fluorine per tube).  One nominally full and  one nominally empty (i.e., heeled) multi-tube trailer may be stored in both the C-745-A and C-745-B storage yards.  W"

      "SummaryText": "hen needed, a full multi-tube trailer is moved to C-410-K, where the gas pressure is reduced to defined levels and then is fed to the storage tanks or the pressure reducing manifolds in \n\nC-410-D.  The pressure of the gas mixture is reduced further at the C-410-D pressure reducing manifolds and then fed to the fluorine distribution header for distribution to other plant locations.  \n\n \n\n4.  FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nThere have been no major releases of chlorine or fluorine involving injury to site workers, environmental effects, or any impact to the public within the past five years.  \n\n\n\n5.  ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n\n\nChemical safety at PGDP consists of the integration of environmental, safety, and health management systems to address chemical safety.  Chemical safety controls are designed to mitigate the adverse affects of the hazardous materials and toxic substances used in the enrichment process to workers, the public, and the environment.  To achieve this objective, safety analyses, process hazard analyses, and industrial hygiene and safety programs are utilized.  PSM Process Hazards Analyses (PHAs) are used to identify and manage chemical risks and impacts.  Specific job-related risks and the technical and administrative controls used for risk management are addressed in the PHAs. \n\n\n\nAccident scenarios 1 and 2 assume 25% fluorine concentration in the gas released compared to the actual 20% fluorine concentration. This is a conservative assumption for the scenario.\n\n\n\n5.1  Control Systems\n\n\n\nSeveral passive and active control systems are used to minimize the accidental release of chlorine and fluorine.\n\n\n\n5.1.1 Chlorine\n\n\n\nAll chlorine feed facilities utilize a vacuum feed system. The feed systems are equipped with container-mounted vacuum regulators that reduce the pressure of the chlorine from the vapor pressure of the liquid chlorine in the container to a partial vacuum.  Loss of vacuum for any reason causes the vacuum-regulating valve to "

      "SummaryText": "close the gas supply, minimizing the release in the event of a break in the manifold.\n\n\n\nAll chlorine feed facilities are equipped with chlorine detectors, which provide alarms to plant personnel in the event of a release.\n\n\n\nManually operated, remote valve closing rods are administratively required to be in place on the stem of open, 1-ton chlorine container valves.  These valves can be operated from outside of the chlorinator rooms in the event of a release from the manifold system.\n\n\n\n5.1.2 Fluorine\n\n\n\nThe pressure reducing manifold regulators in C-410-K are housed in a ventilated enclosure.  Isolation valves in this manifold will automatically close and an alarm is activated if the F2 concentration in the enclosure's ventilation exhaust exceeds specified limits.  Pneumatically operated valves in the manifold will also automatically close if pressure exceeds specified limits during tube feeding or heeling operations.  During tube feeding operations, pneumatically controlled valves will automatically close and an alarm is activated if pressure downstream of the pressure reducing manifold exceeds specified limits or if the upstream piping experiences a rapid pressure drop that exceeds specified limits.  The high pressure control protects downstream equipment from a potential pressure regulation control failure during tube feed operations and the rapid pressure drop control minimizes the release that could result from a pigtail/connection failure.  During tube heeling operations, the feeding pressure regulation controls can be bypassed;  however, a control valve in the bypass line will not open unless the pressure upstream of the valve is below a specified pressure.  This control ensures that only low pressure tubes can be valved in to the process system during tube heeling operations.  Isolation valves will automatically close and an alarm is activated if the downstream pressure is higher than the upstream pressure.  This control minimizes back feed if a pigtail/co"

If these control valves fail during operation, system equipment is protected by a pressure relief system on the low pressure side of the pressure reducing manifold. \n\n\n\nThe fluorine distribution header in C-410-D is supported by two pressure reducing manifolds.  The manifold regulators are housed in separate ventilated enclosures.  One manifold typically is bypassed, while the other is used to regulate the pressure of the fluorine distribution header to a nominal 5 psig.  Isolation valves in these manifolds will close automatically, and an alarm is activated if the F2 concentration in the enclosures' ventilation exhaust exceeds specified limits.  Pneumatically operated isolation valves in the pressure reducing manifolds close automatically if the pressure in the fluorine distribution header exceeds specified limits.\n\n\n\n5.2  Procedures\n\n\n\nPlant procedures are prepared in accordance with the requirements of a formal procedure system.

The Emergency Management Plan provides an overall description of the comprehensive sitewide emergency preparedness program and is based in large measure on the emergency preparedness policies, procedures, and practices that have been used successfully at PGDP for over 40 years. This program has been established to manage and respond in a consistent and integrated way to accidents or other emergency situations that may occur at the site. The structure of this program is intended to ensure that the consequences of emergencies are promptly mitigated and that the health and safety of the public, personnel on the surrounding DOE Reservation, and site personnel are protected, regardless of the cause or nature of the emergency.  The Emergency Management organization is responsible for maintaining and updating the plan, as appropriate.  \n\n\n\n6.1  Organization\n\n\n\nThe Emergency Response Organization (ERO) is responsible for taking immediate mitigative and corrective actions to minimize the consequences of an incident involving the release of hazardous materials and toxic substances to workers, public health and safety, and the environment.  The ERO is staffed with trained personnel who respond to events and are required to participate in formal training, drills, and exercises.\n\n\n\nThe ERO consists of the following:\n\n\n\n  Plant Shift Superintendent (PSS)\n\n  Security/Protective Force\n\n  Fire Services/Emergency Squad\n\n  Operating shift, nonsupervisory, supervisory, and specialist personnel\n\n  Emergency medical support\n\n\n\nThe site ERO is staffed 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
