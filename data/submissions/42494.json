Facility Policy\n\n     The owners, management, and employees of Old Mill Grain and Seed Co. Of Harrisonville, Mo. (the facility) are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire depatrtment, or other authorities, to mitigate and minimize the impacts of the release to the people and the environment.\n\n2.  Facility Information\n\n     The primarty activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers. Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for both direct application and for blending into mixed-grade fertilizers for crop production nutrients.\n\n3.    Worst-Case Scenario and Alternate Release Scenario\n\n       a.  The worst case scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released as a gas overa period of 10 minutes. The maximum quantity released would 46,750 lbs, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85% capacity as limited by design standards. The distance to the end point (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 1.7 miles.\n\n        B.  The alternate release scenario, based on the five-year accident history (or the most most likely potential incident) is a release from a break in a transfer hose. The distance to the endpoint ( point of dispersion) is 1.6 miles.\n\n4.     Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\n        The Facility has been reviewed for general compliance with the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and \n        handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by The American National Standards Institue, Inc. (ANSI), and the \n        standards S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and handling of \n        anhydrous ammonia\". The OSHA standard i"

Five-Year Accidental History\n\n        There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that: have caused any deaths, \n         injuries, of significant property damage at the facility; nor to our knowledge, have resulted in off-site deaths, injuries,    \n         evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n6.     Emergency Response Program\n\n        The facilty has:\n\n        a.  A written action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.38;\n        b.  Provided state and local authorities with emergenct planning and community right-to-know information as required under \n             SARA Title III (EPCRA)\n        c.  A written emergency response program, in accordance with OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.120 including pre-emergency \n             planning and employee training.\n\n7.     Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n        Safety improvement is an on going process at the facility. Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of \n        safe conditions. There are no specific recommendations regarding storage or use of anhydrous ammonia for implementation \n        at this time."
