The City of McMinnville Wastewater Treatment Plant is located in the Southeastern portion of the city limits of McMinnville in the County of Warren in the State of Tennessee.  Warren County is located just South of the center of the Western edge of the Cumberland Plateau.  The City of McMinnville is located at an elevation about 1,000 feet above sea level and is encircled on two sides by mountainous peaks rising to approximately 1,200 feet above the City.\nB.  The McMinnville Wastewater Plant serves the City of McMinnville.  The plant is permitted by the State of Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation Division of Water Pollution Control.  The National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System No. TN0023591.  The design criteria of the plant is 4,000,000 gallons per day.  The chlorine is used for disinfection of the wastewater before it is returned to the Barren Fork River.\nC.  The Wastewater Plant's maximum inventory of chlorine can be up to 8,000 lbs.  The chlorine is kept in a separate containment room that is constructed of concrete, brick and block with no potential fire hazards.  The containment room is equipped with a Wallace & Tiernan Series 50-315 Chlorine Gas Detector that is capable of detecting very low concentrations of chlorine in the air (warning level set at 1 ppm).  When the detector is triggered it will energize the warning lamp and alarm on the control panel in the operation building.\nD.  The chlorinator room is equipped with two Series V-2000 Remote Vacuum V-notch Chlorinators which is also equipped with a Wallace & Tiernan Series 50-135 Chlorine Gas Detector that is also wired into the control panel in the operation building.  The plant is manned 24-hours a day which with the low level detection system, it will give a quicker response to any chlorine leak.\nE.  The Wastewater Plant has used ton chlorine containers since 1968 without any accidental releases.  We always implement and practice the stringent and most recent safety standa"

The offsite consequence analysis includes consideration of two chlorine release scenarios.  The Worst Case Release Scenario was modeled using EPA's RMP Guidance Exhibit 4-3.  The 2000 lbs. of chlorine gas is lost in 10 minutes outside the building.  Therefore, the distance to the toxic endpoint is 1.3 miles for an urban area.  The estimated population from the U.S. Census Tract/Block Map is 5,000 people.\n\nThe Alternative Release Scenario was modeled using EPA's RMP Guidance Exhibit 4-15.  The 1 Inch diameter hole has a release rate of 150 lbs. per min.  The distance to the toxic endpoint is 0.2 miles for the urban area.  The estimated population from the U.S. Census Tract/Block Map is 349 people."
