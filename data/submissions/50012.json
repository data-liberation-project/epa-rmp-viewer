Flammable propellants, including propane, butane and methyl ether (DME), are used to pressurize  a majority of our product containers. All propellants are stored within the four (4) tanks located in our tank farm. Each tank is limited to 85% of capacity by administrative controls. The largest of the tankls has a twelve thousand (12,000) gallon capacity . (10,200 when de-rated to the 85% capacity level) The remaining tanks range from eighteen hundred (1,800) to five thousand (5,000) gallons nominal capacity. Propellants arepumped from the tank farm to a specially desgned Gas House where the aerosol cans are pressurized. Subsequently, the cans are mechanically conveyored into the plant from the Gas House for testing, inspection, packaging and shipment.\n\nWorst Case Scenario :\nOur worst case would be the release of the contents of our largest tank. If the tank contained n-butane, forty nine thousand five hundred (49,500) pounds of flammable propellant would be released into the environment. This occurance would have an off-site impact, based upon the use of EPA RMP* Comp program.\n\nAlternative Case S"

We calculate that the leak would be detected and corrected within ten (10) minutes. This malfunction would result in the release of nine hundred (900) pounds into the environment and cause an off-site impact extending outward 0.08 miles (420 feet) as calculated by  the use of EPA RMP* Comp program.\n\nAccident Prevention Program:\nThe use of flammable propellants in our facility, has been subject to the Delaware Extremely Hazardous Substanve Risk Management Act (EHSRMA) and the OSHA Process Safety Management standard (29CFR 1910.119) since operations commenced in 1994. The facility has a reviewed and updated risk management system in place to meet these requirements and to minimize the potential for accidental release of thease substances . Our management system includes:\nProcess hazard analysis to identify and correct potential hazards\nManagement of change procedures to assure that standards are maintained and potentiial new hazards are identified and evaluated.\nMechanical integrity procedures designed to determine MTBF (mean time between failures) of equipment to minimize mechanical issues.\nDetailed operating procedures for process control.\nTraining for personnel involved in operating and maintaining the processes.\nFacility design allows for multiple layers of incident prevention.\n\nFive (5) Year Accident History\nDuring the past five (5) years, this facility has not had any accidental releases of dflammable substances thatresulted in on-site injuries or damge and no off-site impacts.\n\nEmergency Response Program\nAdvanced Aerosol Technologies, Inc has a written emergency response plan wihich has been updated and reviewed with the last month. It has been coordinated with the Sussex County Emergency Planning Committee (L.E.P.C.) and the Seaford Fire Department. Key per"
