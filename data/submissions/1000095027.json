Whatever its form, it may present a potentially serious threat to company operations, health and safety of employees and the surrounding community.  Therefore, it is essential that all employees working at this site be aware of potential emergency situations, to plan for them, and to follow the written emergency procedures should an emergency occur.\n\nThe purpose of these procedures is to provide information and establish guidelines for responding to emergencies.  Our procedures include requirements for emergency notification to outside agencies, emergency communications within the plant, emergency shutdown procedures, evacuation plans and training.  \n\nThe entire corporation is seriously committed to continuously improving the safety of its operations.  We work closely with the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC), local fire departments, safety and environmental consultants, chemical suppliers, and corporate and sister facilities safety & environmental professionals to help the facility make continuous improvements.\n\nFacility operations:\n\nThe facility is known as a manufacturer of surfactants.  The principal products include food ingredients, Kosher specialty oils, fabric softeners, and specialty surfactants.  These ingredients are used in food, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, and personal care products.  The facility is committed to protecting human health and the environment and hazardous materials are managed in accordance with applicable health, safety and environmental regulations.  \n\nAccidental release prevention program:\n\nOur facility is subject to OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) standard.  As a result we have a comprehensive written safety program used to ensure a safe operation and prevent accidental releases of regulated substances.  The equipment used to process these regulated substances are equipped with early warning alarms for pres"

In this capacity, the SHE Manager coordinates preplanning of emergency services with the LEPC, local health care facilities, police department, various fire departments and contracted spill response teams.  \n\nFor large scale releases of regulated substances this facility would rely upon 911 emergency response services provided by the local and regional fire departments.  \n\nPlanned changes to improve safety:\n\nWe have a multi-year phased approach for continuously improving the safety of our operations.  Examples of this include:\n\n* The systematic replacement of carbon steel process equipment with stainless steel.\n* Upgrading early warning systems to increase the sites abilities to respond even more quickly.\n* Upgrading fire protection and other mitigation systems."
