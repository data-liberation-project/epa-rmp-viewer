The facility is currently on a lease agreement utilizing the referigeration and cold storage systems for citrus products storage.\n\nThe refrigeration system exceeds the 10,000 pound RMP treshold quantity.  The refrigeration system is located in the southwest corner of the property in two compressor rooms.  Both systems are interconnected and is considered as one process for RMP purposes.  The high pressure receiver storage vessel (anhydrous ammonia tank) is located outside the main compressor room.  This tank is the largest capacity vessel in the ammonia refrigeration systems capable of holding 5,185 pounds and was used in the worst case offsite consequence analysis.\n\nThis facility has the capacity to exceed the anhydrous ammonia treshold quanity and requires the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) Program covered in 29 CFR 1910.119.  This facility uses its PSM as the required Program 3 Prevention Program.  Periodic audits will be conducted as required by the regulation.  The PSM program includes a preventative maintenance plan which requires all ammonia referigeration equipment to be periodically inspected and serviced.  This will ensure that the equipment remains in good operating order and minimize the probability of accidents due to faulty equipment.  In developing the PSM Program the facility also developed written operating procedures for the refrigeration process.  These procedures cover all phases of operation and include safety devices.  Other PSM procedures include operator training, management of change, pre-startup and shut-down safety reviews, compliance audits, and incident investigations to ensur"
