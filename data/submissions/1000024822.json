This commitment is demonstrated by significant investments of resources to prevent releases of hazardous substances and for accident prevention, such as employee participation and training, and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of processes.  Valvoline policy is to implement practical controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous substances.  However, if a release does occur, Valvoline has a well-defined emergency action plan and controls to contain the release.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\r\n\r\nThe Valvoline Plant, located in Hernando, Mississippi, produces a variety of car-care products.  The facility consists of an outdoor tank farm and administrative and manufacturing buildings where the finished products are processed and packaged.  These products are well known under the Valvoline and Pyroil brand name.  The plant has an excellent safety and environmental record, with a high level of employee involvement and commitment to operational excellence.  \r\n\r\nThe Valvoline Plant has one manufacturing process (starting fluid manufacturing process) that uses a flammable substance - ethyl ether - listed in the EPA's Risk Management Plan (RMP) rule.  There are no toxic regulated substances above the threshold quantity at the site.  The starting fluid manufacturing process involving ethyl ether consists of storage, blending and packaging.  The process operations are covered by OSHA's process safety management (PSM) standard and are considered Program Level 3 for the RMP rule.  \r\n\r\nA Product Distribution Center (warehouse), located on adjoining property (separated by railroad tracks), stores the finished products, containing ethyl ether, butane, and propane.

There are no public receptors within a distance to an endpoint from a worst-case scenario;\r\n     2.   The warehouse has had no release of a regulated substance in the past five years resulting\r\n          in offsite exposure or consequences; and\r\n     3.   The warehouse emergency response activities are coordinated with the local responders. \r\n\r\nPROCESS 1.

Because the plant process regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) Risk Management Plan (RMP) regulation is also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management systems in place to implement the accidental release prevention program.\r\n\r\nEmployee Participation\r\n\r\nThe Valvoline Plant conducts its business using a teamwork approach.  A number of business and operational\r\nteams provide an active forum for employee participation in the implementation of PSM standard elements. \r\nExamples of employee involvement range from participation in process hazard analysis to development of operating procedures.  Employees have access to all information created as a part of the prevention program.  Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accidental release prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan in the PSM Manual.

These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits\r\nfor key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis and configuration information.  Specific procedures for maintaining current and accurate process safety information is listed in the PSM Manual.\r\n\r\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs).  This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  The Valvoline Plant has established safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g. level, composition) in process documentation.  The Valvoline Plant ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly-trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g. automated shutdown).\r\n\r\nThe Valvoline Plant also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and\r\nconstruction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment.

To date we have not had any incidents that qualify for the 5-year history required under RMP.  \r\n\r\nCompliance Audits\r\n\r\nTo help ensure that the accidental release prevention program is functioning properly, Ashland, Valvoline's parent company, conducts a PSM/RMP compliance audit at least once every three (3) years to determine whether procedures and practices required by the accidental release prevention program have been implemented and are maintained. The audit team is multidisciplinary and includes personnel knowledgeable in process safety and plant operations.  The team conducts the audit using protocols based on compliance requirements, company standards and industry practices and develops findings that are forwarded to Valvoline plant management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until they are resolved.  The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are retained.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROCESS-SPECIFIC SAFEGUARDS TO PREVENT ACCIDENTAL RELEASE SCENARIOS\r\n\r\nThe regulated process at the Valvoline Plant has hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation.

Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\r\n\r\nThe Valvoline Plant uses one of the following methodologies:  What-If, Checklist, What-if/Checklist, Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) analysis techniques or an appropriate equivalent methodology, to perform these evaluations.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accidental release prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional safeguards when the team believes such measures are needed.\r\n\r\nThe PHA team findings are evaluated by local and corporate management for resolution.  Implementation of\r\nmitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.\r\nThis ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk ranking receive prompt attention.  All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are\r\ncompleted.  The formal resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\r\n\r\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the Plant periodically updates and revalidates process hazard analysis results.

The following is a description of existing process-specific safety features applicable to prevention of accidental releases of a regulated substance in the facility.  These safeguards, combined with the general prevention program described in the previous sections, collectively help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human errors.\r\n\r\nRelease Detection / Prevention\r\n\r\nThe ethyl ether storage tank, TK-38, has a maximum allowable working pressure (MAWP) of 15 psig.  This tank is\r\nequipped with a pressure relief valve set at 8 psig and an emergency relief valve set at 15 psig.  The two ethyl ether blend tanks, TK-36 & TK-37, have a maximum allowable working pressure (MAWP) of 20 psig.  They are equipped with pressure relief valves set at 8 psig and emergency relief valves set at 15 psig.  The normal operating pressure range for all three of these ethyl ether storage tanks is 1-7 psig, providing a safety margin before challenging the pressure relief devices.\r\n\r\n    All storage tanks' vapor space is blanketed with nitrogen to eliminate oxygen within the tank.  (The nitrogen supply is regulated to maintain a minimum of 1 psig blanket pressure).\r\n\r\n    Low oxygen level in the ether storage tanks reduces overall corrosion rates.\r\n\r\n    Ether with a stabilizer is purchased to minimize formation of hydrogen peroxide (and other ether decomposition products).  Each shipment is received with a Certificate of Analysis for the stabilized contents and hydrogen peroxide levels.\r\n\r\n    Ether contains an extremely low level of water, thus minimizing corrosion rate.   \r\n    \r\n    Periodic preventive maintenance is managed and performed using GPMate, a computerized maintenance management system. \r\n\r\n    Administrative practice is implemented to close manual valves on process tanks in use in the event of a process shutdown (e.g. weekends, nights, emergencies)."
