Tronox has prepared a policy stating this commitment and has provided the resources to meet the requirements of these guiding principles.  The programs that have been developed to meet the requirements of Process Safety Management and the Risk Management Program are based on these standards.\n\nThe products produced at the Hamilton Facility are sodium chlorate and titanium dioxide pigment.  Chlorine is used in the manufacture of titanium dioxide pigment and in the cooling tower and water treatment systems in both plants.  Titanium tetrachloride is used in the production of titanium dioxide pigment.  The facility has prepared a worst case scenario for chlorine and alternative case scenarios for titanium tetrachloride and chlorine.  In the past five years, three releases of chlorine and two releases of titanium tetrachloride resulted in seven injuries onsite, and one release of titanium tetrachloride resulted in offsite sheltering-in-place.  The quantity released for three of the six events has been estimated.\n\nThe facility has taken numerous steps to help prevent releases from its operations.  Pressure relief valves and excess flow valves are in place on storage tanks.  Water deluge systems and diking of tanks and vessels are being utilized.  In addition, standard operating procedures (SOPs) and job safety and environmental analyses (JSEAs) have been developed at the facility.\n\nThe Hamilton Facility has developed an Emergency Response Plan that meets the requirements of Subpart E of RMP.  The Emergency Response Plan is site-specific and has been shared with the LEPC.  Facility employees are trained to respond to an emergency as described in the Emergency Response Plan and in the use of the necessary personal protective equipment to respond to releases at the facility.  \n\nThe Hamilton Facility is an OSHA Star site.  The facility has implemented prevention programs that meet the requirements of "
