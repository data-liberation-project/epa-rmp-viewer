The original RMP was prepared by Primatech in accordance with the requirements of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk  Management Program (RM Program) regulation (Risk Management Programs for Chemical Accidental Release Prevention, 40 CFR Part 68).  The information presented in this report reflects the data element requirements of the EPA RMP. \n\n \n\nA.         Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n \n\nUnilever - Sikeston One Plant recognizes management's responsibility in protecting its employees, equipment, property, and the environment.  The safety and health of all personnel are very important.  The control of accidents has been and will continue to be a basic responsibility of all personnel in the Sikeston, MO North facility.\n\n \n\nTo accomplish the Company's goal in controlling accidental losses, the facility has established a Plant Safety Program and a Plant Safety Team.  The objectives of the Plant Safety Program are to:  achieve maximum efficiency and safety performance, reduce losses associated which damage property, and the economic burden resulting from injuries and accidents.\n\n \n\nOne of the activities associated with the Plant Safety Program has been the development and implementation of accidental release prevention and emergency response programs which are designed to comply with OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals, 29 CFR 1910.119), and EPA's Risk Management Program (RM program) regulation (Risk Management Programs for Chemical Accidental Release Prevention, 40 CFR Part 68).  The site also complies with all bioterrorism requirements from the FDA and Department of Homeland Security.  The Engineering Services Manager is responsible for implementation of the R"

      "SummaryText": "isk Management Program.\n\n \n\nThe purpose of the accidental release prevention and emergency response programs is to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of toxic substances as well as fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents.  Overall, these programs prevent accidental fatalities, injuries and illnesses and avoid physical property damage. \n\n \n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response programs help prevent accidents because they focus on the rules, procedures, and practices which govern individual processes, activities, or pieces of equipment.  These rules are detailed and improved as necessary.  They are also communicated to and accepted by all employees at the facility.\n\n \n\nB.         Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\n \n\nUnilever - Sikeston One Plant operates an ice cream production facility in Sikeston, MO.  The facility operates an ammonia refrigeration system to provide cooling and freezing capabilities.  The amount of anhydrous ammonia (CAS #7662-41-7) contained in the system is in excess of 10,000 pounds.  Since an ammonia release from the system could pose a risk of offsite public impact and the system is regulated under the OSHA PSM standard (29 CFR 1910.119), the system is subject to the Program 3 requirements of the EPA's RM program.\n\n \n\nC.         Description of the Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\n \n\nThe prevention program consists of the following elements:\n\n \n\n>Employee Participation:  This program involves the employees in establishing and implementing the program.  Employees are also to be involved when a process hazard analysis is conducted.  The program also ensures that all employees have complete access to the program.\n\n \n\n>Process Safety Information:  Written information has been collected which enables the employees to identify and understand the potential hazards in the system.  The written information includes the ammonia SDS and a description"

The contractors are also periodically evaluated to ensure that they perform work by following safe work practices.\n\n \n\n>Pre-Startup Safety Review:  A pre-startup safety review is completed for all new ammonia projects to verify that all safety programs are in place, training has been performed, and construction has been completed according to design standards before the project is put into use.\n\n \n\n>Mechanical Integrity:  This program ensures that the ammonia refrigeration systems are built and maintained using preventive maintenance procedures to minimize unexpected breakdowns or failures.\n\n \n\n>Hot Work Permit:  These procedures ensure that a signed permit is obtained prior to any cutting, welding, or burning. \n\n \n\n>Management of Change:  The procedures are designed to ensure that all changes made to the ammonia refrigeration system are properly reviewed. \n\n \n\n>Incident Investigation:  The procedures ensure that any incidents (and near misses) are investigated, reviewed, and documented using an investigation team.\n\n \n\n>Compliance Audits:  There are procedures to conduct regular audits of the prevention program to ensure that the program is in place and working properly.\n\n \n\nD.
