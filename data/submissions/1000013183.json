Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies.\n\n     The owners and employees of C & M Supply are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, we are prepared to work with the local fire department and other emergency response authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information\n\n     C & M Supply Inc. is an ag-supply business that sells fertilizers, farm chemicals, and fuels.  Our facility's main plant is in Ruskin, Nebraska , but we also operate a satellite plant near the town of Oak, Nebraska.  This facility has no permanent on-site employees and serves mainly as a storage facility.  The Oak plant holds a reportable quantity of anhydrous ammonia for storage and distribution to customers.  The maximum quanitity of anhydrous ammonia stored in our two tanks (12,000 gallons and 8,000 gallons) is 82,000 pounds.\n\n3. Worst-Case and Alternative Release Scenarios.\n\n     Anhydrous Ammonia worst case: The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of both storage tanks as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 82,000 pounds, which represents the weight of the contents of the storage tanks at 80 percent capacity as limited by company operating procedures.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 parts per million) is 4.2 miles.\n\n     Anhydrous ammonia alternative: The alternative release scenario based on the most likely potential incident is a release from a break in a transfer hose.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 parts per million) is 0.4 miles.\n\n4. Accidental Release Prevention Program.\n\n     For the handling of anhydrous ammonia, the facility has implemented the provisions of Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1, published by The"

In addition, our storage tanks meet the standards of the american Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME).\n\n5. Five-Year Accident History.\n\nOur facility has not had any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the last five years that resulted in deaths injuries of significant property damage on site or any known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place , property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n6. Emergency Response Program.\n\n     The facility has prepared a written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.38; has provided authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA); and has prepared a written emergency response program, in accordance with OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.120, including pre-emergency planning and employee training.\n\n7. Planned changes To Improve Safety.\n\n     Safety improvement is as on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to asses the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
