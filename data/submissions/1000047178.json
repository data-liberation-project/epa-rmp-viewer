EXECUTIVE SUMMARY INTRODUCTION 68.155\n\n\n\nThe City of Frederick Utilities Department operates the Monocacy Water Treatment Plant at 1950 North Market Street, Frederick, Frederick County, Maryland.  This plant is one of four water plants operated by the City.  The City also operates one wastewater treatment plant.  The Monocacy water plant as well as the Linganore water plant and the wastewater plant have quantities of regulated hazardous chemicals above the EPA threshold.  The City has a unified Risk Management Program which applies to each plant.  Only the Monocacy Water Treatment Plant operations and policies are presented in this Plan.\n\n\n\n1.1.  ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION/EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES (A)\n\nThe City of Frederick Water Treatment Plant accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates technologies, procedures and management practices.  The plant prevention program complies with all applicable procedures of the U.S.  Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) 40 CFR-68 Prevention Program as well as Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA) 22-CFR-1910-119 under the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990.\n\n\n\n1.2.  MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS (A) (1)\n\nThe City of Frederick has a management system in place which is lead by the City's Mayor, who delegates implementation and on-going use of the RMP elements to the Public Works Department Deputy Director Operations.  The Deputy Director delegates the RMP program to the Utilities Assistant Deputy Director Operations who has responsibility for water treatment plant operations and RMP Program implementation.   The City organization chart defines the RMP program lines of authority.   This program, along with other City-wide and plant-specific policies, eliminates and/or reduces the likelihood and severity "

An organizational chart defining the lines of authority and responsible staff is included in the plant's RMP Process Safety Information and is attached to the RMP *eSubmit..\n\n\n\n1.3.  PREVENTION PROGRAM LEVEL 3 (A) (2)\n\nThe City of Frederick maintains policies, procedures and systems as part of their prevention program.  These are applied to each treatment plant and specifically the Monocacy Water Treatment Plant.  The program address each of the EPA's, RMP Level 3 Program-listed 12 elements needed to implement the program, and the like elements in place in the plant's OSHA PSM program.  The City is in compliance with both.  These documents are maintained and implemented by City of Frederick's Water Treatment Superintendent and by the City's Safety and Safety Coordinator.  \n\n\n\n2.  STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nThe City of Frederick Monocacy Water Treatment Plant employs six (6) full-time employees engaged in water treatment plant and field operations.  Chlorine is used as part of the treatment process.\n\n\n\n2.1.  SITE DESCRIPTION (B) (1)\n\nThe site is owned and operated by The City of Frederick and managed by its Public Works Department.  The site is located at 1950 North Market Street, Frederick, Frederick County, Maryland.  The site is located in an industrial area on North Market Street.\n\nThe Plant includes a separate chlorine storage feed room/ control room which also houses the injection feed distribution system.  The chlorinated water feeds various injector points in the plant.  \n\nChlorinated water beyond the chlorine control room is outside of the boundaries of this RMP process.  The boundaries of the chlorine system subject to the RMP regulation include the 150- pound Chlorine Cylinder Storage Feed Control /Chlorination Control Room, associated vent makeup, exhaust systems and chlorine injection units in the area that supports the system.  It also includes the empty cylinder storage on the dock in front"

All drawings are maintained in the plant's RMP Process Safety Information.\n\n\n\n2.2.  REGULATED SUBSTANCE (B) (2)\n\nChlorine is the only regulated substance on site which exceeds the EPA 40 CFR-68 rule threshold quantity of 2,500 pounds.  The City of Frederick chlorine process was installed as part of the process of purifying water for public consumption.  It operates under permit from the State of Maryland Department of Environmental Protection (MD DEP). \n\nThe chlorine is received, stored in 150-pound cylinders.  Six cylinders are manifolded into a bank.  There two banks, one on line the other on standby.  The on-line bank feeds chlorine to two  process control systems.\n\n\n\nChlorine is an EPA and OSHA-listed toxic chemical.  It is an irritant and corrosive.  Chlorine is a halogen with the formula Cl2.  Chlorine is an oxidizing agent that is non-flammable.  It has a one  ppm OSHA ceiling 15-minute permissible exposure limit (PEL) and a NFPA health rating of 4, severe.  The immediate dangerous health (IDLH) level is 10 ppm and a lethal concentration (LC-5O) is 250 ppm.  Chlorine is not a carcinogen.\n\nThe maximum threshold quantity stored on site is forty-two (42) cylinders of 150 lb each.  This equals 6,300 pounds.  \n\n\n\n3.  HAZARD ASSESSMENT\n\nA hazard assessment was performed to determine the effects a release would have on the plant, the public and environmental receptors surrounding the plant.  For chlorine, the distance to the endpoint concentration of the gas was determined.  In addition, an estimate of the population that could be affected by a release of chlorine was determined, and sensitive receptors such as hospitals, schools, and nursing homes were identified.  The hazard assessment considers two release scenarios a \"worst case\" and an \"alternative case\".  The City maintains a Five-Year Accident History for "

The second is a more probable \"alternative release scenario\".  The first scenario is defined by EPA, which states that \"the operator shall assume that the maximum quantity in the largest vessel is released as a gas over 10 minutes\" due to an unspecified failure.  The alternative scenario is defined as \"more likely to occur than the worst-case scenario\".\n\nAtmospheric dispersion modeling was performed to determine the distance traveled by the chlorine released before its concentration decreases to the \"toxic endpoint.\" The EPA specified endpoint for chlorine is 0.0087 mg/l which equals three ppm.  The three ppm endpoint is the Emergency Response Planning Guideline Level 2 (ERPG- 2).  This is defined by the American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA) as the \"maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects or symptoms which could\n\nimpair an individual's ability to take protective action\"  The residential population within a circle with a radius corresponding to the toxic endpoint distance was defined, \"to estimate the population potentially affected.\"\n\n\n\n3.1.

GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM (D) (1)\n\nPlant-wide, many elements of the prevention program are used for all operations.  An overview of the generally written programs is listed below:\n\nThe City of Frederick has detailed process safety information on each of its operations.\n\nThe document maintenance system is integral to the management of change for all operations on site control.   This system is computer based.  Training is the backbone of employee knowledge, job operations and is ongoing in each area.  Employee training in operations and maintenance emphas awareness of the hazardous, toxic properties and effects of all chemicals used.  Maintenance and preventive maintenance are used for all operations making mechanical integrity a part of each piece of equipment.  The maintenance program uses a computer based work order system for scheduled mechanical integrity as well as for unplanned repairs and maintenance.  Incident investigations of accidents and near-miss incidents ensure we learn from each event as well as correct the causes of the incident.  \n\nIf there is a chlorine release, significant injury, property damage or an incident that could have catastrophic results; an investigating team is formed within 48 hours.  The team reviews the incident, and a report is drafted that defines the findings and resolution of the occurrence.  \n\nEmployees participate in all aspects of the plant as listed below under Emergency Response.  Employees are also Safety Committee Members, Process Hazards Review Members Accident Investigation Team Members  and assist in the development of the various P&Ps.  Safe work practices are used throughout the facility including: 1) Hot Work Permits, 2) Lock Out Tag Out\n\nPermits, 3) Vessel Entry Permits, 4) Site Security, and 5)"

This feeds into the strainer followed by an angle valve and vacuum/pressure regulator.  These parts are made of high pressure anhydrous (elemental) chlorine compatible materials; steel, copper or chlorine compatible non-metallic compound (not corroded by chlorine) rated to 500 psig.  The maximum pressure of the chlorine in the high pressure system is 150 psig giving a three-to-one safety factor.  There are six 150-pound cylinders on line, and one bank of six 150-pound cylinders on standby.  There is an automatic switchover within the vacuum pressure regulator.  One bank is in service and the other is on standby.   Each cylinder has a fusible plug to release pressure if the cylinder temperature is over 155 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nThe low pressure system operates under a vacuum pressure to 13 inches of mercury.  A pressure relief valve downstream of the regulator vents if the pressure in the line reaches over several inches of water pressure.  All the pipe, tubes, and equipment are also chlorine compatible.  The system is designed to 150 psig or complete vacuum giving it a large safety factor over the typical vacuum or positive pressure in it.
