Public Works employees do not respond to emergency releases, rather they are trained to notify the Fire Department, who provide emergency response services to Brookside. Public Works water system operators are not on site full time, but work at the different groundwater pumping stations.\n\nBrookside has remote release sensors that are monitored by a 24-hour alarm service. The alarm service will notify the fire department and page the key Public Works staff, who respond to the situation. Emergency personal protection equipment is not maintained on-site, as workers do not respond to emergency situations. All employees are trained in emergency notification procedures upon hire and annually thereafter.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nVancouver plans to continuously evaluate and improve safety procedures at Brookside as opportunities arise. Training exercises will continue on a regular basis. No major safety modifications to Brookside are currently planned. Any upgrades or extensive maintenance work performed in the future will be in compliance with those standards applicable at that time. During"

Chlorine gas, used for drinking water disinfection, is stored at Brookside in 150-pound cylinders. Vancouver receives stores, and distributes chlorine gas cylinders to groundwater pumping stations from Brookside. Brookside qualifies for a Level 3 RMP. Facility emergency response is provided by the City of Vancouver, Fire Department. More information on these safety aspects is given below.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Action/Response Policies\n\nIt is the policy of Vancouver to handle and use chlorine and other chemicals in the safest means possible. Vancouver has a comprehensive safety program that includes a proactive prevention program, comprehensive training of workers, state-of-the-art release containment and treatment systems and has coordinated emergency response with the Fire Department in the unlikely event of a chlorine release. In light of these safety considerations, the benefits of drinking water disinfection, a safe secure supply of clean drinking water, greatly outweigh the risk of chlorine storage at Brookside.\n\nBrookside Facility and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nAt Brookside full and empty 150-pound chlorine cylinders are stored in the Chlorine Storage Area Containment Room, with a maximum of seventy-five 150-pound full chlorine cylinders. The room is served by an emergency air scrubber system, which when activated by automatic chlorine sensors, has the capacity to neutralize up to 150 pounds of chlorine. The emergency scrubber system has a back-up generator allowing it to operate even if electrical power to Brookside is interrupted.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\nProgram elements to minimize ac"
