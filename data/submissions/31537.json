The risk management plan (RMP) covers the section 112r regulated substance maintained at the Fort Morgan Water Treatment Plant which will be referred to herein as the plant.\n\nPlant description\nThe plant maintains only one regulated substance on site chlorine. The maximum possible chlorine storage is 14,000 pounds, which exceeds the RMP threshold quantity of 2,500 pounds. The storage and management of chlorine in addresed in this RMP.\n\nThe plant is located at 14625 Rd. 8 Wiggins, Colorado which is in a rual area. The surrounding area has very few obstructions.\n\nThe worst case scenario\nThe worst case scenairio for chlorine was calculated as the release of a single one-ton cylinder in accordance with the definiton provided in the Environmental Protection Agency guidance for RMP development. The chlorine storage is enclosed, so the building acts as a passive midigation measure for the worst case release. The area of potential impact was determined using RMP*Comp, modeling software developed by the EPA.\n\nAlternate Release Scenario\nThe alternate release scenario is, by definition, a more liklely release scenario than the worst case. The type of system failure selected for the alternate release was the loss of chlorine due to the rupture of both diaphragms in the vacum regulator. The chlorine would leak from a half inch opening. The leak would continue until the chlorine detection alarm sounded and the the valve on the cyclinder was closed. The Wiggins Fire Department would respond to the leak. The time for the response is estimated at 15 minutes. The fire response personal would enter the chlorine area in protective clothing and close the valve on the leaking cylinder.\n\nProcess Hazard Assessment\nA process hazard assessment was performed on the chlorine system beginning with the cylinder unloading ending with the chlorine in solution. A check list and a modified \"What if \" analysis was us"

      "SummaryText": "ed. General questions reguarding the storage and use areas as well as protocals for the management of the chlorination equipment were answered. Following the checklist, each valve, line and piece of equipment in the system was assessed from the cylinder to the point of chlorine injection using a system flow diagram. The valves and other points in the system where chlorine could be released are shown on the flow diagram.  Compliance with code requirements, potential failures, maintenance and inspection concerns, and standard operating procedures were reveiwed for each point in the system.\n\nPrevention system\nThe plant has a preventive maintenance program desiged to review the operation of the mechanical equipment linked to the chlorination system. There are O/M mauals for each piece of equipment and operators are trained before being allowed to work on such equipment. \n\nBefore each cylinder is put in into service and after and all nessessary connections are made  valves and piping are tested for leaks. There are standard operating procedures ( SOPs) for startup, shutdown, normal operation, and emergency operation. The written SOPS are stored in the operations control room. Personal are trained on the safety concerns and general operation procedures as well as emergency procedures. \n\nEmergency response plan\nAll leaks requiring the use of a chlorine \"B\" kit will be managed by the Wiggins Fire Department. The plant has an aggrement with the fire department, which is included in this plan. A complete copy of the Emergency Response Plan (Contingency Plan) is also included.\n\nThe plant has has no chlorine releases in the past five years."
