      "SummaryText": "Morgan Advanced Ceramics' RMP is tied into our Process Management Safety Program and our ISO9001:2008 Quality System.  All procedures are documented in Work Instructions for each reactor onsite.  Safety processes and equipment necessary are included in our plan.  Our approach is to prevent accidental releases from happening.  Our systems are engineered so that controls are in place to prevent releases. Management is committed to providing all resources necessary to ensure a safe work place, safe community, and do no harm to the environment.  Our facility manufactures Advanced Ceramic Materials using a chemical vapor deposition process.  Substances used include Methyltrichlorosilane, borontrichloride, anhydrous ammonia, nitrogen, helium, argon, and hydrogen gases in our process.  There are 4 PBN (Prylotic Boron Nitride) vacuum furnaces and 1 SiC (Silicon Carbide) vacuum furnace on premises.   Morgan Advanced Ceramics complies with OSHA, EPA, DOT, and State of New Hampshire regulations for storage, shipping, handling and use of all materials in the process. Our Emergency Response Teams works with the Hudson Local Emergency Planning Commission and Fire department to ensure safety requirements are being met. Morgan Advanced Ceramics has contracted with Tradebe so that in the event of accidental release, they will perform clean up activities.   Improvements are continuously being made to our processes to control and prevent any types of accidental releases from occurring.  All employees are provided with ongoing safety training in our processes and hazards that may be present."
