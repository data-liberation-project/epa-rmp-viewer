The process is regulated by Federal OSHA 29 CFR 1910.119 and Cal OSHA Process Safety Management of Acutely Hazardous Materials, Title 8 California Code of Regulations 5189 and 19 California Cod of Regulations 2735 California Accidental Release Prevention Program.  This is a RMP/CalARP Program Level 3 facility.\n\nEnterprise Products Operating LLC recently acquired the facility from Coast Energy Group and is in the process of implementing the Enterprise Process Safety Management Systems.  The Bakersfield Terminal has a commitment to employee and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our process.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases.  However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n\nThe prevention program is based on the requirements of 19 California Code of Regulations 2735 California Accidental Release Prevention Program and includes the following:  Employee Participation, Process Safety Information, Process Hazard Analysis, Operating Procedures, Training, Contractor Evaluation, Contractor and Visitor Orientation, Pre-Job Start-Up Review, Mechanical Integrity, Code of Safe Work Practices (Hot Work Permit, Confined Space Entry, Control of Hazardous Energy), Management of Change, Incident Investigation, Emergency Planning and Response, and internal Compliance Audit.\n\nTraining includes employee responsibilities in the process safety management program, National Propane Gas Association - certified employee training program, hot work permit procedure, code of sa"

Planned changes to improve safety have been established based on compliance with the process safety management audits and revalidation of the process hazard analysis.  The last process hazard analysis revalidation was in May of 1999 and is scheduled for revalidation in the spring of 2004.\n\nThe Terminal receives, stores and distributes LPG and natural gasoline by rail cars and/or transport trucks.  The terminal has a number of storage tanks used for the receipt, storage and redelivery of gasoline and liquified petroleum gases.  The tanks are administratively controlled to hold LPG or natural gasoline at 85% maximum capacity, and are configured to store one or more of the various pruducts that can be handled by the terminal.  The facility is also capable of receiving a ProMix LPG product (a mixture of propane and butane) via a connected LPG pipeline.  The ProMix is stored for redelivery and shipment into either rail tank cars or tanker trucks.  \n\nEnterprise Products Operating LLC maintains an emergency response plan in compliance with local emergency response agencies.  The Bakersfield Terminal has recently updated the facility's Hazardous Materials Business Plan and is on file with Kern County Environmental Health Department - Certified Unified Program Agency.  The facility maintains an air permit to operate with the San Joaquin Unified Air Pollution Control District.\n\n\nIn the event of an accidental release, the facility operators are trained to sound the alarm, shut off the source from a safe location or activate one of the emergency shutdown devices, contact 9-1-1 and secure the area.  The 9-1-1 system is used to notify the Bakersfield Police and Fire Departments.\n\nBased on the criteria set forth in 40 CFR 68.10 and 19 CCR 2735.4, this facility has not had an accidental release.

The alternative release scenario for this process is a hose rupture while pumping propane into an 18-wheel delivery truck.  Installed automatic shutoffs were assumed to fail, requiring a short delay before the terminal operator could activate a secondary remote emergency shutdown system.  Details on the worst case and alternate case scenarios are contiained in the appropriate sections of the RMP registration documents.\n  \nA preliminary seismic walkthrough was conducted by the precious owner to fulfill the requirements of the California Accidental Release Prevention Program, 19 CCR 2745.7 (q)(2).  The preliminary seismic walkthrough consisted of a visual inspection of the process piping and vessels above grade.  Structural integrity below grade was not inspected.  Walkthrough considerations included the mechanical integrity of pipe, pipe supports, vessels and vessel supports, welds, flanges, valves, pressure safety valves, signs of surface corrosion, pipe stress points, foundations, drainage direction fire control and interaction with other elements.\n\nThe reference used for this walkthrough were the following:\n\nAPI Standard 570 Pressure Vessel Inspection Code:  Maintenance Inspection, Rating, Repair and Alteration.\n\nProcess Unlimited International, Inc., Engineered Safety Section, CalARP Seismic Assessment Procedure, April 12, 1999.\n\nUniform Building Code, 1997 Edition, International Conference of Building Officials.\n\nBased on the document, Maps of Known Active Fault Near-Source Zones in California and Adjacent Portions of Nevada:  Uniform Building Code 1997, this facility resides outside the boundaries of the Near-Source Fault Zone.

Enterprise considers and acuts upon action items  from Process Hazard Analyses, facility audits, and incident investigations when the recommendation can be shown to provide an expected improvement in facility safety.
