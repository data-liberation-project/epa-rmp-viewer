We have discussed this program with the County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and the City Fire Department. Representatives of the City of Albany Department of Fire and Emergency Services toured the facility in October 2003. Members of the Fire Department Hazardous Materials Unit were trained in joint exercises on the installation of an Emergency C Kit on a chlorine tank car simulator provided by Surpass. \n\n\n7. Planned changes to improve safety\n\nThis facility was constructed in 1979 and is in compliance with Chlorine Institute guidelines. A newly developed automated chlorine rail tank car shut-off was installed on 07/23/99. We continue to participate in the Chlorine Institute programs, and continue to improve and operate our facility in accordance with the National Association of Chemical Distributors (NACD) Responsible Distribution Program (RDP) and the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations. Future safety improvements will be completed by December 2004. They include the complete replacement of our batch process with a Powell continuous Bleach Manufacturing System, a chlorine scrubber system to evacuate the entire piping system, as well as all new process controls including additional chlorine detectors."

      "SummaryText": "1.  Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies;\n\nAt Surpass Chemical Company's Bridge Street facility we handle chlorine, which is considered hazardous by EPA. Chlorine at our facility is used to manufacture liquid sodium hypochlorite bleach and is consumed directly from the rail tank car. Hypochlorite bleach is well known as an easier to use and safer to handle form of chlorine. It is widely used for disinfecting municipal and private water supplies, for household laundry bleach and for many other commercial uses. The same germicidal and highly reactive properties that make chlorine, and other products made from it, so valuable as a commodity and important to public health, also make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions. Chlorine safety depends upon the safety devices inherent in the design of this facility, the safe handling procedures that we follow, and the training of our personnel. Safe handling of chlorine is necessary to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to our own personal health as well as that of our co-workers, and to reduce the threat to nearby members of our community. It is our policy to handle chlorine safely and to adhere to all applicable Federal and state rules and regulations governing its handling and use. \n\nOur emergency response program is based upon the Chlorine Institute's Pamphlet 64, Emergency Response Plans for Chlorine Facilities. The emergency response plan includes procedures for notification of the local fire authority and notification of any potentially affected neighbors.\n\n2.  The stationary source and regulated substances handled;\n\nThe primary purpose of Surpass Chemical's Bridge Street facility is to manufacture, blend, package and distribute chemicals to water treatment facilities and general industry. The regulated substance handled at this manufacturing/distribution facility is chlorine.  The maximum total inventory of chlorine stored at this plant is 360,000 pounds. Norma"
