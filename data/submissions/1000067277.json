Five-Year Accident History\r\nThere have not been any ammonia-related accidents at the facility over the past five years that resulted in offsite consequences as outlined in the Accident History Section of the RMP Submittal.\r\n\r\n\r\nE.  Description of the Emergency Response Program\r\nAn Emergency Action Plan (EAP) has been implemented at the facility.  The EAP contains procedures describing how the facility will react to ammonia spills or releases and other potential emergencies, including both shelter-in-place and evacuation procedures.  The program has been coordinated with local response agencies. \r\n\r\n\r\nF.  Planned Changes to Improve Safety\r\nWe have identified potential changes to improve the safety of our ammonia refrigeration system by conducting both Compliance Audit and a PHA Revalidation which generated recommendations to improve the safety of the system.  All recommendations are documented through meeting notes and/or action lists associated with the PSM/RMP Program."

      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\r\n\r\nThe Upstate Niagara Cooperative, Inc. Culture facility (UNC) produces various dairy products at our facility located in West Seneca, NY.  UNC has a strong commitment to operate the facility in a safe and responsible manner.  Ammonia is used as a cooling medium in our refrigeration system.  UNC's Ammonia Refrigeration System is used to cool the Cooling Tunnels East and West, ice builder, and Cooler Penthouse.  The system has a charge of 20,304 pounds of Anhydrous Ammonia.  The system runs a suction pressure of 25-30 psi and a discharge pressure of 130-160 psi.  The system features 4 Vilter Screw Compressors.  The system has 2 Evaporative Condensers that maintain the system head pressure.  The system is controlled by computer based system built and maintained by Upstate Electrical Technologies.  The system also features an ammonia detection system with an automatic dialing feature.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.  Description of the Accident Release Prevention Program and Emergency Policies\r\nUNC takes many precautions to prevent or minimize accidental releases of ammonia from the refrigeration system.  These precautions include safety controls (alarms and automatic shutdown devices) which are designed to identify and prevent potentially unsafe conditions such as pressure increases that could cause a system failure.  UNC has also implemented a preventive maintenance program which is designed to maintain the ongoing integrity of the systems, a training program designed to ensure that the systems are operated by qualified associates, and emergency procedures designed to enable trained associates to respond quickly to system upsets.  The PSM/RMP Coordinator is responsible for the management of these ammonia safety programs.\r\n\r\n\r\nB.  The Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\r\nThe Stationary Source is the UNC Culture facility and Ammonia is the only substance covered by the Risk Management Plan Regulations at this facility.\r\n\r\n\r\nC.
