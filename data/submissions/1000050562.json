We have a Fire Safety Analysis Manual that all employees must review once a year.\n\n\n\nAg Country Propane (AGCP) is a retail propane business.  We deliver propane to residences, businesses and any other legal propane using application.  Our office is where we dispatch the trucks and conduct all the day to day operations.  We have a full service service department as well meaning we will install new piping in a house, install a new tank for a customer or work on propane appliances.  We do fill small bottles at our location but do not recertify cylinders. \n\n\n\nWe use PERS for our emergency reporting facility and comply with their guidelines for any emergency issues.  Local fire department is contacted as well in the case of any emergencies.\n\n\n\nWe have not had any accidents in the past 5 years.\n\n\n\nWe have monthly meetings to keep safety a priority and have our Hazmat training for all employees on the 24th of May to comply with the every 3 year training for Hazmat Regulations.\n\n"
