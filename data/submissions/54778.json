Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nTraining is required for all water plant operations employees in the proper handling of Chlorine tanks and feed systems, and emergency response contact policies. This is required to take place in a timely fashion following their employment at the facility, along with refresher training on an annual basis thereafter.\n\nNotification of an outside agency (Logansport Fire Department) is required in the event of a potential or actual release of Chlorine at the facility. The Fire Department will be responsible for any necessary notifications of the public and/or trained and equipped hazardous materials responders.\n\n\n2.  Stationary Source and Regulated Substance(s)\n\nThe Logansport Municipal Utilities owns and operates a water treatment plant. The facility, located in Logansport, Indiana, uses Chlorine stored in 2,000-pound cylinder tanks.  \n\nA low-pressure water induction system is used to draw Chlorine gas from tanks for injection at various points in the water treatment process.\n\nIt is the practice at this plant to have no more than four (4) 2,000-pound tanks on hand at any time, for a maximum total quantity of 8,000 pounds of Chlorine.\n\n\n3. Worst-Case Scenario\n\nAt the plant, the worst-case scenario is the rupture of one (1) cylinder tank containing 2,000 pounds of Chlorine.\n\nUnder this scenario, the contents of the cylinder tank would be released as Chlorine gas at a rate of 200 pounds per minute over a period of ten (10) minutes.  The total quantity released would be 2,000 pounds.\n\nThe distance to toxic endpoint is determined to be 0.9 miles (4,752 feet) using RMP Comp as the modeling calculation tool.\n\n\n\n4. Alternative Case Scenario\n\nOnly a portion of the contents of the cylinder tank would be released as Chlorine gas. This would occur at a rate of two (2) pounds per minute over a period of 30 minutes, thus the"

      "SummaryText": " total quantity released would be 60 pounds.\n\nUnder this scenario, the distance to toxic endpoint is calculated at 0.1 miles (528 feet) using RMP Comp as the modeling calculation tool.\n\n\n\n\n5. General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe program for accidental release prevention is based upon a combination of management practices and low-pressure vacuum feeders specifically designed for Chlorine gas.\n\n\n\n6. Five-Year Accident History\n\nIn the past five (5) years, the Logansport Municipal Utilities Water Treatment Plant has had no accidental releases of Chlorine gas.\n\n\n\n7. Emergency Response Program\n\nSince response activities will be handled by public responders, the Logansport Municipal Utilities Water Treatment Plant is not required to have an emergency response program.  However, emergency issues have been coordinated with the Logansport Fire Department and the Cass County, Indiana, Office of Emergency Management. \n\n\n\n8. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nSafety and employee training will continue to be emphasized by the Logansport Municipal Utilities."
