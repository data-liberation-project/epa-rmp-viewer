FACILITY INFORMATION  \n\n - THE PRIMARY ACTIVITY AT HARVESTLAND IS THE STORAGE AND BLENDING OF FERTILIZERS FOR SALE TO FARMERS.\n\n - ANHYDROUS AMMONIA IS RECEIVED, STORED, AND DISTRIBUTED FOR DIRECT APPLICATION TO AREA FIELD FOR CROP PRODUCTION NUTRIENTS.\n\n - THE MAXIMUM QUANTITY STORED WOULD BE 227,000 POUNDS IN OUR 30,OOO GALLON STORAGE TANK AND ALL ROLLING STOCK. \n\n3.  THE WORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO. \n\n   A. THE WORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO WOULD BE THE RELEASE OF THE TOTAL CONTENTS OF A  STORAGE TANK RELEASED AS A GAS OVER 1O MINUTES. THE MAXIMUM QUANTITY RELEASED WOULD BE 130,000 POUNDS, WHICH REPRESENTS THE VOLUME OF THE  STORAGE TANK AT 85 PERCENT CAPACITY AS LIMITED BY DESIGN STANDARDS. THE DISTANCE TO THE ENDPOINT IS 1.12 MILES. \n\n  B. THE ALTERNATE RELEASE SCENARIO BASED ON A TWO MINUTE RELEASE FROM A BREAK IN A THREE INCH PIPE IS A DISTANCE TO THE ENDPOINT OF 0.78 MILES.\n\n4. THE ACCIDENT RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM.\n\n    HARVESTLAND HAS IMPLEMENTED THE PROVISIONS OF \"SAFETY REQUIREMENTS FOR THE STORAGE AND HANDLING OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA, K-61.1\",PUBLISHED BY THE AMERICAN NATIONAL STANDARDS INSTITUTE,INC., AND THE STANDARDS OF THE U.S. OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH ADMINISTRATION (OSHA) , 29 CFR 1910.111, \"STORAGE AND HANDLING OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA.\n\n5.
