This facility has an excellent safety record with no deaths or serious injuries to plant personnel or contractors due to the RMP covered process. There have been no accidents in the past 5 years.  This Location utilizes a third part contractor with a portable T-reactor to react anhydrous ammonia with acid to create a liquid fertilizer. This reaction process is the reason for the movement to level 3. The stationary anhydrous ammonia tank is normally utilized for filling nurse tanks for agricultural use ammonia for farmers. \r\n\r\nB.\t Accidental Release Prevention Policies and Program\r\n\r\nThis facility strives to meet or exceed compliance with state anhydrous ammonia regulations. Training is provided for each new hire and re-hire employee and at least annually as required by ND Dept of Agriculture regulations. The anhydrous ammonia tank(s) and associated equipment are inspected annually following recommended industry and engineering frequencies. \r\n\r\nC.\tEmergency Response Plan/Emergency Action Plan\r\n\r\nEach employee is trained to be familiar with the emergency plan policies and procedures through safety reviews and other safety meetings.
