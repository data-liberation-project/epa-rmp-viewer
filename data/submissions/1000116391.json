This program addresses management practices in areas such as operating procedures, equipment maintenance, hazard analysis and employee training associated with the processes at our facility. \nIt is the policy of Alta Vista Cold Storage, LLC to implement appropriate controls to prevent releases of regulated substances to the greatest extent possible.\nRegulated Substances\t\nAnhydrous Ammonia is present above threshold amounts at the Alta Vista Cold Storage, LLC.\n Worst-Case and Alternative Scenarios\nA Process Hazard Analysis was conducted to determine the specific hazards associated with the Anhydrous Ammonia system. Several release scenarios were modeled: a Worst-Case scenario involving the total loss of inventory, an alternative high-pressure gas release (the most common cause of Anhydrous Ammonia releases nationwide), and a low-pressure liquid release.  Each scenario includes population impacts and a map showing the potential sphere of influence.\nAccidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nAlta Vista Cold Storage, LLC Service has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the Occupational Safety and Health Standards 29 CFR Part 1910.119 Process Safety Management of highly hazardous chemicals, and California\u0092s Accidental Release Prevention requirements set forth by CCR Title 19, Division 2, Chapter 4.5.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of Alta Vista Cold Storage, LLC release prevention program for the Alta Vista Cold Storage, LLC.\nProcess Safety Information \nAlta Vista Cold Storage, LLC maintains a detailed record of safety information that includes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.
