The facility is located on 13136 Highway 28 West.  It is adjacent to a Georgia-Pacific Plywood mill.  A Georgia-Pacific Stud Mill and Roseburg Particleboard plant are also located at the same complex.  The resin facility consists of three plants: a resin plant that was originally constructed in 1972, a plant that manufactures formaldehyde that was originally constructed in 1973 (formaldehyde is one of the basic raw materials used to manufacture the resins), and a spray-dry resin plant that was manufactured in 1996.  Overall, the facility employs 52 full-time employees.\r\n\r\nGeorgia-Pacific Chemicals LLC is committed to operating the plant in a manner that is safe for its workers, the public, and the environment.  As part of this commitment, Georgia-Pacific Chemicals LLC has established a system to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility.  One component of this system is a risk management program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at the plant and that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) regulation 40 CFR part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule).  One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit a risk management plan (RMP Plan) describing the risk management program at the plant. This document is intended to satisfy the RMP Plan requirement of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program at the plant.\r\n\r\nThe risk management program at the Plant consists of the following three elements:\r\n\u00b7A hazard assessment to help understand (a) the potential offsite consequences of hypothetical accidental releases and (b) accidents that have occurred during the last five years associated with the use of substan"

In fact, the Plant has a comprehensive safety program in place establishing many levels of safeguards against release of a hazardous substance and injuries and damage from a release of a hazardous substance.\r\n\r\nGeorgia-Pacific Chemicals LLC limits the use of hazardous substances.  Before using a hazardous substance at the Plant, less hazardous alternatives are considered. When a hazardous substance is used at the Plant, Georgia-Pacific Chemicals LLC considers the potential for this substance to adversely affect plant workers, the public, and the environment and takes steps to prevent any such effects.\r\n\r\nGeorgia-Pacific Chemcials LLC prevents releases of the hazardous substances used at the facility.

This RMP Plan is primarily intended to describe those parts of the safety program at the Plant that are required by the RMP rule.\r\n\r\n\r\n1.1  Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\nGeorgia-Pacific Chemicals LLC is committed to the safety of workers and the public, and the preservation of the environment, through the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances.  Georgia-Pacific Chemcials LLC implements reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous substances.  These controls include training programs for personnel, programs to help ensure safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of processes at the Plant; and programs to evaluate the hazards at the plant.\r\n\r\nIn the event of an accidental release, the Plant makes every effort to control and contain any release in a manner that will be safe for workers and will prevent injury to the public and the environment.  Georgia-Pacific Chemicals LLC provides response training to its personnel, designates an emergency response coordinator to oversee response activities, and coordinates response efforts with the local fire department.

These documents address (1) physical properties of hazardous substances handled at the plant, (2) operating parameters of the equipment used at the plant, and (3) design basis and configuration of the equipment at the plant.  Georgia-Pacific Chemicals LLC ensures that this process safety information is available to all employees.  The LEPC and the Taylorsville Fire Department receive SDS sheets on all hazardous materials.\r\n\r\nSafety data sheets (SDSs) document the physical properties of the hazardous materials handled at the plant, including regulated substances in covered processes.

The plant reviewed OSHA's fire prevention and protection requirements in 29 CFR 1910.252(a) and created a Hot Work Permit Form to comply with these requirements.

The program reviews the safety record of all contractors to help ensure that the plant only hires contractors who can safely perform the desired job tasks.  The plant explains to the contract supervisors the hazards of the process on which they and their employees will work, the plant's safe work practices, and the plant's emergency response procedures.

However, to make-up for shortfalls in formaldehyde production, some formaldehyde is delivered to the plant by offsite vendors. The formaldehyde vendor supplies formaldehyde solution via a DOT approved tank truck and follows DOT standards when loading the formaldehyde storage tanks.  The storage tanks' design and construction are consistent with ANSI standards.  Workers who perform operations involving formaldehyde receive training emphasizing safe handling procedures for formaldehyde developed by the plant.   The storage tanks are surrounded by a concrete dike which is large enough to contain 100% of the volume of the largest tank should its entire contents be spilled.  All air emissions from the storage tanks are directed to an oxidizer, which destroys in excess of 98% of the formaldehyde emissions.\r\n\r\n\r\n1.4  Five-Year Accident History\r\nThe plant has completed a review of the five-year accident history for the plant.
