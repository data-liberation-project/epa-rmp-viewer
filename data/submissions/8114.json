Land use in the immediate vicinity of the site is primarily\nagricultural, with silviculture and animal operations predominating.  The plant is located\non the south side of a low hill or ridge between two intermittent streams.\n     The location of the plant is due to the presence of natural brine deposits located\nabout 1.5 miles beneath the plant.  These brines are withdrawn through a system of\nwells and processed to produce bromine and hydrogen sulfide, and then replaced into\nthe same geologic formation by a second system of wells.  \n     The West Plant produces bromine, sodium hydrosulfide, and\nhexabromocyclododecane.\nAbout our accidental release prevention and emergency response policies:\n     The West Plant Facility has very active accidental release prevention and\nemergency response programs.  It is the policy of the West Plant Facility to reduce the\nrisk of chemical release to the extent feasible.  The main vehicle for chemical risk\nreduction is the Process Safety Management (PSM) program.  When the OSHA PSM\nstandard was promulgated, existing programs were subsumed into the PSM program\nfollowing the OSHA standard.  \n     The Policy of the West Plant is to first prevent the occurrence of emergency\nsituations, but if prevention measures are unsuccessful, to respond to those situations\nin a professional and appropriate manner.  The site has an integrated Emergency Plan\nwhich follows EPA's \"One Plan\" concept.  West Plant personnel respond to\nemergencies on site with a trained fire brigade, HazMat responders, and a corps of\ntrained EMTs.  The emergency plan provides for coordination with local care givers, first\nresponders, law enforcement, and the county emergency response infrastructure\nthrough the county-wide emergency plan.  \n     Briefly, if a chemical incident appears to have the potential for off site impact, the\nlocal County Eme"

If a situation has impact beyond the\nborders of Columbia County, the county-wide emergency plan provides for coordination\nwith adjoining counties and parishes.\n     All of our south Arkansas facilities use the same basic accidental release\nprevention and emergency response programs.  Using the same plan makes training\neasier and coordination with local off site responders better.  Details of the emergency\nplans (such as maps; locations of response equipment) are different due to the physical\ndifferences in the facilities.\nRegulated substances handled at the West Plant:\n     The West Plant was known to handle four listed chemicals in two processes. \nInformation on the handling and storage was gathered.  Three chemicals in two\nprocesses were found to be subject to the RMP rule.  The accidental release prevention\nand emergency response programs are exactly the same for covered and non-covered\nprocesses; covered and non-covered chemicals are both subject to both programs.\n     The Risk Management Program has been incorporated into the PSM program to\nprovide continuity.

Part of this program (Management of Change) is communication of the\nchange and anticipated effects to all affected employees, and training provided as\nnecessary.\n     To assure compliance with this program, regular audits are conducted. \n     We make every effort to minimize risk through training, preparation, and\nplanning.

A Safe Work\nPermit may require the permittee to initiate and complete a Hot Work Permit before\nperforming certain tasks.

Hot work permits insure fire prevention and protection\nrequirements have been implemented prior to beginning the work.  Another essential\npart of the risk management program is the use of \"lock out/ tag out\" procedures. \nWhen a safe work permit is issued, the permit requires the permittee to assure that all\nsources of potential energy have been deactivated.  For instance, the permittee may\nperform the following procedures before working on a pump: Check the Safe Work\nPermit to make assure operations has purged and drained the pump; check the red\ntags in place to make sure the pump is isolated from the process; and place a personal\nlocking device on the electrical switchgear energizing the pump.  No employee can\nremove a red tag, actuate a tagged component, or remove a personal locking device\nplaced by another employee.  \n     We depend on contractors and contract employees for many essential services. \nUnder our PSM program, we insure that contractor preformed maintenance, repair, and\ngeneral operations are preformed safely.

The Worst Case Scenario (WCS) is\nrigidly defined by the RMP rule.  \n     For simplicity's sake, we have used the recommendation of EPA guidance for\natmospheric conditions.

In both WCS and ACS, the forested, rolling terrain around the West Plant is\ncharacterized by a surface roughness factor \"urban.\"  When interpreting impact, it\nshould be remembered that an actual release travels in the direction of the prevailing\nwind, and does not disperse much toward the sides of the centerline of the direction of\ntravel.  Information on the Toxics WCS is found in section 2 of this plan; section 3\ncontains Toxics ACSs.  The West Plant does not have flammables reportable under\nsections 4 and 5 of this plan.\n     The Alternate Case Release Scenarios (ACS) were developed by a\nknowledgeable panel of safety, industrial, and environmental professionals.  This panel\nreviewed several sources in developing the scenarios: Actual reported incidents;\nProcess Hazard Analyses (PHAs); Data from the EPA ARIP database (nationwide); and\ncollective process hazard knowledge.  Although some of the ACS may have roots in\nactual recorded incidents, the scenario may have been intentially manipulated so as to\nhave off site consequences which were absent in the real incident.  For instance, two\nreal incidents may have been combined to have more serious consequences (for\nmodeling purposes) than did the actual incident.  The most weight was given to the\nconcerns"

Public receptors\nwere estimated from these reports, and the \"Landview III Environmental Mapping\nSoftware\" developed by the EPA and the Department of Commerce.   \nToxic chemical worst-case release scenario:\n     At the West Plant, the Worst Case Scenario (WCS) is a sudden release of all the\nchlorine in the chlorine storage tank.  The conditions are for a wind speed of 1.5 m/sec,\natmospheric stability class F, air temperature 77 deg. F.

A sudden loss of pressure combined with\nvaporization of the tank contents would tend to freeze the chlorine in the vessel, greatly\nreducing the release rate.\nToxic chemical alternate-case scenario #1:\n     The first West Plant Alternate Case Scenario (ACS) is for a release of anhydrous\nammonia.
