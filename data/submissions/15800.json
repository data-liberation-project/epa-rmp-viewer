Our planned maintenance programs have been developed and implemented to assure the safety through safer equipment.\n\nIn the past five years not only has the Sodus Cold storage has not had any accidental release of ammonia.\n\nSodus Cold Storage annually invites the local emergency response personal to our facility to further educate them to our operations potentials."
