      "SummaryText": "PROCESS AT THE QUAIL VALLEY UTILITY DISTRICT\n\nThe Quail Valley Utility District Wastewater Treatment Plant treatment works utilizes the Unox, high purity oxygen system to aerate wastewater in the treatment process.  The oxygen process is maintained by an oxygen generating system that physically removes nitrogen and produces a high purity oxygen (85-90% pure oxygen).  Ferrous sulfate solution is also utilized to aid in settling solids in the clarification process and concentrating solids in the sludge removal process.  Vaporized liquid chlorine is used to disinfect the final treatment effluent.  Vaporized liquid sulfur dioxide is utilized as a de-chlorinating agent for the final treated effluent prior to the effluent discharge to an irrigation reservoir.  There is an on-site diesel generator with 500 gallons of diesel fuel to provide immediate power in the event supplied electrical power is interrupted or lost.\n\n1.  THE ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES AT YOUR FACILITY\n\nHazardous materials are stored and protected in such way that, if any, airborne release is extremely minimal.  The most hazardous material used at this facility is chlorine (Cl2).  As per the supplied MSDS, the specific gravity of chlorine is 1.47.  This specific gravity will cause the chlorine of seek low spots in preference to becoming airborne.  Because of the storage location of chlorine at this facility and the precautionary building containment the worst-case scenario is release to ground.\n\nA water filled reservoir is located 30 feet from the chlorine storage.  The facility is topographically designed so any ground release will drain immediately into the reservoir.  The reservoir is equipped with a primary and redundant containment barrier.\n\nThe primary and redundant barriers can be activated in less than five minutes.  Real-time monitoring devices notify personnel immediately of any release thereby providing time to initiate containment.  Employees are trained and d"

However, the \"normal\" quantity is 2,000.\n\nSulfur dioxide (SO2) is also used in this facility's operation.  The quantity of sulfur dioxide is the same as chlorine.  As per the MSDS, the specific gravity of sulfur dioxide is 1.434.  Because of this the same accidental release procedures as for chlorine are policy at this facility.\n\n2. YOUR FACILITY AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nAt this facility two regulated substances are handled: chlorine and sulfur dioxide.  The maximum quantity of each that may be on-site is 4,000 pounds.  However, the normal quantity at the facility is maximum 2,000 pounds.  These substances are stored in a high integrity storage container and further protected by engineered building construction to minimize and control any potential release.\n\n3. THE WORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\nThe normal quantity of chlorine on-site is 2,000 pounds maximum.  However, worst-case scenario will have 4,000 pounds on-site.\n\nThis facility is topographically engineered in such manner that any ground release cannot flow anywhere except into a reservoir.\n\nThe facility is equipped with real-time monitoring devices that immediately advise personnel of the release.  The real-time monitoring devices provide minimal time for responding personnel to place sorbent materials to minimize or prohibit chlorine from entering the reservoir.  Chlorine has a specific gravity of 1.47 (as per MSDS).  Because of this: the close proximity of the reservoir, the topographically engineered controls and immediate placement of sorbent booms by responding personnel, there is only minimal potential for an airborne chlorine release.\n\nPersonn"

In addition to application of sorbents the primary and redundant barriers are activated.  Additionally, there are sorbent booms adequate to retain ongoing ground release before mitigation procedures begin.\n\nThere are single-dwelling homes within 1200 feet of the facility.  Also a private golf course in proximity of the facility.  According to these most current data (30 November 1998) there is a general population of 15,514 persons within the vicinity of the QVUD.  Ten thousand three hundred and twenty one reside North of the facility.  Five thousand one hundred and ninety three reside South of the facility.\n\nAccording to these data supplied by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration the predominant wind direction is 6.6 mph from the south, southeast to the north, northwest.  The nearest distance to endpoint is .22 miles.\n\nThe worst-case scenario involves ground release to a maximum of 4,000 pounds of chlorine, QVUD and emergency personnel immediately advise individuals or the release.  If an airborne release occurs these individuals are advised protective measures, including evacuation if necessary.\n\n4.
