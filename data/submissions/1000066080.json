      "SummaryText": "RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nYuma Ethanol, LLC\n\n\n\n\n\nYuma Ethanol, LLC (Yuma) is a fully operational ethanol production facility. Yuma started operations in September of 2007. At that time, Yuma submitted the original RMP for the facility in accordance with 40 CFR Part 68. Yuma Ethanol, LLC is designed to produce approximately 60 million gallons of fuel grade ethanol per year. Wet cake (WDGS) is the by-products of ethanol production and are sold to local cattle markets as animal feed. Ethanol production activities fall under the SIC code of 2869, Industrial Chemicals, Not Elsewhere Classified. \n\n\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Response Policies:\n\n\n\nYuma Ethanol, LLC has a commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated in the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel as well as considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the facility. Training personnel is also important to the facility and is considered a valuable prevention method. Staff is trained on spill prevention and control methods as well as Hazwoper and emergency action policies which are implemented at the facility.\n\nYuma Ethanol, LLC's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, plant personnel will respond to contain the release as necessary. Yuma management is dedicated to safety, spill prevention and emergency action.\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances:\n\n\n\nYuma is located approximately 3.2 miles east of Yuma, Colorado. It is constructed on the southwest corner of a 252 acre parcel of land which is bounded on the south by the Burlington Northern rail line, to the west by County Road H, to the north by County Road 39, and to the east by County Road J. Access to the facility via private haul road is off of CR H, just north of the Burlington Northern railroad line. The facility is loca"

      "SummaryText": "ted in Section 19, Township 2 North, Range 47 West.\n\n\n\nThe facility operates 24 hours per day, 7 days per week for the purpose of manufacturing fuel grade ethanol from corn. The regulated substances under the RMP program are Anhydrous Ammonia and Denaturant (Natural Gasoline), which is considered a flammable mixture. Ammonia is used as a chemical processing aid and is consumed in the manufacturing process. Anhydrous ammonia is stored in a single tank. Natural Gasoline is used to denature the ethanol so it is impure prior to being shipped off-site in accordance with applicable regulations. Denaturant is generally stored on-site in the denaturant and final product storage tanks. \n\n\n\n\n\nFive Year Accident History:\n\n\n\nYuma ethanol facility has been subject to RMP criteria upon delivery of substances onsite. \n\nSince startup in 2007, Yuma has had no RMP reportable accidents.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\n\n\nYUMA is included in the Yuma, Colorado Community Response Plan. Yuma Ethanol also has it's own Emergency Response Plan for emergencies of small nature. In the case of an incident requiring high level emergency response, Yuma would call 911 for fire and other emergency equipment. \n\nFurthermore, Yuma has a commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated in the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the facility.\n\n\n\n\n\nYuma's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, plant personnel will respond to contain the release as necessary. Some physical aspects of the facility would also help Yuma personnel contain a potential spill. For example, the ethanol tanks, final product tanks, and denaturant tank are all located in a large bermed Tank Farm containment area. This area is separated from the plant and equipped with a fire suppression system. A release"

      "SummaryText": " from one of these tanks would not be able to migrate off-site, and a fire could be quickly extinguished. \n\nThe anhydrous ammonia tank has a manual shut off valve and an emergency stop switch for any release that may happen with that vessel. \n\n\n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\n\n\nYuma is subject to RMP Prevention Program Level 3. Through completion of this RMP and similar efforts regulated by OSHA's Process Safety Management standard at 29 CFR 1910.119, YUMA has complied with the EPA requirements at 40 CFR Part 68.115(d). Process safety information, safe work practices such as Hot Work, Confined Space Entry and Lockout/Tagout, and operations and maintenance procedures are documented on-site. Periodic functions such as process hazard analyses (PHA), training, management of change, pre-startup safety reviews, and incident investigation are conducted on a regular basis. \n\n\n\n\n\nThe denaturant tank is equipped with high level alarms as well as a berm that surrounds the entire tank farm. The anhydrous ammonia tank is equipped with a manual shut off valve and emergency stop switch. These chemical specific prevention measures minimize the risk for an RMP reportable incident. Compliance audits of the RMP Prevention Program will be conducted on a regular basis to assure compliance with EPA and OSHA regulations. Mechanical integrity will be conducted on piping and vessels as required by API and AMSE.  \n\n\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nAs previously mentioned, Yuma is committed to the protection of its employees, the greater community and the environment from hazardous substances used in the ethanol fuel production process. Yuma management is committed to promoting a safe work environment. Yuma will continue to provide its employees with the necessary training, tools, and ongoing support needed to conduct their work safely and to operate the ethanol production process in a safe and efficient manner. In addition, Yuma has four audits per year by third par"
