Common Point (Facility) is committed to operating in a manner that is safe for workers, the public, and the environment.  This Risk Management Plan (RMP) helps manage the risks at the site and complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency\u00bfs (EPA\u00bfs) rule 40 CFR 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements:  Risk Management Programs (the RMP Rule), and the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality regulation (LAC 33:III.Chapter 59).\r\n\r\nThe facility is subject to the standards of the RMP regulation due to the on-site storage of a Natural Gas Liquid Mix that contains listed flammable substances in excess of the threshold quantity.  The site meets the definition of a Program 1 Source; therefore, under the requirements of the RMP regulation, the following is required of the facility.\r\n* Submit a single RMP as provided in 40 CFR 68.150 through 68.185;\r\n* Analyze the worst-case release scenario (40 CFR 68.25) and submit in plan (40 CFR 68.165;\r\n* Document the nearest public receptor is beyond the endpoint distance [40 CFR 68.22(a)];\r\n* Document the Five Year Accident History of the site (40 CFR 68.42) and submit in the Plan (40 CFR 68.168);\r\n* Ensure Response Actions have been coordinated (40 CFR 68.10); and\r\n* Certify the Plan (40 CFR 68.185).\r\n\r\nThis Executive Summary is part of the Plan submittal as required by the RMP rule under 40 CFR 68.155 and is intended to provide the public with a description of the RMP at the facility.  Information relating to components of a Program 1 Source as listed above, will be discussed further in the sections below.  This Executive Summary will also address the additional information listed under 40 CFR 68.155.\r\n\r\n1.1 Background\r\n\r\nThe Facility is a refrigeration plant that separates natural gas liquids from field gas.  Liquids are stored in a pressurized tank, the contents of which are transported offsite by tank truck.  The sto"

(Southern Star) has overall responsibility for the development and implementation of the RMP for the regulated process at the Facility.  Additional information, including the emergency contact, is provided within the RMP submit report.\r\n\r\n\r\n1.2 Offsite Consequence Analysis\r\n\r\nThe Facility performed an offsite consequence analysis to estimate the potential impact from an accidental release of the flammable liquid to the surrounding area.  In accordance with 40 CFR 68.25, the analysis consisted of evaluating the worst-case release scenario from the 12,000 gallon storage tank.  The analysis was based on the full tank capacity of the flammable liquid spilling instantaneously to form a liquid pool.  The resulting pool would then vaporize resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  The Facility does not expect a worst-case release scenario to ever occur.  The endpoint distance for a Worst-Case Release Scenario from the storage tank is less than the distance to a public receptor since the Facility is located in a rural agricultural location in North Bossier Parish.\r\n\r\n1.3 Accident Prevention and Emergency Response\r\n\r\nThe Facility has a commitment to the safety of the general public, of the employees, and to the preservation of the environment.   One primary portion of this commitment is the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances in and around the facility.  The facility utilizes engineering controls, inspection programs, and detailed procedures as a means to prevent accidental releases.\r\n\r\nIn cooperation with the Bossier Parish Local Emergency Planning Commission (LEPC), the ability exists to notify the local community in the unlikely event during an emergency with potential impact to the public.\r\n\r\n1.4 Five Year Accident History\r\n\r\nThe facility is a new site that has recently started"

In accordance with the requirements of 40 CFR 68.42, information relating to any accidental release that results in death, injury, significant property damage, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage will be documented for the Facility and provided in future RMP submittals.

At a minimum, in accordance with 40 CFR 68.190, the Plan will be reviewed at least once every five years and updated as necessary.  The updated plan will be submitted to the EPA and LDEQ.  The plan will also be updated and resubmitted for changes in Facility operations that meet either of the standards listed under 40 CFR 68.190(b).\r\n\r\n1.6 Recordkeeping and Public Access\r\n\r\nRecords supporting the preparation and implementation of this RMP shall be maintained for a minimum of five years in accordance with 40 CFR 68.200.\r\n\r\n1.7 Public Access\r\n\r\nAs required in 40 CFR 68.210, the information contained within the RMP is available to the public through Southern Star.
