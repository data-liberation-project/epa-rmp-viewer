The properties of chlorine make it necessary to observe safety precautions in handling chlorine to prevent human exposure, and to reduce the threat to the facility's workers and nearby members of the commiunity.  It is the facility's policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and State rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the safe procedures used to handle chlorine; the safety devices and systems designed and constructed into the facility; and the training of the pertinent personnel.   \n\n2.  Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe facility provides chlorination service to swimming pools.  Chlorine is repackaged at the facility from one ton containers to 20 pound capacity service cylinders.  The 20 pound cylinders are used by the subject facility staff to service customer swimming pools.  The chlorine is purchased from and delivered by commercial chlorine suppliers.  Chlorine is repackaged as a liquid from the one ton containers to the 20 pound cylinders.  Any residual chlorine in the small diameter and short length piping of the repackaging system is directed to a liquid scrubber.  Filling is done by trained and qualified personnel during daylight hours.  Filling procedures are strictly followed.  \n\n3a.  Administrative Controls \n\nAdministrative controls to limit the distances for each reported scenario exist to restrict the amount of chlorine released to a minimum, if a release were to occur; and preferably to not have a release occur. This administrative control is inherent in the operational procedures for the chlorine systema nd the training provided to the chlorine system operators.\n\n3b.  Mitigation Measures\n\nMitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario exists to restrict the amount of chlorine released to a minimum, if a release were to occur; and preferably to not have a rel"

General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThis facility complies with all applicable federal and state codes and regulations.  There are safety meetings and safety training.  The Process Safety Management (PSM) program implemented at the facility for the chlorine related activities and equipment represents one of the facility's main active commitments to an accidental release prevention program. \n\n5.  Five Year Accident History\n\nThere have been no accidental releases in the last five years.\n\n6.  Emergency Response Program\n\nThe Emergency Response Program is based upon the alerting of personnel at the facility to evacutate the facility and await the arrival of responders from outside the facility at the evacuation assembly location if a release occurs that causes the evacuation to be initiated.  This response can be incorporated into the Area Plan for the Local Emergency Planning Committee.  \n\n7.  Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nAny commitments made for scheduled mitigation actions are listed in the RMP documentatoin.  These mitigation actions are being implemented at this time.  Current applicable codes and regulations are being reviewed to determine if other commitments need to be made to achieve increased operational safety for the chlorine system."
