We are developing and implementing a comprehensive emergency response plan and an accident prevention program at  our facility in response to the new RMP program.  We cooperate with public emergency planning agencies on a regular basis to develop and maintain contingency plans in case of an accidental release.  All of our employees attend procedural safety and emergency response classes.\n\nThe accident noted in this report was not a due to a failure in any of our procedures ofr equipment.  The accidental release came from a semi tanker truck owned and operated by Martin Resources, Inc. of Rochelle, GA.  The truck was in the process of off loading a supply of anhydrous ammonia at our bulk plant when the trucks transfer pump began to leak due to a seal failure.  Local emegergency responders were notified and they came to the scene.  The pump was bypassed and the uncontrolled release was stopped.  The only damage incurred was some damaged grass and brush along with some contaminated soil that was cleaned up.  \n\nOur anhydrous ammonia tank farm is inspected on a regular basis to ensure safe reliable operation.  The last comprehensive facility inspection was on March 23, 1999.  A chain link fence to keep out unauthorized personnel encloses the facility.  Safety placards are placed on the fence, on the tanks, and at fill stations.   The facility's 3-12,000 and 1-30000 gallon tanks are all equipped with pressure relief valves and gauges to prevent overpressurization.  The supply lines are equipped with excess flow devices that will automatically shut off the flow in the event of a pipe or transfer hose failure.  The tanks and pipes also feature manual shutoff valves to stop and isolate a leak so that it can be repaired.  The facility has a water purging system to clear any extraneous product from the transfer lines after use.  There is a safety shower located at the "
