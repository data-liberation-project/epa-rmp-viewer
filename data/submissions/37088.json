Management has committed to working with local agencies and the community to educate the public regarding the hazards of ammonia and to ensure a safe workplace and surrounding community.  Specific questions regarding RMP compliance at Albertsons should be addressed to Albertsons\u00bf Environmental Affairs Department.\nAlbertsons has prepared this RMP in accordance with the requirements imposed by the April 2004 revisions to the RMP regulations."

      "SummaryText": "Albertsons, Inc. (\u00bfAlbertsons\u00bf) is a diversified retailer of grocery products throughout the United States. Albertsons operates many retail grocery stores throughout Northern California that are supplied through a distribution and transportation complex located in San Leandro, California. The Albertsons\u00bf Refrigerated Distribution Center #8745, located on this facility site employs over 500 people and uses anhydrous ammonia for refrigeration of the products in storage. Anhydrous ammonia is subject to EPA regulation under 40 CFR 68, Accidental Release Risk Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals.\nAlbertsons San Leandro distribution center stores and uses anhydrous ammonia for refrigeration of grocery products in storage.  Albertsons\u00bf San Leandro distribution center has never experienced a release of ammonia involving consequences that affected residents or the environment.\nPursuant to the RMP regulations (40 CFR 68) and the Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations, Albertsons has developed a comprehensive PSM written program to protect employees and the surrounding community from exposure to the hazardous chemicals onsite.  The facility completed a process hazards analysis (PHA) for ammonia using the industry standard What-If?/Checklist Analysis developed through the International Institute for Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR). The PHA was completed using technical and operations staff from the San Leandro facility as well as experienced facilitators from an outside engineering firm (Dames & Moore).\nAlbertsons\u00bf implementation of the PSM program includes employee education in the hazards of ammonia and measures that can be used to reduce employee and community exposure to accidental releases of ammonia. The plans include preventive maintenance programs (mechanical integrity) for the ammonia system, and a program for both pre-startup safety reviews and management of changes (MOC) to this system. The program also includes specific requirements for safe work practices (su"
