This process utilizes anhydrous ammonia in the capacity of a SCR for the Best Available Control Technology (BACT).  The SCR system reduces NOX emissions by injecting ammonia into the exhaust gas stream upstream of a catalyst matrix.  Nitrogen oxides, ammonia, and oxygen react on the surface of the catalyst to form nitrogen and water.  The catalyst is comprised of a noble metal and works within a high temperature range for proper operations (800A? F to 1100A?F).  As such, the control efficiency of the SCR system is reducing NOX emissions to about 90 percent.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Level III Prevention Program applies to both processes.\n\n",

The facility uses anhydrous ammonia (CAS 7664-41-7) in a closed-loop refrigeration process (18,000 lbs. maximum intended inventory) for temperature control of fresh onions.  Under a separate process, anhydrous ammonia is used in a Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) system (300 lbs. maximum).  The SCR is used to control nitrogen oxides (NOX) emissions from a one Mega Watt natural gas-fired turbine. The ammonia refrigeration system and SCR processes trigger the RMP requirements, both Federal and Cal/ARP. These processes were determined to be covered by Prevention Program III requirements.\n\n\n\nAt the time of this writing, the SCR Process was not being used; and the ammonia inventory in the SCR Receiver was negligible.

To achieve this end, Gill's Onions strives to operate its facilities in compliance with applicable federal, state, and local safety, health, and environmental regulations.  With regard to the Ammonia Refrigeration and SCR Systems, the Accidental Release Prevention policy is to maintain compliance with the Risk and Process Safety Management Prevention Program elements.  The RMP/PSM programs are specifically designed and intended to prevent accidental releases; and to deal safely with emergencies if they do happen.\n\n\n\nGills Onions has adopted a Non-responding facility policy; Emergency Response pre-planning is coordinated with the Oxnard Fire/CUPA; and Facility Management.  Gills Onions has filed appropriate reports with the CUPA; measures have been taken to ensure the facility is included in the Community Emergency Plan.  The CUPA makes regular visits to the facility in accordance with California environmental regulations, which helps keep engine companies refreshed on Plant operations and layout.  The Gills Onions Emergency response policies are implemented to comply with the overall company policy of providing its workers with a safe workplace and minimizing risk to the public. Safety is the top priority.  Another priority is protection of the environment. Only after life, safety, environmental concerns are addressed will the focus shift to the secondary issues of property conservation and business recovery.\n\n\n\n1.2 General Description of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nOxnard is located on the southern margin of the Oxnard Plain, approximately 5 miles inland from the Pacific Ocean and approximately 50 miles west of Los Angeles, California.

Relief valves on both processes piped to header leading to ammonia a water (20,000 Ga.) diffuser tank\n\n16.    PH monitors\n\n\n\n1.3 No major changes in the refrigeration system\n\n\n\n1.4 Summary of the Five-Year Accident History \n\n\n\nAccording to a review of Gills Onions history as of May 23, 2019 the Gills Onions facility in Oxnard  had no accidental ammonia releases that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage within the last five years\n\n\n\n1.5 Emergency Response Program (ERP)\n\n\n\nGill's Onions has developed written emergency procedures to address elements that may be encountered during planning, responding or follow-up to an emergency at the facility. Application of the emergency procedures ensures compliance with OSHA Standard 29 CFR 1910.38 (Emergency Action Plans) within the emergency response element of the Risk Management Plan. The basic concept of Gill's Onions emergency procedures is to provide a comprehensive approach for managing emergencies. The four elements of this approach are prevention, preparedness, response, and recovery.\n\n\n\nTh"

      "SummaryText": "e Plant does participate in emergency response activities under the HAZWOPER standard in a defensive manner only.  Plant employees are to implement hazard communications, provide for the safety of visitors and report to the established Evacuation Staging Area(s) for a head count.  Emergency response is coordinated with the City of Oxnard Fire/CUPA.  The Refrigeration personnel and/or other Management would be available to support the Fire Department as technical resources.  The facility has communicated with Oxnard Fire/CUPA to be included in the Oxnard Community Emergency Plan.     \n\n\n\nThe ERP is designed to be applicable to any type of emergency that may affect Gill's Onions and based on the concept that the elements of emergency response are similar, regardless of the hazard. The ERP comprises the following sections:\n\n\n\n1. Agency Interface and Response Planning;\n\n2. Public and Agency Notification;\n\n3. Emergency Medical Care;\n\n4. Emergency Response Actions;\n\n5. Emergency Equipment;\n\n6. Emergency Response Training;\n\n7. Incident Command System; and\n\n8. Plan Review and Update.\n\n\n\nGill's Onions emergency response procedures serve as a guide for emergency control staff, company personnel, emergency assistance groups and law enforcement agencies that may be called upon to participate in controlling an emergency within the facility and surrounding areas. These procedures include employee notification of emergencies and evacuation procedures for emergency situations.  The facility is equipped with windsocks to help determine safe evacuation routes and staging areas.\n\n\n\n1.6 Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nThe primary mechanisms to identify and plan safety improvements include (but are not limited to):\n\n1.    Process Hazard Analysis revalidation/update;\n\n2.    Compliance Audits;\n\n3.    Routine inspections, tests & maintenance (Mechanical Integrity Program);\n\n4.    IIAR Bulletin 109 Inspections (IIAR minimum safety criteria for the safe operation of ammonia refrigeration process);\n"
