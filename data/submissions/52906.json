If an emergency were to occur, it is the facility's policy to notify the Lehigh County LEPC as well as the Lower Macungie Fire Department and Emergency Management Agency, as necessary.  Medical emergencies will require notification of the Lehigh County LEPC, Macungie Ambulance Corps and Lehigh Valley Hospital.  This facility does not maintain a trained fire brigade but does employ a hazardous materials response team and trained incipient stage fire response on-site to respond to small or the initial stages of an emergency.\n\nThe Buckeye Pipe Line Company L.P. - Macungie Station is a pipeline breakout station, including butane blending operations.  The Risk Management Program (RMP) covers the butane blending systems only, including the associated piping and six (6) 60,000 gallon storage tanks, up to (24) 30,000 gallon butane and propane railcars (propane storage for an adjacent facility may occur on the Buckeye Pipe Line rail spur), and one 30,000 gallon remote butane tank to service the vaporizer.\n\nThis facility's worst case scenario is the failure of one of the blending system's six (6) 60,000 gallon storage tanks when filled to the greatest amount allowed (85% at 60 degrees Fahrenheit) resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  The resulting distance to the endpoint (1 PSI overpressure) extends off-site 0.5 mile and includes public and environmental receptors.  The facility's alternate (most likely) release scenario is a \"BLEVE\" of a 60,000 gallon vessel filled to the greatest amount allowed (85% at 60 degrees Fahrenheit).  The resulting distance to the endpoint (5 Kw/m2 - 40 sec.) extends to 0.06 miles, and includes public and environmental receptors\n\nThe Buckeye Pipe Line Company L.P. - Macungie Stati"

This butane blending system is designed, constructed and maintained in accordance with NFPA #58 and the manufacturer's (Mid-Continent Energy and Texon LP) instructions.\n\nTo date, this facility has never had an accident involving butane which has resulted in deaths, injuries or property/environmental damage, evacuations or shelterings in-place.\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving the Buckeye Pipe Line Company L.P. - Macungie Station's butane blending system, it is the policy of the facility to initially contact the Lehigh County LEPC and the Lower Macungie Fire Department and request their assistance.  The facility currently has no trained fire brigade but does employ a hazardous materials response team and trained incipient fire response group.  The facility emergency response plans are coordinated by the fire department and the Lehigh County LEPC along with the Lower Macungie Emergency Management Agency.  The Lower Macungie Fire Department/Emergency Management Agency/Code Enforcement and Fire Inspector have participated in the initial RMP/PSM training session for this system."
