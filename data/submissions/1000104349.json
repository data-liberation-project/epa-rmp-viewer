This commitment is demonstrated in the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel on the proper operation and maintenance of plant equipment and preventative maintenance programs.\r\n\r\nSME has emergency response policies in place that are addressed in the facility's Health and Safety Plan, Industrial Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan (SWPPP), Spill Prevention, Controls, and Countermeasures Plan (SPCC), Facility Response Plan (FRP), and Emergency Action Plan. Most of the listed Plans have annual training requirements (at a minimum) to keep employees educated on emergency response procedures in place at the facility.  All new employees are required to attend orientation where the Plans listed above are reviewed.  New employees also undergo training on emergency response procedures prior to initiating responsibilities onsite.\r\n\r\nSME's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, plant personnel will respond to contain the release as necessary.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED:\r\nSME is located in Carrollton, Carroll County, Missouri.  The facility operates 24 hours per day, 7 days per week for the purpose of manufacturing fuel grade ethanol from the natural fermentation of corn.  The regulated substances stored at the facility are anhydrous ammonia and flammable mixture - natural gasoline (also referred to as denaturant).  \r\n\r\nWORST-CASE AND ALTERNATE CASE SCENARIOS:\r\nWorst-case Scenarios:\r\n1.  Anhydrous Ammonia:  Anhydrous ammonia is stored as a gas liquefied by pressure in an 18,"

A determination detailing the conversion from gallons to pounds of ammonia is included as part of RMP documentation.  RMP*Comp was used to determine the worst-case distance to endpoint (5.4 miles), the model results are also provided as part of RMP documentation.  The ammonia tank sits on a concrete pad, passive mitigation was not included as part of this scenario.  The facility can elect to place a fence around the ammonia tank for security purposes; the typical chain link fence used to enclose the ammonia tank would not prevent migration of a release.  Public receptor information was obtained using MARPLOT and EJSCREEN census reports.  No environmental receptors would be affected by a worst-case release of ammonia. \r\n\r\n2.  Flammable Mixture (Denaturant):  The flammable mixture stored onsite is natural gasoline, typically referred to as denaturant.  Natural gasoline is used onsite to denature ethanol prior to shipment off site.   Denaturant is stored in a 165,000-gallon steel tank in the facility tank farm.  The tank is located within a diked containment structure that contains an impermeable liner with gravel overlay.  An SDS was used to determine initial RMP applicability.  The breakdown of reportable constituents is included as part of the determination documentation.  The worst-case scenario used is the release of the entire contents of the denaturant tank, 839,109 pounds, causing a vapor cloud explosion.  Of the entire tank contents, equaling 839,109 pounds of the flammable mixture, only 448,923 pounds is reportable under CAA Section 112(r).   RMP*Comp was used to determine the worst-case distance to endpoint (0.6 mile), the model results are provided as part of RMP documentation.   Public receptor information was obtained using MARPLOT and EJSCREEN census reports.  No environmental receptors"

      "SummaryText": "are affected by a worst-case release of denaturant.\r\n\r\nAlternate Scenarios:\r\n1.  Anhydrous Ammonia:  The alternate scenario used for anhydrous ammonia is a release of 41,500 pounds due to a transfer hose failure from a pressurized anhydrous ammonia delivery truck.  This scenario is considered the most likely cause of an ammonia release onsite.  The alternate release duration assumed is 10 minutes with an atmospheric stability of D and wind speed of 3.0 m/sec.  The facility control room is manned 24 hours/day and would be alerted of the relief valve failure at the ammonia tank within minutes.  The emergency shutdown system installed at the facility was not considered in this scenario as active mitigation. RMP*Comp was used to determine the alternate distance to endpoint (1.2 miles), the model results are provided as part of RMP documentation.  Public receptor information was obtained using MARPLOT and EJSCREEN census reports.  No environmental receptors are affected by an alternate release of anhydrous ammonia.\r\n\r\n2.  Flammable Mixture (Denaturant):  The alternate scenario used for the flammable mixture is the release of 9,400 gallons (47,804 pounds) of natural gasoline due to a tanker truck loadout spill, causing a pool fire.   The endpoint used was the distance to the heat radiation endpoint of 5 kW/square meter.  Denaturant deliveries at the facility typically occur during normal business hours with a facility staff member overseeing loadout operations - therefore a release at the loadout area could be ceased within minutes by manual overrides.  The loadout area also has a catchment basin with underground piping to secondary containment of the tank farm.   For this scenario passive and active mitigation was not considered, as the mitigation strategies currently in place would not contain a vapor cloud fire.  RMP*Comp was used to determine the alternate distance to endpoint (0.2 mile), the model results are provided as part of RMP documentation. The entire tanker c"

Anhydrous ammonia qualifies as a Program 3 substance.  A PSM program has been implemented at the facility covering ammonia and flammable mixture.\r\n\r\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS:\r\nPlease review the first section of this Executive Summary for general accidental release prevention program information.\r\n\r\nSME's maintenance staff performs regular preventative maintenance inspections, as required by the manufacturer's recommendations and/or State and Federal regulations.  Monthly and quarterly visual inspections are performed and documented, records are maintained in the Safety Director's office.  Quarterly Leak Detection and Repair (LDAR) monitoring is performed and reports filed per State and Federal regulations.\r\n\r\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\r\nThere have been no reportable accidents involving RMP-reportable substances.\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM:\r\nSME has several safety programs in place at the facility that incorporate emergency response, including the Health and Safety Plan and FRP.  SME also maintains an Emergency Action Plan the details evacuation and response procedures for spills and releases, fire, etc.  The plans listed in this section have been prepared in accordance with applicable regulations.\r\n\r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY:\r\nSME provides safety training to its employees on an annual basis.  Contractors are trained on plant-specific safety procedures prior to initiating work onsite.  Any changes to improve safety will be implemented immediately upon discovery of n"
