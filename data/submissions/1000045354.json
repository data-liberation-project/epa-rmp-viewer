Propylene is purchased from an outside vendor and is delivered to the Plant via tank truck, railcar, or pipeline. The tanker's or railcar contents are unloaded at unloading stations by Plant operators into above ground pressurized bullet tanks identified as T23-T27 which is located on the East Side of the plant.

Each of these elements is described below. Also described within each of these elements are associated chemical-specific prevention steps, where applicable.\r\n\r\n3a. Process Safety Information\r\nWritten process safety information is compiled before conducting process hazard analyses for the manufacturing process including the RMP chemicals. This enables the employees involved in operating these processes to identify and understand the potential hazards associated with the processes. The information complied includes data on the safe use and handling of the regulated chemicals (e.g., Material Safety Data Sheets), data on the process technology (e.g., Process Flow Diagrams, process chemistry, flow rates and storage capacities, operating limits and evaluation of exceedances), and data on the equipment used in the process (e.g., Piping & Instrument Diagrams, materials compatibility, energy ratings and classification, control devices and emergency systems, ventilation systems, design basis including conformance to applicable codes and standards).

Each process hazard analysis addresses the process hazards, process incident history, process control devices and detection systems, evaluation of failure of process control devices, equipment location, and human factors. A team of employees having experience and knowledge of the process design and operation, and knowledge of how to complete a process hazard analysis performs each process hazard analysis. The Management of Change process (described below) is used to track and document process changes, which occur as a result of recommendations from process hazard analyses.\r\n\r\n3c.

Mechanical Integrity\r\nThe Baytown Plant maintains the mechanical integrity of equipment used to process and handle RMP listed chemicals. Such equipment includes pressurized vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, pressure relief and vent systems, emergency control devices, pumps, and valves. Written procedures are established to define the scope and requirements of the mechanical integrity program. Maintenance employees engaged in carrying out the mechanical integrity program are trained to complete the required tasks in a safe manner.\r\nOne component of the mechanical integrity program includes inspection and testing of process equipment. Equipment inspection and testing conducted in accordance with manufacturer's recommendations and generally accepted good engineering practices.
