Tank P-50-5, which represents the facility's worst-case VAM release scenario, was placed into VAM service for the first time on February 25, 2010.  VAM is received into this tank via barge delivery using a dedicated marine dock line.  Product is stored and then shipped outbound according to customer requirements via marine parcel tankers that load at Stolthaven Houston's existing Ship Dock 2/3.  VAM may also be transferred periodically directly from barges to rail tank cars with no intermediate product storage.\n\nAs a result of the 2010 VAM storage project for Tank P-50-5, piping modifications were completed in various facility manifolds and at Tank P-50-5 to eliminate the use of hoses in VAM s"
