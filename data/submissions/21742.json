(IBP) Montgomery City, Missouri facility management to implement the requirements of this Risk Management Program (RMP) in accordance with the USEPA regulations under 40 CFR Part 68 and with the corresponding regulations under OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) program.  The objective is to minimize the risk of a release of a hazardous material and if a release occurs, to minimize the potential impact to IBP employees, the public and the environment.  This objective will be accomplished by utilizing general good operating procedures, providing appropriate training to all employees, and coordinating response activities, as necessary, with the local emergency response providers.  This plan covers all IBP owned activities at this facility.\r\nIBP's management is committed to providing the resources necessary to implement this policy.\r\nFacility Description\r\nIBP operates a cold storage warehouse and distribution center at this location.  Support operations include receiving, shipping and administrative offices.  The facility was constructed in 1999.\r\nOne chemical is utilized at the facility in sufficient quantities to be subject to the requirements of 40 CFR Part 68.  This chemical is ammonia and is used as a refrigerant throughout the facility.\r\nWorst-Case and Alternative-Release Scenarios\r\nRMP regulations require that each facility identify worst-case and alternative case release scenarios.  EPA has defined a worst-case release as the release of the entire contents of the largest vessel that contains a regulated substance in a 10-minute period.  This release rate is then evaluated using modeling techniques and/or reference tables to define the distance to a specified endpoint (concentration or overpressure).  The distance to the endpoint is affected by several factors including molecular weight, volatility, heat of combustion, and physical setting"

The alternative release scenario is also evaluated to define the distance to the specified endpoint.\r\nUnder 40 CFR 68 Subpart B \u00a768.22(e), the RMP rule identifies surface roughness as a parameter to be used in the hazard assessment to determine the physical setting of the site, urban or rural.  \"Urban means there are many obstacles in the immediate area; obstacles include buildings or trees.  Rural means there are no buildings in the immediate area and the terrain is generally flat and unobstructed.\"\r\nDue to the lack of trees, hills, and/or other structures in the immediate vicinity of the Montgomery City, Missouri facility, a rural dispersion environment was assumed.\r\nAmmonia\r\nThe data provided in the document EPA's guidance document \"Risk Management Program Guidance For Ammonia Refrigeration\" (November 1998) was used to estimate the toxic endpoint distance for the worst-case ammonia release scenario.  Since the worst-case ammonia release would involve liquid and would come from a pressurized system containing liquid; the released gas should be classified as a dense gas (a result of evaporative cooling).  The ammonia refrigeration document provides calculated endpoint distances for typical meteorological conditions.\r\nThe worst-case release scenario for an anhydrous ammonia release included a release of all the contents of the high temperature accumulator in a 10-minute period (per EPA guidelines).  This release translates to a release of 2,345 pounds of ammonia in 10 minutes or 234.5 lbs/min.  Other assumptions included in the worst-case assessment are: the ammonia is a liquefied gas; the high temperature accumulator is not diked; the release does not take place indoors; the nearfield dispersion environment is characterized as rural; 10-minute averaging period; the wind speed"

The results of the worst-case assessment for ammonia show that the plume must travel 0.87 miles (1.4 kilometers) before dispersing to the endpoint concentration of 201 ppm.\r\nThe selected alternative-release scenario for the ammonia systems is a release from a relief valve due to overpressure of a compressor unit.  The largest relief valve in the system was used in this scenario.  The largest relief valve has a relief rate of 68.5 pounds of air per minute.  As a matter of convention, the specified release rate of any relief valve is always in pounds of air per minute.  The release rate of 68.5 pounds of air per minute correlates to a release rate of 49.1 pounds of ammonia vapor per minute.  This release rate was applied to a release from the ammonia header on top of the building.\r\nThe data provided in the document EPA's guidance document \"Risk Management Program Guidance For Ammonia Refrigeration\" (November 1998) was used to estimate the toxic endpoint distance for the alternative ammonia release scenario.  The ammonia refrigeration document provides calculated endpoint distances for typical meteorological conditions (3 m/s wind speed, D atmospheric stability, 50% relative humidity).  It has been determined, through a review of IBP's operational history, that the total release would likely be 500 pounds of ammonia.  Based on the release rate of 49.1 lbs/min, the duration for a 500-pound release is 10.2 minutes.  Other assumptions include that no active or passive mitigation measures are currently in place and a rural dispersion environment in the nearfield.  The results of the alternative-release scenario for an ammonia release indicates that the endpoint concentration of 201 ppm is reached at 0.10 miles (160 meters) from the release point.\r\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\r\nThe Montgomery City, Missouri facility is governed by a set of O"
