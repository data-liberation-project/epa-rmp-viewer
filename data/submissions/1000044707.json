Simplot Company (Policy Statement EN 01.1) to manufacture, handle, store, and dispose of all substances safely and in compliance with the requirements of federal, state, and local environmental laws, while reducing the risks to human health, safety and the environment.  Each manager/supervisor is expected to responsibly implement this policy, and each employee is expected to comply fully with the spirit, as well as the letter of this policy.  The Company will assure that the environmental, health and safety laws, regulations, and standards applicable to its products and operations are known and obeyed by employees.\n\n\n\nThe J.R.

Anhydrous Ammonia is received, stored, and distributed to area customers as a source of land-applied nitrogen fertilizer.  Aqua Ammonia is received, stored, and distributed to area customers as a source of land-applied nitrogen fertilizer.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThis Ammonia facility implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements of the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\", as published by the American National Standard Institute, Inc. (ANSI K61.1); standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety & Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\"; and standards of California OSHA (CalOSHA), 8 CCR Sections 500-515, \"Unfired Pressure Vessel Safety Orders - Anhydrous Ammonia\".\n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nIn the past five years, there has been one accidental emergency releases of anhydrous ammonia at this site.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThis facility has developed a written site-specific emergency response plan and an emergency contingency plan (Integrated Contingency Plan).  The plans address the regulations concerning emergency plans as mandated under:  OSHA 29 CFR 1910.38, 1910.119, & 1910.120; EPA 40 CFR part 264 subpart D, part 265 subpart D, part 68 and 279.52; DOT/RSPAFRP 49 CFR part 194; and California Health & Safety Code section 25503 of Division 6.95.  Elements within this plan include employee training, SARA Title III reporting requirements and community right-to-know, pre-emergency planning, and emergency response planning.\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nSafety and environmental programs are very dynamic, and since this is an ongoing process, changes toward improvements are evaluated and implemented periodically.  The need for improvement is identified by facility employee inputs, inspections, and audits, which are performed on a regular basis.\n\n"
