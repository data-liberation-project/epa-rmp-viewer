We are committed to the safety and well being of our employees, community and the environment.  Through regular safety training in areas such as hazard awareness, daily operating guidelines, and worker protection, Country Star employees have minimized any potential risk of a hazardous release due to human error.  If an accident were to occur, our emergency response policies would take effect to ensure the proper calls were made and emergency response crews would respond in a timely manner.\n\nThe Gardner facility is located in Auburn township which is on the north east side of Crawford county.  The facility is equiped to handle fertilizer and crop protection products.  Anhydrous Ammonia is a fertilizer used by farmers as the most economical source of nitrogen used to grow crops.  Two Anhydrous tanks are located at the facility the largest being a 30,000 gallon tank. \n\nThe worst-case release scenario would be a total release of the entire tank.  The contents would be released over a 10 minute period.  The total impact of the release would cover an area of 1.12 miles which reaches just into Huron and Richland counties.  This release could impact forty some households holding around 125 people.  This release could also impact the private water supply of the Celeryville farmers.  Although the water is not used for drinking it isused to irrigate crops throughout the area.  This water is located just north and east of the facility.  \n\nThe alternative release scenario could be a release of Anhydrous through a transfer hose.  The largest hose being two inch would release about 5,954 pounds of Anhydrous a minute.  Over a two minute time the release would cover approximately .56 miles.  Within this zone approximately 11 homes and 31 people could be affected.  \n\nCountry Star Co-op has never had a release of a Anhydrous storage tank that has caused any deat"
