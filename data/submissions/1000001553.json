Pool Chlor has ensured a safe operation dating back to 1966.\n\nPool Chlor's manager/owner is personally committed to offer superior service and to maintain a safety and environmental program to promote a safe environment for all its employees and the surrounding communities.  The owner administers the company's safety and environmental policies. He is also responsible for various inspections to ensure compliance, and oversees the entire safety and environmental programs.  These programs include, hazard communications, Hazardous Materials Emergency Business Plan, employee safety manuals, manufacturers documentation, Emergency Response, as well as the Risk Management Plan.\n\nFACILITY AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE HANDLED\n\nStartup of the chlorine system occurred on 1966.  The process is located at 3036 East Malaga Avenue, Fresno, CA 93725.  The chlorine transfer process for Pool Chlor, Inc. consists of chlorine one-ton containers which are the storage vessels.  Chlorine liquid is dispensed from the one-ton container through a filling manifold to a 22-pound cylinder. These cylinders are used off-site to treat residential swimming pools.\n\nThe maximum quantity of chlorine on-site is eight one-ton containers (16,000 pounds).\n\nThe number of full-time employees on site is 13; however, there are 9 route-men that may visit the site each morning to pick up supplies.  These employees normally work off-site during business hours.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nPool Chlor has a Process Safety Management program in place to manage the handling of chlorine.  In addition, common industry standards, policies, and procedures are utilized to ensure safe practices are being performed.  This includes common practices outlined by the Chlorine Institute and the National Associatio"

There is a chlorine sensor in the area that will alarm in the office if a concentration of 3 ppm is detected.  In the event that the release occurs during off-hours, the alarm company is notified.  The alarm company will contact the on-call employee to investigate the alarm.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nAn investigation into the Pool Chlor of Fresno facility's accident history revealed that there have been no reportable chlorine releases over the past five years (March 2004 - March 2009) that exceeded the Federal Reportable Quantity of 10 pounds or the state requirement mandating immediate reporting of any release or threatened release of a hazardous material.  In addition, there have been no injuries resulting from a chlorine release.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nPool Chlor of Fresno is a designated non-responding facility.  The facility's emergency action procedures, including notification, evacuation, response, cleanup, and training, are included in the Injury Illness and Prevention Program. In the event if a release of chlorine, employees have been trained to notify management.  Management personnel will determine the nature of the incident and determine of outside agencies should be notified.   In the event that the release is uncontrollable, outside agencies (9-1-1, Fresno County Environmental Health, and California Office of Emergency Services) will be notified.   In addition to the outside agency telephone numbers, the Injury Illness and Prevention Program includes the telephone and location of the nearest medical facility (Fresno Community Hospital) and neighboring businesses.\n\nNeutralizing agents and fire extinguishers are kept in the work areas.  Employees have been trained in how to use these items.  Work areas are cleaned daily. Each employee knows where the emergency shut-off val"
