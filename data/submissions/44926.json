Never approach the area of a spill by yourself or without notifying your supervisor. The person accompanying the person doing the assessment or control work must be equally protected and trained to handle the emergency.\nThe following guidelines must be followed as part of the initial response:\na) Use of Level B PPE (SCBA or supplied airline respirators) is mandatory for the initial entry. After atmospheric hazard evaluation is completed, lower PPE's could be selected but only as indicated by the Emergency Coordinator in charge.\nB)    The use of the buddy system (work in pairs) is also mandatory.\nIn addition the following precautions should be taken:\na) Approach the spill from its upwind side.\nB) Do not touch the material and avoid any direct or indirect contact with it.

Caution, if you detect a warm door, and you suspect a fire, do not open the door.\nIi) Hazardous work, or work with hazardous materials, in all affected areas will be stopped immediately.\nIii) All feed lines and additional equipment will be shut down and monitored for leaks, pressure build up, gas generation, ruptures in valves, pipes or equipment.\nIv)    The Emergency Coordinator will be contacted.\nV) The area will be cleared of all personnel not actively involved in fighting the fire.

In the event of an imminent or actual emergency situation, the Emergency Coordinator will be the person to issue the notification, and if their help is needed, civil defense, fire or police departments will also be notified.

If the incident is determined to lie within the capabilities of the internal response team, the Emergency Coordinator will deploy the necessary personnel. If the incident is beyond the capabilities of the internal team, then the Emergency Coordinator will contact the appropriate external contractors or agencies.\nThe intent of any initial response effort will be to protect human health and safety, and then the environment. Identification, containment, treatment and disposal will then become the secondary response.\nIn the event of a leak or spill, a contractor will be summoned to remove any standing liquids and haul the material to a facility approved to handle such materials.\nIf for some reason the spill is not contained within a dike or sump area, an area of isolation will be established around the spill. The size of the area will generally depend on the size of the spill and the characteristics of the materials involved. If the spill is large and involves the rupture of a tank or pipeline, an initial isolation of at least 100 ft. in all directions will be established to allow clean-up and repair and to prevent exposure. When any spill occurs, only those persons involved in overseeing or performing emergency operations will be allowed within the designated hazard area. If possible, the area will be roped, taped or otherwise blocked off and properly posted to indicate the hazards present.\nIf the spill results in the release of a toxic vapor or fume cloud, further evacuation will be enforced. An area of at least 500 ft. wide and 1000 ft. long will be evacuated downwind of where volatile materials are spilled"

When this is not feasible, the Weather Service can be contacted at 791-0376 or the Luis Munoz Marin International Airport can be contacted at 791-6153 for accurate wind conditions.\nThe Puerto Rico Environmental Quality Board and the National Response Center will be notified whenever one of the following situations occur:\ni) A spill discharges to a surface water and the quantity of hazardous material is equal to or greater than the Reportable Quantity specified under 40 CFR Part 117.\nii) One thousand gallons or more of oil are spilled in a single event. If a lesser quantity has been spilled, but has entered a storm sewer, it is advisable to contact local authorities for assistance or if it is not possible to intercept\nthe spill at the outfall or prevent the oil slick from moving.\niii) The spill involves other hazardous materials not listed but used at the facilities, if they pose an actual or potential hazard to life or property.\nIf the Emergency Coordinator determines that the company is unable to handle the emergency, the local, state, and federal authorities will be notified of the situation. Evacuation of all affected areas will begin as soon as possible.\nMost materials spills and leaks are contained within the dikes and sump provided in the backyard area. Small spills occurring in a diked area are flushed with plenty of water to the sump provided in that area. The area is dried using absorbent material. All disposable PPE and absorbing material used will be disposed of properly.\nFor all large spills or serious leaks the following guidelines will be followed as closely as possible. These are only general guidelines and actual circumstances may dictate that certain alterations be made to these procedures:\ni) If a leak develops or a spill occurs, the person discovering the discharge will immediately contact the Emergency Coordinator.

It may be helpful to instruct the caller in initial first aid procedures. Then call the local hospitals.\nd) Call the local fire department if a fire is involved that cannot be extinguished by facility personnel. Fight small fires with dry chemicals, C02 or foam, and large fires with water jetspray, fog, or foam. Keep heat exposed containers cooled with water spray and remove them from the fire if possible. If a rising sound comes from a venting device or container begins to discolor, withdraw immediately from the area.\ne) Dispatch emergency personnel to the site to take the appropriate action.\nf) Contact the proper authorities if the spill or release is large.

In addition to the alarm, the internal telephone system is used to notify key personnel as to the nature of the emergency and the recommended plan of action. Total facility evacuation is initiated only by an Emergency Coordinator.\nIn the event a facility evacuation is imminent, the following actions will be taken: i) The warning for evacuation will be activated.\nii) Gates will be opened immediately.
