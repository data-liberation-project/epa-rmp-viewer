This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that  have been designed and implemented, including:\n\nl\tA description of the facility and use of substances regulated by EPA's RMP regulation\nl\tA summary of results from our assessment of the potential offsite consequences from accidental chemical releases\nl\tAn overview of accidental release prevention programs\nl\tA five-year accident history for accidental releases of chemicals regulated by EPA's RMP rule\nl\tAn overview of the emergency response program\nl\tAn overview of planned improvements at the facility to help prevent accidental chemical releases from occurring\n                      and adversely affecting our employees, the public, and the environment\nl\tThe certifications that EPA's RMP rule requires us to provide\nl\tThe detailed information (called data elements) about the risk management program\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe Jacksonville facility produces aroma and flavor chemicals using a variety of chemicals and processing operations.  The facility consists of 54 acres in a predominantly residential and commercial neighborhood. The main processes are distillation and catalytic reactions. The chemical in use  that EPA has identified as having the potential to cause significant offsite consequences in the event of a substantial accidental release, are as follows:\n\nToxics\n\nNone, although Ammonia and Anhydrous Hydrogen Chloride are present at the site, the quantities do not exceed the threshol"

The following are brief summaries of these scenarios, including information about the key administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the exposure distances for each scenario:\n\nWorst-case Release Scenario(s) - Regulated Toxic Chemicals\nThere are no regulated toxic chemicals above the established thresholds in any process at the site.\n\nWorst-case Release Scenario(s) - Regulated Flammable Chemicals\n\nEthylamine Storage and Handling\nThe worst case scenario used for Ethylamine storage was a complete and sudden failure in storage system which releases the entire content of the tank within 10 minutes. The ethylamine immediately vaporizes and the gas cloud explodes. According to the EPA lookup tables, the off site consequences of this explosion would be felt 0.26 miles from the facility. The end point for effect of the explosion is 1 psi. Millennium considers this event to be highly unlikely because of the following safeguards:\n1. The plant complies with OSHA PSM standard 29CFR1910.119 and this RMP rule.\n2. The equipment and processes used are specifically designed and maintained for safe storage and handling of ethylamine. The equipment is equipped with multiple and redundant safety reliefs and automatic shutdown systems.\n3. The plant is staffed 24 hr/day 7 days/wk with trained operators and maintenance mechanics. Operators are trained to respond to releases and fires. \n\nThe scenarios presented abo"

The accident prevention programs in place include:\n\nOSHA Process Safety Management per 29CFR1910.119\nEPA Risk Management Plan per 40CFR Part 68\nACC Responsible Care (R) Process Safety Management Code \nIntegrated Contingency Plan which includes  all types of emergency planning  as required by EPA, OSHA regulations. \nInspections and Preventative Maintenance\nIncident Investigation\n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere have been no reportable releases of monoethyl amine from the site since it was first introduced to the plant in drum quantities in1978\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe facility maintains an integrated contingency plan, which consolidates all of the various federal, state and local regulatory requirements for  emergency response planning. The program provides the essential planning and training  for effectively protecting the employees, the public and the environment during emergency conditions. The plan is available to the Local Emergency Planning Council and to Responders for coordination with the community plan.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThe facility has a systematic program for reviewing process hazards and as improvements are identified as worthwhile, they will be implemented.\n\nCERTIFICATION\n\nThe undersigned certifies  that, to the best of my knowledge, information, and belief, formed after reasonable inquiry, the information submitted is true, accurate and complete.\n\n\n\nSignature:\n\nTitle:\n\nDate:\n\n\n\nRMP ELEMENTS\n\nSection 1.
