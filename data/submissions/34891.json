If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the Anamosa Fire Department,    \nJones County  Local Emergency Planning Committee or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and environment.\n\n2.\t  The stationary source and the regulated substance handled.\n\nThe primary activity at the facility, which is located at, Anamosa  is the storage and blending of fertilizer for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient.  The storage and \nhandling system consists of    18,000    gallon storage tanks, loading risers associated plumbing and nurse tanks.  Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel and authorized contractors. \n\nThe maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia that can be stored would be 237,000 pounds, this includes the amount of anhydrous ammonia that could be stored in nurse tanks.\n\n3.\t  The worst-case scenario and the alternative release scenario.\n\nThe worst-case release would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be    84,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank as limited by design standards.\n\nThe distance of the endpoint of .14mg/L for the worst-case scenario is .94  miles.\n\nThe alternative release scenario based on the most likely potential incident is a release from a break in a transfer hose.  Emergency shutdown procedures, which include the closing of tank valves if possible, otherwise excess flow valves was the only active mitigation considered to limit the amount of product released\n\nThe distance"
