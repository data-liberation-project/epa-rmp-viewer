Three, 1-ton containers are typically stored in the Chlorine Storage Room at the WTP.\n\n3. Process Facility (chlorine)\nPerdue Farms boosts the chlorine concentration from the water treatment plant from 1 to 50 ppm for use in the sanitation of process equipment.  The chlorination process involves withdrawing chlorine gas from a container under vacuum and injecting the gas to the process water for use throughout the facility.  The total quantity of chlorine used in this process is 8,000 pounds in the form of two, 1-ton containers connected in parallel and two additional 1-ton chlorine containers stored adjacent to the interconnected containers.  All four of the chlorine containers are stored outside and are surrounded by a 6 foot chain-link fence.\n\n* General Accident Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\nThe Perdue Farms facility maintains a Process Safety Management (PSM) of Highly Hazardous Chemicals plan prepared in accordance with the Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA) regulation 29 CFR 1910.119.  Perdue Farms also utilizes a preventative maintenance program for its system components.  As part of this program, maintenance personnel inspect the refrigeration system operating parameters and monitoring system five times per shift with all observations logged on a checklist.  Additionally, maintenance personnel conduct daily inspections of the chlorination system at each water treatment facility to ensure proper operation.\n\n* Five-year Accident History\nThere have been no accidents involving chlorine or ammonia at this facility nor off-site that have resulted in death(s), injuries, property damage, evacuations, environmental damage or sheltering in place.\n\n* Emergency Response Program\nPerdue Farms has implemented a comprehensive Emergency Response Plan in accordance with the OSHA PSM regulations.  The facility has a traine"

The written Emergency Response Plan contains specific information regarding Emergency Response organization and procedures, as well as incident notification, mitigation, and incident preparedness.  In addition, Perdue Farms training program includes annual refreshers.  Also, the plant conducts a mock evacuation two times per year with periodic drills coordinated with local emergency responders (Cromwell and Beaver Dam Fire Departments).  The facility has also developed a comprehensive Emergency Action Plan (EAP) to address other emergency response related incidents such as bomb threats, spills or releases of hazardous materials, evacuation, and tornados or dangerous weather conditions.\n\n* Planned Changes to Improve Safety\nPerdue Farms has installed an ammonia gas detection system and exhaust fans in the Mechanical Room and Remote Recirculation Room.  In order to minimize the exposure of facility personnel in the event of a release, exhaust fans are activated if the ammonia concentration is detected inside the rooms at a pre-set concentration.  Also, the facility conducts a periodic vibration analysis to ensure the mechanical integrity of the refrigeration system.  In addition, as part of Perdue's continuous improvement philosophy, all Perdue facilities continue to identify and update system components and techniques to ensure safety."

      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\nPerdue Farms (Cromwell Processing Center) - Beaver Dam, KY\nRMP 2009\n\t\n* Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nPerdue Farms has developed and implemented spill prevention control & countermeasure (SPCC), emergency action plan (EAP) and process safety management (PSM) plans as part of the accidental release / emergency response program.  The programs involve a wide-range of senior management personnel (including Environmental Services Manager and Safety Supervisor).  Additionally, Perdue conducts regular safety meetings and training involving many levels of personnel.  Perdue's policies and procedures are outlined in the respective plans.  Perdue's corporate policy is to inspect, maintain and operate equipment and facilities to prevent accidents, including release of hazardous materials; and to train employees in prevention, as well as to prepare them to respond rapidly and effectively should an accident occur.\n\n* Stationary Sources and Regulated Substances Handled\n1. Refrigeration (anhydrous ammonia)\nAmmonia is used for refrigeration purposes.  The processing facility operates a three-temperature, single-stage, anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system along with a remote recirculation room that maintains a four-temperature, single-stage system.  The entire refrigeration system is a closed loop liquid re-circulation system with a total system storage capacity of 42,500 pounds.  The majority of the refrigeration components are located in the processing mechanical room, with the exception of the condensers located on the roof and piping located throughout the facility.\n\n2. Water Treatment Plant (chlorine)\nThe facility operates a water treatment plant (WTP) with a maximum capacity of 3 million gallons per day (MGD).  Currently, the WTP treats approximately 1.2 MGD for the facility and 0.5 MGD for public water supply.  Raw water withdrawn from the Green River is treated by the addition of conventional water treatment chemicals to ai"
