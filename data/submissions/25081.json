There are seven existing units at CCPP: Units 1-3 which have been retired, Units 4 and 5 which continue to operate as synchronous condensers for support of the regional transmission system, and Units 6 and 7 which continue to operate for electric power generation.  Mirant is currently constructing a new combined cycle power generation unit (Unit 8) at the CCPP site.\n\n\n\nMirant will retrofit the existing Units 6 and 7 at CCPP with Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) systems in order to reduce emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx), as required to comply with Bay Area Air Quality Management District (BAAQMD) Regulation 9, Rule 11, \"Nitrogen Oxides and Carbon Monoxide from Electric Power Generating Steam Boilers\". The new Unit 8 will also utilize SCR systems to reduce its NOx emissions and comply with its permitted NOx emission limits.  Mirant completed the SCR retrofit of Unit 7 in November of 2001 and is scheduled to complete the retrofit of Unit 6 with an SCR system in Spring, 2004.  The new Unit 8 is scheduled to become operational in June, 2005.\n\n\n\nThe SCR technology utilizes aqueous ammonia to reduce NOx emissions from the generating units.  The concentration of ammonia in the aqueous solution will be 29.4 % by weight.  This substance is listed as a hazardous material under both California and federal regulations.\n\n\n\nIn order to prevent accidental releases of hazardous materials and to reduce their potential impact on the public and the environment, a federal program was established in 1990 as described in Section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act.  The California Office of Emergency Services established the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program to pre"

The CalARP Program specifies the regulated substances, oversees the federal requirements, and determines the requirements for the preparation of a Risk Management Plan (RMP) and offsite accidental release consequence analysis.  In Contra Costa County, the Administering Agency overseeing the CalARP program is the Contra Costa County Health Services Department (CCCHSD), to whom this RMP will be submitted.\n\n\n\nSince the quantity of aqueous ammonia to be stored and used at the Contra Costa Power Plant (CCPP) will be greater than both the Federal and State Threshold Quantities, a RMP is required.  As shown in this RMP, even a highly improbable worst-case release from the CCPP aqueous ammonia system will not cause the toxic endpoint concentration for ammonia (200 ppmv) to occur offsite.  In addition, the more stringent 30-minute Short-Term Public Emergency Limit (STPEL) proposed by the National Research Council (75 ppmv) will not be exceeded at any neighboring residences or businesses as a result of the hypothetical worst-case release.   Also, CCPP has not experienced any accidental release during the last five years that caused an offsite impact.  Accordingly, this process qualifies for a Program 1 RMP under both the CalARP and federal regulations.  In order to fulfill the Program 1 requirements, the following actions were completed: \n\n\n\n    - Analyze the worst-case release scenario.\n\n    - Document that the nearest public receptor is beyond the distance to a toxic endpoint.\n\n    - Document that no hazardous material accidents occurred at CCPP in the past 5 years.\n\n    - Ensure that response actions have been coordinated with local emergency planning and response agencies.\n\n    - Certify in the RMP that \"no additional measures are necessary to prevent offsite impacts from accidental releases.\"\n\n\n\nTo ensure continued compliance with the CalARP regulations, Mirant will "

The organization of the RMP follows that provided in the Contra Costa County CalARP Program Guidance Document.\n\n\n\n1.2 ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nMirant is committed to being a responsible member of the community in which it operates by giving top priority to operating in a safe and environmentally sound manner.  It is the policy of Mirant to conduct business in a manner that protects the environment and the health and safety of the public and its employees by: \n\n\n\n    - Meeting or surpassing all environmental laws, regulations and permit requirements, and verifying this commitment through environmental auditing. \n\n    - Seeking to ensure that environmental laws, regulations and permit requirements are based on sound science and cost-effective technology. \n\n    - Pursuing opportunities to enhance the quality of the environment. \n\n    - Promoting public and employee understanding of environmental issues and the company's environmental activities. \n\n    - Establishing company and organizational environmental goals and implementation plans. \n\n    - Ensuring that employees are aware of their individual roles and responsibilities in the implementation of this environmental policy.\n\n\n\nA copy of the Mirant California environmental policy is provided in Appendix A of the RMP.  As it is impossible to create a brief description of all of the environmental, health and safety programs and their manuals at CCPP, Mirant California's health and safety program manual can be found in Appendix B of the RMP.

The proposed location of the aqueous ammonia unloading and storage facility has been selected largely on the basis of safety considerations.  This location will maximize the distance from the property fence line, reducing any potential offsite impacts due to a spill, while minimizing the piping distance to the Units.  In addition, the location was chosen because of the facility area's low occupancy, its easy access for delivery trucks, and to distance the aqueous ammonia storage system from combustible equipment and minimize potential impacts to plant personnel.\n\n\n\nThe aqueous ammonia unloading and storage facility will consist of a truck unloading station and three aqueous ammonia storage tanks.  The storage facility will be designed and constructed to receive and store aqueous ammonia for the retrofitted utility boilers, Units 6 and 7, and the new combined-cycle gas turbine generating Unit 8.\n\n\n\nThe storage facility to service the SCRs on existing Units 6, 7 and new Unit 8 will include three 20,000-gallon carbon steel storage tanks, approximately 12 feet in diameter by 26 feet long.  The tanks will be constructed in compliance with Uniform Building Code Seismic Zone 4, Uniform Fire Code Article 80, and American Society of Mechanical Engineers Pressure Vessel Code Section VIII, Division 1, Rules for Construction of Pressure Vessels.  The tanks will have maximum design pressure and temperature of 50 pounds per square inch gauge (psig) and 120?F, respectively.\n\n\n\nThe aqueous ammonia tanks will be supported horizontally on concrete foundations within a walled containment basin approximately 68 feet long by 44 feet wide, that will slope to a centrally located, covered sump beneath the t"

Pumps for forwarding the aqueous ammonia to the power plant Units and for unloading aqueous ammonia from delivery tanker trucks will also be located within the containment basin.\n\n\n\nAqueous ammonia will be delivered to the Contra Costa Power Plant via tanker truck.  Individual tanker trucks can transport up to 6,500 gallons of aqueous ammonia.  The concrete slab under the truck unloading station is designed to contain the contents of one full truck and will be sloped to quickly drain any accidental releases of aqueous ammonia into the central covered containment sump.  Each storage tank will have an unloading station consisting of an ammonia fill line, where aqueous ammonia is fed from the delivery truck to the tank, and a vapor return line where vapor pressure between the tank and the truck is equalized.  \n\n\n\nThe aqueous ammonia will travel through 3/4 inch stainless steel piping from the storage tanks to the SCR injection grid.  The piping between the tanks and each SCR will be contained in one of two covered trenches, one for Unit 6 and 7 and a separate trench for Unit 8, all located under the road and parking areas to protect the piping from vehicular traffic.  The primary piping will be contained within PVC piping for all stretches that are not within the storage facility or one of the trenches under the road as per the request of the Contra Costa County Fire Protection District.  Thus, secondary containment will be provided for all sections of pipe.\n\n\n\nThe aqueous ammonia delivery and injection facilities for each SCR will include aqueous ammonia feed pumps, ammonia vaporization equipment, and ammonia injection grid.

The spray droplets are then mixed with a hot air diluent stream in the vaporizer to evaporate the ammonia.  The vaporizer produces a uniform distribution of gaseous ammonia in the diluent stream.  The diluent stream is then transported to the injection grid.  \n\n\n\nThe injection grid is located upstream of the SCR reactor.  This allows more thorough mixing of the ammonia-laden diluent stream with the turbulent flue gas from the Units.  Although the oxidation-reduction reaction is initiated by the injection of ammonia at the injection grid, all of the reaction is completed in the SCR reactor by passing the mixture over a catalyst composed primarily of titanium and vanadium oxides.  The treated flue gas, containing a small amount of residual NOX and excess ammonia, is discharged out of the stack.\n\n\n\nThe SCR process is controlled with feed-forward and feedback control loops.  An upstream NOX analyzer will measure the NOX concentration at the SCR reactor inlet.  A downstream analyzer will measure the total NOx concentration downstream of the SCR reactor outlet.  The ammonia demand signal, which regulates the rate at which aqueous ammonia is pumped to the vaporizer, is determined from both NOx analyzers.\n\n\n\nThe aqueous ammonia solution proposed for the SCR systems at CCPP will be 29.4 percent ammonia by weight, with the balance of the weight being water.  Aqueous ammonia is a corrosive material although the degree of danger associated with the substance is considered to be minor.  Ammonia is not a known carcinogen, but it poses acute and chronic non-carcinogenic health hazards to the respiratory system and chronic non-carcinogenic health hazards as skin irritations or other effects.  Acute health hazards are those that occur from short exposures to airborne ammonia vapor, whereas chronic health effects are those that occur as a result of long-term exposures.\n\n\n\nTho"

      "SummaryText": "ugh there is some insoluble ammonia present in the ammonia solution, the solution has a very low vapor pressure compared to anhydrous ammonia, a more hazardous compound also used for SCR.  The ammonia present will not readily vaporize if the solution is released to the atmosphere.  If the ammonia evaporates from the solution, the ammonia vapor is irritating at levels above a few parts per million volume (ppmv) and acutely toxic in high concentrations.  A one-hour average ammonia vapor concentration above 200 ppmv could cause respiratory irritation to exposed individuals.  According to the National Research Council, exposure at the 75 ppmv STPEL level \"should not result in serious effects, but would result in strong odor, lacrimation, and irritation of the upper respiratory tract (nose and throat), but no incapacitation or prevention of self-rescue.\"  \n\n\n\nAmmonia vapor is flammable in air at concentrations of 16 percent to 25 percent, but requires a very high temperature source for ignition.  Ammonia concentrations directly above an aqueous ammonia spill never approach these concentrations; therefore aqueous ammonia has no explosive flammability potential.\n\n\n\n1.4 WORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\nMirant performed an offsite consequence analysis to examine the significance of an accidental release of aqueous ammonia (see Section 2).  The hypothetical worst-case release scenario examined the effects of releasing an entire 20,000 gallon storage tank.  Due to the designed passive mitigation systems, any spill of aqueous ammonia will drain rapidly into a covered sump through drains in the contained storage and unloading areas, leaving only the drain hole areas exposed to the atmosphere where vaporization of ammonia can occur.  The US EPA approved air quality dispersion model SCREEN3 was used to predict the spread of aqueous ammonia for the worst-case release scenario.

The nearest potential public receptor to the aqueous ammonia storage facility is at least 600 feet away within the PG&E switchyard south of the ammonia storage equipment, and beyond the distance of the toxic endpoint. \n\n\n\nSince CCPP has not had a release of a regulated substance in the past five years and there are no public receptors within the distance to the toxic endpoint (528 feet) from the ammonia storage facility, CCPP qualifies for a Program 1 RMP under both the CalARP and federal regulations.\n\n\n\n1.5 ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nSafety was the foremost consideration when designing the aqueous ammonia unloading and storage facility.  The location of the ammonia facility was selected to be in a low occupancy area of the plant at a maximum distance from the property fence line, to reduce potential offsite impacts from a spill.\n\n\n\nThe aqueous ammonia storage tanks will be enclosed within a walled containment basin that will slope to a centrally located, covered sump beneath the tanks that will run the length of the containment area.  There will also be a walled containment pad under the tanker truck unloading facility that will drain rapidly into the covered sump under the tanks.\n\n\n\nMany accident prevention safeguards will be implemented within the aqueous ammonia storage area.  For example in the event of a power outage, standby power needed for all required electrical systems, such as monitors and alarms, will be provided by the Uninteruptable Power Supply system.  Also hot work permits will be required for specific activities that present the potential for fire, and personnel involved in such operations will receive appropriate training.  \n\n\n\nOther safety features of the aqueous ammonia storage and unloading facility include:\n\n    - Ammonia area monitoring system with audible and visible alarms,\n\n    - Eyewash"

Alarms are designed to annunciate in the control room, with local audible alarms for ammonia releases at the facilities.\n\n\n\nTo minimize impacts from accidental releases, workers will be trained in the safe handling of hazardous materials, use of response equipment, procedures for mitigation of a release, and coordination with local emergency response organizations.  To avoid or minimize impacts from the accidental releases of hazardous materials, nonhazardous or less hazardous materials will be used, where possible, and engineering controls will be implemented.  For example, aqueous ammonia was selected for the SCR system over anhydrous ammonia, because it is less hazardous.\n\n\n\n1.6 FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nLarge quantities of aqueous ammonia have not been present at CCPP in the past.
