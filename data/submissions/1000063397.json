The control of accidents has been and will continue to be a basic responsibility of all personnel in the company.\r\n\r\nTo accomplish Glazier Foods of Houston Tx's goal in controlling accidental losses, the facility has established a comprehensive Safety Program that not only includes government mandated safety programs, but also includes safety programs and activities that have been identified industry wide for the prevention of accidents. The objectives of Glazier Foods of Houston Texas's Safety Program are to achieve maximum productivity, efficiency and safety performance.\r\n\r\nOne of the activities associated with Glazier Foods of Houston Texas's Safety Program is the development and implementation of accidental release prevention and emergency response program. These programs are designed to comply with OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals, Title 29 Code of Federal Regulations 1910.119) and the EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP) Regulation (Risk Management Programs for Accidental Release Prevention, Title 40 Code of Federal Regulations Part 68). Glazier Foods Inc of Houston Tx's Safety Manager is responsible for the management of the accidental release prevention and emergency response programs.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the accidental release prevention and emergency response program is to prevent the release of ammonia and to minimize the consequences of ammonia releases. The accidental release prevention and emergency response program is also established for the prevention and response to fires, explosions, terrorist acts, and other types of incidents that may result in catastrophic accidents.

First Alternate Release Scenario\r\nThe release of 1220 pounds per minute of anhydrous ammonia over a 10 minute period due to a puncture of a 1/2-inch {hi-pressure} schedule 80 pipe feeding an evaporator valve station on the roof with pumped liquid. This scenario could occur during a maintenance procedure or unsecured equipment striking this line. The modeled OCA (Off-site Consequece Analysis) for this scenario has a radius of less than 0.2 miles. The population impacted by this scenario is employees at the facility.\r\n\r\nThe alternate release scenarios are unlikely for the following reasons:\r\n-Glazier Foods of Houston Tx has policies to enforce only that competent personnel work on the system and has the power to remove any offending employee and/or contractor from the companies payroll and or contracts.\r\n-The system was designed using standard using standard practices and is maintained by rigid company standards.\r\n-The maintenance program includes a mechanical integrity audit system.\r\n-The maintenance program includes a shift monitoring procedure of the refrigeration system by fully trained personnel.\r\n-Low level controls, sensors for ammonia monitoring, and maintaining a safe ammonia liquid supply to the vessels acts as active mitigation before the release poses a threat to offsite receptors.\r\n-The piping is routed to avoid impact from traffic sources. A majority of the pipes are located on the roof.\r\n-Forklift operators have been trained and certified by the company, and trained in the locations and operations of the ammonia refrigeration evaporators that are located within their working areas.\r\n-Industry standards were followed for the manufacturing of the ammonia vessels, and the vessels were supplied by a reputable company meeting the guidelines spelled out in the Company's Process Safety Management's Contractors requirements as well as requirements for chemical suppliers.\r\n-The facility requires that all PSM elements as well as company maintenance pol"

Stationary Sources and Regulated Substances Handled\r\nThe facility operates a [NAICS#424420 (Packaged Frozen Food Merchant)] freezer warehouse at 11303 Antoine Houston, Tx 77066. An ammonia refrigeration system is in operation to maintain the storage and holding temperatures for frozen food products.\r\n\r\nThe facility operates an (compound) ammonia refrigeration system, which provides cooling throughout the facility.  Glazier Foods of Houston Texas's inventory in the refrigeration system is 14,000 pounds. Due to the volume of ammonia and with the remote possibility of a release of ammonia from the refrigeration system, which could pose a risk to offsite public receptors and have offsite impacts, our refrigeration system is subject to the Program Level 3 requirements of EPA's RMP.\r\n\r\nC. Summary of Worst-case and Alternative Release Scenarios\r\n1. Worst-Case\r\nThe worst-case release scenario at that facility involves the release of  12,200 pounds of ammonia over a 10-minute period due to over-filling high pressure receiver during a pump-down. The maximum level of vessel HPR  is limited to 50% of the vessel. \r\n\r\nThe worst-case scenario is unlikely for the following reasoons:\r\n-Industry standards and quality controls were followed in the design and construction of the equipment in the ammonia refrigeration system.\r\n-Ammonia is not corrosive in this process.\r\n-Pressure safety relief valves limit the operating pressures in this receiver.\r\n-The facility utilizes a preventive maintenance program to maintain the on-going integrity of the vessel.\r\n-The facility has a training program that insures only qualified personnel operate the system.\r\n-The facility requires that all PSM elements as well as company maintenance policies to be followed.\r\n-The facility has coordinated its emergency response system with the local fire department.\r\n\r\n2.

Employee Participation:\r\nThis program ensures that the employees are involved in establishing and implementing the prevention program. Employees are also invloved when a process hazard analysis is conducted. The program also ensures that the employees have complete access to the program on company property. Regularly scheduled meetings are held to discuss any concerns.\r\n2. Process Safety Information:\r\nWritten information has been collected which enables the employees or members of the general public to identify and understand the potential hazards in the refrigeration system. This written information includes the MSDS program as well as a description of the design of the refrigeration system. The written information also includes the MSDS on the ammonia in the refrigeration, standards, guidelines, and basic information about the chemistry of the refrigeration system, and the thermodynamic properties of the refrigeration system.\r\n3. Process Hazards Analysis:\r\nA formal analysis using the What-If/Checklist Technique was conducted prior to the start-up of the system to identify potential hazards.
