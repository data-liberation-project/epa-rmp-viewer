Our commitment is supported by the resources invested in accident prevention, personnel training and the consideration of safety issues in the design, construction, operation, and maintenance of our facilities. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to provide a safe operation and prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, trained compressor station personnel will respond to control and contain the release. All pressures and flows at this facility are monitored 24 hrs. /day at our Integrated Operations Control site located in Liberal, KS.\r\n\r\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\r\n\r\nMerit Energy Company owns and operates the Hugoton Station Natural Gas Compressor facility located in half mile east of Hugoton on Highway 51. The Hugoton Station Natural Gas Compressor facility is regulated by the OSHA Process Safety Management program because of the total quantity of a highly hazardous substance (natural gas) which exceeds the 10,000 pound threshold, it is a manned facility and is in close proximity of a population center as specified by the Standard Code of Federal Regulation, Title 29, Part 1910.119. The facility is also subject to the EPA RMP Standard.\r\n\r\nThe operation of the Hugoton Station Natural Gas Compressor facility is to take natural gas from field compression in the surrounding fields and remove liquids present in the gas stream. Natural gas is then compressed and discharged into sales pipelines leaving the facility. Hugoton Station Natural Gas Compressor facility currently processes approximately 47 MMCF of natural gas daily.\r\n\r\nNGL liquids are transported to the Hugoton facility by truck and unloaded into product storage tank MBJ-1017.  The NGL product is pumped through a condensate stabilizer process creating a low vapor pres"

The remaining NGL product from the stabilizer is routed to product storage tank MBJ-1019 and also removed from site via truck.\r\n\r\nHistory and Ownership\r\n\r\nThis Hugoton Station Natural Gas Compressor facility was built and put into service in 1945 by Panhandle Eastern Pipeline Company. Since then, the facility has periodically had engines and other equipment put into service as operations required with the last engine installed in 1973. Anadarko Petroleum Corporation purchased the facility in March of 1996, and Merit Energy Company purchased the property in 2016.\r\n\r\nOffsite Consequence Analysis Results\r\n\r\nThis narrative section has been deleted as directed by regulation; however, there are public receptors within the predicted worst case 1 psi over-pressure radius as calculated using the EPA RMP Comp: Analysis program, making this a Program Level 3 facility. As a Program Level 3 facility, the secondary calculation for a more likely release was determined using a failed load hose during loading operations from the storage tanks on site. The release was calculated to be a 5 minute flow from a 4\" load hose before the system could be shut in and isolated - resulting in a 0.08 mile ROE.\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\r\n\r\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the plant. The processes at the plant are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) Risk Management Program (RMP) and Occupational Safety, and Health Administration's (OSHA's) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard.

This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment. This information in combination with written procedures and trained personnel provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHAs)\r\n\r\nMerit Energy Company has a comprehensive program to ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled. The station and its components are systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards. Merit Energy Company uses the What If/Checklist or HAZOPS methods of performing process hazard analyses (PHAs) to evaluate the hazards associated with the process. These PHAs are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures. The team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary. If necessary, the PHA team findings are forwarded to local and corporate management for resolution. Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk taking assigned by the PHA team.

These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating. The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained at the office onsite.\r\nOperating Procedures\r\n\r\nThe Hugoton Station Natural Gas Compressor facility maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as startup, normal operations, emergency shutdown and normal shutdown. These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators. These procedures are periodically reviewed to ensure they are current and accurate. The procedures are also kept current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.\r\n\r\nTraining\r\n\r\nTo complement the written process operating procedures, Hugoton Station Natural Gas Compressor facility has a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process. New employees receive basic training if they are not already familiar with such operations. After successfully completing training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process specific duties and tasks. After operators demonstrate the knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently. In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level. This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years.
