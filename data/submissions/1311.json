The Alternate Release  involves over filling this could travel .10. The figures expressed are estimates.\n4.Accidental Release Prevention Program:\nThe Coop recognize all safety procedures required by State and Federal Regulations. The Coop also complies with recommendations from Farmland's AG-21 policies and general industry standards. the most common accidental release would be the over filling of nurse trailers. An example would be if the trailer would be filled to 85-90% on a cool morning, as the air temperature rises, the product expands and cause the pressure relief valve to let product escape. Our policy is not to fill above 86%.\n5.Five Year Accidient History:\nThe Coop has not had a major accidient release within the past five years.\n6.Emergency Response Program:\nThe Coop has an Emergency Response Plan, Emergency Action Plan, and Employee Safety Committee.
