As it is the facilityA?s policy to comply with all applicable governmental regulations, the cold storage facility was designed and constructed in 1997 to the applicable Uniform Building Code/Uniform Mechanical Code.  Personnel at Merced Avenue Partners facility monitor the daily operation of the refrigeration system.  All operations, service, maintenance, and repairs to the ammonia refrigeration system are contracted to a qualified licensed refrigeration contractor specializing in ammonia refrigeration.  Utilizing an experienced qualified contractor to perform routine operations, service, maintenance, and repairs ensures that the equipment is in excellent operating condition. \n\nWhile it is Merced Avenue Partners facilityA?s objective to be a responsible citizen of the community in all of its business activities, the limited staff at the cold storage facility precludes emergency response operations.  As such, an emergency action plan has been prepared for the facility and a chain of command to respond to emergencies has been established.\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances \n\nMerced Avenue Partners owns and operates a cold storage facility located at 31912 Merced Avenue.  Shafter is the closest city to the facility.  The rural plant was constructed in 1997 utilizing all new equipment at the time of construction.  \n\nAnhydrous ammonia is used as the refrigerant that provides cooling for the facility.  The refrigeration system consists of a suction accumulator with a liquid transfer system, three compressors, an evaporative condenser, a high pressure receiver, and several flooded evaporators.  \n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nAs part of the implementation of the RMP Program, key Pr"

The Program includes the following chemical-specific prevention steps:\n\n- Written process safety information, including information pertaining to the hazards of ammonia, the technology of the process, and the equipment in the process has been compiled.\n\n- Process Hazard Analyses (PHA) have been completed and will be updated and revalidated at least every five years.\n\n- Written operating procedures will be reviewed at least annually.\n\n- Safe work practices, such as lockout/tagout, confined space entry, opening process equipment or piping, and control over entrance into the facility are implemented as needed.\n\n- If employees are involved in operating the ammonia system, they will receive initial training and refresher training at least every three years.\n\n- Written Mechanical Integrity procedures have been established and implemented.\n\n- A Management of Change (MOC) program has been developed and implemented to address all proposed changes to the ammonia system.\n\n- Pre-startup Safety Reviews will be performed when a modification is made to the ammonia system that is significant enough to require a change in the process safety information.\n\n- Compliance Audits will be conducted at least every three years to evaluate compliance with the RMP regulations.\n\n- Incident investigation procedures have been established.\n\n- A written plan of action regarding the implementation of Employee Participation has been developed and implemented.\n\n- Hot Work Permits will be issued for all hot work operations conducted on or near the ammonia system, as needed.\n\n- A Contractor Safety Policy has been developed and implemented.\n\nTo ensure that the general accidental release prevention program and the chemical-specific prevention steps are implemented, the facility has assigned overall responsibility for the RMP elements to the Cold S"

The Cold Storage Manager has the overall responsibility for the development, implementation, and integration of the RMP elements.\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nThe Merced Avenue Partners facility has not had any accidental releases from the ammonia-based refrigeration system that have resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage in the last five years.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nThe facility has established an emergency action plan and a chain of command to respond to emergencies and to notify emergency responders when there is a need for a response.  However, an emergency response program does not need to be developed for the facility since the facility employees will not respond to accidental releases of ammonia, the facility is included in the community emergency response plan, and appropriate mechanisms are in place to notify emergency responders. \n\nPlanned Changes To Improve Safety\n\nThe facility relies on the expertise of qualified ammonia refrigeration contractors to regularly evaluate the need for any changes to the refrigeration equipment and to improve safety.  In addition, the Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) study revalidation has been conducted to examine mitigation measures to improve safety at the facility.  Planned changes to improve safety are listed as recommendations in the March 2010 PHA Report. Any outstanding recommendations will be addressed by September 2010.\n"
