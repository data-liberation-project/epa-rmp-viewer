It is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws.  If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to notify the Gooding County Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency.\n\n   This facility is a processing plant.  We manufacture cheese and whey products.  We use Anhydrous Ammonia for our mechanical refrigeration system.  The system consists of a receiver tank, 4 compressors, 2 chillers, 3 vessels, 4 condensors, 21 evaporative coils, 2 pumps and associated piping, valves, and other miscellaneous equipment.\n\n   Our worse case senario is a loss of receiver tank contents of 8,267 lbs when filled, resulting in a liquid spill and vaporization.  The resulting distance to the endpoint extends offsite, and one public receptor is within the distance to the endpoint.  Our alternative senario is a 275-550 lb loss over a 10 minute period through a piping leak.  The resulting distance to the endpoint extends offsite, and one public receptor is within the distance to the endpoint.\n\n   We, at this facility, believe that we comply with EPA's Accident Prevention Rule and all applicable state and local codes and regulations.  The Ammonia Refrigeration System is designed and installed in accordance with  the Uniform Mechanical Code, Uniform Building Code, National Electrical Code, and all federal, state and local law.  It is operated and maintained in accordance with iiar Guidlines, and the ASHRAE standard.\n\n   We have never had an accident involving anhydrous ammonia that caused deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or shelterings in place.\n\n   In the event of an emergency involving our refrigeration system, it is our policy to notify Gooding Rural Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency.  We have discussed this with the Fire Chief, Mr. Pat Bishop.  We have also met wi"
