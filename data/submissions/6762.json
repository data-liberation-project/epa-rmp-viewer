In the event that an accidental release should occur, we are prepared to\nwork with our Local Fire Company, Emergency Response Personnel, and other\nappropriate authorities deemed applicable depending on the specific incident, to\nbest mitigate any release and to minimize the impact of the release to people and\nthe environment.\n\nFACILITY INFORMATION:\nThe primary activity of our company is NAICS code 49313 \"establishments\nprimarily engaged in farm product warehousing and storage facilities\"  that includes \nthe receiving, storage, and reloading of Anhydrous Ammonia for delivery to farmers\nin our area.  This product is subject to the EPA Risk Management Program and is\nthe subject of this plan.  Only the facility used for this product will be included in\nthis report.\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application to\nfarm fields during the early spring and late fall months.  During the balance of the\nyear, inventories will be storage only, with little if any product transfer taking\nplace.  The maximum quantity stored has been listed earlier in the RMP and will\nnot be disclosed in this summary.  The maximum quantity handled at a given time\nwould be the unloading of a semi-trailer vehicle.\n\nThe facility is operated on an as needed basis with staff present only during the\nreceiving and reloading of product for delivery.  Total annual hours for these needs\nto not meet the 2,080 hour requirement to qualify as a full time employee on site,\ntherefore item number 1.11 is Zero.  Our facility has adequate lighting, and is\ninspected at various times day or night during use, and throughout the off season\nwhen not in use.\n\nWORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO:\nThe worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of our\nlargest Anhydrous Ammonia tank, re"

      "SummaryText": "leased as a gas over 10 minutes.  The\nmaximum quantity released has been identified earlier in this program and would\neffect some residential population.  \n\nALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO:\nAs we have not had an actual release of Anhydrous Ammonia during the last\n5-years at the site, we believe the most likely release would be caused by a break\nin a transfer hose.  Transfer hoses are protected by manual and self closing excess\nflow valves so our alternative release scenario is based on the loss of contents from\nthe largest hose used (off loading transportation equipment).  The distance to the\nendpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 0.06 miles (528 feet) based on EPAs\nRMP Comp guidance program.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PROGRAM:\nFor Anhydrous Ammonia, our accidental release program is based on guidelines\nfound in the American National Standards Institute, Inc. (ANSI) standard K-61.1\nSafety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\"; and\nthe U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) standard 29CFR\n1910.111 Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia.  Additionally, we\nconduct annual employee training on the safe handling, transportation and\ndistribution of Anhydrous Ammonia, and have installed safety equipment including,\nbut not limited to: Excess flow valves, Emergency shut-off valves, and Lock outs to\nprevent tampering when the site is unattended.  Finally, we maintain routine\ncontact with our local fire department and emergency response personnel; and\nhave provided and/or participated in safety training exercises on Anhydrous\nAmmonia.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\nWe have not had a release of Anhydrous Ammonia within the past five years that\nhas caused any death, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor to\nour knowledge have resulted in offside deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in\nplace, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM:\nThis facility is included in the written Commu"
