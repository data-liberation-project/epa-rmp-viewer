A primary aspect of this commitment is the Keynes Bros., Inc. system to help ensure the safe operation of the Flour Chlorination Process. This commitment is also demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention in the operation and maintenance of  processes, as well as in the  extensive training of operating personnel. \n\nIn the event of an accidental release, Keynes Bros., Inc. has procedures which are designed to control and contain the release in a manner which will be safe for employees and will help prevent injury to the public and the environment. Keynes Bros., Inc. emergency response personnel receives thorough training in handling accidental releases. An emergency response coordinator has been assigned to oversee any response activities and to coordinate response efforts with local emergency agencies.\n\nIn order to effectively implement these policies, Keynes Bros., Inc. established a management system headed by William W. Keynes, Jr. to ensure the proper implementation and effectiveness of the Risk Management Program (RMP).\n\n2.0     REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nKeynes Bros., Inc., located in Logan, Ohio, is primarily involved in Flour Milling. Keynes Bros., Inc. utilizes Chlorine which is a regulated substance in sufficient quantities to be covered by the RMP rule. The following is a table which lists the Keynes Bros., Inc. RMP covered processes and the associated Regulated Substances with maximum quantities:\n\n     Process Description       Program Level        Regulated Substance        Proces"

Chlorine was evaluated for a possible worst-case scenario and four(4) alternate scenarios. The alternate release scenarios represent a more realistic potential for occurrence. By identifying these potential releases, Keynes Bros., Inc. has prepared an extensive program to prevent such an occurrence. This program is discussed in detail in the \"Prevention Program\" section of this plan.\n\nThe primary objective of performing the offsite consequences analysis is to determine the distance at which certain effects might occur to the public and/or the environment because of an accidental release. This point is called the endpoint distance. At distances less than the endpoint distance, the effects would be greater; \n\n\n4.0     ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM - PROGRAM 3\n\nThe Keynes Bros., Inc. Program 3 Prevention Program, applies to the Chlorine System..  The program consists of the following twelve elements:\n\n     4.1   Process Safety Information\n\n             Keynes Bros., Inc. maintains a variety of technical documents that help ensure the safe operation of our processes.  These documents address:\n\n          physical properties of hazardous substances handled \n          chemical properties and associated hazards of those substances\n          operating parameters and limitation of the process equipment \n          design basis and configuration of the equipment \n          specific chemical inventories\n\n           Keynes Bros., Inc. ensures that the process safety information is available to all Keynes Bros., Inc. employees, the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC), and the local fire department.

Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\n           To perform the PHAs, Keynes Bros., Inc. primarily uses the Process Safety Management Hazard Evaluation Checklist.  The PHAs are conducted using a team of individuals with experience in engineering and process operation and a leader with experience in process hazard analysis techniques. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and/or mitigation measures, when appropriate.  The team then prepares a written report describing the results of the analysis, including a list of recommendations ranked according to relative risk ratings assigned by the team.  Responsibility to resolve the recommendations is assigned to William W. Keynes, Jr., Executive Officer, and is tracked through completion.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\n           To help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, Keynes Bros., Inc. periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every five (5) years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer in operation.  The results and findings of these updates are documented and retained.  The team findings are forwarded to William W. Keynes, Jr., Executive Officer,  for consideration and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\n\n     4.3   Operating Procedure"
