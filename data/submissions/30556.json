      "SummaryText": "ding community.  The facility\u00bfs ARP program combines and satisfies both the requirements RMP and PSM.\n\nThe ARP program ensures that the processes are designed, installed, maintained, modified and operated in a safe manner.  Participation by the facility\u00bfs employees is a key ingredient in the development, implementation and maintenance of each of the ARP program\u00bfs elements.  The program elements include policies and procedures regarding employee participation, process safety information, process hazard analysis, operating procedures, training employees on procedures, contractors\u00bf safety, pre-startup review, mechanical integrity, permitting for hot work, management of process changes, emergency planning and response, compliance audits and offsite consequence analysis.\n\nTrained employees perform routine monitoring and maintenance of the systems to ensure that system deviations are quickly addressed.  All employees and contractors that work on or around the covered process are trained in the hazards of the processes.  Contractors are pre-approved by the safety department to ensure safe work standards are followed at any work site within the facility.\n\nThe facility has installed safety devices to reduce the risk of an accidental release of the regulated substance and to minimize the impact should an accidental release occur.   One of the safety devices is an automated control system that can automatically shutdown the system in the event of a system deviation that may result in a release.  Another safety feature of the facility\u00bfs process is an ammonia leak detection system with sensors installed throughout key areas of the facility to provide early warning of a release.  The detection system is connected to a control system, which sounds an alarm to notify employees.  The facility has also installed a public address and alarm system to notify employees of a plant evacuation in the event it is required.\n\nEmergency Response Policies and Procedures:\n\nThe facility has implem"

      "SummaryText": "FNG Lake Wales:\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances:\n\nCitrus World, Inc. d.b.a. Florida\u00bfs Natural Growers is a citrus juice processing and packaging facility (NAICS Code 311411) using one regulated substance, anhydrous ammonia (CAS Number 7664-41-7).  The ammonia is used as the refrigerant in the facility\u00bfs refrigeration process.  The refrigeration process is an integral part of processing, storing and preserving the facility\u00bfs juice products. \n\nFresh citrus fruit arrives at the facility via trucks from local citrus growers during the normal citrus harvesting season.  Juice is extracted from the fruit and held in chilled storage for processing and packaging.  The juice is then processed and packaged into finished product and stored in chilled warehouses to await shipment to customers.\n\nThe facility\u00bfs refrigeration process is divided into three separate systems.  The largest of the three systems (Process 1) provides refrigeration for the processing and packing functions at the facility.  This system has a maximum intended inventory of the regulated substance above the threshold quantity.  The second and third systems provide refrigeration for the facility\u00bfs chilled warehouse space.  The second system\u00bfs (Process 2) maximum intended inventory is also above the threshold quantity, however the third system\u00bfs inventory is below the threshold quantity.  All three systems are operated and maintained to the same level of safety and in compliance with Environmental Protection Agency\u00bfs Risk Management Program (RMP) and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration\u00bfs Process Safety Management (PSM) program.\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Policies and Procedures:\n\nThe facility has proactive safety programs, including an extensive Accidental Release Prevention (ARP) program.  The facility works diligently to provide a safe working environment for its employees and to prevent any accidental release of the regulated substance that may impact the facility or its surroun"

      "SummaryText": "ented an Emergency Response Plan in compliance with 29 CFR 1910.38 and disseminated to facility personnel.  The facility is included in the community emergency response plan.  The facility\u00bfs emergency response plan consists of employee notification (alarm) and evacuation, followed by notification of the appropriate local and national emergency agencies.  A facility evacuation plan has been developed, disseminated to facility employees and included in the Emergency Response Plan documentation.\nThe facility has established an Emergency Response Team (ERT) to assist refrigeration personnel in containing an accidental release of ammonia.  ERT members and refrigeration personnel receive hazardous material training to the technician level in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.120(q)(iii) and key management personnel receive hazardous material training to the incident commander level in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.120 (q)(v).  \n\nFive-Year Accident History:\n\nThe facility has had two accidental releases that resulted in on-site injuries in the past five years.  The facility has not had an accidental release that resulted in deaths, significant property damage or any off-site injuries, property damage, environmental damage, evacuations or sheltering in place.\n\nIn the first accident, August 26, 1999 at 4:00 P.M., a contractor was evacuating the ammonia from process vessel inside one of the facility\u00bfs processing buildings and some of the vapor was released near the employee.  The amount released was less than one pound and the duration was less than one minute.  The release was the result of human error and administrative controls have been put into place to prevent a recurrence.\n \nThe second accident occurred at 10:00 P.M. on June 28, 2000.  An employee was working on one end of a piece of processing equipment when an ammonia vapor release developed on the opposite end on the unit.  The employee went to the end where the release had occurred to perform additional duties and inhaled s"

      "SummaryText": "ome ammonia vapor.  The duration of the release is unknown but the quantity released was less than a five pounds.  The initiating event for the release is unknown, however it is felt to have been from a bushing or a packing nut on a valve.\n\nPlanned Process Safety Improvements:\n\nThe facility is continuously refining its safety and ARP programs.  The facility routinely holds process safety management meetings to discuss results of mechanical integrity inspections, incident investigations and management of changes.  \nFuture plans at the facility to improve process safety include installation of additional ammonia detection systems in the processing and warehousing areas of the facility.  Other plans include streamlining systems and removing excess piping and equipment to reduce the maximum intended inventory of the regulated substance."
