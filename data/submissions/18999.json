The owners, management and employees of Farm Service Center Company are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the T-Reactor Contractor, local fire department and other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to persons and the environment.\n\n2 - Farm Service Center Co. is a small independent retail/wholesale facility for plant food and crop protection chemicals. Crop nutrients in a clean, easily absorbable form are mixed, sold and delivered; crop protection products in sealed containers are sold and distributed to the farm. There are no regulated flammable chemicals in reportable quantities on site.\n\nTwice a year our facility has need for a liquid fertilizer (10-34-00) containing Anhydrous Ammonia. The manufacturing process is done on site by a professional contractor. The Anhydrous Ammonia is brought in by train; one or two tank cars, each holding approximately 79 ton will be parked on a railroad siding next to the plant where the Anhydrous Ammonia is transferred by hose to the T-Reactor and mixed into a liquid fertilizer.\n\nDue to the fact that the anhydrous ammonia is on site no more than twice a year and on average less than 30 days total per year, we are using the option of predictive filing.\n\n3 - The worst-case release and alternative release scenario:\n\na. The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of the tank car over a 10 minute period. The distance to the endpoint would be 5 miles.\n\nb. The alternative release scenario would be from a break in a transfer hose. The distance to the endpoint would be 0.3 miles.\n\nc. Our facility provides water to the T-Reactor Contractor to be used as a spray to control any escaping ammonia. Active and passive mitigation measures are contained in the T-Reactor Contractors procedure.\n\n4 -"

      "SummaryText": " Accidental Release Prevention Program. This facility has implemented the provisions of OSHA Standard 29 CFR1910.1200, Hazard Communication. The contractor complies with OSHA Standard 29 CFR 1910.110, Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals; Explosives and Blasting Agents. We provide the T-Reactor Contractor with water and an area that is free of outside traffic and unauthorized personnel, thus reducing the risk for an accident. While the T-Reactor Contractor is on site our employees comply with the Contractor's Program.\n\n5 - Five-year Accident History. There have been no reportable accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the last five years.\n\n6 - Emergency Response Program. The \"Emergency Action Plan\" of Farm Service Center Company describes procedures to minimize hazards to human health and to the environment from fires, explosions, sudden and non-sudden releases of chemicals,: spilled chemicals, tornadoes, bomb threats or other accidents occurring on the premises. Copies of the well organized easy to use color coded \"plan\" have been distributed to the LEPC (Local Emergency Planning Committee), Fire Department and two strategic locations at the facility. Our employees are aware of the provisions of the emergency action plan and each one's role in carrying out the plan. An ongoing safety training and accident prevention program is our first line of defense.\n\n7 - Planned Changes to Improve Safety. Safety improvements are an ongoing process at this facility. Periodic evaluations are performed to access the maintenance and safe conditions of our equipment. There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations at this time.\n\n     8 - For further information contact:    Cyd M.
