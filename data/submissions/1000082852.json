As such, EnLink has chosen to include natural gas condensate in the RMP-regulated inventory at the Facility.  \r\n\r\nThe substances stored at the Eunice Facility were also evaluated for toxic characteristics; it was determined that there are no RMP-regulated toxic substances handled at the Facility in quantities that exceed RMP threshold quantities.\r\n\r\nGENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\n\r\nBecause the Eunice Facility is regulated under RMP Program Level 1, it is not subject to the RMP Prevention Program required under 40 CFR 68.  However, the Facility is subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) program. The Eunice Facility's PSM Plan is kept on-site as a separate document. \r\n\r\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nThe Eunice Facility has had no accidental releases of flammable materials regulated under the RMP program that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on-site, or off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or any environmental impact for the period of five (5) years prior to September 2014.\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\r\n\r\nBecause the Eunice Facility is regulated under RMP Program Level 1, it is not subject to the RMP Emergency Response Program required under 40 CFR 68.  However, the Facility does keep a written Emergency Response Plan and coordinates response efforts with the Evangeline Parish LEPC. \r\n\r\nSAFETY IMPROVEMENTS\r\n\r\nEnLink has a continued commitment to update equipment and improve safety pertaining to the covered process when necessary.  The most recent Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) for the Facility was completed on February 8, 2013, at which time several safety improvements were recommended including: validation of the annual maintenance program; a review of relief devices and block valves; and a review that all equipment, in"

      "SummaryText": "Y RESPONSE POLICIES\r\n\r\nThe Eunice Facility maintains a policy of safe flammable material handling operations, reducing to the greatest extent possible hazards associated with material transfer and storage activities, and reducing subsequent risk to the surrounding community, employees, and the environment.   \r\n\r\nThe Eunice Facility has procedures in place, including both on-site activities and coordination with off-site responders that are to be followed in the event of a flammable material release.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\r\n\r\nThe Eunice Facility transfers and stores NGL in various temporary and three permanent aboveground vessels and associated piping and valves.  NGL is a regulated flammable mixture that is an aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbon mixture.  The regulated flammable chemicals contained in the NGL mixture above one percent include methane, ethane, propane, isobutane, N-butane, isopentane, and pentane.  \r\n\r\nThe Facility also has one 39,816 gallon tank in the same process that is used to store natural gasoline.  Natural gasoline is a flammable mixture containing isopentane and pentane.  \r\n\r\nThe following provides the maximum storage capacity and largest vessel capacity for all of the RMP-regulated flammables stored at the Eunice Facility.\r\n\r\nRMP STORAGE INVENTORY\r\n\r\nSubstance:\r\nNatural Gas Liquids: Maximum Inventory 144,354 gallons/668,596 pounds; Largest Vessel 84,462 gallons/391,198 pounds\r\nNatural Gasoline: Maximum Inventory 39,816 gallons/215,980 pounds; Largest Vessel 39,816 gallons/215,980 pounds\r\n\r\nThe Eunice Facility stores natural gasoline, which under certain circumstances, is not classified as an RMP-regulated flammable mixture.  Although the current Facility Material Safety Data Sheet for natural gasoline lists it as a National Fire Protection Agency (NFPA) Class 3 flammable, subsequent testing completed by EnLink demonstrates that the mixture would, at times, be considered an NFPA Class 4 flammable base"

      "SummaryText": "The Eunice Loading Facility (Eunice Facility or Facility) utilizes more than the threshold quantity of a regulated flammable substance (10,000 pounds) in the loading and storage of natural gas liquids (NGL) that include methane, ethane, propane, isobutane, N-butane, isopentane and pentane.  The Eunice Facility loads/unloads pressurized trucks and rail cars of raw feed (NGL).  The Facility is capable of storing natural gasoline and raw feed in four pressurized tanks located on-site.  The Facility does not store any toxic substances above threshold quantities.  This Facility is subject to the Risk Management Plan (RMP) requirements codified in Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations Part 68 (40 CFR 68) administered by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).\r\n\r\nNo public receptors are located within the worst-case release scenario for the Facility; the Facility has not had an accidental release of a regulated substance where exposure to the substance, its reaction products, overpressure generated by an explosion involving the substance, or radiant heat generated by a fire involving the substance led to any off-site death, injury, or response or restoration activities for an exposure of an environmental receptor; and the Facility coordinates emergency response procedures with the Evangeline Parish Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  Therefore, the Eunice Facility is subject to Program 1 requirements as stated in 40 CFR 68.10. \r\n\r\nThe Eunice Facility employs eight (8) full-time employees on-site who will ensure the proper operation and maintenance of the facility. \r\n\r\nThe Eunice Facility was previously operated by Crosstex Processing Services, LLC and is currently operated by EnLink Processing Services, LLC (EnLink).  The Eunice Facility last submitted an RMP amendment to the EPA in September 2010 for the Eunice Facility.  The following information serves as the 5-year RMP update for the Eunice Facility.\r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENC"
