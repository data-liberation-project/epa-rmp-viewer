By virtue of the flammable effects associated with butane, it is necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling butane to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to employee health, and to minimize the threat and impact to nearby members of the community. Motiva Enterprises LLC - Doraville Terminal is strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety and health. Safety at the Facility depends upon the manner in which butane is handled as well as the various safety devices incorporated into the design of the process. Furthermore, comprehensive training is provided to employees and contractors/visitors which reinforces the safety policies and procedures of the Doraville Terminal.\r\n\r\nThe facility has fixed inventories of butane. Butane is received by truck (transports) and stored in one (1) storage vessel. Specifically, liquefied butane is off-loaded by truck for storage under pressure (pressure reliefs set at 250 psi on the storage vessel). The butane is pumped to injection skids for direct injection into regular and premium unleaded gasoline lines feeding the site gasoline truck loading racks. Injection quantities are controlled via the blending/injection skid and autoanalyzer. Process safety controls include excess flow valves, low-melting point (<250F) feeds to pneumatic valves (fail safe), 85% fill shutoff on the vessel, emergency shut-off devices on the system and HMI, line thermal (pressure) reliefs, and grounding/interlock devices. Access to the Doraville Terminal is restricted to authorized employees, management personnel and authorized contractors/visitors.\r\n\r\nB.
