The company's management maintains an active role in ensuring that environmental compliance takes place through an active review of its safety and environmental plans. A pro-active approach has been adopted through establishing a preventive approach to chemical safety. The preventive program addresses employee participation and training, process hazard analysis, mechanical integrity reviews, compliance audits, and change management. \n\n\n\nThe facility, which utilizes 118,000 square feet, is located on highway 61 South in Vicksburg, Mississippi. The company employs 100 people and operates year-round. The primary products consist of polystyrene egg cartons, food and serving trays. Polystyrene crystals are extruded to make rolls of polystyrene, which is subsequently formed using various molds and dies in thermoforming machines. Pentane, an EPA regulated substance, is used to expand the polystyrene crystals. The maximum amount stored at the facility is 34,000 lbs. \n\n\n\nThe operation at Foam Packaging complies with OSHA-PSM rule. In keeping with that rule, the company employs a preventive maintenance program to address hazards within the company's operation. For example, the processes operating procedures have been defined and documented for startup, emergency shutdown, and normal shutdowns. Employee training is an on-going process to ensure that those individuals who are a part of the covered process understand the hazards and appropriate responses.\n\n\n\nIn 2013 the company upgraded the pentane delivery system to include a concrete berm around the pumps for spill containment, additional pentane sensors to detect pentane fumes at the tank and external pumping systems. And, control circuitry to disengage pentane flow and delivery into the building when fumes are detected.\n\n\n\nThe company's risk mitigation and controls consist of:\n\n\n\n?    Pentane monitor"

Daily visual inspections of pentane delivery system.\n\n?    Positive air flow and ventilation systems;\n\n?    Static eliminators employed in hazardous areas where material is created.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe company has developed an emergency response system in conjunction with the Vicksburg Emergency Management Center and the City Fire Department. The emergency response plan has a system of internal and external notification should a release occur. Listed in the response plan are the appropriate contacts depending on the severity of the release. The system also provides a procedure for employee evacuation. Periodic dills are conducted to test the evacuation system. \n\n\n\nIn order to prevent accidental release of pentane, the company has incorporated locking shutoff valves for tank filling and fuel return lines. Specific unloading procedures have been prepared for pentane delivery. There have been no reportable accidents during the past five years.\n\n"
