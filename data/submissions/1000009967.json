It processes 44 million gallons of sewage daily from the sewer systems in the Spokane area.  It can also process an additional 77 million gallons of stormwater per day.  The plant is managed as a public utility called the City of Spokane Wastewater Management Department.\n\nThe Plant is commited to safe operation as described in the Mission Statement of the City of Spokane Risk Management and Safety Manual:\n \"To protect the City from loss by:\n+ minimizing financial risk\n+ promoting physical well being of employees and citizens who come in contact with City operations, and\n+ preventing the disruption of services.\"\n\nThe overall plant operation begins at the headworks building, where a mechanical bar screen separates large solids and an aerated grit chamber allows inorganic solids to settle.  The sewage is then transferred to primary treatment, where solids settle from the liquid waste in four primary clarifiers.  The liquid is transferred to the aeration basins, where dissolved solids are processed by an activated sludge.  The contents of the aeration basins are transferred to the secondary clarifiers, where the sludge is separated from the water. The water is disinfected with sodium hypochlorite and discharged to the Spokane River.  Solids from the primary and secondary clarifiers are sent to the gravity belt thickeners and then to the anerobic digesters.  Methane gas is produced in the digesters.  The methane is burned in a waste gas boiler to produce steam, which is used to heat the digesters and buildings.  Excess digester gas is burned in a flare.\n\nThis Risk Management Plan covers processing of digester gas, which contains methane.\n\nThe facility has a Safety Manual that describes procedures for assuring that the digester gas operations are run in compliance with both the EPA Risk Management Plan Rule and the Washington State DOSH standard for"

These procedures include:\n+  Involving employees in process hazard analyses, writing procedures, and reviewing safety performance\n+  Documentation of process safety information\n+  Conducting process hazard analyses\n+  Developing standard operating procedures\n+  Training operators and mechanics to perform those procedures\n+  Performing inspections and tests to maintain the mechanical integrity of equipment and instrumentation\n+  Reviewing changes to the processes to review safety impacts\n+  Conducting pre-start-up safety reviews to confirm that changes were made as intended\n+  Investigating incidents that did or could have caused a release or fire\n+  Assuring that safety performance is considered when hiring contractors\n+  Using a hot work permit system to prevent fires\n+  Auditing process safety management activites at least every three years to assure their effectiveness\n\nThe plant has developed an emergency action plan.  Employees are trained to respond to releases immediately as long as it is within the limits of their training and capabilities of their equipment.  The City of Spokane Fire Department is available to respond to a release that exceeds the capabilities of plant employees.\n\nA planned change for improving process safety is to take the older digesters out of service, inspect them, and make any structural repairs needed.  This work will begin once the two new egg-shaped digesters are fully operational."
