A safety inspection is performed before product is moved from the storage tank to nurse tanks. By doing a short walk around inspection of the facility a person is able to detect any problems before they arise. If any part of the system showed signs of stress, or if odors were present, corrective measures would be taken to repair the system before the facility became a problem. Employees are trained and schooled so they are aware of the hazards of handling and transferring anhydrous ammonia. The safety plan also includes a safety drill, wherein employees are exposed to the safe procedures of handling and transferring anhydrous ammonia. All employees handling anhydrous ammonia are required to comply with all safety measures and rules set forth by the Farmers Cooperative Elevator Company.",

A written plan is necessary to keep track of all emergency procedures and provisions. It is also easier to ensure training is completed and is consistent for all employees when an Emergency Action Plan is in writing. An Emergency Action Plan must contain emergency escape procedures and emergency escape route assignments; procedures to be followed by employees who remain to operate critical plant operations before they evacuate; procedures to account for all employees after emergency evacuation has been completed; description of rescue and medical duties for those employees who are to perform them; the preferred means of reporting fires and other emergencies; names or regular job titles of persons or departments who can be contacted for furtherinformation or explanation of duties under the plan. The written plan also includes all the MSDS sheets for the products that we carry. The purpose of this business is to buy and sell grain, and to retail other farm related supplies and services including bulk fuels and anhydrous ammonia. Our facility has coordinated with local emergency responders and we do not plan to have our employees  respond to any significant emergency release.

In the event of an emergency, when calling emergency personnel it is necessary to give the facility name; give the facility location; give your name; explain the type of emergency; are there any explosions or is the emergency out of control; are there people hurt or injured or is there trapped personnel; also convey any known special needs like equipment, respirators, oxygen, and life support systems.\n\nA sign-in log is located in the main office and all visitors must sign in the log book. This would include contractors, grain inspectors, state inspectors and others doing work at the facility. The visitors log would help the EC in locating these personnel in the event of an emergency. In the event of an emergency the EC would be able to assemble his employees to the rendezvous point which is north  of the scale, and between the office and the feedmill. At this time the head count would be taken; this would help the EC in locating personnel still missing and also locating personnel signed in the log book if any. At this time the EC would be able to secure the area and assign duties, making sure curious onlookers, the press, and unauthorized employees do not enter the dangerous area. The EC would coordinate outside response assembling the appropriate personnel to take care of the situation. Once the situation is under control it is imperative that the same accident does not happen again. Steps must be taken to correct the problem. Any emergency equipment used, should be replaced, or cleaned and repaired and returned to its proper position.

Gloves and goggles must be worn when handling anhydrous ammonia. Never wear contact lenses when working with anhydrous ammonia.\n     C.

Handle valves by the BODY, NOT by the valve HANDLES. Tighten all fittings by hand and close bleeder valves.\n4. Open valves on the nurse tank and then open valves on the riser. Open valves slowly.\n5. Start the pump to fill the tank.\n6. Once the liquid BEGINS coming through the 85% FIXED liquid level gauge, the tank is at its maximum RECOMMENDED filling level. Shut pump off. Close loquid and vapor valves starting at the riser first, and the hose ends, and finally the tank itself.

Exposure to high gas concentrations may lead to temporary blindness and severe tissue damage. Contact with the liquid can produce severe frostbite or freezing, chemical burns and blindness. Exposure to ammonia may exacerbate symptoms in persons with eye disease.\nSKIN: Liquid solutions and high concentrations of gaseous ammonia can cause blistering or first- and second- degree burns. Rapid evaporation of the liquid and chemical reaction with the skin's moisture will cause freezing of the tissue followed by caustic burn. Severe injuries can be fatal.\nINHALATION: The odor of ammonia, which can be detected at 1-50 ppm, serves as an excellent warning. Accidental exposure to high concentrations (i.e., 400 ppm and above) can cause severe irritation of the respiratory system such as coughing, difficulty in breathing, chest pain, bronchopneumonia and pulmonary edema. Breathing concentrations of 5,000 ppm has been reported to cause lung inflammation and death by asphyxiation. Continued exposure to lower concentrations of the gas cause irritation to mucous membranes and upper respiratory tract and possible damage to the lungs. Exposure to ammonia may exacerbate symptoms in persons with impaired kidney, liver, or pulmonary function.\nINGESTION: Can produce corrosion and inflammation of the sophagus, gastritis, abdominal spasms, nausea,, faintness, and bluish skin. Other possible effects are esopheal ulcers that can result in strictures and in gastric duaodenal and stenosis.\nTOXICITY VALUES:  LCLO: 5,000 ppm for humans exposed for 5 minutes by inhalation\n                                 LC50: 2,000 ppm for rats exposed for 4-hours by inhalation\n                                 LD50: 350 mg/kg for rats"
