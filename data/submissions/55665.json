This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training and consideration of safety in the design, operation, and maintenance of the Aqueous Ammonia Storage System. Facility\u00bfs policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substance.\n2.\tSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage, and sale of fertilizers, in addition to, the sale of pre-packaged agricultural chemicals to farmers.\nAqua ammonia (20% of ammonia by weight) is stored in two 10,000 gallon above ground tanks at the site. The maximum quantity of aqua ammonia handled is 132,000 pounds. The total quantity of ammonia present in the aqua ammonia, based on 20% active ingredient by weight, is 26,000 pounds. \n3.\tHAZARD ASSESSMENT SUMMARY/OFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\nWorst-Case Release Scenario Results Summary\nScenario Description: Per the CalARP Regulations, one worst-case release scenario has been defined for the Aqueous Ammonia Storage.  The results can be found in the Hazard Assessment documentation.  \n \nAlternative Release Scenario Results Summary\nScenario Description: Per the CalARP Regulations, one alternative-case release scenario has been defined for the Aqueous Ammonia Storage.  The results can be found in the Hazard Assessment documentation  \nRisk Considerations\nAlthough the storage and use of aqueous ammonia has inherent potential risks and the release scenarios can potentially reach sensitive populations within the community, the facility has recognized these potential risks and structured its safety programs to make the worst case type of event non-credible.  In addition to the safety practices of the facility and plant personnel to make the worst-case event non-credible, it should also be recognized that there are inherent anal"

The facility utilizes  manual shutoffs, and emergency shutdown systems.\n \n4.\tACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\nAs part of the implementation of CalARP Program 2, key Prevention Program elements were documented and implemented by the facility to manage process safety issues associated with the use of aqueous ammonia.
