OSHA, EPA, DOT and the Kansas Department of Agriculture regularly inspect our facilities. These inspections along with the safety culture and training our employees have been through have helped us achieve an outstanding safety record.  Our employees receive semi-annual on the job training and must be able to demonstrate safe operating procedures before being allowed to handle anhydrous ammonia.  Our employees also receieve certified training from the Kansas Fertilizer and Chemical Association.\n\nTherehave been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years in excess of the reportable quantity as established by the above listed agencies.\n\nW/G Fertilizer - Chanute has a written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA and the EPA and we report our regulated materials to the Community Right to Know program, the responding Fire Department and the LEPC.
