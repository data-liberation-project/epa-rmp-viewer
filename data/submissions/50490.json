We have undertaken this process to deal with the risks involved with the storage, handling, and use of Anhydrous Ammonia in our facility.\n\nThis RMP re-submittal is being completed due to a .Management of Change Process Hazard Analysis 2007 and a reportable release of anhydrous ammonia. A Process Hazard Analysis study was conducted for the processing system on April 2005 and a PHA Addendum for a Management of Change in December 2007. A Process Hazard Analysis was conducted for the warehouse system on April of 2004. Mechanical Integrity Inspections are done yearly on both systems. See executive summary for more details.\n\nOur goal is to promote overall worker, public, and plant safety.\n\nEdy's Grand Ice Cream is located at 3426 Wells Street, Fort Wayne, Indiana.  We manufacture some of the finest ice cream in the world.  The facility includes processing tanks, piping, packaging equipment, raw materials warehousing, finished goods refrigerated storage, an Ammonia refrigeration engine room, boilers, and miscellaneous utilities.  Also located at the facility is raw milk processing equipment, shipping and receiving docks, and a waste water treatment equalization system.  The facility produces and ships approximately 60 million gallons of finished product each year.\n\nThe refrigeration system required for our production process necessitates the submission of this Risk Management Plan.  The refrigeration system contains in excess of 73,600 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.  This surpasses the threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds outlined in Process Safety Management and Risk Management Program regulations.\n\nEdy's Grand Ice Cream has implemented numero"

These rules are detailed and improved as necessary.  They are also communicated to and accepted by all employees at our facility.\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN\n\nIn the event that an ammonia leak is detected employees are to notify the onsite Hazmat Responder and ERC Coordinator.  The Hazmat Responder takes an ammonia level reading using a detection device.  If the Hazmat Responder determines that the ammonia level is above 35 ppm an evacuation of the exposure area is ordered.\n\nThe Hazmat Responder determines if the leak is serious enough that outside assistance is needed.  If outside assistance is needed the local HAZMAT organization is contacted.  Also Edy's Grand Ice Cream Emergency Response Team is contacted.  The Hazmat Responder then take appropriate procedures, such as Emergency Shutdown Standard Operating Procedures, to control the leak with personal protective devices in place.\n\nOnce the Incident Commander arrives on scene, a report is given and the Incident Commander takes control of the situation.\n\nEdy's Grand Ice Cream is committed to continuous improvement of our policies, procedures, and facility. It is the intention of Edy's Grand Ice Cream to remain an industry leader. New technology, training techniques, and equipment are continuously being added to our system. As part of ongoing on site training Edys trains with the local HAZMAT responders. \n\nEdy's Grand Ice Cream has organized the information and polices pertaining to the process into a complete library consisting of nine numbered volumes, some volume numbers are assigned to sets of reference manuals"

Items of a low priority (Process improvements) were budgeted for completion in a timely manner.\n\nEdy's Grand Ice Cream ammonia refrigeration system also incorporates additional safety items such as tagging of all valves and components, and a PC / PLC based control system with a graphical operator interface that controls mitigating devices such as emergency exhaust fans, emergency shutdown systems and alarms.\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE PRODUCTION AREA REFRIGERATION SYSTEM\n\nThe Edy's Grand Ice Cream production system operates separately from the warehouse system described below.  The production facility incorporates a standard evaporation and Compression Style Ammonia Refrigeration system.  Ammonia vapor from the Intercoolers is routed to the suction inlet of the High Stage Compressors.  \n\nAt the High Stage Compressors, ammonia vapor is compressed to a super heated vapor.  The super heated vapor is fed to the Evaporative Condensers.  At the Condensers the super heated vapor rejects heat and converts to high pressure Condensed Liquid Drain.  The condenser accomplishes this by using a combination of air and water flow across ammonia coils.  The condensers are equipped with Hydrostatic Relief valves that relieve around the isolation valves.  Airflow is supplied to the con"
