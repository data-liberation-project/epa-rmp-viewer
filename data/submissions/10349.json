      "SummaryText": "The BOC Gases Galesburg facility, owned and operated by The BOC Group, Incorporated is located at West Sixth & West St., Galesburg, IL. 61401 The management and employees of the Galesburg facility are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of  MAPP (Methylacetylene-Propadiene/Propylene/Propane Mixture).  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to the community and the environment.\n\nThe Galesburg operation is a MAPP (Methylacetylene-Propadiene/Propylene/Propane Mixture) storage and distribution facility which is generally unmanned. When manned, the facilities primary operation is the distribution ,unloading of  MAPP (Methylacetylene-Propadiene / Propylene/Propane Mixture)  from  railcars (35,000 gal/144,700 lb.) into two 18,000 gal (73,400 lb ) high pressure ASME storage tanks. The site also contains a 15,000 gal (51,500 lb) high pressure ASME storage tank of Propylene. The MAPP and Propylene is then transfilled into DOT approved road tankers and distributed to customers.\n\nThe worst-case scenario, based on the EPA's definition for a flammable gas release, would be the rupture of the 35,000 gallon MAPP Rail Car Tank. The results would be a maximum release of 145,000 lbs of MAPP over a 10 minute period.\n\nThe endpoint of 1 psi overpressurization was determined to be 0.42 miles using the RMP*Comp. (1.06) software. The weather conditions used were a wind speed of 1.5 meters/sec., Stability Class F, an air temperature of 77 degrees F and urban topographical terrain.\n\nThe impacted area would affect 312 residents and no special receptor based on the 1990 US Census data obtained from \"Land View III\".  Several business / industries are also within the endpoint which are; Themro Gas, Brodie Meats, Opta Foods and United Packers with a combine total of approximate 50 people.

The maximum flow was determined to be 2,160 lb/min for 60 minutes. The distance to a Vapor Cloud Fire endpoint is <0.1 miles.\n\nThe release endpoint of 34mg/L  was determined to be <0.10 miles using the RMP*Comp. (1.06) software. The Weather conditions used were a wind speed of 3.0 meters/sec., Stability Class D, and air temperature of 77 degrees F and urban topographical terrain.\n\nThe affected area would affect no (0) residents and one business/industry (Themro Gas)  based on Land View III and actual observations. No special population or environmental receptors are affected by this scenario.\n\nPassive and Active Mitigation systems in place that would reduce the likelihood of a release or the release itself. These include check valves in the fill lines, Excess Flow Valves,  a preventive maintenance schedule for the system, safeties and testing of the tanks.\n\nThe facility has developed a comprehensive prevention program designed to prevent accidental releases of MAPP in accordance with EPAs Risk Management Part 68, Program Level #2.  The program utilizes state-of-the-art technology, sound engineering practices, administrative controls and active employee participation.\n\n Written process safety information was developed for the MAPP system to enable managers, supervisors, and employees to identify and understand the process hazards.  This information was utilized to develop a  Hazard Review Checklist (HR) which assists management and employees in making decisions for improving safety and reducing the consequences of releases of MAPP. The HR focuses attention on equipment, instrumentation, utilities, human actions, (routine and nonroutine), and external factors that might impact the process by identifying potential failure points or failure modes in the process. The HR was review and updated "

The procedures were reviewed/approved to ensure they are technically accurate by employees, managers and personnel with the technical expertise/knowledge of the process.  The operating procedures were review on November 15, 1998 and are annually reviewed/revised as necessary to reflect current operations.\n\nEmployees are thoroughly trained, including maintenance and contractor employees.  The training meets and exceeds the requirements as outlined in OSHAs hazard communication standard 29 CFR 1910.1200.  Training includes operating procedures, safe work practices, emergency procedures (including alarms), special assignments, evacuation and emergency response; safety rules and procedures; routine and nonroutine work authorization; and other pertinent process safety information.  Each employee trained has a defined and documented program based on their job duties.  The training goals and objectives have been established and written in clear and measurable terms.

In addition, employees receive traditional classroom instruction including lectures, videos, programmed and on-the-job instruction.  Employees are encouraged to actively participate.
