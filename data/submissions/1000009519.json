Facility Policy.\n\n    The owners, management and employees of  Manson Ag Services, Inc. are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, Calhoun County LEPC, and/or other authorities, to mitigate and minimize the impacts of the release to the people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information.\n \n    The primary activity at the facility is the storage of fertilizers for sale to farmers. Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application as a nutrient for crop production. The maximum quantity stored would be 131,325 pounds in a storage tank.\n\n3. Worst-Case Scenario and Alternate Release Scenario\n\n    An analysis of the potential off-site consequences of hypthetical worst-case and alternative-case accidental releases have been addressed in our Hazard Assessment and Information is in our Risk Management Program.\n\n4. Accidental Relase Prevention Program\n\n    The facility is in compliance with the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc. (ANSI), and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\". The OSHA standard is referenced in the RMP Registration Form, see Section 8.3 (b).\n\n5. Five-Year Accident History\n    \n    There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that have caused any deaths, injuries or significant property damage at the facility: no to our knowledge, has THERE BEEN ANY ACCIDENTAL RELEASES resulting in off site deaths, injuries, evacuations, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n6. Emergency Action Plan.\n\n    The facility has:\n\n    a. A written action plan, in accorda"
