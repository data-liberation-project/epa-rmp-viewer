ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nAs an INV Nylon Chemicals Americas Victoria Site facility, this site operates under INV Nylon Chemicals Americas Victoria Site EHS Policy and Management Systems are used to assess compliance on a regular basis.  These INV Nylon Chemicals Americas Victoria Site documents are available via the corporate and site intranet.  The EHS procedures are available to employees through the plantwide intranet.  The 800 series of procedures in particular deal with Process Safety and Risk Management requirements.  In addition, the INV Nylon Chemicals Americas Victoria Site Emergency Manual lays out the complete Emergency Response program for the site.\n\nB.  SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nThe INV Nylon Chemicals Americas Victoria Site of 4500 acres, located approximately 9 miles south of the city of Victoria, Texas, in a rural setting south of SH 185.  About 1000 acres of the property are used for manufacturing areas, 100 acres for bio-treatment and wetlands, and the remainder is set aside for wildlife habitat and future manufacturing needs.\n\nThe site consists of manufacturing processes to produce Nylon Intermediates (hexamethylenediamine and adipic acid).  In the production of these products, the following regulated substances are used or produced as intermediates:\n- Anhydrous Ammonia\n- Aqueous Ammonia\n- Hydrocyanic Acid (HCN)\n- 1,3 Butadiene\n- Chlorine\n- Hydrogen\n- Natural Gas (Methane)\n\nC.
