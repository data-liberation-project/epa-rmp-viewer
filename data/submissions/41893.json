The Emergency Response Plan (Plan) is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of this PSM/RMP document.  This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n1.) To save lives.\n2.) To minimize and avoid injuries.\n3.) To protect the environment.\n4.) To minimize property damage.\n\nSOCWA maintains a safety committee whose members are the designated emergency coordinators for the facility.  The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, chlorine health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year.  This Plan was reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM, RMP, and CalARP regulations, and to ensure that the plan is kept current.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nThe Joint Regional Plant of the South Orange County Wastewater Authority (SOCWA)  is located at 29201 La Paz Road in Laguna Niguel.  The facility is situated west of the La Paz Road near Kings Road and approximately 2.75 kilometers (1.71miles) west of Interstate 5.  The immediate area is primarily residential areas.\n\nThe chlorine system at the Joint Regional Plant is used for the treatment of wastewater.  The Joint Regional Plant uses chlorine for odor control, filamentous control, or disinfection at different processes in the wastewater treatment:  1) influent, 2) return activated sludge (RAS), 3) plant process water, and 4) recycled water.  Chlorine is stored at the Joint Regional Plant as a liquid form of liquefied compressed gas in one ton containers.  Liquid chlorine is transferred from the one ton containers to evaporators.  The evaporators heat the liquid chlorine to produce chlorine vapor.  The chlorinators then contr"

The injectors combine chlorine and water to produce chlorine solution providing an effective treatment.\n\nA maximum of 19 one ton chlorine containers (38,000 lbs) is maintained in the chlorine room of the chlorine building.  This building is located on the north side of the property.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe chlorine system at the Joint Regional Plant has many safety features.  Much of the safety of the system is inherent in the policies and procedures that govern the operation of the system.  For example, the SOCWA treatment processes operate in accordance with OSHA's Process Safety Management regulation and the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program.\n\nIn the event that the primary engineering or administration controls at the J. B. Latham Regional Plant fail and cause a release of chlorine, there are several mechanisms in the plant to minimize the impact:  1) chlorine sensors / detectors, 2) alarms, and 3) emergency vapor scrubber system.  The chlorine sensors that trigger audible and visual alarms are located in the chlorinator room and the chlorine storage room.  Once a chlorine leak of 0.2 ppm is detected by the sensors, the ventilation system that continuously circulates the air in the chlorine building will be shut off by the emergency vapor scrubber system.  The chlorine scrubber system then will absorb and will eliminate chlorine.  \n\nThe emergency chlorine scrubber system at the J. B. Latham Regional Plant is also designed and built by RJ Environmental Incorporated.  The scrubber system consists three stage chemical absorption system:  one horizontal crossflow spray scrubber followed by two horizontal crossflow packed bed sections.  The released chlorine gas is absorbed and reacted with caustic solution. The system is designed with the ventilation rate of 3000 acfm and t"

The scrubber has the capability of neutralizing 2,000 pounds of chlorine with a 99%+ rate of effectiveness.\n\nIn addition, common industry standards, policies, and procedures are utilized to ensure safe practices are being performed.  This includes common practices recommended by the Chlorine Institute.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe accident history researched back five years to June 1994 shows that the SOCWA's facility has not had an accidental release or \"near miss\" of chlorine.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nSOCWA has an emergency response plan in effect at the facility.  The Emergency Response Plan (Plan) is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of the PSM/RMP document.  This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives: \n\n1.) To save lives.\n2.) To minimize and avoid injuries.\n3.) To protect the environment.\n4.) To minimize property damage.\n\nSOCWA maintains a safety committee whose members include the emergency coordinators for the facility.  The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility. \n\nThe Plan also includes the Emergency training for all SOCWA employees. The SOCWA performs periodic emergency evacuation drills every 90 days to enhance the emergency response skills of its personnel.\n\nThe Emergency Response Plan is reviewed and updated by SOCWA Joint Regional Plant responsible person, Mr. Michael Wilson at least once a year.  This Plan will be review and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM, RMP, and CalARP regulations, and to ensure that the plan is kept current.\n\nSOCWA has coordinated emergency response efforts withe the local fire department,  Orange County Fire Department.  In the case of a chlorine-related emergency, its is the policy of SOCWA to evacuate the employees and to allow the fire departme"

In addition, a Revalidation of the initial Process Hazard Analysis Study was performed in August 2003.  The 2003 PHA Revalidation consisted of:\n\n? a detailed review of the HAZOP log tables from the previous study;\n? a series of safety checklists (including external events);\n? a hazard and operability study; and\n? a facility inspection.\n\nThe mitigation measures include the addition of ammonia sensors, exhaust fans, and enhanced operating procedures.  All recommendations resulting from the revalidation study are complete.\n\nIn addition, a Seismic Assessment was performed in June 1999 and a revalidation was added in May 2004.  The Seismic Assessment Revalidation concluded that the Chlorine Process at the Joint Regional Plant meet the structural requirements of the CalARP regulation."
