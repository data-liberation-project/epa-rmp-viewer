The accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at the stationary source.\nCameron Meadows is a natural gas processing plant.  We handle natural gas and natural gas liquids (which contain methane ethane, propane and other like materials).  The EPA considers these materials hazardous (flammable). Because they are flammable it necessary to handle them with certain safety precautions.  These Safety precautions include safety systems such as alarms, shutdowns, overpressure relief valves, good and accepted engineering practices, proper construction guidelines and training of our personnel.  These safety precautions provide protection for our employees' health and welfare and provides safeguards for the public and environment. It is our policy to comply with all applicable local, state and federal laws and regulations.\n\nIn addition to implementing EPA's Risk Management Program to protect the public and the environment, the Cameron Meadows Plant has implemented OSHA's Process Safety Management program to protect  the employees.\n\nCameron Meadows' Emergency Response Plan includes procedures for notification of Local, State and Federal agencies, as well as adjacent business. Local officials including our LEPC have reviewed (and had input on) the Response plan. The Cameron Meadows employees receive training over these procedures and also conduct Mock Emergency Drills. \n\n2. The stationary source and regulated substances handled.\nThe primary function of the Cameron Meadows facility is the recovery of natural gas liquids from natural gas.  The natural gas is delivered to the Cameron Meadows Plant via pipeline.  Liquids are extracted from the gas by the use of a cryogenic process.  The processed gas is shipped via pipeline to end-users.  The recovered liquids are sent via pipeline to a fractionation facility were the individual components of the mixture are separated and sold to various users.\n\nThe regulated substances at the Came"

Cameron Meadows Operating Procedures allows the level of the Product Surge Tank to be maintained at 40 to 60%. Using the EPA's method of calculating worst case release where the entire contents are released as vapor over a ten minute span and release finds a ignition source the end-point of 1 pound overpressure using the TNT Equivalency Method with 10% conversion is a distance of .3917 miles or 2,068 feet.     \n \n            Alternate Release:\n    A failure of the tandem seals on the Cameron Processing Train's Demethanizer Reflux pump as used for alternate release scenario.  The duration of 20 minutes reflects the approximate time needed for the operator to detect and stop the leak. The pump is a Bigham centrifugal pump that operates at a range of 600-800 GPM.  Normal suction and discharge pressures are in the 425# to 435# range.  Suction temperature is between -70 to -80:f.\n\n    The maximum hazard zone width for this scenario is 642 feet and goes off the plant site to the south and extends into a normally unmanned separation facility.\n\n3. 4.    The general accident prevention program.\nThe Williams Field Services' Cameron Meadows Gas Processing Plant, a division of Williams Energy Services, has developed and implemented this Risk Management program to identify, understand, control and prevent or minimize the consequences of unwanted releases of high hazardous chemicals (regulated substances).

The local Fire Department and Ambulance Services have both been on site to review our program and facilities.

We conduct evacuation drills and tabletop drills. We review the plan with the LEPC annually.\n    \n7.    Planned changes in improving safety.\nThis facility will be conducting volume testing on our firewater pumps.  The piping system to the suction of the firewater pumps is being studied.  We will be installing smoke dictation in our purchase power building.  We plan on installing new heat detectors in our GE turbine building.  Will this increase the ability to pump fire-suppression water? Will it increase the speed with which fires can be detected?"
