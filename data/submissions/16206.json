If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to initiate our emergency response procedure and to notify the Tolleson Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency. Emergency evacualtion in the community would be coordinated through the Tolleson Fire Department.\n\nA DESCRIPTION OF THE FACILITY AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED. \n\nThis facility is a slaughterhouse and meat packing plant using ammonia as a refrigerant for many of the packing areas.\n\nTHE WORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\nOur worst-case scenario is failure of the 5000 gallon (28,500 pound) ammonia receiver resulting in the release of all the contents over ten-minute period. According to EPA's RMPComp model, the distance to the endpoint is 3.1 miles. The community of Tolleson and some outliying areas of Phoenix are within the distance to the endpoint. Several schools and recreation areas are also within the endpoint distance.\n\nTHE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThis facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule, OSHA's PSM rules, and all applicable state and local codes and regulations. \n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nWe have never had an accident involving ammonia that caused deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or shelterings in place.\n\nTHE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving our refrigeration system, it is our policy to initiate the plant emergency response procedure, including notification of the Tolleson Fire Department to request that they respond to the emergency. We have discussed this policy with the fire department; members of the fire department have inspected our system.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY. \n\nNone"
