This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\nTHE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\nOur facility's primary activities encompass the manufacture of sweeteners and corn syrups utilizing the corn wet milling process. We have one regulated substance at our facility. This substance is Sulfur Dioxide (anhydrous). Sulfur Dioxide (anhydrous) is used to control microbial growth during the corn steeping process and also weakens the starch-gluten bonds so the separation process following steeping is more efficient.\n\nThe maximum inventory of Sulfur Dioxide at our facility is 89,000 lb. \n\nIn October 2009, we removed Chlorine from our facility.\n\nTHE WORST CASE SCENARIO AND THE ALTERNATE RELEASE SCENARIOS\nTo evaluate the worst case scenario and the alternate release scenarios we have used EPA's RMP*Comp program. \n\n\nTHE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND THE CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA. This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-30 Standard, 1957 edition. Non-combustible chemical storage systems were designed and are maintained in conformance with applicable ASME standards, ANSI standards and chemical supplier recommendations. The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nPROCESS SAFETY INFORMATION- Tate & Lyle, Lafayette South mai"
