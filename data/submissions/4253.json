Emergency Response Program\n\nThis facility has developed a written emergency contingency plan (Integrated Contingency Plan). The plan addresses the regulations concerning emergency plans as mandated under: OSHA 29 CFR - 1910.38, 1910.119, and 1910.120, EPA 40 CFR - part 264 subpart D, part 265 subpart D, part 68 and 279.52, DOT/RSPA-FRP - 49 CFR part 194. Elements within this plan include employee training, SARA Title III reporting requirements and community right to know, pre-emergency planning, and emergency response planning.\n\n7.  Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nSafety and Environmental programs are very dynamic, since this is an ongoing process, changes toward improvement are evaluated and implemented periodically. The need for improvement is identified by facility employee inputs, inspections and audits which are performed regularly at this facility."

Box 190   Main Street\nHoople,  ND     58243-0190\n\nPhone: 701) 894-6119\n\n1.  Policies and Guidelines\n\nIt is the policy of the J.R. Simplot Company (Policy Statement EN 01.1) to manufacture, handle, store and dispose of all substances safely and in compliance with the requirements of federal, state and local environmental laws while reducing the risks to human health, safety and the environment. Each manager is expected to responsibly implement this policy, and each employee is expected to comply fully with the spirit, as well as the letter of this policy. The Company will assure that the environmental, health and safety laws, regulations, and standards applicable to its products and operations are known and obeyed by employees.\n\nIt is the policy of the Minerals and Chemicals Group of the J.R. Simplot Company (Policy Statement M & C #3) that the processing, manufacturing, storage, shipping, or disposal of products and materials shall be carried out in a manner consistent with the protection of public safety and the environment, and in full conformity with the requirements of the law.\n\nThe J.R. Simplot Company Guideline (Guideline Statement SA 01.2) states that the Company is committed to reducing incidents or occurrences in the workplace that result in human injury, illness, or death, and/or destruction or loss to the corporation's assets and to be in compliance with all laws and regulations governing workplace safety. It is, therefore, our intent to provide a safe work environment and to protect the corporation's assets. This guideline applies to all groups and separate operating entities of the J.R.

Each group shall develop and implement appropriate programs for initial and ongoing safety and loss prevention training of employees.\n\n\n2.  Regulated Substance(s)\n\nThe substance(s) that are routinely stored at this facility would be Anhydrous Ammonia at or above the threshold level for the RMP. \n\nAnhydrous Ammonia is received, stored and distributed to area farms as a source of land applied Nitrogen fertilizer.\n\nMaximum Quantity Stored in the largest stationary source at this site is 79,000 pounds of Anhydrous Ammonia in one  18,000 gallon storage tank. The maximum quantity handled would be 79,000 pounds of Anhydrous Ammonia.  \n\n3.  Worst-Case and Alternative Release Scenario\n\nThe worst-case release scenario for Anhydrous Ammonia would be the release of the total contents of the storage tank released as a gas over a 10 minute period. The maximum quantity released would be 79,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest stationary storage tank at the facility at 85 percent capacity, as limited by design standards. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 5.10 miles. \n\nThe alternative release scenario based on the five year accident history (or the most likely potential incident) is a release from a break in a transfer hose, which is estimated to release 500 pounds. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 0.30 miles.  \n\n4.  Accidental Release Program\n         \nThis Anhydrous ammonia facility implemented the provisions of the State of North Dakota Anhydous Ammonia Regulation and the Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia as published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc. (ANSI K61.1), and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia.  \n\n5.
