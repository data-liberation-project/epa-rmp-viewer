The latitude and longitude of the high pressure receiver is 40.664183, -95.869314. The facility is located approximately 0.7 miles north of interstate 75 in a rural area surrounded primarily by housing.\n\nAccording to FEMA Flood Map Service, the facility is located adjacent to \u201ca special flood hazard area\u201d. \n\nA review of United States Geological Survey (USGS) fault maps revealed that there are no faults in close proximity to the site. The USGS 2018 One-Year Model revealed that Wayfare Foods had a <1% chance of experiencing \u201cpotentially minor-damage\u201d due to ground shaking in 2018.\nDescription of Covered Process\n\nThe make up air units are each supplied from an integral surge drum while other air-cooling evaporators and heat exchangers are supplied by the recirculator. As such, the system is configured for both flooded and pumped overfeed operation.\n\nProcess Classification\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system at Wayfare Foods consists of vessels, equipment, and valves which are interconnected by piping. As such, the refrigeration system at Wayfare Foods is treated as a single process.\n\n1.3 General Accident Release & Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\n1.3.1 General \n\nWe inform our employees engaged in process operations of the dangers of an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia in annual safety meetings.
