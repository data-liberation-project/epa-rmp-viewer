The facility also has storage of fertilizers for sale to the farmers in the area. Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application as a nutrient for crop production.\n\n\n\nThe plan is to minimize those hazards to human health and to the environment that are associated with accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  Employees, working at the bulk storage plant, make routine observations and inspections prior to and during transfer operations of anhydrous ammonia from the storage vessel(s) into nurse tanks.  In so doing, they are able to detect problems before they arise. Repairs can be made before they become problematic.  Employees are annually trained to recognize the hazards associated with storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia.  In addition to annual training several employees who have been on the job for a number of years. This training includes classroom instruction, oral testing, on-site training at the plant, and follow-up observation to determine their individual comprehension and understanding of working with anhydrous ammonia.  \n\n\n\nThe company routinely invites local fire department personnel to visit the site.",

Cogdill\n\nPhone:   712-674-3344\n\n\n\n1.    Facility Policy.\n\n\n\n        The owners, management and employees of Cogdill Farm Supply, Inc. are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, Crawford Emergency Management/County LEPC, and/or other authorities, to mitigate and minimize the impacts of the release to the people and the environment.\n\n\n\n2.    Facility Information.\n\n\n\n        The primary activity at the facility is the distribution of products to area farmers.  The fertilizer product, anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application as a nutrient for crop production.  At times, Anhydrous ammonia is also stored on site in nurse tanks designed for this purpose.  The facility is manned year round during normal business hours.\n\n\n\n3.    The Worst-Case Release Scenario and the Alternate Release Scenario \n\n\n\n         An analysis of the potential off-site consequences of hypothetical worst-case and alternative-case accidental releases have been addressed in our Hazard Assessment and information is in our Risk Management Program.\n\n\n\n4.    Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\n\n\n        The facility is in compliance with the provisions of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia\" and state regulations covering anhydrous ammonia.  The OSHA standard is referenced in this RMP Registration Form; see Section 8.3 (b).\n\n\n\n5.    Five-Year Accident History.\n\n\n\n        There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that have caused any deaths, injuries or significant property damage at the facility; nor to our knowledge, has THERE BEEN ANY ACCIDENTAL RELEASES resulting in o"
