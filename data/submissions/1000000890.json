Monosodium glutamate is used as a flavor enhancer.  It is derived from the amino acid, glutamic acid. Glutamic acid is manufactured using an industrial fermentation process. The primary raw material for the fermentation process is glucose, which is derived from corn.  The amino acid is extracted, purified, and packaged for distribution primarily in North America. \n\n\n\nAnhydrous ammonia, which is covered under the EPA Risk Management Plan, is used at the Ajinomoto Food Ingredients facility. Ammonia is used for pH control in the fermentation process.  \n\n\n\n**The Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies at Our Facility**\n\nAjinomoto North America, Inc. is committed protecting our employees, the public, and the environment from the risks associated with the use of hazardous industrial chemicals, including anhydrous ammonia. \n\n\n\nWe have taken steps to ensure that anhydrous ammonia is handled safely at our facility. Mechanical systems are inspected and tested to ensure safe and proper operations. Our employees are trained in the safe handling of ammonia. Approximately 75% of our employees have been trained to the HazMat Technician level, which allows quick response to any chemical release situation that may develop. \n\n\n\n**The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps**\n\nRegarding anhydrous ammonia, Ajinomoto North America, Inc. is regulated under OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) Program and EPA's Risk Management Plan (RMP). Under these programs, we have developed and implemented procedures and we have installed equipment to help minimize the risk of an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia. These items include:\n\n1. Periodic mechanical integrity testing of ammonia systems.\n\n2. Periodic employee training on the hazards and safe handling of ammonia.\n\n3. Collecting proce"
