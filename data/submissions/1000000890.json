Monosodium glutamate is used as a flavor enhancer.  It is derived from the amino acid, glutamic acid. Glutamic acid is manufactured using an industrial fermentation process. The primary raw material for the fermentation process is glucose, which is derived from corn.  The amino acid is extracted, purified, and packaged for distribution primarily in North America. \r\n\r\nAnhydrous ammonia, which is covered under the EPA Risk Management Plan, is used at the Ajinomoto Food Ingredients facility. Ammonia is used for pH control in the fermentation process.  \r\n\r\n**The Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies at Our Facility**\r\nAjinomoto North America, Inc. is committed protecting our employees, the public, and the environment from the risks associated with the use of hazardous industrial chemicals, including anhydrous ammonia. \r\n\r\nWe have taken steps to ensure that anhydrous ammonia is handled safely at our facility. Mechanical systems are inspected and tested to ensure safe and proper operations. Our employees are trained in the safe handling of ammonia. Approximately 75% of our employees have been trained to the HazMat Technician level, which allows quick response to any chemical release situation that may develop. \r\n\r\n**The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps**\r\nRegarding anhydrous ammonia, Ajinomoto North America, Inc. is regulated under OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) Program and EPA's Risk Management Plan (RMP). Under these programs, we have developed and implemented procedures and we have installed equipment to help minimize the risk of an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia. These items include:\r\n1. Periodic mechanical integrity testing of ammonia systems.\r\n2. Periodic employee training on the hazards and safe handling of ammonia.\r\n3. Collecting proce"

Development of written operating procedures for working with anhydrous ammonia.\r\n6. Development of a management of change procedure for anhydrous ammonia systems.\r\n7. Conducting pre-start up safety reviews of new processes that use anhydrous ammonia.\r\n8. Conducting periodic compliance audits of the OSHA PSM and EPA RMP programs. \r\n9. Promptly investigating any anhydrous ammonia release incidents and recommending changes to prevent such incidents. \r\n10. Requiring employee participation in the development of safety programs.\r\n11. Using hot work permits when conducting welding or cutting activities near anhydrous ammonia.\r\n12. Qualifying contractors used to work on anhydrous ammonia systems.\r\n13. Engineering and constructing anhydrous ammonia systems that are compliant with current engineering and industry standards.\r\n14. Development and implementation of an Environmental Management Program under ISO 14001. \r\n15. Administrative controls to prevent overfilling of anhydrous ammonia tanks. \r\n16. Installation of ammonia leak sensors.\r\n17. Installation of remote switches for emergency shutdown of the anhydrous ammonia system. \r\n\r\n**The Five-Year Accident History**\r\nIn the last five years, there have been no anhydrous ammonia releases at the Ajinomoto North America, Inc. facility that meet the criteria for a reportable release as specified in 40 CFR 68.42. \r\n\r\n**The Emergency Response Program**\r\nIn the event of a release of anhydrous ammonia, Ajinomoto North America, Inc. is prepared to respond. \r\n\r\nProcedures are in place to promptly alert our employees, contractors, public safety officials, the Iowa Department of Natural Resources (IDNR), and the National Response Center in the event of a hazardous material release.

The local Fire Department is aware of the hazardous chemicals used at our facility and they have toured our facility. Local industries and local emergency responders, including the Eddyville Volunteer Fire Department, have participated in periodic drills with Ajinomoto North America, Inc.   \r\n\r\nThe Ajinomoto North America, Inc. facility has coordinated with the Monroe County Local Emergency Planning Commission (LEPC) and is included in the Monroe County Emergency Operations Plan (EOP). We have coordinated with the South East Iowa Response Group (Haz Mat Team) in Ottumwa, Iowa, located approximately 17 miles away. \r\n\r\nAjinomoto North America, Inc. employees have been trained on haz mat response, spill reporting, and notifying the necessary public safety authorities to alert the public. \r\n\r\nAjinomoto North America, Inc. has the necessary equipment on site to deal with anticipated emergencies. Employees have access to and are trained in the proper use of Class A fully contained encapsulated chemical suits with self contained breathing equipment. If a haz mat release escalates, our local volunteer fire department can contact the South East Iowa Response Group (Haz Mat Team) in Ottumwa, Iowa for assistance. \r\n\r\n**Planned Changes to Improve Safety**\r\nImproving industrial chemical safety is a never ending process. We are continuously striving to improve our safety practices at Ajinomoto North America, Inc.  As changes in technology, techniques, or procedures present themselves, they will be examined and considered for implementation to improve the level of our safety as related to handling anhydrous ammonia."
