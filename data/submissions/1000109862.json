If possible, turn off all electrical equipment before leaving the work area. Under all circumstances, remember that safety of life is the first concern.  The Emergency pentane Shutoff I-7 must be activated if at all possible.  \n2.\tIt is the responsibility of the shift supervisor for each area to see that all employees in their area leave the building promptly and safely. All employees should exit the building by way of the nearest facility exit away from the pentane storage tanks. Employees should move to the Far East end of the facility unless directed to a different location by the shift supervisor based on wind direction. Response and clean up should be done by the local Fire Department or other authorized local, state or federal authorities.

During the manufacturing process of EPS, pentanes are used as a blowing agent and are an essential key component to the product.  Due to the storage of pentanes in a quantity over the threshold limit of 10,000 lbs., Epsilyte is subject to compliance with the EPA Risk Management Program.\n\n  The release rate of the worst-case scenario is based on a large hole in the vessel and the loss of approximately 189 gallons a minute and duration of 10 minutes. Ten minutes is based on the time it would take to notice a rapid drop in the pentane pressure.  The alternative release scenario is a smaller size hole that would dissipate 25 lbs. per minute.  Again, the duration of 10 minutes is used based on the time it would take to notice the drop in pressure.  \n  \n\tEpsilyte is following OSHA PSM and EPA RMP level 3.
