Occidental Chemical Corporation's Ingleside Plant is an integral part of the OxyChem commitment to the industrial chemicals market. The IELLC Markham Ethylene Storage and Surface facility contains a salt dome that serves as a reservoir to store excess ethylene produced by the IELLC Ingleside ethylene unit. Ethylene flows to and from the Markham salt dome storage well via a bi-directional pipeline. The pipeline traverses 114 miles between the IELLC ethylene production unit near Ingleside, Texas and the salt dome storage facilities near Markham, Texas.\r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\r\nOxyChem is committed to operating the IELLC Markham Ethylene Storage and Surface facility in a\r\nmanner that is safe for its workers, the public and the environment. It is our policy to adhere to all\r\napplicable Federal, State and local rules and regulations, and industry standards and best practices. As\r\npart of this commitment, OxyChem has established systems to help ensure safe operation of the\r\nprocesses at this facility, which includes the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous\r\nsubstances and emergency response programs. OxyChem is focusing on individual employee\r\nresponsibilities for working safely and achieving the targets of zero safety and environmental\r\nincidents. This program includes training of all employees on the basic values and beliefs that all\r\naccidents and chemical releases are preventable, and it is the responsibility of every employee to\r\nensure that they are aware of the goals of zero incidents and will be held accountable for their\r\nactions.\r\n\r\nTHE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\r\nThe Markham Ethylene Storage and Surface facility, located on FM 1468 North near Markham and\r\nBay City, Texas,"

      "SummaryText": "will store the important commodity chemical ethylene. The Markham facility has three regulated substances that are products, intermediates, or raw materials: ethylene, methane, ethane.  Ethylene is the only regulated substance above the threshold quantity in the process.\r\n\r\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND THE SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\nThe following sections briefly describe the elements of the Markham facility's Program 3 prevention program that address EPA's RMP rule prevention program requirements. Each of the sections listed below are documented and maintained in two documents at the plant: The Plant Safety and Health Procedures Manual and the OxyChem Process Reliability Guidelines Manual. Each of these manuals is updated regularly. The Markham facility's prevention program has been prepared for compliance with OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) and the EPA's Risk Management Rule (RMP) and consists of the following elements: Process Safety Information, Pre-startup Safety Review, Management of Change, Process Hazard Analysis, Compliance Audits, Mechanical Integrity, Operating Procedures, Employee Participation, Contractor Safety, Training, Hot Work Permits, Emergency Planning and Response, and Incident Investigation. Before using a hazardous substance at the Markham facility, less hazardous alternatives are always considered. When a hazardous substance is used at the Markham facility, OxyChem reviews the potential for an accidental release of this substance, which could adversely affect plant workers, the public and the environment, and takes steps to prevent any such effects. This is accomplished through the facility's Management of Change (MOC) and Process Hazard Review (PHR) procedures, which are followed for all new installations or modifications of existing processes. The equipment is carefully designed, installed, operated, and maintained to reduce the likelihood of an accidental release. Industry and government standards are closely"

OxyChem also uses Recognized and Generally Accepted Good Engineering Practices (RAGAGEP) when designing new or modifying existing processes. In addition, OxyChem requires the documentation of standard operating procedures and training of affected employees regarding these procedures as part of the MOC process. OxyChem's mechanical integrity program provides an ongoing process to verify the mechanical integrity of the equipment, piping, and instruments to prevent the release of hazardous substances.\r\n\r\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\nThere have been no reportable releases in the past five years.\r\n\r\nTHE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\r\nThe Markham Ethylene Storage and Surface facility has an established, written emergency response plan. The Markham facility supervisor or senior operator is the incident commander for emergency response until relieved by management personnel. All facility personnel are trained in action they are expected to take in an emergency, such as evacuation procedures. Facility drills are conducted periodically to test the effectiveness of the plan, the plant employee accountability program, and to activate the Ingleside plant's Emergency Operations Center (EOC). OxyChem has a Chemical Emergency Response Team (CERP Team) that is available 24-hours per day to respond to OxyChem facility chemical emergencies.\r\n\r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\nThe Ingleside Plant and Markham facility continue to improve the safety of the processes through\r\nannual reviews of our plant procedures, near misses and incident investigation programs, and a\r\nprogram soliciting safety and environmental suggestions from the plant employees. The key element\r\nof the Markham facility's safety and environmental programs is prevention. The Markham facility will continue to improve all of its processes in order to prevent significant events from occurring in the future."
