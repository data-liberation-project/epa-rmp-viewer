Chlorine containers in use are on scales for daily measurement of chlorine consumption and for inventory purposes.  The chlorine storage and feed rooms contain gas detectors for alarm purposes.  Standard operating and emergency procedures  are in place.  The City of Lebanon has delegated emergency response to the local fire department, and the County LEPC and HAZMAT response teams.  The LEPC  off-site Emergency Response Plan from SARA III is the de facto emergency response plan for the site.  Incident chain of command is listed in this document.  Water Treatment Plant Operators are trained in chlorine safety and in routine operations.  A Chlorine Institute \"B\" repair kit is available to provide for repair of one-ton container leaks.  Both SCBA and PPE are provided for operators.  As part of the RMP, internal audits will be performed on an annual basis.",

      "SummaryText": "    Executive Summary\n\n\nExecutive Summary\nGeneral\n    The City of Lebanon Authority (CLA) owns and operates a  potable water treatment system and distribution system for the City of Lebanon, Pennsylvania, and surrounding communities.  The water treatment plant located at 12 East Behney Avenue, Lebanon, PA, 17046, processes up to 10.0 million gallons per day of water drawn from the Swatara Creek and Sechrist Dam to yield potable water.  Treatment processes include pretreatment, coagulation, flocculation, sedimentation, filtration and chlorine disinfection.  This plan addresses chlorine used in the treatment process.  The plant is operated 24 hours per day, all year.\n    The water treatment plant includes a chlorine storage room, which contains up to eight, one-ton cylinders (16,000 pounds) of chlorine liquified under pressure, a hoist, scale(s), vacuum regulators and a gas detector/alarm unit.  A chlorine feed room is located adjacent to this storage room and has a pre, post and spare chlorinator.  The chlorination system uses remote-vacuum-actuated feed lines and has vacuum regulators attached directly to the chlorine container gas valves, mitigating against high-pressure gas releases through the chlorinator system.  Water treatment operators regularly check the room and its equipment, inventorying the rate of chlorine use and adjusting the feed rate as necessary.  \nOff-Site Consequence Analysis\n    The off-site consequence analysis includes two chlorine release scenarios, one \"worst-case\" and one \"alternative-case.\"  The first scenario is defined by the regulations as the \"maximum quantity in the largest vessel\" being released \"as a gas over ten minutes,\" due to an unspecified failure.  The alternative-case scenario is defined as \"more likely to occur than the worst-case scenario.\"\n    Atmospheric dispersion modeling was performed using the RMP*Comp program distributed by the Chemical Emergency Preparedness and Prevention Office of the EPA.  This model determined the distance tra"

The off-site consequence analysis was performed under the prescribed EPA conditions of all volume released as gas within a ten minute period, to an ERPG-2 endpoint radius of 3.00 miles according to the RMP*Comp model.  Within the 28.3 square-mile area bounded by this circle reside 14,520 people who may potentially be affected by the release.\n    The alternative-case scenario chosen involves a leak from a faulty gasket installation between the ton container and the vacuum regulator.  The RMP*Comp model was run assuming a 10 minute duration release at 0.5 pounds per minute, which yielded a distance to endpoint of 0.1 miles and an impacted area of twenty acres surrounding the facility.  The meteorological conditions used were taken from the Guidance to be stability class D and wind speed of 3.0 m/sec.  No offsite persons would be affected by this release.\nAccidental Release Prevention\n    The City of Lebanon Authority's water treatment plant accidental release prevention program is based upon the following elements:\n    1.    High level of training for the operators.\n    2.    Preventative maintenance program for equipment.\n    3.    Use of stat"

Performance of a hazard review of the equipment and procedures.\n    6.    Implementation of an auditing and inspection program.\n\n    Chemical-specific prevention steps include availability of self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA), personal protection equipment (PPE), awareness of the hazards and toxic properties of chlorine and the presence of a chlorine gas detector.\nFive Year Accident History\n    No accidental release of chlorine has occurred at this facility in the past five years.\nEmergency Response Program\n    The facility has an emergency response program which has been reviewed and coordinated by the Lebanon County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  This program includes an emergency response decision tree and a notification plan.  Emergency response drills will be conducted with the fire companies, and the operation and response procedures will be reviewed and updated on a regular basis.\nPlanned Facilities to Improve Safety\n    Facilities to improve safety (recommended actions) were made following a May 4, 1999, inspection of the disinfection systems by the consulting engineer.  These recommendations involved additional signage.  Although there are no local codes requiring the following, it is good engineering practice, prudent and also recommended to install a fire suppression system and chlorine scrubber system for the chlorination facilities."
