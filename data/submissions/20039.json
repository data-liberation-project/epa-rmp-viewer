Many of our employees are members of Local Emergency Planning Committees.  Our facilities have written emergency preparedness plans that are updated regularly.  \n\nAshland facilities typically host open houses every 3 to 5 years as an opportunity for neighbors to learn about our commitment to safety.  Ashland makes an effort to support our communities through sponsorship of local activities and participation in many local organizations.\n\nA description of your facility and the regulated substances handled:  \n\nThis facility manufactures, receives, stores, and ships chemicals which are primarily used in the electronics and semiconductor industry.  The regulated substances handled are anhydrous ammonia and ammonium hydroxide.\n\nFor more information, visit our web site at www.ashspec.com or contact the Plant Manager.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario:\n\nThe USEPA RMP regulations require the worst-case release scenario to assume that the entire contents of the largest vessel of a regulated substance in a process are released.  The USEPA requires that one worst-case scenario be reported to represent all regulated toxic substances held above the threshold quantity.  Ashland reported the worst-case scenario for anhydrous ammonia.  Ba"

      "SummaryText": "sed on our analysis using USEPA-approved methods, the worst-case release scenario could potentially affect offsite public receptors.  There were no specific administrative controls or mitigation measures considered in the analysis to limit the distance reported. \n\nThe alternative-case release scenario:\n\nThe USEPA RMP regulations require an analysis of the alternative-case release scenarios.  The alternative-case release scenario represents an accidental release that is more reasonable than the worst-case, but is still highly unlikely to occur.  The USEPA requires that the results of the alternative-case release scenario analysis be reported for each toxic present.  Based on our analysis using USEPA-approved methods, the alternative-case release scenarios for anhydrous ammonia and ammonium hydroxide could potentially impact offsite public receptors.  There were no specific administrative controls or active mitigation measures considered in the analysis to limit the distances reported.  The passive mitigation measure considered in the analysis was the diked containment of the ammonium hydroxide.\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps:\n\nThis facility is operated in strict accordance with the USEPA prevention program requirements.  A written management system is in place with written operating and maintenance procedures.  The operations at this facility are ISO 9002 certified.  The management system procedures contained in the ISO program ensure rigorous training for operations employees, numerous management checks and balances, and strict attention to changes in the operations with a thorough review and examination of potential incidents that could lead to an accidental release.  Ashland maintains a 24-hour corporate emergency reporting system that can speedily coordinate emergency response with top management and quickly communicate key first-aid or medical information to local health care providers.

Our employees regularly undergo training in emergency response activities.  This facility regularly invites the local fire department and emergency responders to tour and inspect our plant and gain familiarity with our operations.  This facility has a written emergency response plan that is updated regularly.  \n\nPlanned changes to improve safety:\n\nOur facility continually evaluates and implements employee suggestions and recommendations resulting from routine hazard reviews and process hazard analyses.  We are currently in the process of building an enclosure around the anhydrous ammonia system to minimize potential offsite impacts of an accidental release.  We make changes to improve safety based on comments and information developed within our organization and the industry.  Toward continuous improvement, we are looking at ways to minimize risk through process improvement and re-design.  Ashland is committed to the Chemical Manufacturers Association's Responsible CareSM Initiative Management Code on Process Safety."
