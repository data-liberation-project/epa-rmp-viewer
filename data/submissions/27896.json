Thus, 40 CFR 68 is applicable to Kraft Foods in Tulare.\n\nBelow is a brief description of the release scenarios for ammonia and their off-site consequences:\n\n3.0 Worst-case and Alternative Release Scenarios\nThe ammonia refrigeration system has associated hazards that can potentially affect on-site employees and the general public if there is a release from the system. Although the alternative release scenario is more probable, the US EPA requires that one worst-case and one alternative release scenario is reported for each regulated chemical. Described below are the associated hazards and the worst-case and alternative release scenarios for each regulated chemical.\n\nAmmonia \nAmmonia is classified as a Group 2 Refrigerant per ASHRAE Standard 34-1989.  The dominant characteristic of this chemical is its toxicity.  It is a self-alarming chemical by its distinctive pungent odor.  Due to this odor, persons exposed to ammonia vapor will not voluntarily stay in areas of even small concentrations.  Ammonia is flammable in a very narrow and high range of concentration with a high ignition temperature.  It is not poisonous, but it is corrosive to human tissue.  Ammonia is readily absorbed into the moisture of the skin and, at high concentrations, can cause severe burns.\n\nThe risks to persons in an accidental release of ammonia include:\n\n1. Irritation of respiratory tract,\n2. Corrosive attack of skin and other tissue,\n3. Freezing of skin and other body tissue when contacted by liquid ammonia.\nAlthough there are quality and safety systems in place at Kraft's Tulare plant, the ammonia refrigeration system has associated hazards that can potentially affect on-site employees and the general public if there is a release from the system.

This facility submitted the initial RMP in June 1999.  This is a re-submittal due to a change in inventory.  There have been no reportable ammonia releases since the initial RMP was filed.  This facility has implemented an electronic preventive maintenance system.  This is a system that uses a real time database to track preventive maintenance, training, inspection dates and issue reminders to responsible groups.  Training is tracked on an internal spreadsheet.\n\nThe emergency response policies at the Tulare facility ensure that there is emergency response coverage 24 hours per day and 7 days per week through employees with emergency response training.  There are also adequate provisions for coordination with outside agencies, such as the Tulare City Fire Department, in the event of an emergency.\n*From this point in the Executive Summary, anhydrous ammonia will be synonymous with ammonia.\n\n2.0 Process Description and Regulated Substances\n\nThe Tulare, CA plant is a manufacturer/processor of dairy products and dairy byproducts. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes for the primary processes at this facility are 311512 and 311513.   The facility is capable of producing and packaging various dairy products for consumer intake.  Many areas of the plant are refrigerated to preserve the dairy products.  Some of these areas include: storage tanks and silos containing raw materials and product.\n\nThe Tulare plant has one regulated substance under 40 CFR 68: ammonia.  Ammonia is used as a cooling agent in the plant's refrigeration process. \n\nThe amm"

Given the safety precautions at the plant, both scenarios are unlikely to occur.\n\nThe ammonia release scenarios were modeled using EPA's RMP*COMP to obtain the distance to\nendpoint.  The endpoint, as defined by the US EPA, is the Emergency Response Planning Guideline,\nLevel - 2 (ERPG-2).  The ERPG-2 was developed by the American Industrial Hygiene Association and is applicable to human exposures for up to one hour.  The ERPG-2 is intended to protect individuals from health threatening or escape impairing injury and is not generally considered fatal.\n\n4.0 General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe Tulare plant has developed an OSHA PSM program for their ammonia refrigeration system. Ammonia falls under the RMP Program 3 prevention program, which is identical to the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) program.    EPA has said that if the process is in compliance with OSHA PSM, then it is compliance with RMP Program 3.  Thus, the Tulare facility's ammonia PSM should meet the requirements for the RMP document.  \n\nThere are several aspects of the prevention program that are key: \n\n1. Since most of the pipe work is out of the way of people and the machinery, there is less of a chance of an ammonia release.\n2. The plant maintains good training, certification and employee awareness of operating procedures.\n3. The plant has developed a strong preventive maintenance and inspection program.\n4. An ammonia detection system is present at the facility that alerts facility personnel\n5. Utility personnel are present on-site and assigned to the ammonia system 24 hours a day, 7 days a week and all year round\n\n\n5.0 Five-year Accident History\n\nThe review of this facility's accident history includes the following range of dates: June 1, 1997 - June 1, 2002. According to 40 CFR Part 68.42(a), there have been no accidental releases, for ammonia, at this facility.\n\n6.0 Emergency Res"

Kraft Foods Environmental Affairs and the Tulare City Fire Department have reviewed this plan.\n\nThe plant personnel are divided into various management and response teams.  The in-plant contacts in the event of an emergency are listed in the Plant Emergency response Plan.  Back-up personnel are also available in the event that the primary incident response personnel cannot be contacted.  The on-site emergency response plan includes information about the frequency of employee emergency response training as well as a detailed description of the training content.  There are also specific procedures to follow in the event of a fire and ammonia emergency.\n\nAt the discretion of the incident commander, the Tulare City Fire Department will be called upon to provide back-up emergency responders and equipment.  The Tulare City Fire Department responds to all emergencies where fire alarms are used for evacuation in addition to all fire related emergencies.  In every case that the fire department is called, the Kraft Tulare and Tulare City Fire Department HAZMAT Response Teams will be placed on standby and an ambulance will be called to the scene.\n\n7.0 Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nBased on the Process Hazard Analysis (what-if PHA) completed for ammonia, a list of action items were developed and are being monitored to determine if implementation was accomplished.  Some of the projects undertaken to improve safety at the facility include an operational test program for ammonia sensors, operator training (all operators attended the University of Wisconsin ammonia training course), and all ammonia valves are being tracked on a spreadsheet for maintenance schedules.  There are numerous examples of proposed safety improvements as a result of the PHA.  These include:\n\n1. Addition of an auto suction system. (Implementation, 2003)\n\n2.
