      "SummaryText": "Eastman SE, Inc.: Executive Summary\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Response Policies\nEastman SE, Inc., (Eastman SE) is located on a 2200 acre site near Batesville, Arkansas. Eastman SE is a manufacturer of specialty organic chemical intermediates.  Some of the chemicals manufactured at Eastman SE include: intermediates used to make color film and photographic paper, paint and coating additives, intermediates used in plastics and bottle polymers, medical supplies, prescription medicine intermediates, food supplements, household detergent ingredients, agricultural products, and bio-based products.  Eastman SE has RMP regulated flammables consisting of ethyl mercaptan and propylene.  In addition, the facility uses chlorine, crotonaldehyde, oleum (20% and 30%), and anhydrous hydrogen chloride, which are RMP regulated toxic substances. \n\nEastman SE has a long-standing history of protecting the health and safety of employees, the community, and the environment.  This is evidenced through over 20 years of safe operations and excellent environmental stewardship, through our commitment to the principles of Responsible Care\u00ae, and through our recognition by OSHA as a \"STAR\" site in OSHA's Voluntary Protection Program.  To protect people, property, and the environment, we use multiple systems-or layers of protection-where one system is designed to backup another system.  The first layer involves accident prevention by identifying and reducing risks during the design and before startup of new manufacturing processes.  The second layer involves operating and mantaining equipment and processes in a manner that reduces risks and minimizes incidents.  The third layer involves maintaining the capability to respond to and control incidents in a timely manner.\n \nAll RMP covered processes at Eastman SE are regulated as Program 3.\n\nFive Year Accident History\nEastman SE is committed to a goal of providing a workplace that is free of accidents.  Our record over the past years indicates"

Eastman SE is an OSHA VPP STAR site.\n\nGeneral Accident Release Prevention Program Steps\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at Eastman SE.  Because processes at Eastman SE that are regulated by the EPA RMP regulation are also subject to the OSHA PSM standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\nEmployee Participation\nEastman SE has management systems in place which meet the requirements of RMP and ensure full employee participation.   The ARK Site Safety Team was developed to provide oversight, direction, and coordination of site and department safety programs to ensure safety excellence.  \n\nEastman SE encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team.  Employees have access to extensive information created as part of Eastman SE's accident prevention program.  Specific ways that employees are involved in the accident prevention program are documented in employee participation plans that address each accident prevention program element.  In addition, Eastman SE has a number of initiatives underway that address process and employee safety issues.  These initiatives include a Eastman SE's Safety Concerns Process which is a process for reporting safety concerns and ensuring that such concerns are addressed promptly.  A second initiative is called the Safety Observation Process, a program where employees make random observations of their co-workers to help identify and eliminate at-risk behaviors. Additionally, Eastman SE participates in OSHA's Vo"

The VPP lists guidelines for employee participation.  \n\nProcess Safety Information\nEastman SE keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design information.  This information is normally compiled in a Process Safety Information (PSI) binder. The PSI and referenced documents are readily available to employees as part of the employee participation plan.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nEastman SE has a comprehensive Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards before the manufacturing process begins.\n\nEastman SE uses a PHA technique that is appropriate to the complexity of the process being studied.  There are four techniques in use at Eastman SE.  These are Check List, What If, What If-Check List, and Hazard and Operability Analysis.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating, maintenance, chemical, and engineering expertise and experience.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures.\n\nImplementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on the relative risk rankings assigned by the PHA Team.  These rankings help ensure  accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options being implemented in response to PHA Team findings are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained for the life of the process.\n\nAll processes undergo"

      "SummaryText": "a revalidation PHA at least every five years as long as the process is active.\n\nOperating Procedures\nEastman SE maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as: 1) unit startup, 2) normal operations, 3) temporary operations, 4) emergency shutdown, 5) normal shutdown, 6) initial startup of a new process.  These procedures are used as a reference by experienced operators and provide the basis for consistent training of new operators. The procedures are maintained current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the Management of Change Process.  Department Superintendents certify these procedures annually as accurate.  The Process Safety Review Committee reviews them at least every five years.  \n\nTraining\nTo compliment written procedures for process operations, EastmanSE has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  Each new employee receives basic training in department operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is provided training on process-specific duties and tasks.  This is done through an operator apprentice program or by pairing the new operator with an experienced operator for an appropriate period of time.  After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skill demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they may work independently.  Refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years.  Training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\nContractors\nEastman SE uses contractors to supplement its construction, maintenance and related services workforce.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, Eastman SE has procedures in place to provide contractors information on the hazards in their work area.

The purpose of a PSSR is to ensure safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup.  This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and supporting systems are operationally ready. \n\nMechanical Integrity\nEastman SE has well established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition.  The basic aspects of this program include: 1) conducting training, 2) developing written procedures, 3) performing inspections and tests, 4) correcting identified deficiencies, and 5) applying quality assurance measures.  In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process equipment.\n\nSafe Work Practices\nEastman SE has long-standing, documented safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety.  Examples of these include: 1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, 2) lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, 3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous materials before process piping or equipment is opened, 4) a permit and procedure to control spark-producing activities (i.e., hot work), and 5) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space.  These procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\n\nManagement of Change (MOC)\nEastman SE has a comprehensive system to manage changes to proce"

This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), operating procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented.  Changes are reviewed to ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.  Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures are updated to incorporate these changes.  In addition, operating, maintenance, and contractor personnel are provided  necessary training on the change.\n\nIncident Investigation\nEastman SE promptly investigates all incidents that result in, or reasonably could result in; fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury.  The goal of each investigation is to determine the root cause and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to company management.  Corrective actions are implemented in response to the investigation team's findings and are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented and the investigation results are reviewed with employees and contractors who could be affected by the findings.\n \nCompliance Audits\nTo help ensure the process safety program is functioning properly, Eastman SE conducts compliance audits at least every three to four years to determine whether the required procedures and practices are being implemented.  A specialized team from an outside source conducts these compliance audits.  Audit findings are forwarded to company management for resolution.

Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by either equipment or human failures.\n\nEastman SE also has safety features on processing units to help: 1) quickly detect a release, 2) contain and control a release, and 3) reduce the consequences of a release.  Some examples of safety features that compose the layers of protection at Eastman SE are gas detectors/analyzers, relief valves, scrubbers, automatic shutdown systems and containment areas.\n\nEmergency Response Program Information\nThe overall emergency response program for Eastman SE is coordinated with the Independence County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  The LEPC includes local emergency response officials, local government officials, and industry representatives.  The committee meets regularly to develop community emergency response plans and to conduct community-wide drills.  Eastman SE has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations.  This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.  Eastman SE also conducts its own periodic emergency drills that involve the LEPC and/or emergency response organizations.
