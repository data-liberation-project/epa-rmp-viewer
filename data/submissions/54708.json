Salt Creek Gas Plant  (2009)\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nThe Salt Creek Gas Plant operations center has a long standing commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training our personnel as well as the safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of potentially hazardous or regulated substances.  However, if a release would occur, the Emergency Action Plan (EAP) will be initiated and trained gas plant operators would respond to control and contain the release.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE(S) AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe Salt Creek Gas Plant, located outside of Midwest, Wyoming, USA, operates a variety of processes to extract light hydrocarbons from the natural gas stream from the Salt Creek oil field.  These light hydrocarbons include methane, ethane, propane, butane and pentanes.  The propane, butanes and pentanes are sold as a Y-grade mixture to other facilities for further separation.  The methane and ethane is sold or consumed on site or in the nearby field for fuel.  The Salt Creek gas plant uses one regulated flammable material in it?s process, that being propane which is used as a refrigerant to cool the natural gas stream to recover the liquids.  The natural gas stream which feeds the plant contains a small amount of Hydrogen Sulfide (H2S), which is also regulated; however the entire amount of H2S in the plant is less than the threshold quantity.\n\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS RESULTS\n\nThis section has been omitted in accordance with the Homeland Security rules and by regulation.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the Salt Creek Gas Plant.  The processes are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency?s (EPA?s) Risk"

The gas plant ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls, monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel and protective instrument systems such as automatic shutdowns.  \n\nThe plant also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of the process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment.  This information, along with process operating parameters is used to develop written procedures that are used to establish inspection and maintenance activities.  Additionally, the procedures are used to train operators and assure that the safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\nPROCESS HAZARD ANALYSIS (PHA)\n\nThe company has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically studied to identify hazards and that appropriate controls are in place to manage those hazards.\n\nThe company has used the ?what if? method along with a corporate method referred to as the DP-10 method of conducting the PHA.  These analyses are conducted using a team of individuals who have the operating and maintenance experience as well as the engineering expertise to evaluate the systems in the process.  The team is tasked with identifying and evaluating hazards within the process as well as identifying accident prevention and mitigation measures.  Using this information, the team suggests additional prevention and/or mitigation measures if the team believes such measures are necessary.  Based on a hazard ranking system, the findings are forwarded to the plant engineer and local management for resolution.  If they can not be resolved at a local level, the r"

The hazard ranking method is to assure those items with the highest priority are resolved in as quickly as possible.  All responses and resolutions are documented and tracked until completed or signed off by a responsible party.  The final resolution to all findings are documented and kept with the PHA for the life of the facility.\n\nTo ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the plant reviews, updates and revalidates the PHA.  These reviews are held at least every five years and will continue to be conducted at this interval until the plant is no longer operating.  The results and findings from these updates and reviews are documented and retained with the original PHA.  If there are findings or recommendations found during this review process, they are forwarded to management for consideration.  The final resolution of the findings are documented and retained.\n\nOPERATING PROCEDURES\n\nThe Salt Creek Gas Plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations such as: 1) unit startup; 2) normal operations; 3) emergency shutdown; 4) normal shutdown; 5) initial startup of a new process and others.  These procedures are used for reference by the experienced operators and provide a basis for the consistent training of new operators.  Each procedure is reviewed and certified annually to assure it reflects the operating conditions and operations of the facility.  These are kept current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes in the process or operational conditions.  The changes are documented using the Management of Change process. \n\nIn addition, the procedures at the Salt Creek Gas Plant include a section that provides guidance on how to respond to exceedances from specific process parameters such as high/low temperatures or pressur"

This information is imbedded in the written procedures so operators and others have access to it at all times.  \n\nTRAINING\n\nTo complement the written process operating procedures, the Salt Creek Gas Plant has a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  New employees receive basic training in gas plant operations. After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted at least every three years and more frequently if there are changes to procedures or processes.  All training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify the operators understanding of the training.\n\nCONTRACTORS\n \nThe Salt Creek Gas Plant uses contractors to supplement its work force during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the gas plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors; 1) perform their work in a safe manner, 2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, 3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, 4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, 5) understand and follow site safety rules, and 6) inform gas plant personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.  This is accomplished by providing contractors with; 1) process overview, 2) information about safety and health hazards, 3) emergency response plan requirements, 4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work, and 5) safe and hot work permits as required.

Fire detectors tied into automated facility shutdowns\n\nRelease Containment/Control\n?  Process relief valves that either discharge to a safe area or discharge to a flare system that captures and incinerates any episodic releases\n?  Manual and automated valves to isolate portions or all of the process\n?  Automated shutdown systems for specific process parameters (e.g., high stack temperatures, high/low pressures, etc..) \n?  Redundant equipment and instrumentation where feasible\n\nRelease Mitigation\n?  Fire extinguishers located throughout the plant\n?  Operators trained in emergency response and process control\n?  Personal Protective Equipment including chemical protective clothing, Self-Contained Breathing Apparatus (SCBA) and supplied air respirators\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe Salt Creek Gas Plant has an excellent record of accident prevention over the past five years.  During that time, there have not been any incidents that did or could have resulted in an hydrocarbon releases whose quantities approached those described in the RMP release events.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\n\nThe Salt Creek Gas Plant maintains a written emergency response program, which is in place to protect worker and public safety and the environment.  The program consists of procedure for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address all aspects of e"

      "SummaryText": "mergency response, including proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post incident cleanup.  In addition the plant has procedures that address maintenance, inspection and testing of emergency equipment.  Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties.  The emergency response program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to the plant.  The emergency response program changes are administered through the MOC process, which includes informing and/or training affected personnel in the changes.\n\nThe overall emergency response program of the Salt Creek Gas Plant is coordinate with the Midwest Fire Department and the Natrona County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  This coordination includes periodic meeting of the committee, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials and industry representatives.  The Salt Creek Gas Plant has around the clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations.  This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to emergency situations.  In addition to periodic meetings with the LEPC, the Salt Creek Gas Plant conducts periodic emergency drills that involve the local emergency response organizations.  Annual refresher training is available to local emergency responder regarding the hazards of regulated substances in the gas plant.   \n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThe Salt Creek Gas Plant resolves all findings form PHAs and audits, some of which have resulted in modifications to the process.  These modifications are typically completed during scheduled turnarounds at the facility.  Some examples of these are:\n?  Re0activated second de-meth"
