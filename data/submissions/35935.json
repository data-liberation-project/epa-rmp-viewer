The  plan addresses emergency planning, public  health\r\nand safety.\r\n\r\nThe AES Hawaii facility generates steam and electricity at 91-\r\n086  Kaomi  Loop,  Hawaii 96707. The  Plant  is  located  near\r\nBarber's  Point, within the area known as Campbell  Industrial\r\nPark,  which is on the Island of Oahu about 30 miles  west  of\r\nHonolulu. Electricity generated by the facility is supplied to\r\nHawaiian  Electric Company, and steam is sold  to  the  nearby\r\nChevron USA oil refinery. The plant has two Circulating  Fluid\r\nBed  (CFB) coal-fired boilers and one steam turbine.  The  CFB\r\nboilers  use a clean coal technology that minimizes  emissions\r\nof  sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides. The boilers use limestone\r\nthat  reacts  with  the sulfur in the coal  to  reduce  sulfur\r\ndioxide  emissions. The nitrogen oxides emissions are  reduced\r\nby   two   factors:   the  relatively  low  boiler   operating\r\ntemperatures  and  the addition of anhydrous  ammonia  to  the\r\nboiler  flue  gas  that  reacts with the  nitrogen  oxides  to\r\nproduce harmless nitrogen gas and water vapor.\r\n\r\nAmmonia safety considerations have been incorporated into  the\r\nconstruction  of  the  ammonia system.  The  ammonia  tank  is\r\nsecured  to the ground and has cathodic protection.  The  tank\r\nhas   relief   valves   at  the  top  of   the   tank.   Thus,\r\noverpressurization  of  the tank would primarily  involve  the\r\nventing of gas in the upper part of the tank. The vapor  lines\r\nfrom  the  tank  to  the  boiler area  are  buried  to  reduce\r\npotential  releases  from this piping. Loading  and  unloading\r\nvalves,  the tank and tanker truck are equipped with automatic\r\nshut-off  valves  in  the event that flow through  the  valves\r\nexceeds  design criteria. Therefore, in the event of a loading\r\nhose  failure,  the  flow  of ammonia would  be  automatically\r\nterminated.  The facility also has a monitor  located  in  the\r\nammonia system process area that detects leaks and trigger"

This  Risk\r\nManagement  Plan summarizes the efforts that this company  has\r\nundertaken to establish a Risk Management Program.\r\n\r\nAnhydrous ammonia is the only chemical used at the AES  Hawaii\r\nfacility  that is above the RMP threshold amount.  The  onsite\r\nmaximum storage quantity of the liquid anhydrous ammonia  tank\r\nat  the AES Hawaii plant is 109,000 pounds, which is above the\r\n10,000 pound RMP applicability threshold. The AES Hawaii plant\r\ndoes  not  use  any other chemicals or flammable materials  in\r\nexcess of threshold quantities covered by RMP requirements.\r\n\r\nA  management  system  will be in place  at  the  facility  to\r\noversee  implementation  of  the  facility's  Risk  Management\r\nProgram. This management system is considered one of the  most\r\nimportant elements of this facility's Risk Management Program,\r\nas  its  goal  is  to  ensure  that  lines  of  authority  and\r\nresponsibility are clearly defined, helping to ensure that all\r\nelements  of  the Risk Management Program are implemented.  At\r\nthe  AES  Hawaii  Facility, the person  who  has  the  overall\r\nresponsibility  for  the  Risk  Management  Program   is   the\r\nenvironmental coordinator.\r\n\r\nThe   facility   also   participates  in  emergency   response\r\nactivities  with the Campbell Local Emergency  Action  Network\r\n(CLEAN). CLEAN has developed an Emergency Management Plan that\r\nprovides  supplemental guidance and information  to  emergency\r\nresponse personnel, local residents, and business based on the\r\nspecific  operations  in and around Campbel"

The prevention program  incorporates  a\r\nmechanical integrity program, regularly scheduled maintenance,\r\ndaily  visual  operational checks of equipment,  and  employee\r\ntraining   in   proper  operating  procedures  and   emergency\r\nresponse.\r\n\r\nAES  Hawaii  has designed a Mechanical Integrity  Program  for\r\nammonia in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.119(j). The purpose  is\r\nto   verify  that  critical  process  equipment  is  designed,\r\ninstalled,  maintained  properly, and operates  correctly.  In\r\naccordance  with  this  program,  the  ammonia  processes  and\r\nequipment  must be constructed, installed, and  maintained  in\r\norder to minimize the risk of releases of the highly hazardous\r\nchemicals.  The  mechanical integrity program  at  AES  Hawaii\r\nincludes  identifying  and categorizing equipment.  Inspecting\r\nand  testing  of  instrumentation and documenting  maintenance\r\nprocedures;  training  of maintenance personnel;  establishing\r\ncriteria  for  acceptable test results; documenting  test  and\r\ninspection  results; and documenting manufacturer  information\r\nfor equipment and instrumentation.\r\n\r\nThe  facility  performs a system integrity  check  every  five\r\nyears   for  the  ammonia  storage  tank  and  all  associated\r\nhoses/lines.   The  most  recent  integrity   evaluation   was\r\nperformed in  August 2003.  As part  of  this  evaluation, all\r\nemergency  relief  valves and storage  tank  loading/unloading\r\nvalves and hoses were replaced. The equipment is maintained in\r\naccordance  with manufacturer specifications,  and  applicable\r\nANSI,   and  ASME  engineering  codes.  A  computer   database\r\ngenerates work orders to identify when such maintenance  needs\r\nto  be  implemented.  Once,  each  12-hour  period,  operators\r\nvisually   observe  the  equipment  for  signs  of   potential\r\nmalfunction."
