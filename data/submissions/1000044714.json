Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\nThe management and staff of the Eastern Distribution Center are committed to operating the anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system with the highest regard for the safety of the public, distribution center personnel, and the environment.  To ensure the safety of the public, distribution center personnel, and the environment the facility has implemented a management system that integrates the elements of OSHA's Process Safety Management standard, 29 CFR 1910.119 and EPA's Risk management Program rule 40 CFR part 68.  The policies and procedures integrated under the facilities management system specifically address the prevention of the release of anhydrous ammonia and emergency response to an accidental release.\r\nB. Stationary Source, Regulated Substance Handled, and Process Description\r\n1.  The Eastern Distribution Center is located at 16020 Leeland Rd in Upper Marlboro, MD 20774.  Anhydrous ammonia is used as the refrigerant in the closed loop mechanical refrigeration system.  \r\n2. The ammonia refrigeration system is the only process at the facility which is subject to the EPA rule and OSHA PSM standard.  \r\n3. Anhydrous ammonia is the only regulated substance in the ammonia refrigeration system.  At ambient temperature and pressure it is a colorless gas with an irritating odor.  It is highly soluble in water.  The chemical formula for anhydrous ammonia is NH3.\r\n4. The anhydrous ammonia maximum intended inventory is 35,320 lbs.\r\n5. The closed loop mechanical refrigeration system cycles the refrigerant (anhydrous ammonia) from liquid to gas and back again.  The ammonia undergoes no chemical changes in the process.  The system cycles the ammonia through various physical states, high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, high pressure vapor, and low pressure vapor in order to provide refrigeration for product and process equipment.  \r\nC. Accidental Release Prevention Program\r\nThe facility has an accidental"

Five Year Accident History\r\nOver the past five years, the Eastern Distribution Center has not had any anhydrous ammonia releases that resulted in deaths, injuries, property damage, environmental damage, or off-site consequences.\r\nE. Emergency Response Program\r\nThe facility has an Emergency Action Plan (plan) in effect at the facility.  This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:  \r\n- save lives;\r\n- minimize and avoid injuries;\r\n- protect the environment; and\r\n- minimize property damage.\r\nThe Emergency Action Plan (Plan) is included in the facility IIPP program.  Emergency response activities are coordinated with the local fire department and available hazmat resources.  In case of a major ammonia emergency, the facility will first call 9-1-1 to alert the local Police and Fire Departments.  Other responders will be called as needed.  If a release exceeds the federal reporting quantity of 100 pounds for ammonia, the National Response Center will be called\r\nF. Planned Changes to improve Safety\r\nThe Eastern Distribution Center has a management system in place that is designed to ensure the implementation of each program element in compliance with the OSHA PSM standard and EPA RMP rule.  Authority, responsibility, and accountability are assigned to facility management and staff.  Ongoing compliance audits, revalidations, and inspections help to continuously improve on the program prevention elements.  Continuous training is provided for ammonia"
