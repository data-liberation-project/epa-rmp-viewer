The following information was determined using the Automated Resource for Chemical Hazard Incident Evaluation (ARCHIE) model, based on the stability class F , 4.5 mph wind speed, and the level of 200ppm for Anhydrous Ammonia.  This resulted in a release rate of 1,500 lbs/min, and an end point of 2.75 miles from the spill point during summer season at 85 degrees F.  \n\tThe alternate case scenario for Anhydrous Ammonia was decided as the loss of Anhydrous Ammonia resulting from a release through a 1-inch and a 2-inch line break. . The following information was determined using the Automated Resource for Chemical Hazard Incident Evaluation (ARCHIE) model, based on the stability class F, 6.5 wind speed, and a level of 3ppm for Anhydrous Ammonia.

Its Dun and Bradstreet number is 02-405-9032.  Map Location 38014'30N; 85044'W.\nOperation Description\n\tThe site process involves the receipt of commercial food products for cold storage.  No processing takes place at the facility, only storage for maintenance of cold temperature.  Industrial lift trucks, placed into coolers or freezers move the materials.\n\tFrom the time of receipt and throughout the storage period, the materials are maintained at a cool temperature by anhydrous ammonia refrigeration processes.\n\tThe air cooling process involves the distribution of liquid ammonia through piping (coils) across which air is blown with fans to cool the air.  \nOperation (Technology) of the Process\n\tRefrigeration is the control of heat.  According to American Heritage Dictionary heat is defined as:\nThe energy associated with the motion of atoms or molecules in\nsolids, which can be transmitted through solid and fluid media\nby conduction, through fluid media by convection and through empty\nspace by radiation.\n\tHeat is energy.  The amount of energy or heat available is determined by the amount of motion or excitement of the atoms or molecules.  The more excited the molecules, the more energy or heat available.\n\tThis energy or heat can be moved or transferred.  This transfer occurs when there is a difference of temperature.  Heat flows from a source of grater energy (higher temperature) to a source of lower energy (lower temperature).  The greater the temperature difference, the more rapid the heat flow.\n\tThere are three types of heat transfer mechanisms:\nConduction\nConvection\nRadiation\n\tThe use of liquid ammonia as a refrigerant is the transferring of heat by conduction and convection.  In conduction heat is transferred by the molecules in a medium coming in contact with each other.  The warm molecules collide with colder m"

Metals are very good at transferring heat by conduction.\n\tBy blowing air or moving a liquid such as water or glycol over a material such as metal that has been cooled heat is transferred by convection.  The heat load in a freezer is moved via convection to the coils where conduction takes place in transferring the heat to the refrigerant.  The refrigeration process does not produce cold.  It simply moves the heat from an area where it is not wanted to a place it can be discharged.\n\tThe refrigeration systems at Merchant are accomplished by three methods using Anhydrous Ammonia.  These include:\nAir Cooling\nWater Chilling\n\n\tLiquid ammonia has the ability to absorb very large amounts of heat as it vaporizes.  This ability is the basis for mechanical refrigeration systems.  These mechanical systems utilize both pressure and temperature in the refrigeration cycle.  There are five major components in a mechanical refrigeration system.  These include, 1) Receiver, 2) Metering device/expansion valves, 3) Evaporator, 4) Compressor, and 5) Condenser.\n\tThe Receiver collects the condensed vapors and stores the excess refrigerant charge that is not circulating through the system.  The receiver is located between the condenser and the expansion valve.  It is also used to store refrigerant when it is necessary to service the system.\n\tThe liquid ammonia is routed to a metering device (expansion valves).  This device regulates the amount of refrigerant going into the evaporator.\n\tAs the ammonia flows through the device, there is a pressure drop.  The amount of pressure drop determines the temperature of the refrigerant going to the evaporator.  The refrigerant leaves the metering device in both a liquid and a vapor phase.\n\tThe two-phase refrigerant then enters the evaporator.  The evaporator removes heat from the area or substance bei"

      "SummaryText": "ng cooled.  The ammonia absorbs heat and vaporizes as it travels through the evaporator.  The ammonia then leaves the evaporator and travels to the compressor.\n\tThe compressor takes the vapor through the suction line and increases the pressure such that when the heat is removed in the condenser, the vapors change form and become liquid.  Work is required to compress these vapors.  This work is converted into energy and stored in the compressed vapors.  This increase in energy results in an increase in temperature.\n\tThe compressed vapors then go to a condenser.  The condenser removes a lot of the heat contained in the compressed vapors.  When enough heat is removed, the vapor changes form and become liquid.  This condenser liquid then flows to the receiver.\n\tMerchants Ice & Cold Storage Company receives Anhydrous Ammonia by wheeled vehicle.  The receiver has a maximum of 11,000 pounds which is filled to 80% capacity.  The Anhydrous Ammonia is in a liquid form at receipt.  Contract personnel complete the connection to the tank.\n\n\tWorst-case release scenario and alternative release scenario\n\tAs a part of the Merchants Ice & Cold Storage Company proactive program concerning the hazards of ammonia to its' workers and the surrounding public, its staff has conducted a thorough hazard assessment.\n\tFor the hazard assessment and the RMP, populations potentially affected are defined as those within a circle that has as its center the point of release and its radius the distance to the toxic or flammable endpoint.  Owners or operators may use Census data to define this population.  The presence of schools, hospitals, other institutions, public arenas, recreational areas, and large commercial and industrial developments that can be identified on street maps within this circle must be noted.  The presence of environmental receptors within this circle must also be listed.  The EPA has defined environmental receptors as natural areas such as national or state parks, forests, or mon"
