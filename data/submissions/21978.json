      "SummaryText": "Bayer Corporation\nPolyol Pilot Plant Facility\nNewtown Square, Pa.\n\n\nEPA RMPlan Executive Summary\n\n\nINTRODUCTION:\n \n\nSITE HISTORY\n\nBayer Corporation is a major Chemicals and Health Care products company with operations throughout the United States.  Bayer employes approximately 25,000 people at more than 50 facilities.\n\nThe Newtown Square Polyol Pilot Plant Facility was recently acquired from Lyondell Chemical Company.  It was opened by Atlantic Richfield Company in 1980.  Since then, the Newtown Square facility operated as a research and development center for ARCO Chemical Company (ACC).  Beginning in 1987, \nthe site also became ACC's world-wide corporate headquarters. In July of 1998, Lyondell Chemical Company purchased ARCO Chemical Company.  The facility serves as a scale up pilot plant location for Bayer's Polyol Research and Development activities.  Overall, the facility is shared with Lyondell Chemical Company, which also conducts research and development activities at the facility.  Many site services are also shared between the two companies as described in a joint Shared Services Agreement.  Lyondell Chemical Company submitted an original RMP Plan as required in June 1999.  This submittal is a revision to that plan reflecting the ownership change.  Operation of the facility's covered process has not changed.\n\n\n1.0 ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nThe Bayer Corporation Newtown Square Pilot Plant Facility is committed to operating and maintaining all \nof our laboratories and processes in a safe and responsible manner.  We have in place a \ncombination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning \nprograms to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public, as well as to protect the \nenvironment.  These programs are designed to meet or exceed governmental requirements \nsuch as the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) \nrule (40 CFR Part 68) and the Occupational Sa"

This document is \nintended to satisfy the RMP Plan requirements of the RMP rule and to provide the public \nwith a description of the risk management program at the facility.\n\n\n2.0 STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe facility is not a manufacturing site.  Bayer operates laboratories and pilot plants designed to support company manufacturing sites as well as develop new processes.  Processes supported include propylene oxide and it's derivatives.  Lyondell Chemical Company operates similar facilities at the site, although none of the operations are subject to the RMP Regulation.   In Bayer's research and development processes, the following chemicals are used that the EPA has identified as having the potential to cause significant off site consequences in the event of a substantial accidental release:\n\nToxics\n\nThe Bayer Polyol Pilot Plant facility stores and handles only one chemical in quantities exceeding the \nEPA defined threshold quantity:  propylene oxide.  The Polyols Pilot Plant uses propylene oxide to prepare experimental samples of intermediate urethane chemicals.  Propylene oxide is used as a reaction component to make polyols which Bayer's customers use to make foam seating and mattresses, sneaker soles, coatings, adhesives, sealants, elastomers and other consumer products.\n\nFlammables\n\nThe Bayer Corporation Polyol Pilot Plant Facility does not handle or store any listed \nflammables in excess of the threshold quantity.\n\n\nManagement systems are in place to ensure that the site optimizes the amount of chemicals \non site by:\n\n* ordering chemicals in minimum quantities \n* maintaining accurate inventory records and sharing chemicals between different users in \n  order to avoid duplicate inventories\n* designing projects to minimize sample sizes\n* working with vendors to provide \"just in time\" delivery.  \n\n\n3.0 KEY OFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS SCE"

      "SummaryText": "NARIOS\n\nRMP PROGRAM LEVEL\n\nThe Bayer Corporation Newtown Square Polyol Pilot Plant Facility is classified as a Program Level 1 Process under the EPA's Risk Management Program rule 40 CFR 68.  Program Level 1 Process designation indicates that although the site handles and uses a listed chemical above the threshold quantity, the distance to endpoint for the worst case accidental release scenario is less than the distance to the nearest public receptor.  Additionally, the process has not had any accidental releases in the past five years resulting in an on-site death, injury, or property damage; or an off-site death, injury, evacuation, shelter-in-place, property damage, or environmental damage as outlined in the risk management program rule (40 CFR 68.10 (b)(1)).\n\nLyondell Chemical Company initially performed off-site consequence analyses to estimate the potential \nfor an accidental release of a regulated substance that may affect the public or the environment. The USEPA - RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance Document (OCA Guidance), dated May 24 1996, was utilized.  EPA Off-Site Consequence Analysis (OCA) Guidance Tables were used for evaluating the worst case scenarios and alternative release scenarios for flammable and toxic materials.  There have been no changes to the process that would affect the results of the analysis.  Only ownership of the process has changed.\n\nThe following is a brief summary of the worst case scenario for the only covered chemical at \nthe site, propylene oxide.  Key administrative controls and mitigation measures implemented \nto limit the exposure distances are included with the scenario description.\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario - Regulated Toxic Chemical : Propylene Oxide\n\nThe  propylene oxide worst case scenario assumes 'instantaneous' failure of a Polyol Pilot Plant propylene oxide tank.  The tank contents would be contained within a concrete dike area with a vapor release resulting from the evaporation of the liquid pool within t"

The release and corresponding distance to endpoint (derived from EPA method) remains within the site fence line and does not affect any public receptors.\n\nThe following 'Passive Mitigation' measure was used in this analysis:\n\n * Concrete Dike: the concrete, secondary containment dike contains the propylene oxide release and limits propylene oxide evaporation to the atmosphere. \n\n\nActive Mitigation:\n\nBy definition, the worst case analysis does not allow credit to be taken for active mitigation \nsystems.  However, the Polyols Pilot Plant has in place many layers of protection designed to \nprevent and if necessary, detect and respond to any spills or leaks of propylene oxide.  These \nactive controls include but are not limited to the presence of OSHA PSM certified operators \nduring all operating hours, the design and use of multiple automatic shutdown systems and the presence of automatic leak detection and fire suppression systems throughout the complex.\n \nIn addition to the active mitigation systems described above, the following are maintained through a Shared Services Agreement with Lyondell Chemical Company which also occupies the facility:\n\n * emergency responders and emergency management organization members on 24 hr. call \n * integrated process control and alarm systems to alert operating personnel in the process area\n   and central security\n * highly-trained emergency management personnel\n * fire-safety officers that are trained as Emergency Medical Technicians\n * more than adequate supply of emergency and spill response equipment\n\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario(s) - Regulated Flammable Chemicals\n\nThe Newtown Square Pilot Plant facility does not use or store any listed flammable chemicals in \nexcess of the threshold quantity.

The accident prevention programs in place \ninclude, but are not limited to:\n\n * Written Safety Policies and Procedures\n * Employee Training and Qualification Programs\n * Safety Reviews that use hazard evaluation methodologies for all new projects\n * Operational changes to existing processes that are evaluated using risk assessment and \n   hazard evaluation methods.\n * Experiments and pilot process units that are designed and built with appropriate levels of \n   safety redundancy, reflecting the hazards present.
