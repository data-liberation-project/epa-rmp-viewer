      "SummaryText": "\nThe City of Elberton is located in Elbert County which is in the northeast corner of the State of Georgia.  The City owns the Beaverdam Creek Water Treatment Plant (WTP) which is operated by the City's Public Utilities Department.  The plant's main water source is the Savannah River via an intake station on Lake Russell approximately 20 miles away.  The plant can also draw water from Beaverdam Creek which runs adjacent to the plant's property, but this source is typically used only for emergency purposes.\n\nThe WTP utilizes chlorine for disinfection of the treated water prior to entering the City's water distribution system.  The chlorination process consists of three one-ton chlorine cylinders, gas feed and water solution piping, chlorine feeders, and other process equipment.\n\nThe three one-ton cylinders represent a total of 6,000 lbs of chlorine that can be on hand at any one time at the plant.  This amount exceeds the regulatory threshold level of 2,500 lbs; thus, development and implementation of a Risk Management Plan (RMP) in accordance with 40 CFR Part 68.  The plant is not subject to OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) requirements; thus, it qualifies as a Program 2 process.\n\nA review of process history revealed that no reportable accidental releases of chlorine (i.e. - greater than 10 lbs) have occurred in the past five years at Beaverdam Creek WTP.  These data support the probability that a worst case accidental release will not occur.\n\nThe Beaverdam Creek WTP RMP provides a comprehensive approach for reducing the likelihood of chlorine releases and gives detailed information and preparations to help ensure effective and appropriate measures for responding to releases that may occur and includes the following:\n\n?   Employee training\n\n?   Chlorine system maintenance\n\n?   Chlorine system safety issues\n\n?   Standard and emergency operation procedures\n\n?   Hazard review\n\n?   Auditing and inspection procedures\n\n?   Alarm response procedures\n\nThe Beaverdam Cree"

      "SummaryText": "k WTP has an emergency response plan which has been coordinated with the City of Elberton and Elbert County fire departments.  Emergency response drills, drill evaluations and facility tours are conducted on a regular basis, at which time emergency operation and response procedures are also reviewed.\n\nElberton Public Utilities takes a proactive approach to risk management and emergency response through continuous joint training sessions between its employees and local response agencies.  These preventative measures will provide for the continuous improvement of communications and will maintain effective procedures for the safe handling of and timely emergency response to potential chlorine hazards."
