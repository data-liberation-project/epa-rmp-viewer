      "SummaryText": "At the Wastewater Treatment Plant, chlorine is handled and used in the process to treat the incoming wastewater prior to discharge from the plant.  Chlorine is considered by the Enviornmental Protection Agency to be a hazardous chemical.  The properties that make Chlorine valuable as a commodity also make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions and/or procedures to prevent exposure to Chlorine by reducing the risk to employees, to members of the community, and to public receptors.  Under the Clean Air Act Amendments, Section 112(r), all facilities that store and/or use 2,500 pounds or more of Chlorine are required to develop a Risk Management Plan.  Risk Management is the systematic identification, evaluation, and control of potential losses that may arise in the operation of a facility from future events such as fires, explosions, or accidental release of Chlorine gas.  Hazard identification and evaluation, along with associated risks, are the cornerstone of Risk Management. The benefits of Risk Management are better understanding of the process of its hazards by operators, improved maintenance and equipment availability, better emergency preparedness, and reduced costs related to accidents and injuries.  Chlorine is used at the facility as a disinfecting agent.  All the chlorine used at the facility is contained within one ton cylinders.  The chlorine cylinders are received by truck and are stored in a separate building that is easily accessible.  The chlorine is introduced into the process from the room in which it is stored.  The total inventory of chlorine normally stored is on the order of 3,000 pounds.  The average daily usage is based on the incoming wasewater flow rate and is on the order of an average of 75 pounds per day on an annual basis.  The identification and evaluation of hazard analyses required a worst-case scenario of an accidental release of chlorine.  A worst-case scenario was developed using the largest container (1 ton cylinder) ru"

The distance to the endpoint of 3 ppm, the safe concentration, is influenced by the wind velocity, humidity, solar energy, etc.  An alternate release scenario was also developed to determine the distance to the endpoint of 3 ppm.  This scenario was developed by a 3/16 inch transer line failure in which 317 pounds of chlorine were released at a rate of 10 pounds per minute.  In both cases, the worst-case and alternate case scenarios, an off-site consequence would occur.  Also, the models used for the two scenarios were OCA Guidance.  The worst-case scenario is stipulated by the Risk Management Program specifications and the alternate case scenario was selected as a result of the Process Hazard Analysis.  In the vent of an accidental release of a regulated chemical, a failure of a transfer hose seemed the most logical.  However, in both cases, the accidental release of regulated chemcials to cause an off-site consequence is remote because of strategically located detection and alarm systems.  Furthermore, there has not been an accidental release of a regulated chemical at the facility in the past five years nor has there been an accidental release of a regulated chemical that caused an off-site consequence since the start up of the present facility some twenty years ago.  Currently, the facility's general accidental release prevention program is governed and/or is operated by the rules and regulations of the Illinois Department of Labor.  The overall approach to chemical safety includes routine inspections by the Illinois Departmentof Labor and the city safety coordinator, coupled with up to date training practices and procedures appropraite to the chemicals used and the chemical process.  City management has serious commitment to safety and the implementation of safe procedures as manifested by upgrading the fac"

An emergency response program is in place, both at the facility and in coordination with the local emergency responders.  The local emergency response team is under the direction of the City Fire Chief.  The local emergency response team has had hands on experience with unsafe consequences, although not chlorine related, that nevertheless is indicative of their training and experience in alerting and notifying the public of an unsafe condition.  The facility will make available to the team all pertinent information such as the effect atmospheric conditions has on the distance to the endpoint of the chemical should there be an accidental release.  Currently, the facility is investigating an alternate non-regulated chemical to replace chlorine upon the completion of the facility retrofit along with organizational changes to enhance employee training and participation.  Each of these changes will improve safety at the facility.  The present upgrade to the Waste Treatment Plant is scheduled for completion in August of the year 2000."
