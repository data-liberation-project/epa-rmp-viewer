Due to our long history in using this chemical, many refinements, with safety in mind, have been made.  Examples of some of these are listed herein.\n\nDesign has been completed for a major upgrade to the WPCF to replace worn equipment and provide more advanced levels of treatment.  In addition the use of chlorine gas will be eliminated and replaced with an ultraviolet disinfection system.  This upgrade work is tentatively scheduled to occur over the next 1 - 3 years.\n\nSince the Water Pollution Control Facility is located within close proximity to the Town Center, Town Hall and Police Facility, the following steps have been implemented.\n\n-Chlorine dispensing equipment operates on a vacuum system, if there is a break in a supply line the system shuts down.  No chlorine gas can flow.\n-Chorine supply is stored within an isolated storage building.\n-Two individual leak detection alarms are in operation at all times.  The facility is equipped with an auxiliary power system.\n-Activation of chlorine leak detectors triggers an audible warning buzzer, and interior and exterior warning lights to alert staff.  An additional warning signal may be activated by WPCF staff to warn staff.\n-Superintendent of Sanitation is an active member of LEPC.\n-Annually:  The training program consists of WPC staff along with some members of the Fire Department and Highway Department who receive Hazardous Materials Technician level site specific certification.\n-Annually:  In house WPC staff training of chlorine includes videos, review of an emergency plan and a written competency test is given to all participants, as required, mock drills are coordinated with the Fire Department.\n-Detailed Chlorine Emergency Plan has been developed and is updated as required.\n\nBased on these factors it is not likely that a major leak would occur.
