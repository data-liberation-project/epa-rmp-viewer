      "SummaryText": "The City of Athens, Texas has developed a Risk Management Plan (RMP) to be implemented at the Water Treatment Plant (WTP) in an effort to protect human health, to protect the environment, and to comply with applicable federal regulations.  The WTP is operated by the City of Athens, and has a capacity to process 6.0 million gallons per day (MGD).  The plant's physical address is 5200 FM 2495, Athens, Texas 75751.\n\nThe RMP was developed to meet the standards published in 40 CFR Part 68.  Those regulations were promulgated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to address the accidental release prevention provision under the Clean Air Act 112,r,7.  The goal of the RMP is to focus on reducing the risk of accidental releases of certain gaseous chemicals, thus, preventing harm to employees as well as avoiding potentially catastrophic impacts to the public.\n\nPhysical access to the WTP is controlled by chain-link fencing and locked gates.  The WTP is located in a rural, semi-remote area that is located outside of the main population center of town.  The WTP utilizes anhydrous ammonia and chlorine gas within the water treatment process.  The chlorine is contained within ASME coded one-ton cylinder vessels.  All external chlorine gas transfer piping is protected with channel and angle iron supports.  The gas feed equipment is inspected daily, and all plant operators have received training on the safe handling of chlorine and ammonia gases, as well as in the use of self-contained breating apparatus units.  Each operator is required to attend training classes on how to read and interpret Material Safety Data Sheets within the first six months of their employment.  As a first responder, each operator has been trained in the proper procedures to shut down the chemical feed systems, and report to the emergency response personnel.\n\nThe Athens Fire Department is responsible for writing all emergency response procedures as well as the coordination of all emergency response acti"

      "SummaryText": "vities.  A copy of the City's Emergency Response Program has been filed with the Henderson County Emergency Response Coordinator's office.  Although a portion of the lake area population would be affected if the worst-case scenario (as described by the EPA) were to occur, the probability of such an occurrence is highly unlikely due to safeguards built into the chemical feed system, the physical properties of ammonia and chlorine gas, and the geographical location and terrain surrounding the WTP.  The release of gas amounts in quantities capable of having any offsite consequences is unlikely.  Fortunately for the City, there have not been any offsite incidents of this nature in the history of this WTP.\n\nThroughout the RMP, emergency readiness procedures and regular training schedules are emphasized.  One of the goals of implementing these procedures and schedules is to minimize the chance of a gas release occurring.  If all WTP employees practice preventative maintenance and are well trained in emergency response procedures, then if or when a release occurs, they can be successful in preventing and / or minimizing personnel injury and / or property damages.\n\nAll WTP employees are required to know the locations of emergency telephone numbers and the names of supervisors and other key personnel that should be contacted in case of an accidental gas release.  If such an emergency occurs, each WTP employee will have an assigned task to accomplish.  The risk management program enhances the safety plan already in place because it provides a clear checklist that identifies predetermined individuals and agencies that require notification and coordination.  The RMP describes which individuals will respond to the gas release to stop it, and outlines the agencies that will be responsible for evacuating the appropriate areas and then sounding the, all clear, notice once the leak is contained.  The RMP also includes procedures for the periodic review of response readiness."
