      "SummaryText": "The facility receives dehydrated natural gas by pipeline, removes condensable natural gas liquids (NGLs) and carbon dioxide, and ultimately delivers the natural gas to a transmission pipeline. The Hay Canyon Treating Facility consists of equipment and scrbbers to remove liquids from the natural gas process stream, a membrane unit to remove carbon dioxide, and a Joule-Thompson (JT) expansion unit to extract natural gas liquids (NGL). On a daily basis the facility processes approximately 1 to 2 million standard cubic feet (MMscf) of dehydrated natural gas per day and the JT expansion unit extracts approximately 100 gallons of NGL. The NGL is a flammable mixture consisting of multiple regulated flammable substances including methane, ethane, propane, butane, and pentane. The NGL is stored at ambient temperatures at approximately 23o psig.\n\nOperators of the facility have an on-going commitment to safety and accident prevention. This commitment is demonstrated by upper managements support of an active EH&S program. An employee training program is implemented as part of a comprehensive EH&S management system and the use of established design and construction standards (API, ASME,NEC).\nThe facility was constructed by skilled tradesmen who, in many cases, were required to demonstrate their skills and pass certification requirements prior to working on the project. On-going construction inspection and quality assurance procedures included x-ray examination of welds for additional quality control. Shop-fabricated equipment mounted on skid units were used where possible to minimize field construction.\n\nAt this facility, critical process parameters are monitored remotely on a 24-hour basis using supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) technologies. This approach enables operation without full-time onsite personnel.\nFor the WCS, the entire flammable material inventory is assumed to release and ignite resulting in a VCE. There are numerous safety systems and administrat"

The figure included in the consequence analysis presents the location of the subject facility and the boundaries of the WCS consequence endpoint.\n\nAs indicated, there zero public receptors within the endpoint boundary, therefore the facility is eligible for Program 1 status. As the facility is eligible for Program 1, no alternative release scenarios (ARS) were considered in the consequence analysis."
