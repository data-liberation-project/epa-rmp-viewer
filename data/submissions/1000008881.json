      "SummaryText": "A. Accidental Release Prevention: All operators are trained in safe handling of chemicals.  They receive ongoing training through the certification process required by the State of SD.\nB. Regulated Substances Handled: Chlorine.\nC. Regulated Substances Used: Chlorine.\nD. Worst Case and Alternate Release Scenarios:  The city built a new water treatment plant in 2003.  The plant came on line late in 2003.  The new plant was inspected by the consulting engineer, contractor, City Engineer and Water Treatment Superintendent.  Since the plant is located three miles west of the City of Huron, we expect no impact on the city from a chlorine leak.  There are only three residences located within one mile of the plant.  Given the relatively low volume of chlorine on hand at any on time and given that the chlorine on site is stored in ten separate 150 pound cylinders.  Due to the distances to the closest residences, we expect no off-site impact from a chlorine leak.  Anhydrous ammonia is no longer used in this plant.  Wind speed and wind direction could have some impact but not likely at the distances involved in our situation.  \nE. General Accident Prevention Program: We train our operators to prevent accidents.  Ongoing education including water treatment plant operator training is part of our accident prevention program.\nF. Five Year Accident History: We have not had a reportable accident in YEARS.\nG. Emergency Response Plan: We just prepared an Emergency Response Plan for EPA.  Copies were provided to the Beadle County Emergency Manager.  Local Law Enforcement and Fire Department members have toured the new water treatment plant so that they are prepared to respond to an incident in the facility.\nH. Planned Improvements to Improve Safety: Cameras and monitors inside and outside surveillance system in and around the new Huron Water Treatment Plant were installed in 2008.  The system is monitored at the Huron Police Department.\n\nRETURN COMMENTS TO Vince Juelfs, Water Sewer Sup"
