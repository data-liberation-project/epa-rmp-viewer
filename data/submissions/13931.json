ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES.\n\nAt Cargill Honeysuckle White, we utilize anhydrous ammonia which is considered hazardous by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).  The properties which make ammonia valuable as a refrigerant also necessitate certain safety precautions.  Cargill Honeysuckle White strives to protect all its valuable resources and assets - both personnel and property.  We live and have families in this community.  We want to prevent exposure to all our personnel as well as nearby members of our community, existing natural resources, and the surrounding environment.  It is our policy to comply with all Federal, State, and Local regulations.  Through continual, accurate training and various safety devices and procedures, we work to minimize potential releases.\n\nOur emergency response program has specific procedures for accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia as well as other emergencies.  We work in conjunction with the California Fire Department and the Local Emergency Planning Committee to prepare for necessary notification of all affected neighbors.\n\n\n2.  THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED.\n\nThe primary purpose of our facility is the processing and production of turkey and poultry products.  We utilize anhydrous ammonia as the primary means for refrigeration, cooling and freezing.  An outside company is used to fill our main receiver tanks.  Piping then carries the ammonia to the needed refrigeration, cooling or freezing units.  Access to the site is restricted to facility employees, authorized management personnel and authorized contractors.\n\nThe regulated substance used at our facility is anhydrous ammonia.  The maximum amount of ammonia stored at this facility is 44,000 pounds.  We have the capacity for 110,000 pounds but our written policy limits our storage to 40% of total capacity.\n\n\n 3.

      "SummaryText": "ASE RELEASE SCENARIO(S) AND THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO(S), INCLUDING ADMINISTRATIVE CONTROLS AND MITIGATION MEASURES TO LIMIT THE DISTANCES FOR EACH REPORTED SCENARIO.\n\nWorst Case Scenario\nThe worst case scenario would be failure of our receiver.  Cargill policy restricts the maximum capacity of this 85,000 pound tank to 40% of capacity.  The greatest amount stored in that tank is 34,627 pounds.  It is assumed that the entire contents are released as a two phase flow (gas and aerosol-ALOHA).\nDistance to endpoint: 1.9 miles\n\nAlternative Scenario\nThe alternative scenario would be the release of ammonia due to the failure of a pressure release valve.  The emergency valves shut-down release would engage and stop the flow or the monitoring system would alert personnel to manually shut the valve.  The maximum time of the release would be 57 minutes and maximum quantity released would be approximately 2,636 pounds of ammonia.  \nDistance to endpoint:  0.2 miles (or 359 yards)\n\n\n4.  FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY.\n\nTo date, this Cargill Honeysuckle White facility has had one reportable release.  It occurred November 3, 1997, due to a weld failure.  A piece of metal that was welded to the piping sheared causing a pipe rupture.   It resulted in improved piping design; the pipe was re-routed and a sonogram flex was installed.  Approximately 20,080 pounds of anhydrous ammonia was released.\n\nOff-site consequences were minimized due to several factors.  Cargill has an in-house HAZMAT team that responded to the incident.  The Springdale HAZMAT Team was notified but were not required to respond.  Also, the release occurred inside the facility and much product was neutralized using CO2.  No evacuation was required for off-site receptors (persons off the Cargill property).\n\n\n5.  THE RMP MANAGEMENT PROGRAM.\n\nThe management of the RMP program will be handled by Mr. Les Rau, Utilities Manager.  Mr. Rau will administrate in conjunction with the Cargill Honeysuckle White management and p"

THE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND THE SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS.\n\nThe Cargill Honeysuckle White facility complies with all applicable Federal, State and Local regulations including the EPAs Accidental Release Prevention Rule.  Our personnel are trained about this during our Hazard Communications Training and through access to our Written Programs.  Our Refrigeration Maintenance operators receive a combination of classroom training plus On-The-Job training (OTJ).  They are given written tests and are able to demonstrate proper job skills and knowledge. \n\n\n7.  THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM.\n\nCargill Honeysuckle White has onsite Hazardous Materials trained personnel to immediately respond to adverse conditions.  This helps minimize the potential of an off-site release. \n\nWe work very closely with the Washington County Local Emergency Planning Committee and the Springdale Fire Department on emergency preparedness.  We meet periodically with representatives of each to address any changes in the facility or any new concerns.\n\n\n8.  PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY.\n\nCurrently, Cargill Honeysuckle White trains and tests all refrigeration technicians.  Our preventative maintenance program is above standard and our total ammonia Process Safety Program is reviewed annually and updated periodically. Our program is improved continuously through annual updates of our written program and annual training of our technicians.  We also take advantage of new technologies when safer and more economical alternatives are available."
