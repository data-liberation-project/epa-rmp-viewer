The management and employees of Effingham Clay Service Company are committed to prevention of accidental releases of Anhydrous Ammonia. If any accidental release should occur. The facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, Local Emergency planning Committee or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n2.    The stationary source and the regulated substances handled. The primary activity at the facility which is located at 7471 North 300th Street is the storage and blending of fertilizer for sale to farmers. Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient. The storage and handling systems consists of one - 30,000 gallon storage tank and one AA? 12,000gallon storage tanks with loading risers, and associated plumbing and nurse tanks.\n3.    The accidental release prevention program. This facility complies withy EPAAA?s Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations. This facility has implemented the provisions of AA?Safety requirements for the storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia, K-61.1, published by the American National Standards Institute Inc.  As adopted by State regulations and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). 29 CFR 1910.111, AA?Storage and Handling of Anhydrous AmmoniaAA?. Compliance with these regulations and on-going training of our employees make up our accident release prevention program.\n4.    Five year accident history. There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years thatAA? have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage to the facilityAA? nor to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries,or environmental damage.We did have a release of 7,600 pounds of Anhydrous Ammonia which resulted in no ground cont"

The vapor cloud was a concern which prompted the Sheriffs department to evacuate eight homes, no shelter in place, and approx. $ 5,000 off site property damage of corn and soybean crops, This incident prompted us to ask the local Sheriffs department to increase patrol of our facility and for us to park our wagons together in a better lit area of our facility.\n5.    The Emergency Response Program. The facility has a written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA Standard, 29CFR 1910.38 and have provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right to know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA)\n6.    Planned changes to improve safety. Safety improvement is an on going process at the facility, Periodic evaluations are performed to access the maintenance of safe conditions, There are no specific safety recommendations for implementation at this time.\n"
