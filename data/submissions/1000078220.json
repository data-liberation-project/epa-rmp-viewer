Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\nWe at Farmward Cooperative in Renville, Minnesota  are strongly committed\r\nto employee, public, and environmental safety.  This commitment is an inherent part of our\r\ncomprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation,\r\noperating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our\r\nfacility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated\r\nsubstances.  We coordinate our response efforts with the Renville Fire Department, which provides\r\nadditional emergency response expertise.\r\n\r\n  2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\r\nFarmward Cooperative facility's primary activities include support services for crop production.  We have anhydrous\r\nammonia stored in two 26,000-gallon tanks, one 25,300-gallon tank, Thirty Four 2 each 1,000-gallon nurse tanks, nine 1,000-gallon nurse\r\ntanks, and ten 1,400-gallon nurse tanks nurse tanks at our facility in Renville, Minnesota (Figure 1). \r\nThe maximum amount stored at 85% standard maximum storage capacity is 155,480 gallons \r\n(799,447 pounds) including the capacity of the on-site nurse tanks.   The largest single storage\r\nvessel at our facility contains 113,726.6 pounds at  85% standard maximum storage capacity.\r\n\r\n  3. Worst Case Release and Alternative Release Scenarios\r\nFarmward Cooperative utilized RMP Comp for the worst case and alternate case scenarios of the required offsite\r\nconsequence analysis for our facility.  The following details these scenarios.\r\n\r\nThe worst case release scenario involves a catastrophic release of the entire contents of one of the \r\nlargest sing"

At Class F atmospheric stability, 1.5 m/s wind speed, and a rural topography, the\r\nmaximum distance to a toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L is 4.7 miles (Figure 2).

Vehicular collision (RMP Hazard Review, Section 8.4) was selected as the\r\nmost probable causal agent for an alternative release scenario.  The scenario involves the release of \r\n5,000 pounds of ammonia in a gaseous form over a period of two minutes.  Active mitigation\r\n(emergency shutoff) limited the release to two minutes.  Under neutral weather conditions, the\r\nmaximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L of ammonia is 1.2 miles (Figure 3).
