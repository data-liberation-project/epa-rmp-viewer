This information is maintained up-to-date and is available to operating personnel.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified, evaluated, and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses include: Checklists, What If/Checklists (combined),  Audits, Reactive Chemical/Process Hazard Analyses, Chemical Exposure Index, Fire & Explosion Index, and Layers of Protection Analyses. The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at regular intervals.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.  \n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Union Carbide Corporation maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nTraining\nOur facility has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Refresher training is provided on a continuing basis.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nWe carry out a highly documented Planned Preventative Maintenance Program (PPM) which provides checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls, pumps, and compressors.

Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and are trained to deal with the modification.\n\nPre-startup Reviews\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at Union Carbide. These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits\nSelf assessments and audits are conducted on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented.  Audits are carried out at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\nIncident Investigation\nUnion Carbide promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a significant release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\n\nEmployee Participation\nUnion Carbide Corporation believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.  Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views c"

As such, all Union Carbide facilities now operate under and adhere to policies and standards of The Dow Chemical Company.  The Union Carbide facilities at South Charleston, Institute, Technology Park, North Charleston Distribution Terminal,and New Yard share leveraged support and management and are collectively called West Virginia Operations.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nWest Virginia Operations is strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. If such a release should occur, our highly trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  We are also completely coordinated with the Kanawha/Putnam Emergency Planning Committee which provides additional emergency response expertise.\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe South Charleston site is a manufacturing facility that annually produces many different specialty chemicals and plastics.  Most are intermediates used in other processes or sold to customers who convert them into finished products.  Several RMP covered processes were closed just prior to the 2004 5-year RMP Update due to business reasons, and their related chemicals have been eliminated from Union Carbide\u00c2\u00bfs South Charleston facility.  Changes from the 2004 RMP submittal include the removal of: \nVME process containing Acetaldehyde, Crotonaldehyde [2-Butenal], and V"

In addition, our employees have access to all information created as part of the facility\u00c2\u00bfs implementation of the RMP rule, including information resulting from process hazard analyses in particular.\n\nContractors\nOur company hires contractors to perform specialized maintenance and construction activities.  Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is performed.  West Virginia Operations has a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related the contractor\u00c2\u00bfs work and the processes.  Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe emergency response program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.  Detailed emergency response plans are developed and coordinated with the Kanawha/Putnam Emergency Planning Committee and the community.\n\nThe South Charleston facility carries a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials.  The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas.  The plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within our processes that would require a modified emergency response.\n\nTo ensure proper functioning, quarterly emergency drills are conducted to enhance skills and tactics for responding to an accidental chemical release.  Critiques are held on drills and actual events.  Emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced.

In December 2004, the gum base business climate changed and the demand for poly vinyl acetate increased.  A business decision was made to restart the Gum Base Plant.  The Gum base Plant (GBP) did re-start in 2005 and an updated RMP Plan was submitted to EPA.  The quantities of vinyl acetate monomer stored and handled at the South Charleston Plant did not increase from those reported in the 1999 RMP Plan.\n\nUnion Carbide handles and stores threshold quantities of the following RMP-regulated toxic substances at the South Charleston Plant:\nAllyl Alcohol\t\nEthylene Oxide  \t\nPropylene Oxide\nVinyl Acetate Monomer\n\nDue to the closure of the AAA process and the VME process, Union Carbide South Charleston site no longer handles or stores threshold quantities of the RMP-regulated flammable substances.  Thus flammable worst case and flammable alternate release scenarios have been removed from the 2009 RMP Update.\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nSouth Charleston has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last 5 years.  Due to our stringent release prevention policies, there have been no accidental releases as defined by the RMP rule of regulated substances, during this period.\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nUnion Carbide\u00c2\u00bfs general accident prevention program consists of compliance with the EPA RMP rule, OSHA\u00c2\u00bfs PSM standard, and implementation of Dow's Operating Discipline Management System.
