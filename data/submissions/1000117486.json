      "SummaryText": "The City of Lincolnton, NC Water Treatment Plant uses chlorine to disinfect water to provide safe drinking water to the public.  Water is treated through screening, flocculation, and disinfection via chlorination.  In the disinfection process, a chlorinator mixes chlorine gas with water to make a chlorine slurry.  Untreated water is allowed to mix with the chlorine slurry in a contact chamber, killing pathogenic organisms that may be dangerous to public health.\n\nChlorine is a regulated toxic chemical by 40 CFR Part 68, and therefore any process utilizing over 2,500 pounds of chlorine must implement Risk Management Plan (RMP) requirements.  The Water Treatment Plant stores a maximum of four one-ton chlorine cylinders (approximately 8,000 pounds of chlorine) and is therefore subject to RMP requirements.  The storage of this amount of chlorine also makes the facility subject to OSHA's Process Safety Management requirements.\n\nThe worst case, toxic release scenario is a release of chlorine gas from a single 2,000 pound cylinder in ten minutes.  The distance to the toxic endpoint is 3.0 miles.  The alternative toxic release scenario is a slower release from a small one-inch hole twelve inches below the liquid level in the cylinder.  Again, this would involve a release of 2000 pounds, over a longer period of time.  The distance to the toxic endpoint from the alternate scenario is 0.2 miles.  These releases could affect local populations according to EPA\u0092s RMP*Comp calculations and Marplot population estimates.\n\nTo prevent toxic releases of chlorine, the facility complies with the OSHA PSM standard.  All tenets of the Process Safety Management Program are included by reference in this RMP.  Some aspects of the release prevention program include written operations procedures, inspections of equipment, employee training, automatic shutoff equipment, and a chlorine gas detection monitor and alarm. \n\nThe Water Treatment Plant has not had a chlorine release in the past five year"

In the event of a chlorine accident or release, facility personnel are trained to notify the LEPC, local emergency response, and evacuate the facility.   \n\nThe City of Lincolnton is committed to operating all of its facilities in a safe and environmentally sound manner, and compliance with these regulations serves as a testament to the City's commitment."
