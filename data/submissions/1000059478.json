      "SummaryText": "1. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policy\n\nPriority Cooling conducts inspection procedures to review refrigeration equipment prior to startup and during operations. These procedures identify potential sources of release and equipment corrections required to prevent these releases. On-site personnel and certified refrigeration contractors review the equipment as required. On-site personnel provide initial emergency response. On-site personnel will make a preliminary assessment in the event of a release and will provide first response. First response may include emergency equipment shutdown, system isolation, or controlled operation such as pump down to prevent or reduce an off-site release. No emergency operations will be performed that are beyond the capabilities of the operators or other on-site personnel. Local fire and police departments with mutual aid response will provide emergency response for a major release event. Refrigeration contractors would also be on-call to provide emergency response.Emergency response training will be conducted yearly for current employees and as required to for new employees. Records will be kept of all training performed at the site for a minimum of five (5) years.\n\n\n\n2. Description of Source and Substance Handled\n\nPriority Cooling uses anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant in their operations. The ammonia system is used for storage cooling, vacuum cooling and ice generation. See Appendix A.2 in the hardcopy RMP for the drawings showing the facility location map, site plan, and refrigeration system layouts. There are four separate refrigeration systems at the facility. Refrigeration System 1 is composed of both fixed and portable equipment. The fixed system is composed of six (6) reciprocating compressors, one (1) screw compressors, one (1) high-pressure receiver, one (1) low-pressure receiver, one (1) suction accumulator, two (2) ammonia pumps, four (4) surge drums, two (2) evaporative condensers, thirteen (13) "

One of the vacuum tubes removed from the site during off season, while the other (Priority Cooling Tube) stays on site all year. Ammonia charge of the Refrigeration System 1 is approximately 13,500 lbs.\n\nRefrigeration System 2 is composed of fixed equipment including two (2) screw compressors, one (1) high-pressure receiver, one (1) low-pressure receiver, two (2) ammonia pumps, one (1) evaporative condenser, eight (8) evaporative cooling coils, and miscellaneous equipment like oil pots and oil separators. Ammonia charge of the Refrigeration System 4 is approximately 7,500 lbs. Currently System 1 and System 2 operate as stand alone systems. Facility has one stand alone vacuum cooling system composed of one full car vacuum tube, refrigeration trailer and vacuum pump and one stand alone Ice Maker Trailer. Both of these systems are pump down to on site nurse tanks and removed from the site at the end of the season. Ammonia charge of the Vacuum Cooling System is approximately 5,000 lbs and the Ice Maker Trailer charge is 2,000 lbs. The facility operates seasonally from November through March. The facility pumps down all the ammonia in the system to the two (2) high-pressure receivers and six (6) nurse tanks located at the southeast corner of the facility during the off season.   The facility has two (2) mechanical rooms that house the refrigeration compressors. All vessels except HPR-2 and LPR-2, which are located in Engine Room 2, are located in the outdoor vessel area. Evaporative condensers EC-1 and EC-2 are located on the Engine Room 1 Roof, and EC-3 is located on the Engine Room 2 Roof. The evaporative cooling coils are located in four (4) cold rooms and two (2) shipping docks. All compressors have safety switches that would shut down the compressors upon detection of unsafe operating conditions. All pressure vessels and compr"

      "SummaryText": "essors are protected against high-pressure situations by safety relief valves. There are ammonia detectors in the cold rooms for alarming. Facility mechanics are experienced with ammonia refrigeration, conduct daily walks and monitor the refrigeration system. The refrigeration systems at the facility were constructed as per applicable codes and industry standards at the time of construction. The total ammonia charge of the refrigeration systems at the facility is approximately 28,000 lb. Refrigeration drawings showing the equipment locations and the piping layout are located in Appendix A.2-System Drawings of the hardcopy RMP. A list of refrigeration equipment used at this facility can be found in Appendix F of the hardcopy RMP. International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) \"Ammonia Refrigeration Safety Inspection Checklists,\" located in Appendix A.1 of the hardcopy RMP, describe equipment details. The refrigeration systems at this facility are single-stage vapor compression cycles. Anhydrous ammonia (NH3) is a gas in its natural state and is extremely irritating to mucous membranes and lung tissue. The gas is pungent and may be suffocating as shortness of breath and labored breathing can develop if inhaled. Prolonged inhalation of high concentrations may cause bronchitis and/ or pneumonia, with some residual reduction in pulmonary functions. Repeated or prolonged contact of high concentrations of ammonia to the skin can cause frostbite, redness, pain and serious skin burn. See Appendix A.4 of the hardcopy RMP for Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) for anhydrous ammonia.\n\n\n\n3. Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nPriority Cooling maintains a release prevention program to eliminate or minimize releases. The program includes regular inspections, monitoring equipment and logging conditions, scheduled maintenance, and operator training. There is a program to analyze releases for ways to prevent a similar future release, see Appendix J-Incident Investigation."

      "SummaryText": " The ammonia refrigeration system has specific safety procedures to prevent a release. Operators and mechanics are trained for safe operation and maintenance of the refrigeration system. They are also trained in emergency response procedures in the event of an ammonia release. Ammonia detectors are installed in all refrigerated rooms. Personnel will automatically be notified if any detector exceeds its set point. Monitoring is done 24 hours per day. All of the relief valves at the facility and the vacuum cooling systems are tied into an ammonia diffusion tank to prevent high-pressure releases to ambient.\n\n\n\n4. Five-Year Accident History\n\nAccording to Priority Cooling personnel, in the past five years there have been no releases of anhydrous ammonia resulting in reportable quantities or injuries.\n\n\n\n5. Emergency Response Program\n\nIn event of a release, the Safety Coordinator is responsible in contacting emergency responders and will be contacting emergency response agencies, schools, daycare centers, and acute care facilities that may be affected by the release. The Safety Coordinator will also be responsible for evacuation of employees if necessary and for coordination with community emergency responders if off-site evacuations are required. A description of the emergency response plan is included in Appendix N of the hardcopy RMP onsite.\n\n\n\n6. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nRecommended corrective actions to mitigate the potential for an accidental ammonia release are proposed on the tables located in Section VIII of the RMP onsite. The table items are a result from recommendations made during the Process Hazard Analysis, a Code Compliance Review, and a Safety Inspection performed by a qualified person. Some corrective items in the recommendation table originate from multiple codes but are listed only once. Specific facility areas and systems categorize recommendations resulting from the Safety Inspection; some of which may repeat general Process Hazard Analysis"
