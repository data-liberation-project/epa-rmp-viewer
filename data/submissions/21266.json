As a precaution approximately 1000 people were sheltered in place.\n\n\u00b7 March 10, 1995 - Accidental release of hydrogen chloride, vinyl chloride monomer, and ethylene dichloride. One person on-site was treated and released and on-site damage was minimal. No injuries, exposures to toxic chemicals, property damage or environmental damage occurred off-site as a result of this release. As a precaution,\napproximately 5000 people were sheltered in place as a result of this release. \n\n\u00b7 August 10,1996 - Accidental release of hydrogen chloride and chlorine. Three employees were treated for exposure to hydrogen chloride and chlorine before returning to work. No exposure to toxic chemicals, injuries, property damage or environmental damage occurred off-site as a result of the release. Because the release was easily contained, no one was sheltered in place.\n\n\u00b7 June 5, 1997 - Accidental release of hydrogen chloride.

This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, training of highly qualified personnel, and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of our facility process. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent chemical releases. However, if a release does occur, our personnel are trained and equipped to quickly respond to, control/contain, and mitigate the release.\n\nGeorgia Gulf Lake Charles, LLC is committed to Responsible Care\u00ae, a voluntary initiative for the safe management of chemicals. Georgia Gulf Lake Charles, LLC follows the Responsible Care\u00ae, Code of Management Practice, which is integral to the development and implementation of our Environmental and Health and Safety policies. Georgia Gulf Lake Charles, LLC has developed and implemented Community Awareness and Emergency Response Procedures to assist in emergency preparedness and foster community right to know.  This is further demonstrated by Georgia Gulf Lake Charles, LLC's involvement in outside agencies and willingness to provide an open line of communication with the community.\n\nGeorgia Gulf Lake Charles, LLC is located in Westlake, Louisiana.  The facility came into existence on November 13, 1999 as part of the Vinyls acquisition by Georgia Gulf Corporation and Affiliates from CONDEA Vista Company.

Other regulated chemicals used in our process, which are in quantities below the threshold quantity include chlorine, ethylene, and sulfur dioxide.\n   \nThe worse case scenario (WCS) associated with a toxic substance handled at the Georgia Gulf Lake Charles, LLC involves a catastrophic failure of the hydrogen chloride storage vessel resulting in a release of 721,000 pounds of anhydrous hydrogen chloride.  Although we have numerous controls to prevent such a release and to manage the consequences, no credit for administrative controls or passive mitigation measures was taken into account when evaluating this scenario. Look-up tables published by USEPA were used to determine the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint. Based on these Look-up tables, maximum distance to the scenario endpoint of .03 mg/L (approximately 20 ppm) for the worse case scenario is 25 miles.\n\nThe alternative case scenario (ARS) for hydrogen chloride is the release of hydrogen chloride vapor over a 15-minute period from a one-inch hole in a process line that contains hydrogen chloride. The 15-minute release duration is the maximum time necessary to block off and transfer to storage the hydrogen chloride contained in the process line thus stopping the release. No other mitigation measures other than to empty the process line were taken into account when evaluating this scenario. A dense phase dispersion model \"PHAST\" developed by Det Norse Veritas (DNV) was used to determine the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.03 mg/L (approximately 20 ppm) to be 1.02 miles.\n\nThe WCS (worse case scenario) associated with the release of a flammable substance involves the release of largest inventory, in a single vessel of vinyl chloride monomer (VCM).

Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n \nThe facility primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations. HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques. The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. The team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary. \n\nThe PHA team findings are made available to those individuals associated with the \nprocess unit for comments and forwarded to local and corporate management for resolution. Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative ranking assigned by the PHA team. This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest rank receive immediate attention. All\napproved mitigation options being implemented in response to PHA findings are tracked through completion. The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nOperators, supervisors, and plant engineers work together to develop and maintain operating procedures. These procedures define how tasks related to process operations are safely performed. At Georgia Gulf Lake Charles, LLC, operating procedures: (1) are used to train employees and (2) serve as refe"
