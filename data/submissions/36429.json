It is the policy of this facility to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws.  Management, and employees are committed to the prevention of accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, county LEPC, EPA, and any other applicable authorities to mitigate the release and minimize its impact on people and the environment.\n\n\n\nA description of the facility and the regulated substance handled:  The primary activity at this facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, filled into nurse tanks, and sold to the customer for direct application as a crop production nutrient. The maximum quantity stored is 140,196 pounds in 1/30,000 gallon storage tank.   \n\n\n\nThe worst-case release scenario:  The worst-case scenario is the release of the total contents of the largest storage tank or rail tank car released as a ga"

The maximum quantity released would be 140,196 pounds, which is the volume of the largest storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards.

There are 200 private homes and a total population of 600 people within the distance to the endpoint.\n\n\n\nThe alternative release scenario:  The alternative release scenario, based on the most likely potential incident, is a release from a transfer hose failure (1.5\" hose).  Based on The Fertilizer Institute Alternate-Case Releases of Anhydrous Ammonia Table 1, assuming that the release is stopped by active/passive mitigation after 2 minutes and a wind speed of 3 meters/second, the following is a summary of results:\n\n\n\n    Release rate                3,563 lb/min \n\n    Maximum quantity released         7,127 lb \n\n    Distance to 200 ppm endpoint        0.46 miles\n\n\n\nThere are 20 private homes and a total population of 60 people within the distance to the endpoint.\n\n\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps:  This facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by The American National Standards Institute (ANSI), and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\".
