      "SummaryText": "This Risk Management Plan (RMP) covers the Jim Bridger Power Plant near Point of Rocks, Wyoming.  The power plant utilizes a Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) system which controls nitrogen oxide (NOX) emissions.  The SCR uses anhydrous ammonia (NH3).  Commercial SCR systems using anhydrous ammonia are found on large utility boilers, industrial boilers and municipal solid waste boilers. The SCR system uses anhydrous ammonia, with the aid of a catalyst, to convert NOX into nitrogen (N2) and water (H2O).  The SCR requires an ammonia storage system.  The ammonia storage system became operational in the fourth quarter of 2015.\r\n  \r\nThe amount of anhydrous ammonia stored in the system is expected to exceed the 10,000 pound threshold set forth by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) for filing an RMP.  Because anhydrous ammonia is listed by both the US Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and the EPA as a hazardous chemical, our accidental release prevention program is designed to comply with the Process Safety Management (PSM) and RMP regulations of those two agencies. These regulations are designed to prevent the accidental release of ammonia and to minimize the negative consequences should an accidental released of ammonia occur.\r\n\r\nTo ensure safe operation of the ammonia storage system, the Jim Bridger Plant is implementing a PSM program that looks continuously at possible changes to the ammonia storage system that would improve safety.  The PSM program also includes a comprehensive analysis of the ammonia storage system and operator training that is designed to ensure safe operation of the storage system.  Part of the training also includes procedures for notifying local emergency responders in the unlikely event of an emergency.\r\n\r\nThe RMP submittal requires a five-year accident history of the ammonia storage system at the power plant.   So far, there is no accident history to report for this Rev. 6 RMP submittal."
