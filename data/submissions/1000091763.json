The facility employs two independent refrigeration systems that contain anhydrous ammonia each, as a refrigerant within a closed system.  The two systems' combined inventory, exceeds 10,000 pounds and the systems are being considered as 'co-located' processes for the purposes of the Risk Management Plan regulation.  The systems, consisting of piping, valves, and equipment, cycles ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration for dock operations and cooler/freezer storage.  Typical operating conditions range from approximately 8Hg on the low pressure side of the systems to 165 psig on the high side. \r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS \r\n\r\nThe Arctic Cold Storage ammonia refrigeration systems have many safety features.  Much of the safety of the systems is inherent in the policies and procedures that govern the operation of the system.  For example, the Arctic cold Storage facility operates in accordance with OSHA's Process Safety Management regulation.  Refrigeration contractors, experts in the ammonia refrigeration industry, are contracted at the facility to maintain the system and perform any repairs.\r\n\r\nThe Arctic Cold Storage facility including each ammonia system was designed and constructed in accordance with the Minnesota Mechanical Code which specifically outlines requirements for the safe operation of the ammonia refrigeration system.  These safety features include ammonia sensor in the engine rooms as well as sensors in the cold storage areas, and automatic shut down system  that prevent equipment damage and ammonia releases.  In addition, the majority of the ammonia inventory is maintained inside the machine room and just outside of the ma"

The facility maintains a Safety Committee whose members are the designated emergency commanders for the facility.   Arctic Cold Storage has an Emergency Action Plan (Plan) in effect, which is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of the PSM/RMP document maintained at the facility.  The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year.  This Plan will be reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations, as well as to incorporate any facility changes.\r\n\r\nArctic Cold Storage has coordinated emergency response efforts with the local fire department and with the contracted refrigeration operation and maintenance firm.  In the case of an ammonia-related emergency, it is the policy of Arctic Cold Storage to evacuate and to allow the fire department/HazMat Team to respond to the emergency.  The refrigeration contractor will be available for guidance and assistance.\r\n\r\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE \r\n\r\nArctic Cold Storage is located at 4139 Roosevelt Road, in St. Cloud, Minnesota.
