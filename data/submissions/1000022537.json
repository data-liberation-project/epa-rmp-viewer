Texas\nEmergency Planning and Response\n\nPURPOSE\n\nTo describe the plant Emergency Alarm and Communication Systems and to provide guidance on how to use them.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nA basic emergency control function is initiating, maintaining, and controlling the communication process.  Communication provides the connection between the Control room and Supervisor in charge with other plant personnel, the community, governmental agencies, and mutual aid.\n\nCommunication problems are the most common operational breakdown during emergency operations, affecting the plantsA? ability to start, coordinate, and complete effective operations.  Decision-making, assignments, coordination, revision, and the control of overall strategy and management of the action plant hinge on good communications.\n\nCOMMUNICATION DESCRIPTION\n  \n1. The two-way portable radios will be used to warn DB Western personnel through out the plant.\nThe plant utilizes Motorola HT 750 series portable radios.\n\nThe Supervisor will state the Emergency across both channels and give instruction of where to meet.\n\n\n2. The yellow phone will be used to notify all surrounding    plants.\n\nFour different horn signals are used to alert plant personnel of an Emergency situation.\n\n1. Fire Alarm  - Steady Alert Tone\n2. Fume Release Alarm  -  Whoop\n3. Disaster Alarm  -  Hi Low (European Police)\n4. All Clear Horn  -  Air Horn  (Fog Horn)\n\nTo use the Emergency Yellow Phone\n\n5. Pick up the Yellow Phone\n6. Press and hold handset button for 2 seconds before speaking\n7. State your name and location \n8. Request a fume release alarm \n\nGuidelines for your message\n\n9. State your name and location\n10. Give the location of the emergency\n11. Give any other relevant information\n12. Speak slowly and clearly\n13. Be brief \n14. Release the handset button when not talking \n\n\nRunners\n\na. Runners are to be used \n\nWhen other means of communication have failed.\nWhen it is not practical to use other means of communication.\nWhen the communica"

Fire Response\n              \na. In case of a fire, the first response is to activate the Emergency Methanol Shutdown button on the control panel.  This will shut the control valve on the Methanol supply line.\nb. Push the button in the Red Fire Box outside of the office.\nc. If it is a small containable fire use fire extinguisher to put out the fire.  Extinguisher spray must be aimed at the base of the fire.  If it is larger than what can be put out by an extinguisher call 911 for the La Porte Fire Department.\nd. The fire monitor will be started if there is reason to believe that the fire can be suppressed with the fire water system.\ne. Evacuate all operations personnel to either Checkpoint 1 (East Automatic gate) or Check point 2 (West gate).  Always move downward and crossway from the smoke.\nf. Take role call.  Make sure company personnel and contractors are accounted for.\ng. The Supervisor will direct the Fire Department to the location of the fire and show the MSDSA?s on the perceived items which are burning.  The Supervisor must also describe any potential risks that might occur when fighting the fire.\n\n3. Fume Releases\n \na. In case of a fume release, the first thing that must be done is to identify the source of the fume release.  This must be done under strict directions of the supervisor.  If the Supervisor is not present call either Mike Bocksnick at (832)723-8639, Steve Beetham at (281)352-7483, or Dennis Beetham at (541)416-0834.  If you cannot reach any of these people, hit the Emergency Methanol Shutdown button on the control board and call 911.  Go to step d.\nb. Shut off all air conditioning in the control room and all offices.  No one will leave the control room before there is authorization "

Notify DuPont via the Yellow phone if there is a minor release.\nd. If there is a small containable fume release, the Supervisor will put on the proper breathing apparatus and identify the source of the leak.  If it can be contained do so quickly.  If it cannot be contained operations will go through a controlled plant shutdown and the leak will be fixed before resuming normal operations.\ne. Evacuate all operations and personnel to either checkpoint 1 (east automatic gate) or checkpoint 2 (west gate) depending on which way the wind direction sock on Prax Airs cooling tower is blowing.  Always move downward and crossway from the direction of the sock.\nf. Take role call.  Make sure all company personnel and contractors are accounted for.\ng. The supervisor will direct the Fire Department to the location and show the MSDSA?s on perceived items in which fumes are being released.  \nh. The Supervisor must also describe any potential risks that might occur when containing the fume release."
