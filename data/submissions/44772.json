      "SummaryText": "Michigan Turkey Producers is committed to safety regarding its anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system. Michigan Turkey associates are committed to work together in planning, developing, and implementing safe and healthy work methods, practices and programs.  Michigan Turkey Producers is a turkey processing plant. The facility employes roughly 65 full-time employees. The facility is  located on 1100 Hall St SW in Wyoming, Michigan. The mechanical refrigeration system at Michigan Turkey is a process for exchanging heat to affect a desired temperature in an environment and/or product. The technology involves the transfer of the refrigerant through its liquid and vapor states by mechanical compression, condensation, and evaporation. There is approximately 20,375 lbs. of anhydrous ammonia on site at Michigan Turkey. Michigan Turkey falls under OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation 29 CFR 1910.119. This facility also falls under the EPS's Risk Management Planning (RMP) regulation 40 CFR Part 68 due to the anhydrous ammonia.  In maintaining a safe facility as well as complying with these regulations, Michigan Turkey has developed certain practices to promote the safe operation of the anhydrous ammonia system. These practices range from technological safeguards, proper maintenance of equipment and training of affected employees. The emergency response for Michigan Turkey is coordinated through the Kent County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC). The LEPC has developed the Off-Site Spill Response Plan for the facility. The facility is equiped with alert and notification systems monitored via an outside central station. The employees are trained in evacuating the facility. There is no HAZMAT team in place at the facility, as the local emergency response authorities will handle major releases. Michigan Turkey is committed to the continual improvement of our safety and health performance and will authorize the actions necessary to achieve this objective theref"
