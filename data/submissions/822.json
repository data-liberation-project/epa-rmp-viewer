THE ACTIVITY OF THIS PLANT INVOLVES THE STORAGE AND TRANSFER OF THE PRODUCT.\nTHE MAXIMUM QUANTITY STORED IS 149000 LBS. WORSE CASE RELEASE SCENERIO WOULD BE A RELEASE AS A GAS OVER TEN MINUTES. THE POTENTIAL QUANTITY RELEASE COULD BE 149000 LBS., WHICH IS THE VOLUME OF THE STORAGE AT 85% - AS LIMITED BY DESIGN STANDARDS AS WELL AS COMPANY POLICY. DISTANCE TO END POINT IS 2.59 MILES.\nTHE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENERIO BASED ON OUR HISTORY AND INDUSTRY INFORMATION COULD BE A RELEASE FROM A BREAK IN A PIPE OR TRANSFER HOSE. THE DISTANCE TO END POINT FOR THIS SCENERIO IS .83 MILES.\nTHERE HAVE BEEN NO ACCIDENTAL RELEASES OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA IN THE PAST FIVE YEARS RESULTING IN INJURY, DEATH, EVACUATION, SHELTERING IN PLACE, OR OTHER EMERGENCY PROCEDURES.\n\nOUR EMERGENCY PLAN IS DESIGNED TO MINIMIZE RISKS TO EMPLOYEES, THE SURROUNDING PUBLIC, AND EMERGENCY RESPONDERS. OUR COMPANY WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH ALL INVOLVED IN THIS INDUSTRY TO IMPROVE AND IMPLEMENT ANY NEW PROCEDURES AND ADVICE FOR THE BETTERMENT AND INTEREST OF SAFETY."
