Evraz Stratcor's Process Safety Management (PSM) program follows the requirements of the OSHA standards (29 CFR 1910.119) that are copied in Part 68. The Evraz Stratcor PSM program for AA, Cl2, and TiCl4 serve to address the RMP requirements for those covered processes. Although the PSM program has been developed to follow the guidelines of the OSHA PSM standard, it should be noted that the Evraz Stratcor facility is under the jurisdiction of the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA). The requirements for our prevention program take a proactive approach to preventing accidental releases of regulated substances that pose a danger to human health and the environment. This prevention program is a vital part of our everyday operations as safety is our chief priority. Our program employs high standards and includes the following steps and programs that lead to successful accident prevention: \r\n\r\n3.1  Process Safety Information\r\n\r\n\tProcess safety includes information pertaining to the hazards of the substances in the process, information pertaining to the technology of the process, and information pertaining to the equipment in the process.

The chemical hazards of the process chemicals used at the Evraz Stratcor facility are covered by the Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) and the Hazard Communication (HAZCOM) program required by MSHA in 30 CFR Part 47.   \r\n\tInformation pertaining to the technology of the process and the equipment in the process is compiled in the PSM program. \r\n\r\n3.2  Process Hazard Analysis\r\n\r\n\tEvraz Stratcor's current PSM program includes Process Hazard Analyses (PHA) performed by a team with expertise in engineering and process operations for its covered substances that follow hazard and operability study (HAZOP) methodologies. Recommendations resulting from the PHA are promptly addressed following the completion of the review. The resolutions to the recommendations are performed and documented as soon as possible and a schedule of the completion of all resolutions to recommendations resulting from the PHA is developed and kept on-file in the PSM program with the PHA. \r\n\r\n3.3  Operating Procedures\r\n\r\n\tThe PSM program has developed and documented procedures for each operating phase of Evraz Stratcor's processes covered by the PSM program. Standard operating procedures (SOPs) for each department are kept on the server for electronic access. These SOPs are also readily accessible to employees. The SOPs are revised as needed as part of their ongoing review and reflect the most current operating practices of the covered processes. Included in the SOPs are practices for such operations as lockout/tagout, confined space entry, hot work permits, and safe work permits. The SOPs address elements for each operating phase, operating limits, safety and health considerations, and safety systems and their functions. \r\n\r\n3.4  Training\r\n\r\n\tOperating and maintenance personnel at Evraz Stratcor, as well as any contract employees, as required by the regulation, must be trained in an overview of the process and in the d"

(Evraz Stratcor), we use anhydrous ammonia (AA) as a reactant in the recovery of vanadium products and chlorine (Cl2) and titanium tetrachloride (TiCl4) in the halide manufacturing process. The AA, Cl2, and TiCl4 onsite are regulated substances under the Accidental Release Program regulations, which govern the Risk Management Plan (RMP).  Certain safety precautions must be observed when handling these chemicals to prevent unnecessary human exposure and to reduce the threat to employees and nearby members of the community.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and State rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle these chemicals, training of our personnel who operate the processes, and the safety devices inherent in the design of their storage vessels. \r\n\tOur emergency response program presents a logical coordinated course of action to be followed in case of an emergency.  The program utilizes information from the Emergency Response Guidebook by the Department of Transportation.  The emergency response plan includes procedures for notification of the local fire authority and notification of any potentially affected neighbors.\r\n\r\n2.0  Evraz Stratcor and Regulated Substances\r\n\r\n\tOur Hot Springs facility includes a vanadium recovery process and a halides manufacturing process. Anhydrous ammonia is used to aid in the recovery of the vanadium product in a crystallization circuit. Chlorine is introduced into the vanadium halide production process as a reactant. Titanium tetrachloride is blended with vanadium oxytrichloride to form vanadium-titanium mixtures.  The AA, Cl2, and TiCI4 are the only chemicals that EPA has identified on the RMP Rule Toxic Substances list and that are stored above threshold quantities. Evraz Stratcor has no flammable substances onsite regulated by Part 68.  Storage conditions for the toxic chemicals regulated under t"
