(Evraz Stratcor), we use anhydrous ammonia (AA) as a reactant in the recovery of vanadium products and chlorine (Cl2) and titanium tetrachloride (TiCl4) in the halide manufacturing process. The AA, Cl2, and TiCl4 onsite are regulated substances under the Accidental Release Program regulations, which govern the Risk Management Plan (RMP).  Certain safety precautions must be observed when handling these chemicals to prevent unnecessary human exposure and to reduce the threat to employees and nearby members of the community.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and State rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle these chemicals, training of our personnel who operate the processes, and the safety devices inherent in the design of their storage vessels. \n\n    Our emergency response program presents a logical coordinated course of action to be followed in case of an emergency.  The program utilizes information from the Emergency Response Guidebook by the Department of Transportation.  The emergency response plan includes procedures for notification of the local fire authority and notification of any potentially affected neighbors.\n\n\n\n2.0  Evraz Stratcor and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\n    Our Hot Springs facility includes a vanadium recovery process and a halides manufacturing process. Anhydrous ammonia is used to aid in the recovery of the vanadium product in a crystallization circuit. Chlorine is introduced into the vanadium halide production process as a reactant. Titanium tetrachloride is blended with vanadium oxytrichloride to form vanadium-titanium mixtures.  The AA, Cl2, and TiCI4 are the only chemicals that EPA has identified on the RMP Rule Toxic Substances list and that are stored above threshold quantities.

Evraz Stratcor's Process Safety Management (PSM) program follows the requirements of the OSHA standards (29 CFR 1910.119) that are copied in Part 68. The Evraz Stratcor PSM program for AA, Cl2, and TiCl4 serve to address the RMP requirements for those covered processes. Although the PSM program has been developed to follow the guidelines of the OSHA PSM standard, it should be noted that the Evraz Stratcor facility is under the jurisdiction of the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA). The requirements for our prevention program take a proactive approach to preventing accidental releases of regulated substances that pose a danger to human health and the environment. This prevention program is a vital part of our everyday operations as safety is our chief priority. Our program employs high standards and includes the following steps and programs that lead to successful accident prevention: \n\n\n\n3.1  Process Safety Information\n\n\n\n    Process safety includes information pertaining to the hazards of the substances in the process, information pertaining to the technology of the process, and information pertaining to the equipment in the process.

Recommendations resulting from the PHA are promptly addressed following the completion of the review. The resolutions to the recommendations are performed and documented as soon as possible and a schedule of the completion of all resolutions to recommendations resulting from the PHA is developed and kept on-file in the PSM program with the PHA. \n\n\n\n3.3  Operating Procedures\n\n\n\n    The PSM program has developed and documented procedures for each operating phase of Evraz Stratcor's processes covered by the PSM program.

The SOPs are revised as needed as part of their ongoing review and reflect the most current operating practices of the covered processes.

Solvent Extraction Circuit PHA (December 2011)\n\n\n\n    Upon completion of the PHAs (initial and updates), a report of findings or \"punch list\" is developed and action items are ranked in order of greatest risk.  Items with the greatest risk will be attended to first. However, if easy, quick, inexpensive, or procedural fixes can be accomplished without taking resources away from the high risk items, those easy fixes are completed and, with proper documentation, removed from the list.  Documentation of this punch list, progress toward completion of those items, and PHA documentation are maintained in the Safety Office. Currently, Evraz Stratcor utilizes an electronic work order system to schedule and track completion of each item.  The Maintenance Supervisor is responsible for making sure each item is completed and checked off.\n\n\n\n"
