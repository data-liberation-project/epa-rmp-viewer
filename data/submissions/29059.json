Isoprene is used to produce specialty anhydrides.\n\n2.3  Alternative Release Scenarios - Regulated Toxic Substance\n\nWe have one toxic substance, Acrylonitrile (AN).  The alternative release scenario is the leakage from pipes for 10 minutes at 20 pounds per minute in the Tank Farm.  It releases 200 pounds of AN to the concrete dike area.  This area is equipped with deluge system and fire fighting equipment.  The release rate of AN to air is 6.32 pounds per minute, and the toxic endpoint is 0.076 mg/l.  The estimated affected endpoint is less than 0.1 mile according to the EPA's RMPComp.   The potential public receptor is the employees of Quality Carriers.\n\n2.4  Alternative Release Scenarios - Regulated Flammable Substances\n\nTwo alternative release scenarios from two regulated flammable substances are analyzed because they affect different public receptors.  \n\nOne scenario is the overfill of the DMA storage tank for 10 minutes at 65 gallons per minute in the Tank Farm.  It releases 5420 pounds of DMA to the concrete dike area.  This area is equipped with deluge system and fire fighting equipment.  Assuming that the released DMA is ignited and has a flash fire, the estimated affected endpoint is 0.06 miles according to the EPA's lookup tables.   The potential public receptor is the employees of Reagens plant.  \n\nThe other scenario is the overfill of the Isoprene storage tank for 10 minutes at 220 gallons per minutes in the Tank Farm.   It releases 12,500 pounds of Isoprene to the concrete dike area.  This area is equipped with deluge system and fire fighting equipment.

Our facility and our employees are committed to safe work procedures defined by the prevention program.     We have specific accountabilities and controls to ensure that we are meeting our own high standards for accident prevention.\n\n\n4.0   FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nWe have not had any accidental releases from covered processes that have resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage during the past five years.\n\n\n5.0   EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nOur program covers various federal, state, and local regulatory requirements for emergency response planning.  We have procedures and training for announcing the accidental releases, contacting the emergency responders, notifying the regulatory agencies and communities, maintaining the emergency response equipment, and handling the emergency incidents.  We have a trained emergency response team on site, and if needed, we coordinate with Channel Industries Mutual Aid (CIMA) for handling larger emergency incidents.  Our emergency response team has training in fire school, rescue training, HAZMAT training, and has conducted joint training and drills with CIMA.  \n\n\n6.0   PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThe Safety Awareness Program is designed and implemented by the plant safety, health and environment committee  -\nThis program includes safety slogan"

This is the largest storage tank of DMA, and the release will be contained in a concrete containment area.   This area is equipped with deluge system and fire fighting equipment.
