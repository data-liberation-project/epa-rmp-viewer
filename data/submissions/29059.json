We use a combination of release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public as well as to protect the environment.  A brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented include:\n\n(1)  A description of our facility and use of substances regulated by EPA's RMP regulation\n(2)  A summary of results from our assessment of the potential offsite consequences from accidental chemical  releases\n(3)  An overview of our accidental release prevention programs\n(4)  A five-year accident history for accidental releases of chemicals regulated by EPA's RMP rule\n(5)  An overview of our emergency response program\n(6)  An overview of planned changes to improve safety\n\n\n1.0   STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThis facility produces organic chemicals as intermediates for our customers to make dyes, pharmaceutical products, resins, and insecticides.  The regulated substances listed in EPA's RMP rule in our facility are Dimethylamine, Isoprene,  1,3-Pentadiene, Acrylonitrile and 1,3-Butadiene.  They are all flammable substances except Acrylonitrile, which is toxic substance.\n\n\n2.0   RELEASE SCENARIOS AND OFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSES\n\nRMP rule requires that we provide information concerning the worst-case release scenario(s) and alternative release scenario(s) for our facility.  The following are brief summaries of these scenarios, including information about the key administrative control and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario:\n\n2.1  Worst-case Release  Scenarios - Regulated Toxic Substance\n\nWe have one toxic substance, Acrylonitrile.  The worse-case scenario is the rupture of the Acrylonitrile (AN) storage tank with a maximum inventory of 67,"

The toxic endpoint of AN is 0.076 mg/l, and the estimated affected distance to toxic endpoint is 1.1 miles according to the EPA's RMPComp.   The potential public receptors include employees of facilities at Reagens, Celanese, Intergulf, Nisseki, Hoyer, TWT, CR&L, Engelhard, Scott Specialty Gases, Diexie Chemical, Dianal America, Haldor Topsoe, Bealine Service, Aeriform, Quality Carriers,  E. I. DuPont, and Nova Molecular Technology.  AN is used to produce Cyanocyclohexene in the Anhydrides unit.  \n\n2.2  Worst-case Release  Scenarios - Regulated Flammable Substance\n\nTwo worst-case release scenarios from two regulated flammable substances are analyzed because they affect different public receptors.  \n\nOne scenario is the rupture of the Dimethylamine (DMA) storage tank with a maximum capacity of 75,100 pounds in the Tank Farm.  This is the largest storage tank of DMA, and the release will be contained in a concrete containment area.   This area is equipped with deluge system and fire fighting equipment.  Assuming the released DMA has a vapor cloud explosion, the estimated affected endpoint is 0.31 miles according to the EPA's lookup tables.   The potential public receptors include employees of plants Reagens, Dianal America, and E. I. DuPont.  DMA is used to produce Dimethylacetoacetate (DMAA) in the Arylides unit.  \n\nThe other scenario is the rupture of the Isoprene storage tank with a maximum capacity of 158,000 pounds in the Tank Farm.  This is the largest storage tank of Isoprene, and the release will be contained in a concrete containment area.  This area is equipped with deluge system and fire fighting equipment.

Isoprene is used to produce specialty anhydrides.\n\n2.3  Alternative Release Scenarios - Regulated Toxic Substance\n\nWe have one toxic substance, Acrylonitrile (AN).  The alternative release scenario is the leakage from pipes for 10 minutes at 20 pounds per minute in the Tank Farm.  It releases 200 pounds of AN to the concrete dike area.  This area is equipped with deluge system and fire fighting equipment.  The release rate of AN to air is 6.32 pounds per minute, and the toxic endpoint is 0.076 mg/l.  The estimated affected endpoint is less than 0.1 mile according to the EPA's RMPComp.   The potential public receptor is the employees of Quality Carriers.\n\n2.4  Alternative Release Scenarios - Regulated Flammable Substances\n\nTwo alternative release scenarios from two regulated flammable substances are analyzed because they affect different public receptors.  \n\nOne scenario is the overfill of the DMA storage tank for 10 minutes at 65 gallons per minute in the Tank Farm.  It releases 5420 pounds of DMA to the concrete dike area.  This area is equipped with deluge system and fire fighting equipment.  Assuming that the released DMA is ignited and has a flash fire, the estimated affected endpoint is 0.06 miles according to the EPA's lookup tables.   The potential public receptor is the employees of Reagens plant.  \n\nThe other scenario is the overfill of the Isoprene storage tank for 10 minutes at 220 gallons per minutes in the Tank Farm.   It releases 12,500 pounds of Isoprene to the concrete dike area.  This area is equipped with deluge system and fire fighting equipment.

We have procedures and training for announcing the accidental releases, contacting the emergency responders, notifying the regulatory agencies and communities, maintaining the emergency response equipment, and handling the emergency incidents.  We have a trained emergency response team on site, and if needed, we coordinate with Channel Industries Mutual Aid (CIMA) for handling larger emergency incidents.  Our emergency response team has training in fire school, rescue training, HAZMAT training, and has conducted joint training and drills with CIMA.  \n\n\n6.0   PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThe Safety Awareness Program is designed and implemented by the plant safety, health and environment committee  -\nThis program includes safety slogan "
