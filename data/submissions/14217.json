              "Description": "7.0 Prevention Program\n\nI. History\n\nIn 1940 the American Window Glass Company concluded that lehr rolls exposed to sulfur were less likely to cause roll scar.  Experimentation with the different methods of depositing sulfur on rollers used to move glass were tried until 1949 when studies showed staining and etching that resulted.\n\nThrough further experimentation the correct temperature and amount needed to coat the rollers correctly was determined.  Throughout the glass industry, it is used to impart fracture, weathering and abrasion resistance, to render glass containers resistant to alkaline contents and as an anti-seize agent.\n\n\n\nII. Transportation\n\nIn the United States, deferral authority under rules promulgated by the Department of Transportation (DOT) regulates the transportation of sulfur dioxide by rail, highway, air and water.  It must be shipped only in containers, which have been manufactured to DOT specifications or in some circumstances built in accordance with the American Society of mechanical Engineers' ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code.\n\nIn general, regulations governing sulfur dioxide require that the steel or other material used in fabricating containers meet certain chemical and physical qualifications and that the containers shall pass periodic hydrostatic pressure and other tests as may be applicable.\n\nSince transporting sulfur dioxide as a vapor is not commercially economical, it is shipped and stored as a liquefied compressed gas.  Because liquid sulfur dioxide expands as its temperature rises, it is possible with sufficient increase in temperature for a container to become liquid full.  The resulting hydrostatic pressure could cause a container to rupture or to discharge sulfur dioxide through a pressure relief valve.  Therefore, DOT regulations limit the amount, which may be put into containers of various types.  These regulations provide that the liquid portion of the commodity must not be completely full a container at 1308 F.  This filling limitation is expressed in terms of maximum filling density for each type of container.  \n\nThe maximum allowable filling density for all sulfur dioxide shipping containers is 125% (1.25 kg/dm3).\n\n\nIII. Materials of Construction for Liquid and Gaseous Sulfur Dioxide Service\n\n\nContainers\n\nTon containers are utilized at this facility and follow the following specifications:  DOT-106A500, DOT-106A500-X, DOT-110A500W, ICC-27 and BE-27.  These ton containers have a maximum capacity of 2000 lbs. of sulfur with a tare weight ranging from 1300 to 1650 lbs.\n\nTon containers are equipped with two valves each leading to a =-inch eduction pipe.  When the container is positioned so that one valve is directly above the other, the top valve will deliver gaseous sulfur dioxide and the bottom valve liquid sulfur dioxide.  A line or arrow should be stenciled on the end of the ton container indicating the alignment of the two valves.\n\nTon containers are equipped with fusible metal devices.  Most have three fuse plugs located in each end of the tank.  These consist of a brass plug with a fusible metal insert which, melts at 157-1708 F.  There are no pressure relief devices of the rupture disk or spring-loaded type on tone containers.\n\nRegulations provide that the tom containers must be subjected to a test by internal hydrostatic pressure within five years of the previous test date at 500-psig test pressure.\n\nThe following markings are required by the DOT to be stamped clearly, legibly and permanently in a prescribed sequence on the chime of the ton containers: \n\n7 the DOT specification number followed by the service pressure, e.g., DOT-106A500X;\n7 a serial number and identifying symbol of the maker;\n7 the date of the original test placed so that dates of subsequent tests can easily be added.\n\nEach sulfur dioxide ton container must be provided with a prescribed NONFLAMMABLE GAS label.  Two must be affixed, one on each end.  The NONFLAMMABLE GAS label may contain the UN number outside of the solid line border.  The container must remain marked and labeled when empty unless cleaned of residue and purged of vapor to remove any potential hazard.\n\n    Piping\n\nWelded construction is recommended with welding neck flanges used where flanged connections are required.  If threaded joints cannot be avoided, back-welding is recommended.  All piping should be well supported and provisions made to protect the piping against the effects of expansion, contraction, jarring, vibration, settling and external corrosion.  Flow should not be restricted by an excessive number of elbows and bends. \n\n    Hoses\n\nHose couplings should be of steel or stainless steel.  Each hose assembly together with its integral couplings should be hydrostatically tested to its maximum rated working pressure and found to be leak free.  Hose assemblies should be visually inspected regularly and retested at leas annually.\n\n\nIV. Storage\n\nAll full containers are stored on the south pad in a horizontal position and off the ground to avoid corrosion.  Inside storage areas include the west side of the Glass Production Line I, the west side Glass Production Line II and the west side of the Roller Hearth.  These areas are dry and well ventilated with floor level ventilation to a safe area, and are readily accessible.  When it is necessary to store outdoors, provisions have been made to allow the container to come to room temperature before being used. \n\n\nV. Chemical Information\n\nSulfur dioxide is produced commercially by the liquefaction of gases from the combustion of elemental sulfur.  It is a compound formed by the combination of sulfur and oxygen.  The liquefied gas, when produced is a colorless gas with a characteristic pungent odor.  It may be cooled and compressed to a colorless liquid.  When heated above its critical temperature of 315.48 F sulfur dioxide exists only as a gas regardless of pressure.  \n\nSulfur dioxide liquid is heavier than water, having a specific gravity of 1.436 at 328 F.  As a gas sulfur dioxide is more than twice as heavy as air, its relative density being 2.2638 at atmospheric pressure and 328 F.  One pound of gas occupies 5.47 cubic feet at 328 F at 1 atmosphere.\n\nSulfur dioxide is neither flammable nor explosive in either the gaseous or liquid state.  It is relatively stable chemical requiring temperatures above 36328 F to bring about detectable decomposition of sulfur dioxide.  It is soluble in water with up to 18.6% by weight dissolving at 328 F to form a solution commonly known as sulfurous acid.  Since the vapor pressure of sulfur dioxide in water increases with rising temperature, the solubility of sulfur dioxide in water decreases as the temperature rises.  \n\nSulfur Dioxide is incompatible with powdered and alkali metals such as sodium and potassium.\n\n\nVI. Physiological Effects - Exposure Limits\n\nMaximum exposure limits for sulfur dioxide:\n\n    NIOSH/OSHA PEL        5 ppm (13mg.m3 at 258 C and 1atm)\n    ACGIH TLV-TWA        2ppm (5mg/m3)\n\nNIOSH has concluded from experimental and epidemiologic studies that exposure to sulfur dioxide at the existing Federal standard of 5ppm can cause adverse respiratory effects by increasing airway resistance in a significant number of workers.  Some workers are especially sensitive to these effects.  In addition there is evidence that the effects produced by sulfur dioxide are enhanced by airborne particulate matter and that sulfur dioxide may promote the carcinogenic action of other airborne substances.\n\nImmediately Dangerous to Life or Health (IDLH):100 ppm.  This level represents a maximum concentration from which an individual, without wearing protective mask or apparatus, could escape within 30 minutes without any escape-impairing symptoms or any irreversible health effects.\n\n\nEffects of Exposure\n\nRoutes of Entry:    Inhalation of gas; direct contact of gas or liquid phase on skin and mucous membranes.\n\nInhalation:    Acute exposure may result in dryness and irritation of the nose and throat, choking, sneezing, coughing, and bronchospasm.  Severe overexposure may cause death through a systemic acidosis, pulmonary edema, or from respiratory arrest.  Prolonged or repeated exposure may cause impaired lung function, bronchitis, hacking cough, nasal irritation and discharge, increased fatigue, alteration in the senses of taste and smell, and longer duration of common colds.  In extreme cases, dental caries, loss of fillings, gum disorders and the rapid and painless destruction of teeth may result from repeated overexposure.\n\nSkin Contact:    Liquid sulfur dioxide can cause frostbite and skin burns.  Sulfur dioxide converts to sulfurous acid in moist environments that may cause skin irritation.\n\nEye Contact:    Corneal burns, opacification of the cornea and blindness may result if liquid sulfur dioxide is splashed in the eyes.  Sulfur dioxide can penetrate the intact cornea and cause iritis.\n\nIngested:    Severe burns to the mouth, throat and gastrointestinal system may occur.\n\n\nVII    Tank Changing Procedures - Safety Guidelines\n\nSafety Equipment    \n\nThe following personal protection must be worn at all times when working with SO2 tanks:\n\n7 Loose fitting long-sleeved shirt or jacket\n7 Cartridge Respirator with correct cartridges for SO2 protection\n7 Chemical Splash goggles\n7 Face Shield\n7 Rubber Gloves\n7 Rubber Apron\n\nTools\n\nThe following tools are required to properly and safely change out an SO2 tank:\n\n7 2 Crescent wrenches \n7 SO2 Monitor\n7 Spray Bottle with diluted 50/50 (ammonia and water)\n\n\nProcedure\n\nChanging SO2 tanks is a two person operation whereby one worker actually performs the steps necessary to complete the task, while the other worker acts as a safety observer standing approximately 20 feet away from the work area.  The observer's responsibility is to react to an emergency if it should arise.  The observer must have available proper emergency equipment and be knowledgeable in its use.\n\n1.)     Shut the empty tank valve off that connects to the regulator,     using a crescent wrench.  Visually inspect the pressure     gauge to ensure it has dropped to zero.\n2.)     Close the small line valve just outside the regulator to     prevent blow back from the line.\n3.)     Unscrew the regulator line from the empty SO2 tank.      Reattach the tanks 12\" cap.\n4.)     Using a hi-lo capable of moving 3500 pounds, center the     forks underneath the tank (forks must be at least 30\" apart)     then tilt the forks fully back to remove the empty tank from     the rack.\n5.)     Transport the empty tank to the shipping department, weigh     it and transport it to the staging area on the south pad.\n6.)     Inform the storeroom attendant of the tank number and its     empty weight. \n7.)     Obtain from the storeroom attendant the number of the     replacement tank.\n8.)     Return to the south pad, obtain the correct tank based on     the given tank number.\n9.)     Weigh the full tank in shipping.\n10.) Inform the storeroom attendant of the full tank weight.\n11.) Deliver the full tank to the SO2 rack, aligning two tank ports     in a vertical position.\n12.) Connect the regulator line to the top port of the full tank using one of the supplied lead washers.\n13.) When the regulator is in place, open that tank valve.  Use the spray to check for leaks.  If a vapor appears turn off the tank valve and reconnect the regulator line.  If a vapor still appears when using the spray, contact your supervisor.  If the regulator and tank do not leak, open the line valve.  Again check the line valve and line connections for leaks.  If none appear, adjust the regulator for a line pressure of 15 psi.\n\n\nEmployee Training\n\nEmployees working in the hot end of the plant will be responsible for changing SO2 tanks.  Training regarding procedures, precautions and PPE limitations shall be conducted when an employee is newly assigned to this job task.  Hi-Lo training shall be conducted in accordance to federal and state mandates.\n\nEmployees shall be trained in the following information:\n\n7 Physiological hazards of exposure\n7 Possible hazards due to leaks and corrosion\n7 Potential weak points in the process at which a leak may occur\n7 How to recognize corrosion\n7 How to use a 50/50 spray solution of ammonia and water to detect leaks\n7 Responding to leaks\n7 First Aid Procedures\n7 Emergency Response Procedures\n7 Responsibility of the Observer\n\nVIII    Maintenance Inspection Checklist\n\nThe following checklist is to be used for inspections of the sulfur dioxide tanks and respective fittings:\n\n1. Are the tanks properly painted and marked?\n2. Are the tanks free from corrosion, dents or other damage?\n3. Is the rack in good condition?\n4. Are all the hoses, pipes, meters and other fittings been tested for leaks using a 50/50 solution of ammonia and water?\n5. Have the back flow valves been checked to ensure correct operation?\n6. Are all gaskets, connections and pressure gauges and meters in good condition?\n7. Are dust caps in place when a tank is not in use?\n8. Are all hoses properly secured and protected from damage?\n9. Is the storage area free from combustible or flammable materials?\n10. Are all connections tight?\n11. Are there sufficient lines for all purposes without dual use or makeshift connections?\n12. Are necessary valve handles available at the valve location?\n13. Are hoses capped or plugged when not in use?\n14. Are hose couplings worn or damaged?\n15. Are coupling gaskets in good condition?\n\n\nIX    Emergency Procedures\n\n    General\n\n1.) Rescue personnel should use proper personal protection to avoid becoming a casualty.\n2.) Prompt action is essential.\n3.) Remove exposed person to uncontaminated area.\n4.) Remove contaminated clothing under a safety shower.\n5.) Wash contaminated body parts with cool, running water for at least 15 minutes\n6.) Give nothing by mouth if person is unconscious or convulsing.\n7.) Call for medical assistance if necessary.\n\nInhalation - if breathing has ceased\n\n1.) Remove to fresh air.\n2.) Begin artificial respiration if necessary\n3.) Trained personnel should administer oxygen.\n\nInhalation - if breathing has not ceased\n\n1.) Remove to fresh air\n2.) Place patient in a comfortable position\n3.) Encourage slow deep regular breathing prolonging exhalation\n4.) Trained personnel should administer oxygen as soon as possible\n5.) Keep patient warm and at rest\n6.) Render any other necessary first aid\n\nEye Contact\n\n1.) Flush eyes immediately with copious amounts of tepid running water for at least 15 minutes.\n2.) Hold eyelids apart to ensure complete irrigation of all eye and lid tissue.\n3.) Do not attempt chemical neutralization or apply ointment to the eye\n4.) Seek medical assistance immediately.\n\nSkin Contact\n\n1.) Flush contaminated skin with copious amounts of running water for at least 15 minutes, continue as required to control burning sensation.\n2.) Remove clothes while in the shower to ensure flushing of all contaminated skin.\n3.) Do not attempt chemical neutralization or apply ointments to damaged skin.\n4.) Seek medical assistance immediately.\n\nIngestion\n\n1.) Unless unconscious or convulsing, give the victim 1-2 glasses of milk or water.\n2.) DO NOT induce vomiting.  Obtain medical assistance immediately.\n\n\nX. Emergency Conditions\n\nProtective clothing and self-contained breathing apparatus must be provided and made readily available at a sulfur dioxide installation for emergency use or rescue purposes in accordance with federal and state requirements.  Local exhaust ventilation should be used where there is potential exposure to sulfur dioxide at levels in excess of allowable standards. \n\nIf sulfur dioxide is released, the irritating effect of the vapor will force personnel to leave the area long before they have been exposed to dangerous concentrations.  To facilitate their rapid evacuation all exits are well-marked and easily accessible.  If someone should be trapped in a sulfur dioxide atmosphere, they should breathe as little as possible and open their eyes only when necessary.  Partial protection may be gained by holding a wet cloth over the nose and mouth.  Since sulfur dioxide vapor is heavier than air, the upper floors of buildings would normally have lower concentrations, but personnel could also get trapped if assistance is not quickly available.\n\nIf sulfur dioxide is released to the environment state and local authorities must be contacted in accordance with the directions of \"Emergency Response Procedures for Spills or Releases\" found in Carleton's Pollution Incident Prevention Plan.",

      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\nGuardian Industries - Carleton Michigan\nJune 1999\n\n\nThis Risk Management Plan is written in accordance with all governmental guidelines and mandates.  It is completed in an effort to develop a plan for responding to sulfur dioxide exposure.  Currently we use this chemical in three areas of the plant for the same purpose.  That is to encourage gripping of glass as it passes through an annealing oven.\n\n\nI. Plant Location\n\nThe Carleton plant located within Ash Township at 14600 Romine Road, Carleton, Michigan, at which a total of 400 production employees and 125 administrative personnel are employed.  The facility size is 880, 000 square feet and comprised of two glass melting furnaces, one electric tempering furnace and one glass coater.  Although production is a twenty-four hour operation, regular business hours are from 8:00am to 4:30pm, Monday through Friday.  Facility 24 hour phone number:  (313) 654-6264.\n\n\nII. Parent Corporation\n\nGuardian Industries World Headquarters location is 2300 Harmon Road, Auburn Hills, Michigan   48326.  Facility twenty-four hour phone number: (810) 340-6264.\n\n\nIII. Historical Background\n\n Guardian Industries was incorporated in 1968 as successor to the Guardian Glass Company, a privately owned company engaged in the manufacturing of automobile glass since 1932.  In 1970, the company began the manufacture of flat glass by the float process in this, the Carleton Plant.  The immediate success of this type of glass manufacturing and excellent final product warranted the installation of a second float glass line in 1973.\n\nGuardian Carleton also installed an electric powered Vertical Furnace in 1971 to temper specialized pieces of glass.  For improved production, this was dismantled and replaced in 1973 with a gas fired Air Hearth, which was eventually replaced in 1978 with the electric Roller Hearth currently in use.\n\nIn 1991 a coating operation was added to this plant.  Originally installed across the street, it was reloc"

Guardian's fabricated glass products include heat-treated and tempered safety glass, insulating and reflective glass for the residential and commercial construction industry, and laminated windshields and tempered side and rear windows for the automotive industry.  \n\nV. Production Process\n\nIdentified under SIC Code 3211, the following operations are housed within the 17.2 acre manufacturing facility:\n\nAdministration and Personnel\n\nEngineering and Maintenance\n\nProduction Control and Sales\n\nInventory Control\n\nTempering\n\nFloat Glass \n\nShipping\n\nWarehouse Storage\n\n\nGuardian's Carleton Facility manufactures glass by the \"float\" method.  In this process, silica sand, limestone, dolomite, soda ash, salt cake and recycled glass are melted at approximately 2700: F in a gas-fired furnace.  The molten glass then leaves the furnace and \"floats\" on a pool of molten tin, where it is formed and drawn out as a continuous ribbon.  After leaving the tin bath, it is drawn through an annealing oven where its temperature is gradually reduced.  It is here in this oven, called a lehr, that sulfur dioxide is used to coat the rollers as an aid in moving glass through the system.  Glass passes through the lehr and into the packing section of the plant.  Once inspected it is cut to size and packed for shipment.\n\nThe electrically powered Roller Hearth is used to temper specially sized glass for automotive and architectural use.  Glass is physically seamed, or sanded to remove burrs on its edge, and then it is placed on a conveyor line leading to a washing system for removal of large dirt particles.  The conveyor system delivers the glass into the electric furnace where it is heated to appr"

The glass is cleaned in a five station washing area, then moved through a series of increasing vacuum chambers for eventual exposure to a metal covered target where sputtering onto the glass, takes place.  Glass then passes through decreasing vacuum chambers to the ambient air to eventually be inspected and packed for shipment.\n\n\n\nVI. Emergency Coordination\n\nGuardian Industries has developed and abides by safe work practices when interacting with hazardous materials.  Management is committed to creating a safe work environment and employees are encouraged to report unsafe work practices or tools as one means to preventing accidents.  Joint cooperation between employees and management in the observance of safety and health policies is considered to be of first importance and mutual cooperation and dedication are necessary in making all safety policies successful.\n\nIn accordance with government regulations, Guardian Industries has appointed the plant Engineering Manager as emergency coordinator who shall be responsible for coordinating and implementing emergency contingency plans.\n\nThe Emergency Coordinator must be on the premises or if off-site, on call and located such a distance that he can reach the facility within a short period of time.  He must be thoroughly familiar with all aspects of this plan, all operations and activities at this site, the location and characteristics of waste handled, the location of all records within the facility and the facility layout.  In addition the emergency coordinator must have the authority to commit the resources (personnel and monetary) to carry out these emergency plans.\n\n\nVII. Preventive Measures\n\nDuring an emergency the emergency coordinator must take all reasonable measures necessary to ensure that fires, explosions and releases do not occur, recur or spread to other hazardous materials on-site.

      "SummaryText": " These measures may include stopping processes and operations, removing or isolating containers, monitoring for leaks, pressure buildup, gas generation, ruptures in valves or other equipment.\n\nVIII. Facility Personnel\n\nThe Emergency Coordinator will direct actions of all facility personnel in     accordance with this plan, to:\n\n1.) Identify hazards and assess extent of potential harm to human health or the environment.\n2.) Notify, as necessary, the appropriate Emergency Response contacts.\n3.) Respond in cooperation with outside agencies to minimize hazards.\n4.) Follow up response actions with required reports (verbal and written).\n\nIX. Plan Revision\n\nThese procedures shall be reviewed and immediately amended, if necessary whenever:\n\n7 The plan fails in an emergency.\n7 The facility changes - in its design, construction, operation, maintenance, or other circumstances, in a way that materially increases the potential for spills or releases other or changes the response necessary in an emergency.\n7 The list of personnel conducting the emergency coordination responsibilities.\n7 The list of monitoring or emergency equipment changes.\n7 Applicable regulations are revised.\n\n\nX. Coordination Agreements\n\nCoordination arrangements have been established and agreed to by local police departments, fire departments, hospitals, contractors, state and local emergency response teams to coordinate emergency services.\n\nXI. Five Year Accident History\n\nWithin the last five years there has been one sulfur dioxide exposure which took place November 1995, when a temporary worker was asked to assist an engineer on the production line.  Investigation found a leaking hose which was fixed immediately.  The employee was taken to the hospital for observation since he also suffered from asthma. He was released a few hours later.  \n\n\nXII. Worst-Case Release and Alternate Scenario's\n\nAnhydrous sulfur dioxide is stored on-site in one ton containers.  Our worst scenario would entail the unexpected release"

Approximately 2000 pounds of this chemical would be released having the potential to reach an endpoint of 2.10 miles within a 10 minute period according to EPA Guidelines.  Within this radius a Guardian owned recreational facility, residences, farmland, schools, a park and other businesses are located.  Tanks are currently stored in a horizontal position at the south end of the plant on an outdoor pad.  They are stored in a low traffic area and are unlikely to be damaged.  Tanks used within the plant rest on specially designed racks raised above the ground.  Personnel required to change out the tanks are properly trained in the procedure and personnal protective equipment needed to perform the task safely.\n\nIn an alternate scenario there is the possibilty that a pipe or hose may leak.  Immediately an alarm will sound indicating which tank is at fault.  This alarm is located in the tin bath control room which is manned 24 hours a day.  If such a release were to happen within seconds the tin bath operator would realize the sudden drop in pressure and would summons maintenance assistance.\n\nHowever, if such an event happened, release time would be less than one minute.  With a wind speed of 3.0 miles/second the distance to end point would be 1.00 miles.  Within this area, Guardian Industries Recreational Facility, a park, school and several residences and businesses are located.\n\nXIII. Chemical Release Prevention and Planned Safety Improvement.\n\nGuardian continues to review procedures and update equipment to ensure the absence of sulfur dioxide exposure.  The massive revamping of the alarm systems this past year enables us to be aware of leaks seconds after the leaks begin.  Accordingly Guardian reviews and updates the PHA for sulfur dioxide to ensure all safety measures and precautions are taken."
