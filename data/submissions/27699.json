The Shift Leads, who operate the Control Room, report to the O & M Manager.  Staff members will be responsible for accomplishing RMP program requirements as work activities assigned to their positions.  \n\nAnhydrous Ammonia \u00bf Regulated Substance and Process Description\nThe prevention program for the Mesquite Generating Station covers the anhydrous ammonia storage and injection systems for the two identical Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) systems used in each of the two Power Blocks.  This RMP prevention program covers the following processes and regulated substance:\nProcesses 1 & 2: Ammonia storage and injection to the SCR system\nRegulated Substance: Anhydrous Ammonia\nProcess #1 is the system for Power Block #1, and Process #2 is the system for Power Block #2.  The ammonia systems procedures are contained in the Mesquite Generating Station Policies and Procedures Manual (PPM) 9.01, titled \u00bfAmmonia Storage and Transfer System\u00bf.\n\u00b7\tProcess Chemistry:  The two identical SCR systems in Power Blocks #1 and #2 are designed to reduce oxides of nitrogen (NOx) in the combustion turbine exhaust gases.  Ammonia vapor is diluted and injected into the exhaust gas ducts upstream of the catalyst beds.  The exhaust gas mixes with the ammonia vapor and flows over the catalyst beds, where the NOx is reduced to nitrogen gas and water vapor:\n\n\t\tNOx  +  NH3  -->   N2  +  H2O   \n\n\t\tThe system uses anhydrous ammonia, which is delivered by tank truck to a"

When ammonia is needed in the SCR systems, liquid ammonia is taken from the bottom of a storage tank, evaporated in an electric heater, and returned to the tank headspace as vapor.  The vapor is fed into a 1000 CFM dilution air stream and injected into the duct as approximately 2.6% ammonia by volume. \n\n\u00b7\t\u00b7\tMaximum Planned Inventory: In each of the two Power Blocks, the gross tank volume is 14,000 gallons but a tank will only be filled to a maximum of 85% of capacity, or 12,000 gallons (61,500 lbs at 60 degrees F.), to allow for expansion. The liquid ammonia in 30 feet of 2 inch pipe from a storage tank to its vaporizer inlets, plus 15 to 20 feet of 2 inch fill pipe connected to a tank, is less than 1 pound. The quantity of ammonia in pipes connected to a tank is negligible compared to the tank contents.  The maximum planned inventory for anhydrous ammonia is 61,500 lbs in each Power Block, or 123,000 lbs for the plant.  The quantity of ammonia in the delivery trucks is not included because the tractors will not be disconnected from the tank trailers during delivery, keeping them under DOT jurisdiction.   A full load of ammonia in a delivery truck is 44,000 lbs.\n\u00b7\t\n\u00b7\tSafety Systems \nThe anhydrous ammonia system includes the safety and alarm systems described below. \nAmmonia leak detection sensors, consisting of one per truck unloading skid, one per unloading compressor, 4 per tank, and one per vaporizer, monitor the level of ammonia in the atmosphere.  If ammonia is detected above the Low PEL alarm level of 25 ppm, a flashing strobe light is activated at the main leak detection control panel located on the truck unloading skid, and a remote alarm is activated in the plant DCS system to alert control room personnel of a potential leak.

When a System Sponsor or other Team Member observes that a change in the plant is required as a result of a safety situation, a potential to improve plant efficiency, or a regulatory mandate, they prepare and submit a DCR. \n\nA review group assigned by the Plant Manager reviews the DCR for technical and economic merit.

The maximum internal temperature of  122 degrees F was modeled because higher internal temperature gave a longer distance to the 200 ppm endpoint, even though the mass of ammonia in an 85% full tank is greater at lower internal temperatures.  The model was run for rural conditions because the topography is relatively open between the tank and the largest potential offsite receptor population at the Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station (PVNGS) directly north of the Mesquite Generating Station.  \n\nThe model predicts an ammonia concentration of 200 ppm at a maximum distance of 3.1 miles from the tank.\n\n\nAlternative Release Scenario\nThe alternative release scenario is a break in 2\u00bf fill line from the tanker trailer to the tank while loading, causing a release of liquid ammonia from 20 ft of hose and 20 ft of 2\u00bf pipe before the driver can shut off the flow.  This scenario was selected as the most likely release to occur in the system as constructed and operated at the Mesquite Generating Station.  The model was run for urban conditions due to proximity of plant buildings and structures.\n\n\nBased on a typical temperature of 90 degrees F., the model estimates a release of 0.29 lbs of ammonia and predicts an ammonia concentration of 200 ppm at a distance of 14 yards from the tank.
