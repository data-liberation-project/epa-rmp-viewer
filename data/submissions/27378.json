FACILITY POLICY\n     THE MANAGEMENT AND EMPLOYEES OF THE OTTAWA COOPERATIVE ASSOCIATION ARE COMMITTED TO THE PREVENTION OF ANY ACCIDENTAL RELEASE OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA. IF AN ACCIDENTAL RELEASE SHOULD OCCUR, THE FACILITY IS PREPARED TO WORK WITH THE LOCAL FIRE DEPARTMENT AND OR OTHER AUTHORITIES, TO MITIGATE AND MINIMIZE THE IMPACTS OF THE RELEASE TO THE PEOPLE AND THE ENVIRONMENT.\n\n    2. FACILITY INFORMATION\n     THE PRIMARY ACTIVITY AT THE FACILITY IS THE STORAGE OF FERTILIZERS FOR SALE TO FARMERS. ANHYDROUS AMMONIA IS RECEIVED, STORED AND DISTRIBUTED FOR DIRECT APPLICATION AS A NUTRIENT FOR CROP PRODUCTION. THE MAXIMUM QUANTITY STORED WOULD BE 122,500 POUNDS IN A STORAGE TANK AND NURSE TANKS. \n\n      3. WORST CASE SCENARIO AND ALTERNATE RELEASE SCENARIO\n      A.  THE WORST CASE SCENARIO WOULD BE THE RELEASE OF THE TOTAL CONTENTS OF A STORAGE TANK RELEASED AS GAS OVER A PERIOD OF 10 MINUTES. THE MAXIMUM QUANITITY RELEASED WOULD BE 79,000 POUNDS, WHICH REPRESENTS THE VOLUME OF THE LARGEST STORAGE TANK AT 85% CAPACITY AS LIMITED BY DESIGN STANDARDS AND ADMINISTRATIVE CONTROLS. THE DISTANCE TO THE END POINT (POINT OF DISPERSION TO 200 PARTS PER MILLION, OR PPM) IS .8 MILES. \n\n     B. THE ALTERNATE RELEASE SCENARIO, A 3 INCH TRANSFER HOSE IS USED AS AN ALTERNATE RELEASE SCENARIO FOLLOWED BY RELEASE OF AMMONIA FOR 2 MINUTES BEFORE AN AUTOMATIC EXCESS FLOW SHUT DOWN VALVE INTERVENES OR REMOTE MANUAL SHUT OFF IS CLOSED AND STOPS THE FLOW OF AMMONIA. THE MAXIMUM QUANTITY RELEASED WOULD BE 11,908 POUNDS. THE DISTANCE TO THE ENDPOINT (POINT OF DISPERSION TO 200 ppm)  IS .33 MILES. THE MOST LIKELY POTENTIAL INCIDENT, WOULD BE A RELEASE FROM A BREAK IN A 1 INCH TRANSFER HOSE SCENARIO FOLLOWED BY RELEASE OF AMMONIA FOR 2 MINUTES BEFORE AN AUTOMATIC EXCESS FLOW SHUT DOWN VALVE INTERVENES OR REMOTE MANUAL SHUT OFF IS CLOSED AND STOPS THE FLOW OF AMMONIA. THE MAXIMUM QUANTITY RELEASED WITH THIS SCENARIO WOULD BE 2,901 POUNDS. THE DISTANCE TO THE ENDPOINT (POINT OF DISPER"

ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n     THE FACILITY IS IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE PROVISIONS OF THE U.S. OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH ADMINISTRATION (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.11, \"STORAGE AND HANDLING OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA\". THIS FACILITY IS ALSO IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE PROVISIONS OF THE KANSAS FERTILIZER LAW. THE OSHA STANDARD IS REFERENCED IN THE RMP REGISTRATION FORM IN SECTION 8.3 (b).\n      THERE ARE MANY HAZARDS ASSOCIATED WITH ANHYDROUS AMMONIA, ALTHOUGH THERE ARE PROPANE GAS STORAGE TANKS IN THE AREA OF THE AMMONIA PLANT, WE AT THIS TIME FEEL THAT IT POSES NO THREAT TO THE AMMONIA PLANT OR THE AMMONIA PLANT TO THE PROPANE STORAGE. WE REQUIRE THAT EACH EMPLOYEE THAT LOADS AMMONIA BE TRAINED EVERY THREE YEARS AT A STATE SPONSERED TRAINING SCHOOL AND YEARLY TRAINED IN OPERATING AND SAFETY PROCEDURES AT A GIVEN AMMONIA PLANT. ALL EMPLOYEES ARE TRAINED TO INSPECT THE AMMONIA PLANT BEFORE FILLING PROCEDURES AND BEFORE USE DO A VISUAL INSPECTION OF ALL HOSES AND VALVES TO MAKE SURE THERE HAS NOT BEEN A FAILURE OF EQUIPMENT SINCE THE LAST TIME IT  WAS USED. EMPLOYEES ARE REMINDED TO FOLLOW START UP PROCEDURES BEFORE FILLING AND DURING FILLING OF  NURSE TANKS.\n\n     5. FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n     THERE  HAVE BEEN NO ACCIDENTAL RELEASES OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA IN THE PAST FIVE YEARS THAT HAVE CAUSED ANY DEATHS, INJURIES OR SIGNIFICANT PROPERTY DAMAGE AT THE FACILITY, NOR TO OUR KNOWLEDGE, HAS THERE BEEN ANY ACCIDENTAL RELEASES RESULTING IN OFF SITE DEATH, INJURIES,  EVACUATIONS, PROPERTY DAMAGE, OR ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGE.\n\n     6. EMERGENCY ACTION PLAN\n     A. A WRITTEN ACTION PLAN, IN ACCORDANCE WITH OSHA STANDARD 29 CFR 1910-38 \n\n     B. PROVIDED STATE AND LOCAL AUTHORITIES WITH THE EMERGENCY PLANNING AND COMMUNITY RIGHT TO KNOW INFORMATION AS REQUIRED UNDER SARA TITLE III (EPCRA).\n\n     C. IF A LARGE RELEASE OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA TAKES PLACE AT THE FACILITY, THE REQUIRED RESPONSE ACTION IS TO EVACUATE THE AREA OF THE SPILL AND CALL 91"
