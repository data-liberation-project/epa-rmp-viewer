These initiatives include forming problem-solving teams to promote both process safety and employee safety.\n\nPersonnel representing operations, maintenance, support, and management work together on the Employee Excellence Team to represent facility employees involving the following areas:\n\n\u00bf\tEmployee Ownership and VPP (Behavior Based Safety Process, Safety in Motion, ergonomics, traffic safety, general safety, safety concerns),\n\u00bf\tPollution Prevention (recycling programs, waste prevention and minimization, wildlife tours),  \n\u00bf\tSafety Standards and Procedures (review, edit, create, and audit)\n\u00bf\tProcess Safety (process safety metrics, Process Safety Event lessons-learned, communication and re-education of PSM/process safety).\n\nB. Process Safety Information\n\nSweeny Refinery maintains a variety of technical documents that are used for the safe and reliable operation of facility processes. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  Specific teams/groups within the facility are assigned responsibility for maintaining current and up to date process safety information. Process safety information documents are readily available for review and use (e.g. during unit process hazard analysis, etc.). The refinery Management of Change (MOC) process is utilized to maintain process safety information current and up-to-date.\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in safety data sheets (SDSs). For specific process areas, the complex has documented saf"

      "SummaryText": "D ASSESSMENT RESULTS\n\nAt the heart of the Risk Management Plan rule is the requirement to conduct a hazard assessment to examine and communicate potential offsite impacts of releases of regulated hazardous substances. Two types of releases are to be considered, a Worst Case Scenario and an Alternate Release Scenario. The WCS (representing a catastrophic event) is defined as a release with the largest quantity of a regulated substance from a single vessel or process line failure that results in the greatest distance to a specified endpoint. The ARS represents a more credible, but still potentially significant, accidental release of a regulated hazardous material. It is also understood that active and passive mitigation systems can be considered in developing the ARS. However, in some cases mitigation measures and systems may not have been included to its fullest extent in order to create potential worst-case alternate release scenarios. In helping to establish the Alternate Release Scenarios that are more credible and likely, various information such as previous incident history, PHA failure scenarios, siting and spacing studies, etc. were considered.\n\nNote: For Security purposes, the Offsite Consequence Analysis description and scenarios are not shown in the Executive Summary.\n\n\nIV. GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM STEPS\n\nThe following is a summary of the general Accident Prevention Program in place at the Sweeny Refinery.  Because processes at the plant are subject to both EPA Risk Management Program Rule and OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) compliance, this summary addresses each of the PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the Accident Prevention Program.  \n\nA. Employee Participation\n\nSweeny Refinery management supports and encourages employees to participate in all facets of risk management and accident prevention. Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemic"
