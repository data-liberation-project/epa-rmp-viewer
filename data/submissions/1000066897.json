This includes provisions of 40 CFR part 68 EPA RMP. This is a systematic approach for chemical process hazards management designed to eliminate or minimize the potential for major catastrophes caused by the release of highly hazardous chemicals. GPC II will employ these measures to ensure that the means for preventing a catastrophic release, fire, or explosion are understood and to ensure the necessary preventative measures and lines of defense are installed and maintained. Every person on-site is included in these measures and management will ensure they are properly established and utilized.\r\n\r\nB.\tStationary Source & Regulated Substances Handled\r\n\r\nGPC II is located in Daviess County, Indiana. The facility is a corn wet miller producing beverage and denatured alcohols, animal feed, starches, and corn syrup solids. GPC's facilities reside on 800 acres and include storage tanks and processes typical of a corn wet milling plant.\r\n\r\nB.1\tPrimary Plant Operations of Concern\r\n* Natural gasoline tank.\r\n\r\nB.2\tUse of Regulated Substances\r\nPentane\r\n* The largest constituent of natural gasoline in the storage tank at the facility\r\n* A maximum inventory of 114,925 pounds (lbs) is handled or stored at the facility.\r\n\r\nC.\tGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program\r\n\r\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps at GPC II include but are not limited to:\r\n* National Fire Protection Association (NFPA)\r\n* EPA, American Petroleum Institute (API)\r\n* American Society of Testing of Material (ASTM)\r\n* National Board of Boiler and Pressure Vessel Inspections (NBIC)\r\n* American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME)\r\n\r\nD.\tFive Year Accident History\r\n\r\nThe GPC II facility has had no reportable accidents for the regulated chemicals in the previous five years."

      "SummaryText": "E.\tEmergency Response Program\r\n\r\nThe facility's emergency response program is coordinated with the City of Washington's Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC). GPC II submits annually a Tier II report detailing the hazardous chemicals onsite in order to aid in emergency planning.\r\n\r\nF. Program 1 certification\r\n\r\nBased on the criteria in 40 CFR 68.10, the distance to the specified endpoint for the worst-case accidental release scenario for the following process is less than the distance to the nearest public receptor: natural gasoline process. Within the past five years, the process has had no accidental release that caused offsite impacts provided in the risk management program rule (40 CFR 68.10(b)(1)). No additional measures are necessary to prevent offsite impacts from accidental releases. In the event of fire, explosion, or a release of a regulated substance from the process, entry within the distance to the specified endpoints may pose a danger to public emergency responders. Therefore, public emergency responders should not enter this area except as arranged with the emergency contact indicated in the RMP. The undersigned certifies that, to the best of my knowledge, information, and belief, formed after reasonable inquiry, the information submitted is true, accurate, and complete."
