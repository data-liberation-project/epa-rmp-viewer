This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Crestwood Midstream Partner's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, facility trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release. \n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances.\n\n\n\nNatural gas is gathered from wells in the surrounding fields and sent to the Willow Lake Gas Plant for processing prior to being sold for domestic consumption. This gas contains impurities in the form of carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrogen (N2) and water. These impurities must be brought into specification before residue companies will purchase this gas. The Willow Lake Gas Plant inlet gas contains enough natural gas liquids that extraction is desirable.\n\n\n\nThe process of the compression and dehydration of natural gas and removal of condensate and natural gas liquids occurs in the following way.\n\n\n\nNatural gas from nearby wells is gathered into pipes that extend out into the field in a spider web configuration. The pipes are designed so diameters increase as they grow closer into proximity of the compressor facility and volumes are larger. The gas then enters the compressor station.  Pipeline condensate is removed from the gas stream along the pipeline via the inlet gas scrubber. Removed condensate is routed to pressurized natural gas liquids storage tanks. \n\n\n\nThe gas enters a high pressure inlet coalescing filter that filters the inlet gas and removes oil and free liquids. The gas then enters compression. The gas stream flows through a propane refrige"

The gas is then measured via an orifice meter and enters transmission pipeline.\n\n\n\nThe processes at the station are interconnected by piping and fit the EPA's definition of a stationary source in 40 CFR part 68.  The facility contains two sources of regulated substances held over their respective threshold quantities; condensate (pentane) and natural gas liquids.\n\n\n\nGeneral Accident Release Prevention and Program Information\n\n\n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place for the process at the facility. \n\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\n\n\nCrestwood Midstream Partners encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team.  Employees have access to all information created as part of the facility accident prevention program.  Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the facility.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\n\n\nCrestwood Midstream Partners keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  The reference documents are maintained on file at the facility to provide open access.\n\n\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in safety data sheets (SDSs).  This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known "

For the process, the facility has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) in key process parameter documents.  The facility ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\n\n\n\nThe Willow Lake Gas Plant also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment.  This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\n\n\nCrestwood Midstream Partners has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the process are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.  \n\n\n\nCrestwood Midstream Partners primarily used the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis and Check-List techniques to perform this evaluation.  HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes suc"

Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\n\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the Willow Lake Gas Plant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted when major changes occur at the facility.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.  Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.  \n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\n\n\nWillow Lake Gas Plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process.  These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.  The procedures are kept current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.\n\n\n\nIn addition, the Willow Lake Gas Plant maintains key process parameter documents that provide guidance on how to respond to upper or lower limit exceedence for specific process or equipment parameters.

New employees receive basic training in facility operations if they are not already familiar with such operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted on an as needed basis.  All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\n\n\nContractors\n\n\n\nThe Willow Lake Gas Plant uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the station has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform facility personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.

The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready.  The PSSR team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness.  A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves as a quality assurance function by requiring that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\n\n\nCrestwood Midstream Partners has well-established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition.  The basic aspects of this program include: (1) conducting training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting identified deficiencies, and (5) applying quality assurance measures.
