Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThis facility is regulated under 29 CFR 1910.120, Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response and 29 CFR 1920.38, Employee Emergency Plans and Fire Prevention Plans.  Chemicals Incorporated fully complies with these regulations with employee training and written plans.  Additionally, the facility is a member of Mutual Aid Mont Belvieu, the local emergency response group.\n\n\n\n2. Source and Substances Handled\n\nPrimary Activities: Specialty Chemical Toll Manufacturer\n\nUse of Substances:  \n\nHydrochloric Acid: 33,200 lbs (max) bulk storage tank (4,000 gallons)\n\nTrimethylaminie Storage:  128097 lbs (max) - 2 bulk storage tanks (9,500 gallons and 14,500 gallons) in close proximity.  \n\n\n\n3. a. Toxic Worst Case Scenario:  Failure of a 4,000 gallon tank of Hydrochloric Acid (38%) with no emergency response resulting in the complete release of contents over a 174 minute period.  The 33,200 pounds would form a vapor cloud with a toxic endpoint radius of 2.7 miles.\n\n\n\nb. Toxic Alternative Scenario: No alternative scenario for Program Level I toxics.\n\n\n\nc. Flammable Worst Case Scenario:  Failure of bulk storage containing 128097 pounds of trimethylamine resulting in\n\na vapor cloud explosion with a 1 psi over pressure endpoint radius of 0.4 miles.\n\n\n\nd. Flammable Alternative Scenario: No alternative scenario for Program Level I flammables.\n\n\n\n4. General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nChemicals Incorporated has made accident prevention the number one priority at the facility, and accidental chemical release prevention is a major facet of the accident prevention activities at Chemicals Incorporated.\n\nKey to the prevention program is comprehensive training of both operations and maintenance personnel.\n\n\n\n5. Five Year Accident History Summary\n\nNo Accidents involving Trimethylamine or Hydrochloric Acid\n\n\n\n\n\n6. Emergency Response Program\n\nChemica"

      "SummaryText": "ls Incorporated's Emergency Response Program is tailored to the varied processes inherent to a small specialty chemical toll manufacturer.  The plan rests on response trained operators and a 24 hour a day emergency coordinator along with two alternate coordinators to handle notifications and request for response from outside agencies such as MAMB, Barber's Hill Fire Department, and ambulance services.\n\n\n\nSpecial equipment and personal protective gear is on hand for containing releases.  Training of employees is conducted to repair any possible leaking tanks/containers.  Additionally, the Trimethylamine supplier is available 24 hours to assist in emergencies.  Additionally, the facility has installed a 1.2 million gallon fire water reservoir and associated fire suppression equipment for fire fighting service.\n\n\n\n7. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nAdditional passive and active mitigation strategies are being evaluated for all of Chemicals Incorporated's processes including additional containment."
