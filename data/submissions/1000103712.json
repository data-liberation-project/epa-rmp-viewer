These drills and exercises are evaluated by QCCP management to determine if any additional training or education is required.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\nThere have not been any reportable releases at the ethanol facility within the past 5 years; however, there was a denaturant release that were not considered reportable per RMP. \n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION:\nQCCP has several safety programs in place at the facility that incorporate emergency response, including a Health and Safety Plan.  A SPCC and FRP have been prepared and implemented in accordance with applicable regulatory standards.  FRP regulations require exercises of internal and external notification systems on a semiannual to annual basis.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY:\nQCCP will continue to provide annual training programs to employees covering both safety and environmental programs in place at the facility to ensure the continued safety of employees and Contractors. If any additional training is deemed necessary, QCCP will ensure that additional training or education opportunities are presented to the employees in need. There are no planned changes to improve safety at the QCCP facility at this time."

Population data was obtained using Circular Area Profiling Software (CAPS), which incorporates 2020 U.S. Census Data. Public receptor information (i.e., schools, hospitals, businesses, etc.) was obtained using Google Earth. No environmental receptors are affected by a worst-case release of denaturant. \n\nAlternative Scenarios:\nThe alternative scenario used for anhydrous ammonia is a release of 25,000 pounds due to a tanker truck loadout spill, caused by a transfer hose failure, causing the liquid to pool and evaporate. This scenario is considered the most likely cause of an ammonia release onsite. The alternative release duration assumed is 10 minutes with an atmospheric stability of D and wind speed of 3.0 m/sec. The facility control room is manned 24 hours/day and would be alerted of the relief valve failure at the ammonia tank within minutes. No passive or active mitigation is considered in this scenario. RMP*Comp was used to determine the alternative distance to endpoint (0.9-mile radius); the model results are provided as part of this documentation. Population data was obtained using Circular Area Profiling Software (CAPS) which incorporates 2020 U.S. Census Data.

      "SummaryText": "to a tanker truck loadout spill (failure), causing a vapor cloud fire.   The endpoint used was an over pressurization of 1 PSI, a worst-case option.  Denaturant deliveries at the facility typically occur during normal business hours with a facility staff member overseeing loadout operations \u0096 therefore a release at the loadout area could be ceased within minutes by manual overrides.  The loadout area also has a catchment basin with underground piping to secondary containment of the tank farm.   For this scenario passive and active mitigation was not considered, as the mitigation strategies currently in place would not contain a vapor cloud fire.  RMP Comp was used to determine the alternate distance to endpoint (0.1 miles), the model results are provided as part of this documentation. Population data was obtained using CAPS. Public receptor information (i.e. schools, hospitals) was obtained using Google Earth.  No environmental receptors are affected by an alternate release of denaturant.  \n\nToxics\nWorst Case Scenarios:\nAnhydrous Ammonia is stored in one (1) 64,000-pound tank. QCCP limits by standard procedures the maximum volume of anhydrous ammonia that could be stored in this tank is 85% of its total capacity. For this worst-case scenario, it assumed that a catastrophic failure of the tank resulted in the release of the maximum possible amount in the tank, or 64,000 pounds. Since the toxic chemical is not stored in a diked area, no passive mitigation is assumed in the endpoint calculation. As required by the rule, it was assumed that the spill spreads out until a depth of one (1) centimeter (0.39 inch), and assuming the spill occurs onto a flat, not-absorbing surface. Since a release would likely be onto, in part, a somewhat porous surface (soil), the distance estimated may be overestimated. RMP*Comp was used to determine the worst-case distance to endpoint (4.4-mile radius); the model results are also provided as part of this documentation. The highest daily max"

The facility operates 24 hours per day, 7 days per week for the purpose of manufacturing fuel grade ethanol from corn.  The regulated substances under the RMP program are the Denaturant (also known as natural gasoline which is a flammable mixture) and anhydrous ammonia (which is a toxic chemical). \nWORST CASE AND ALTERNATIVE CASE SCENARIOS:\nFlammables\nWorst Case Scenario:\n\nNFPA 4 Flammable Mixture (Denaturant):  The flammable mixture stored onsite is natural gasoline, typically referred to as denaturant.  Natural gasoline is used onsite to denature ethanol prior to shipment off site.   Denaturant is stored two (2) tanks a 32,000-gallon steel tank and a 20,000-gallon steel tank in the facility tank farm.  The tank is located within a diked containment structure that contains an impermeable liner with gravel overlay.  A facility provided SDS was used to determine RMP applicability.  The SDS lists several RMP-applicable constituents; however, assumed entire mixture as Pentane.  The worst-case scenario used is the release of the entire contents of the largest denaturant tank, 186,816 pounds, causing a vapor cloud explosion.  RMP Comp was used to determine the worst-case distance to endpoint (0.5 miles), the model results are provided as part of this documentation.

QCCP is an ethanol production facility located near the city of Galva, Ida County, Iowa.  This summary is presented in response to the requirements of the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) under Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Part 68 (40 CFR 68) and Section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act. The QCCP facility is subject to the RMP rule due to the storage of anhydrous ammonia, a regulated toxic substance, and natural gasoline, a regulated flammable mixture, above the threshold quantities (covered processes).\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICIES:\nQCCP has a commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated in the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel as well as considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the facility. QCCP has emergency response policies in place that are addressed in the facility's SPCC/FRP, and Emergency Action Plan. Most of the listed plans have a minimum of annual training requirements in order to keep employees educated on emergency response procedures in place at the facility. Annual training is also a good time to discuss any situations at the facility the occurred over the previous year that the helped the plant gain knowledge on how to better address chemicals or spill practices. New employees are required to undergo training on the plans listed above prior to initiating responsibilities onsite. If job duties warrant, new employees may also be required to read through the plans, as well. QCCP 's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, plant personnel will follow the appli"
