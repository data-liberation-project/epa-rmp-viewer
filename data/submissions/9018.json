General accidental release and prevention policy of Cagle-Keystone Foods.\n\nIn this food product manufacturing facility we handle anhydrous ammonia and chlorine in a liquid\nand vapor state which is considered hazardous by the EPA.  Due to the hazardous properties of\nammonia and chlorine it is necessary to observe certain safety precautions during their use to\nprevent human exposure, reduce the threat to our workers personal health, the surrounding\ncommunity and the environment.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal and state\nregulations that were are governed by.  Safety depends directly on our proper handling of these\nchemicals coupled with the safety devices, control measures and safe handling procedures that our\npersonnel are trained in.\n\n2.  Stationary source and regulated substance handled.\n\nCagle-Keystone Foods, 7220 Highway 19 N, Camilla, Georgia, is located approximately two\nmiles north of Camilla, Georgia. We are responsible for the processing of frozen poultry products\nin various varieties. The entire facility consists of two separate processing centers. Both plants\nmanufacture product around the clock, (7) seven days a week. There are 2600 full time employees\nat the entire facility, which includes hourly and salary personnel. \n \nThe potentially hazardous chemicals used at the Cagle-Keystone Foods facility are anhydrous\nammonia and chlorine. \n\nThe dominant characteristic of ammonia vapor is it's pungent, distinct odor.  Persons exposed to\nammonia will not voluntarily stay in areas of even small concentrations, although these levels\nwould not result in any health risks. \nRisks from accidental exposure to ammonia in a vapor state are irritations to the eyes, nose and\nthroat. The extent of irritation depends on the exposure amount and length of exposure.   \nAmmonia is classified non-flammable"

      "SummaryText": " by the Department of Transportation.  It will burn, but only\nin a very narrow, high concentration level with a constant ignition source.\n\nChlorine gas is primarily a respiratory irritant. It is so irritating that low concentrations in the air\nare readily detectable. In high concentrations the irritating effect of the gas will force an individual\nfrom a contaminated space unless trapped or unconscious. Liquid chlorine will cause skin and eye\nburns upon contact. When liquid is exposed to atmospheric pressure and temperature the liquid\nwill vaporize to chlorine gas.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe normal operating level of ammonia that is used/stored at Cagle-Keystone Foods facility is\n100,000 pounds, 50,000 at each of the Processing and Further Processing centers. The anhydrous\nammonia is used as the refrigerant chemical during the manufacturing and cold storage process.\n \nThe normal operating level of chlorine that is used/stored at the Cagle-Keystone Foods\nProcessing facility is 4,000 pounds. The chlorine is used in the facility for water treatment and\nsanitation. \nThe possible hazards that could lead to an accidental release of either chemical include, but are\nnot limited to, equipment failure, damage to piping, damage to equipment and human error. \n\n3. Worst case release scenarios and alternate release scenarios including administrative and\nengineering controls to limit/prevent the release of ammonia and chlorine.\n\n  Ammonia worst case release scenario criteria for Cagle-Keystone Foods\n                          Processing facility:\n\nWorst case scenario depicts continuous source leak from the High Pressure Receiver (HPR)\nlocated in the Processing facility engine room.  This vessels normal operating level is 11,500\npounds of liquid ammonia,  approximately 50% of it's total capacity. Although it's maximum\ncapacity is 23,000 pounds, this exceeds engineering controls and written operating procedures\nthat only allows an 80% level at any time.    \n     \n     Ammonia Quantity:                 "
