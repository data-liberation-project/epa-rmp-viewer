The program\r\nincludes engineering, education, and enforcement provisions for hazard communication, spill\r\nprevention and response, hazardous waste, universal waste and waste oil management, waste water\r\nand storm water management.\r\n\r\n2. Emergency Response Program: The Long Prairie Packing Company facility has developed an OSHA\r\nhazardous substance emergency action plan. The plan outlines specific procedures for evacuations,\r\nincident alarms and alerting. Depending upon a given situation, the Fire Department will be called to\r\nprovide emergency responders and equipment. The Fire Department will be called for all fire related\r\nemergencies. The facility has communicated the hazard of ammonia with the local fire department\r\nand LEPC. The incident commander has ultimate control of implementation of the emergency\r\nresponse plan.\r\n\r\n3. Stationary Source and Regulated Substance: Long Prairie Packing Company is a harvest and food\r\nprocessing plant located at 10 Riverside Drive, Long Prairie, MN. The building houses a processing\r\nplant used for harvest, processing, freezing, and packaging. The processed products require\r\nrefrigeration for processing and storage. Anhydrous ammonia is the primary refrigerant used. There\r\nare two (2) Machinery Rooms located on the south side of the plant and one located on the north side\r\nof the plant. This is the original ammonia refrigeration system.\r\n\r\n4. Worst Case and Alternative Release Scenarios: RMP*Comp was used to calculate the worst case\r\nand alternative release scenarios for the process.\r\n\r\n5. Five Year Accident History: There have been no reportable incidents during the past five years.\r\nHowever, the facility maintains records of all incident investigation reports regardless of ammonia\r\nquantity released into the atmosphere.\r\n\r\n6.
