In addition, it is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws.\n\nTo provide for the safety of our employees, our customers, and the general public, Bartlett provides corporate Environmental, Health, and Safety (EHS) personnel to maintain and administer comprehensive safety and environmental programs and procedures.  EHS personnel audit and monitor facility compliance with the safety standards of the company.\n\nAll locations are required to conduct their own internal audit utilizing checklist survey forms that are reviewed regularly and updated as necessary to ensure all applicable federal, state, and local regulations are covered.  EHS personnel conduct comprehensive annual audits at every location to measure regulatory compliance including those governing the safe handling and storage of anhydrous ammonia.  This requires a timely written response with the completion date of all recommendations resulting from the audits.\n\nEach location has a \u00c2\u00bfManager\u00c2\u00bf or \u00c2\u00bfSite Safety Coordinator\u00c2\u00bf as an extension of the EHS.  They are given training to monitor the day to day safe work activities, maintain the required regulatory record keeping, conduct monthly safety meetings, conduct employee training, and act as the location\u00c2\u00bfs contact with corporate EHS.  The manager or designated site safety coordinator acts as the location\u00c2\u00bfs emergency contact.\n\n\nDescription of our Facility and the Regulated Substances Handled:\n\nThe facility is a wholesale farm supply distribution center.  We store and distribute a wide variety of pesticides and fertilizers including anhydrous ammonia.  Anhydrous ammonia is received by truck and rail, is handled and stored on-site, and is a substance regulated by the EPA req"

      "SummaryText": "uiring us to comply with the Risk Management Program.  We sell anhydrous ammonia to grower customers in nurse tanks that are either 1,000-gallon or 1,500-gallon capacity.  The customer applies the ammonia into the soil as a source of nitrogen fertilizer for growing agricultural crops.  Ammonia is also used for blending into mixed grade fertilizers for crop production nutrients.\n\nThe facility maintains various size nurse tanks for customer delivery.  The number and size of tanks may vary throughout the season.   Anhydrous ammonia is stored in stationary storage tanks on site.  In addition, anhydrous ammonia may be stored temporarily at the facility in railcars while waiting to be unloaded and sold to customers.   A maximum of two railcars have been on-site at one time.  The largest single storage vessel at our facility is a railcar.\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps:\n\nThe anhydrous ammonia system is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with ASTM standards and ASME codes.  The facility complies with the ANSI K 61.1 standards, OSHA (29 CFR 1910.111), EPA\u00c2\u00bfs Accidental Release Prevention Rule, and all applicable federal, state, and local codes and regulations.\n\nOur ammonia system is protected from major releases by internal excess flow valves, check valves, relief valves, manual shutoffs, and emergency shutoff valves.  The load-out risers used for the purpose of filling the nurse tanks are protected by excess flow valves to stop the flow of ammonia if a line or hose fails.  All main storage tank valves and riser valves are locked when not in use.       \n\nOur ammonia system is inspected on a regular basis with maintenance and preventive maintenance scheduled and documented.  Liquid and vapor valves, hoses, excess flow valves, gauges, and relief valves are replaced when necessary and according to the guidelines in the ANSI standards.\n \nTraining is provided to all employees at least annually, whenever there"

The training consists of classroom lectures, current videos, testing and certification, and on the job training.\n\n\nFive-year Accident History:\n\nThere have been no accidents involving anhydrous ammonia that caused deaths, injuries or property or environmental damage, including evacuations on or off-site.\n\n\nEmergency Response Program:\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving our ammonia system, it is our policy to notify local community fire department and request that they respond to the emergency.  In preparation for this, we have coordinated with all of the local response agencies by providing information and/or facility tours to ensure that they are familiar with and properly prepared for an incident at our facility.  This will help to ensure that our community has the strategy for responding to and mitigating the threat posed by an ammonia release.  This complies with the requirement for our facility to be included in the community emergency response plan prepared under EPCRA and coordinated with our LEPC.\n\nIn addition, Bartlett has an Emergency Response and Contingency Plan for each facility that complies with the requirements of OSHA (29 CFR 1910.38 and 1910.1200).  The plan includes provisions for public notification, initial medical care, evacuations, and LEPC coordination.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:\n\nWe plan on adding additional safety features to our storage facility in 2003.  We will continue to provide our employees with ongoing annual training to ensure that they are current with safe ammonia transfer and handling procedures.  We will also provide regular inspection and maintenance on all of the ammonia equipment."
