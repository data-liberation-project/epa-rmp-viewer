These prevention program provisions are specifically intended to minimize the probability and/or consequence of any accidental pentane release from the facility and include such measures as process hazards analysis, operating procedures, training, contractors, pre-start-up safety, mechanical integrity, hot work permit, management of change, incident investigation, emergency planning and response, and compliance audits.  The facility prevention program is an ongoing system based on periodic training, incident investigations, audits, procedure revisions, and RMP updates as required to reflect facility change and RMP requirements.\n\nFive-Year Accident History:\nThe facility has had no RMP reportable accidents or releases of pentane.\n\nEmergency Response Program:\nThe facility's Emergency Action Plan is intended to produce the maximum effective response in the least amount of time.  The facility has coordinated response with the local fire station and the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) to ensure that they will respond to any accidental release from the pentane system.  The facility has also established a notification mechanism to ensure the fire station will be properly notified when any response is needed for a pentane release. Based on this coordination with the local emergency responders, the facility is not required to implement any additional RMP emergency response program requirements.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:\nThe facility is committed to ensuring its operations are safe and in accordance with all RMP requirements and has established a senior manager responsible for RMP development, implementation, and compliance.  This manager is committed to maintain the safety of the RMP covered pentane system through active adherence to the appropriate procedures and"

The management structure and oversight to ensure safety is documented in the facility's RMP and includes compliance with applicable regulations, codes and standards (OSHA PSM Standard and US EPA 40 CFR 68).\n\nSource and Federal Regulated Substances Description:\nThe facility in Salt Lake City, Utah, uses a chemical blend of iso-pentane and acetone as the blowing agent to produce foam panels to be used as building insulation.  The blend consists of varying amounts of iso-pentane and acetone and is reported as a flammable mixture. The facility includes raw material unloading and storage, material blending operations, panel production and cutting, product storage, and loading operations.  The pentane blend will arrive by truck or rail and will be stored in a 50,000-gallon horizontal tank. \n\nThe facility also has a small metal line which takes rolls of sheet metal, straightens them, and cuts the sheets to length.\n\nThe warehouse handles, stores and distributes various materials for the manufacture of building products, particularly insulation. The warehouse includes the receipt, handling, and storage of various products in small aerosol canisters containing greater than 1 wt. % of pentane as the blowing agent. The quantity of the covered products stored in the warehouse can fluctuate based on the season, therefore a conservative approach was taken in determining the maximum intended inventory for pentane. \n\nGeneral Accidental Release Pr"
