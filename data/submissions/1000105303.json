Revised versions of the City\u2019s Emergency Action Plans are provided in Section 13. The key elements of the Emergency Action Plans are as follows:\n\n\u2022\tAll plant staff (including administrative and clerical staff) is trained in the specific elements of the emergency response program.\n\u2022\tThe chlorine storage facility is equipped with electronic gas detectors and chlorine scrubbers. The gas detectors have an audible alarm and alert the City\u2019s central operations control room.\n\u2022\tIn the event of an IDLH release, or one deemed unmanageable by on-site personnel, an alarm at the facility will automatically inform the City of San Buenaventura Fire Department of the release; in addition, on-site personnel at the facility would immediately contact the Fire Department. With assistance from City staff, the Fire Department would conduct emergency response activities. City staff is trained in first aid procedures.\n\nHypothetical Accidental Release Scenarios\n\nThe Risk Management Plan must assess the downwind impacts of hypothetical accidental releases. EPA requires facilities to model the distance that a plume of released gas would travel before it dispersed to an ambient concentration equal to the \u201cToxic Endpoint Concentration.\u201d The Toxic Endpoint Concentrations for various compounds were specified by EPA, and are generally concentrations that would cause no physical harm but could interfere with people\u2019s ability to leave the area. The Toxic Endpoint Concentrations for the RMP chemicals at the facility are 0.0087 parts per million (ppm) of chlorine in air and 0.14 ppm of aqueous ammonia in air.

      "SummaryText": "Introduction\n\nThis Risk Management Program (RMP) plan for the City of San Buenaventura\u2019s (City) Avenue Water Treatment Plant (AWTP) has been prepared in accordance with the USEPA Chemical Accident Prevention Rule (Clean Air Act, Section 112-r-7, Risk Management Program), the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program and the CalOSHA Process Safety Management Standard for the chlorine disinfection system located at the facility. The amount of 19% aqueous ammonia at this facility is above CalARP threshold quantities. \nThis current 5-year RMP update is required by the Federal RMP, CalARP, and CalOSHA PSM programs due to the quantities of gaseous chlorine and 19% aqueous ammonia used and stored at the Avenue WTP. The last RMP update was prepared and submitted to EPA in 2018.\n\nFederal RMP, CalARP and PSM Applicability\n\nIn California, the state-equivalent of the Federal RMP is the CalARP program, which replaced the California Risk Management and Prevention Program (RMPP). The CalARP program requires facilities that handle regulated substances on the Federal extremely hazardous substances list (or the State list of regulated substances), in quantities greater than Federal or State threshold quantities, to submit a RMP plan. The Federal RMP, CalARP and PSM threshold quantities for chlorine are 2,500, 1,500 and 100 pounds respectively. Chlorine is subject to CalARP requirements until it is injected into water (reducing the concentration to below 1 percent). Although not regulated by Federal RMP and CalOSHA PSM regulations, 19% wt. aqueous ammonia is regulated under the CalARP program. The threshold quantity for aqueous ammonia as a gas or in solution is 500 pounds.\n\nThe City can store a maximum of 30,000 pounds of gaseous chlorine at the AWTP. In addition, the City stores a maximum of approximately 26,316 pounds of 19% wt. aqueous ammonia at the AWTP. The chlorine storage and feed system at the City\u2019s AWTP qualifies for a Program 3 Prevention Program. However,"
