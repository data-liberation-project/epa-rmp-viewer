      "SummaryText": "\nDalton Utilities' Risk Management Plan for Safe Chlorine Handling at the Land Application System involves a unified approach that integrates technologies, procedures, and management practices to monitor potential chlorine hazards and minimize the risk of accidental chlorine releases.  All applicable procedures of 40 CFR 68.170 are addressed in the plan, which seeks to provide for employee safety, public health and response agency interaction. \n\nThe Dalton Land Application System (LAS) is contained within a 9000-acre site bounded on three sides by the Conasauga River.  The site is fenced and public access is controlled.  The site consists of primarily forested land and most of the bordering property is also forested; much of it in commercial timber production.  \n\nThe LAS utilizes chlorine to disinfect treated effluent from its three wastewater treatment plants prior to land application.  The chlorine is introduced at Pump Stations B and C.  These pump stations have similar configurations and pump the disinfected wastewater out to the individual spray fields via a pipeline distribution system for spray irrigation. The chlorination process is identical at Pump Stations B and C and  includes chlorine cylinders, chlorination equipment, electrical equipment, and process specific safety equipment.  Chlorination for disinfection of treated wastewater is not part of the SIC codes listed by EPA in 68.10(d), and the municipal facility is not subject to OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) requirements.  Consequently, this qualifies the LAS chlorination process as a Program 2 process.\n\n\n\nThe Dalton Utilities' Risk Management Program is supported by the following key elements to mitigate the effects of potential chlorine release hazards:\nOperator training,\nPreventive maintenance program,\nProcess specific safety equipment,\nSafe and effective standard operating procedures,\nHazard review of equipment and procedures.\n\nFurther, Dalton Utilities has an active environmental, health an"

This review included a facility tour, overview of training program and a discussion about release response.\n\nDalton Utilities takes a proactive approach to risk management and emergency response through information sharing sessions between Dalton Utilities' employees, our HAZ-WOPER qualified emergency response contractor and local response agencies.  These preventative measures will provide for the continuous improvement of communications and will maintain effective procedures for the safe handling of and timely emergency response to potential chlorine hazards."
