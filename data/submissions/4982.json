      "SummaryText": "Jasper Water Plant\n\n     The Jasper Water Works facility (Jasper Water Plant (JWP)) treats surface water from the Warrior River for drinking.  The facility is located approximately 5 miles east of the city of Jasper, Alabama, along Hwy 69 in Walker County.  The JWP consists of several water purification treatment processes, including Chlorination, Filtration, Flocculation and Sedimentation.  \n\n     Chlorine gas has been in use for nearly a century as the choice disinfectant in the treatment of both sewage for discharge and surface and ground water for drinking.  Currently the JWP maintains a maximum inventory or 8,000 pounds of Chlorine gas.  Under EPA's Risk Management Program, Clean Air Act 112(r), any industry utilizing Chlorine, a regulated gas, above the threshold level of 2,500 pounds, must develop a Risk Management Plan and implement a Risk Management Program.  \n\n     The JWP, in implementing their Risk Management Program (RMP), is currently undergoing changes in both process design and operations, as well as improving on their emergency response preparedness plans.  The JWP recognizes the emphasis on and is pursuing optimal public involvement in response to regulated substance emergencies.  The JWP acknowledges that as a result of being in compliance with the RMP Rule, the safety of  the surrounding community as well as that of on-site workers is significantly enhanced.  From improved record-keeping, training, operating procedures to better engineering design, the JWP is dedicated to minimizing the risk of using Chlorine gas while at the same time improving the quality of local services.  \n\n     Chlorine gas is required at the JWP for disinfecting surface water pumped in from nearby Lake Guntersville, as well to add a \"polish of residual Chlorine\" to finished drinking water leaving the facility.  The JWP recognizes that Chlorine gas, if accidentally released into the environment, may cause severe injury and even death for a significant distance from the sour"

The JWP has recently adopted new policies under its RMP to prevent and prepare for the uncontrolled release of a regulated gas from the JWP.  \n\n     The JWP is currently owned by Jasper Water Works & Sewer Board in Jasper, AL. The Jasper Water Works General Operations Manager is Mr. Don Welch ((205) 221-2141).  Primary responsibility for the implementation of the RMP is under the direction of the Chief Operator of the JWP, Mr. Charles Williams.  Mr. Williams's primary responsibility under the RMP will be to oversee the training and execution of the facility's health, safety and environmental programs.  Additional individuals may be assigned responsibility for implementing individual requirements and will report to Mr. Williams on delegated matters.  Responsible individuals will communicate information to other employees involved in operation and maintenance of the regulated process involving Chlorine gas, as required.  All responsible individuals so involved will be listed by name, title and duties, in the RMP located on site at this facility.\n\n    Any material changes in the design or maintenance [except for \"replacements in kind\"] of the current regulated process will be introduced into the RMP by those delegated that authority under the guidelines of the RMP.  The public may contact the JWP by calling (205) 648-2156 or 648-4730 or the Jasper Water Works office at (205) 221-2141 for information regarding more details about the Risk Management Plan.\n\n     The JWP currently maintains up-to-date safety information related to the regulated substance, process, and equipment, including Material Safety Data Sheets for Chlorine, maximum intended inventories, and safe upper and lower temperatures, pressures and process flows for the regulated substance.

The JWP is prepared to assess and repair incidental or controlled leaks of the regulated materials but is currently not authorized to respond to uncontrolled releases of Chlorine from their facility.  Instead, the JWP has coordinated first response assistance from federally regulated Hazardous Materials (HazMat) specialists.  Currently the Jasper, Guntersville and Jasper Fire Departments have joined together for first response action should an uncontrolled release of Chlorine gas occur on the JWP site.  In coordination with local and nearby Police and Sheriffs, residents will be evacuated systematically, and as soon as decisions are made by the Emergency Coordinator (Fire Department) and others in the Emergency Chain-of-Command.    \n\n     EPA requires each regulated facility to analyze a Worst-Case Scenario release (the release of the entire contents of a regulated substance container) as well as an Alternative-Case Scenario in which the released regulated gas is brought under control at some point following uncontrolled release events.\n\n     In the Worst-Case Scenario, detailed within the facility's RMP, a scenario \nis considered in which the uncontrolled release of the entire contents of a ton container of Chlorine gas occurs.  There are no mitigation features included in this Worst-Case analysis, such as enclosed buildings or other structures, for the uncontrolled release of the regulated substance. The endpoint radius for such a release, in which injury to those exposed is potentially possible, was calculated using parameters which are facility specific as well as criteria provided by EPA.

These valves release Chlorine gas only when a vacuum is applied, hence, if a line should break in the Chlorine process manifold system the valves on the source will automatically shut off when the vacuum is lost.\n\n     Although the potential for an entire ton container of the gas to escape the Plant's boundaries is unlikely, it can happen.  The EPA requires all responders to such a release to coordinate with the local Emergency Management Agency, the Fire Department, HazMat specialists and other local authorities such as the Police Department and Sheriff's office, in order to effectuate the best plan for evacuation efforts, if needed, and other requirements to assure the greatest protection for those who may be exposed to the gas.  As described below, recommendations have been submitted regarding improved maintenance and safety, the introduction of a community siren system, as well as initial response activities developed through  coordinated efforts of the participating agencies and rescue organizations.  In the analysis of the Worst-Case scenario release the JWP did not include mitigation features such as enclosed buildings or other physical devices which might otherwise quench or disperse the released gas and reduce the endpoint radius calculated.\n\n     As part of the Worst-Case scenario Emergency Response Action the cooperating agencies considered, and is currently implementing, procedures for responding to sensitive receptors within the endpoint distance of the regulated gas.  For example, local Schools, Hospitals and other sensitive receptor sites are currently being integrated into the community's Emergency Response Plan through the efforts of the Fire Department, LEPC, Police Department and others.

USGS maps showing the effected areas within the endpoint distance are filed within the facility's RMP.  The estimated population within the 3.0 mile endpoint radius is 2,300 persons.\n\n    In the Alternative Release Scenario the JWP adopted conditions of uncontrolled release in which the failure of a check valve results in the release of the regulated gas for a period of  approximately 30 minutes.  At this time the gas is assumed to be arrested and brought under control by emergency response personnel.  The endpoint radius for Chlorine was calculated to be 1.2 miles (JWP choose a scenario provided by the AWWA's Compliance Guidance and Model Risk Management Program for Water Treatment Plants.  Mitigation features which impeded the dispersal of the released gases, such as an enclosed building, were integrated into the Alternative Release Scenario calculations.  The population of Jasper affected within the 1.2 radius is estimated at 420 persons.\n\n     Currently the regulated gas is connected to the Chlorine process within the Chlorine Room, a fire proof brick structure located approximately 50 feet from the Main Office.  The JWP maintains a Chlorine detector which is set to activate a local and remote alarm system at 1 parts per million concentration  The Chlorine building is equipped with automatic closure of all doors and relatively tight containment of the internal atmosphere (which is environmentally controlled).  In the event of a partial release of Chlorine gas it is anticipated that the bulk of the gas will be contained within the immediate vicinity of the Chlorine room.  \n\n     There have been no accidental releases of Chlorine gas beyond incidental events, such as minor leaks, in the last five years.\n\n     During the development of the JWP's RMP Program several recommendations were made which are current"
