              "Description": "The prevention program pertains to all chemicals.   The process involves two units.  One is storage and the second one is transfer of the material to a truck (for toxics) or to a flare (for flammables).  The storage unit measures are: all toxic storage tanks are located inside a secondary containment (diked) wall.  The volume of the containment is more than sufficient to contain all the contents of the storage tank.  The storage of flammables are inside pressurized compartments of a barge.  The pressure is relieved by routing the flammables to the flare for incineration.  Unit 2 is transfer operations.  During transfer spills can occur due to hose failure.  To prevent excess spills to the ground, there are shut off valves on the tanker to which the toxics are transferred to.  For transfer of flammables to the flare, the shut off is achieved by a shut down valve in the tank containing the flammables.",

The VAM tanks are equipped with secondary containment and relief valves incase of rupture.  To prevent overflow, the tank volume is noted atleast weekly and prior to loading and the volume to be added is carefully estimated and if the volume is more than 70%, the contents are added in small increments.  During transfer operations to trucks, the transfer is carefully monitored during the entire duration by atleast one facility person and it there is a spill, the transfer is discontinued immediately by closing the valves which are installed on the tanker trucks and individual tanks.  The drums are stored in a secondary containment area, capable of storing 110% of the contents of drums.  Drums are labelled and closed at all times and when it is full, the drums are sealed and are transferred as is totrucks.  The drum storage area is inspected atleast weekly. \n\nThe substances under Table 3, 68.130 are Butadiene, Butane, Butene, Propane and Propylene.  Trace amounts of these are normally contained in the tank barges which dock at the shipyard for degassing.  The storage of the flammables are temporary but often the flammables can stay in the tank barges for 1 or 2 days.  The tank barges are under pressure.  The degassing is conducted by routed the contents in the barges (vapor space in the barges) to a flare.  During the depressurization procedure, the subtances are sent from the tank barges to the flare for incineration.  There are alarms and relief valves on the tank barges if there is a leak or there are any other hazards.  There are also valves on the tank barges to shut down the flow of the flammables to the flare if there is a leak.  The transfer operation (from tank barge to flare) is carefully monitored by atleast one facility person."
