Roger Mills Gas Gathering, L.L.C. is committed to the safety and health of its employees, contractors, and visitors.  This commitment is demonstrated in the design, installation, operation and maintenance programs developed and implemented specifically for this facility.  Operation and maintenance personnel are trained in the appropriate emergency response procedures to follow in the event of an accidental release.  However, accident prevention is the ultimate goal and as such a site-specific mechanical integrity program is being implemented and maintained.\n\nFACILITY DESCRIPTION AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\nThe Crawford Station is located approximately 1.25 miles west of Hwy. 283 on county road E0800, north of Roll, OK.  It is a facility designed to separate and collect natural gas liquids (i.e. ethane, propane, butane and heavier hydrocarbons) that drop out of the natural gas carried in the gathering system pipes, and compress the remaining gas to delivery pressures.  The only process in the station that contains an above threshold quantity of a regulated substance is the NGL Storage Tank.  There are no above threshold quantity toxic substances at the Crawford Station.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\nThe Crawford Station has developed and implemented a site-specific accidental release prevention program that consists of a detailed facility mechanical integrity program and employee training program.  The mechanical integrity program was developed under the guidelines of manufacture written recommendations, recognized/generally accepted good engineering practices, industry/regulatory standards and past operation history.  Employee training was designed to ensure/document employee understanding of facility operation and maintenance requirements.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nCrawford Station "

RMGG continues to look for, develop and implement programs that will improve an employee's ability to identify and correct potential workplace hazards.  RMGG also endeavors to ensure policies, programs and procedures are developed and implemented to meet applicable laws, rules and regulations.  Employee understanding of the policies, programs and procedures is high priority.\n"
