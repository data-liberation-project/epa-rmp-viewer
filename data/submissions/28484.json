The alternative case release scenario represents an accidental release that is more reasonalbe than the worst case, but is still highly unlikely to occur.  Based on our analysis using USEPA approved methods, the alternative case release scenario for 30% ammonia solution could potentially effect offiste receptors, however there are no public off site receptors in the area impacted by the release.  There were no specific administrative controls or active mitigation measures considered in the analysis to limit the distance reported.  The passive mitigation considered in the analysis was the storage of 30% ammonia solution in an enclosed building.\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical specific  prevetnions steps:\n\nThe Garland, TX distribution warehouse is operated in strict accordance with the USEPA prevetnion program requirements.  A written management system is in place along with written operating procedures.  Our management system procedures ensure rigorous training for operations employees, numerous management checks and balances and strict attention to changes in the operations with athorough review and examnination of potnetial incidnets that could lead to an accidental release.  Ashland maintains a 24 hour corporate emergency reporting system that can speedily coordinate emergency resposne with management and quickly communicate key first aid or medical information to local health care providers.
