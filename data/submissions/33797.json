Oregon Refinery Services maintains a comprehensive training program. All employees operating the oleum process prior to June 21,1999 have been certified as having the requisite knowledge, skill and ability to safely carry out all required duties and responsibilities. Initial training is additionally provided to all new Marsulex employees. To ensure a continued safe operation of the oleum process, Marsulex documents all training provided and also provides refresher training every three (3) years, and more frequently, as required.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMechanical Integrity\r\n\r\nTo ensure that all oleum process equipment functions as designed, Marsulex, Inc.

Second, because the Oleum process is subject to the EPA's Risk Management Plan, we also take all steps necessary to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements for Program 3 processes that are set forth in 40 CFR Part 68 of the EPA. The following sections briefly describe the accident prevention programs in place at the oleum process at our facility.\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\n\r\nMarsulex, Inc. Oregon Refinery Services maintains detailed records of process safety information to ensure the safe operation of its facility. In general, Process Safety Information pertains to process chemicals, technology and equipment. Process Safety Information describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters, and equipment designs associated with the oleum process. These records ensure that all personnel understand the hazards related to the oleum process. These are accessible to all employees in Process Safety Information binders located in the control rooms and in the lunchroom.\r\n\r\n\r\nProcess Hazards Analysis\r\n\r\nMarsulex, Inc. Oregon Refinery Services conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that all hazards associated with oleum process equipment are identified and controlled. Our qualified team uses the Hazard and Operability Study methodology, also known as the Hazop, to perform its Process Hazards Analysis. This team thoroughly uses its expertise in engineering and process operations to identify process hazards. It makes all recommendations necessary to control the identified hazards. Management is responsible for addressing these recommendations in a timely manner. The Process Hazards Analyses are also made available to all affected employees in the Process Safety Information binders.

Oleum, also known as fuming sulfuric acid, is the regulated substance that is present in the oleum process at our facility. Oleum is a mixture of sulfuric acid and sulfur trioxide. The maximum expected inventory of oleum based upon our operational requirements is 1144226.95 pounds. It is used to create products used by most Americans on a regular basis. Oleum is a constituent of laundry detergent and is also used to produce white oil and computer chips.\r\n\r\n\r\nHazard Assessment Results\r\n\r\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used look up tables and equations provided by the EPA in the RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance. The following paragraphs provide details regarding the scenarios chosen.\r\n\r\nThe Worst Case Scenario associated with the toxic substance oleum involves a catastrophic release of 20% oleum due to a storage tank failure. In this scenario, 1,400,000 pounds of oleum are immediately released into the atmosphere. It then forms a pool 1 cm deep and begins to evaporate. EPA lookup tables predict that the fumes will travel 3.60 miles before the fume concentration in the air will reach a safe level at 0.01 mg/l.\r\n\r\nThe Alternative Release Scenario associated with the toxic substance oleum involves a release of 3180 pounds of oleum from a loading hose over a ten (10) minute period. EPA Lookup tables predict that the fumes will travel 0.2 miles before the fume concentration in the air will reach a safe level at 0.01 mg/l. This release is controlled by both active and passive mitigation measures, including neutralization.\r\n\r\nAt the request of the State of Ohio, Marsulex added a second alternative release scenario involving a small hole in the Oleum Storage tank.  This release is similar impact as the hose failure above.\r\n\r\n\r\nGeneral Accident Prevention Program Steps\r\n\r\nMarsulex, Inc. is committed to reducing the risk of accidental release of hazardous s"

Oregon Refinery Services maintains a written Emergency Action Plan to deal with the threat of accidental releases of hazardous materials. Because we actively participate in Lucas County's Local Emergency Planning Committee's Community Emergency Response Plan, Marsulex employees will not respond to releases of regulated substances. However, Marsulex maintains appropriate mechanisms to notify emergency responders when there is a need for an emergency response. Reportable releases will be reported within 30 minutes of discovery of the release. Those releases that pose a threat to the community will immediately be reported to the Oregon Fire Department and to 911.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\r\n\r\nSafety is of primary importance to us at Marsulex, Inc.
