Designed as a closed loop system, ammonia is circulated to each of the room cooling units and returns to the accumulators, located in the Energy Center. Heat laden ammonia vapor is pulled from the accumulators, compressed, and sent to rooftop condensers where it is cooled and liquified and re-circulated to the room cooling units. The maximum system working pressure is 175 psig. Maximum quantity of ammonia on-site is 30,000 lbs.\n\nWorst-case Scenario for a toxic substance:\n\nThe worst-case release toxic endpoint was determined using EPA's \"RMP Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration' reference tables and equations. This scenario was based on the following criteria:\n\nVessel:                         High Pressure Receiver (HPR) \nVessel Size:                 60\" x 20' 0\"\nAmount Released:        15,000 lbs.\nDuration of Release:     10 minutes\nRelease Rate:               1,500 lbs/min\nWind Speed:                 1.5 meter/sec\nAtmospheric Stability:   F\nTopography:                 Rural\nPassive mitigation:        Building Enclosure\n\nSince the HPR is housed inside the \"Energy Center\", the toxic endpoint was calculated using this enclosure as passive mitigation. The enclosure has two different ceiling heights, one section measures 40' x 40' x 18' and the other 40' x 28' x 32' for a total of 64, 640 cubic feet. There are four(4) exhausts fans rated at 4,000 cfm each providing 6 air exchanges per hour. Using the formulas provided in Chapter Four of the \"RMP Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration\" the release rate, from the building, was calculated at 300 lbs/min. with a distance to the Toxic Enpoint of 1.0 miles.\n\nUsing La"

An ammonia release under these conditions, will affect 11 people, residential and retail structures. \n \nAccidental Release and Emergency Response Policies:\n\nThe Pleasant prairie Distribution Center has established an in-house emergency response team to quickly respond to and handle releases of Anhydrous Ammonia. The established steps include initial training under the OSHA regulation 29 CFR 1910.120 'HAZWOPER'. The facility has also established annual retraining for all personnel that are on the HAZMAT team as well as periodic spill drills and plant wide evacuation drills to assure all employees are prepared in the event of an emergency. This facility has also established training with the Fire Department personnel and community Local Emergency Planning Committee. These established plans and procedures shall be periodically reviewed to assure that they are current and up to date.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps:\n\nThe Pleasant Prairie Distribution Center has not only complied with the EPA Risk Management Program but als"
