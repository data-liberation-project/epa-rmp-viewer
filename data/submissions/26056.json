Vapor from the Low Pressure Receiver # 1 (-30 \u00b0F) is sent to the booster compressors.  The vapor is compressed from low pressure ammonia vapor to an intermediate pressure vapor.  The booster compressor discharge is sent through the Low Pressure Receiver # 2 ( +15 \u00b0F) to reduce the temperature before being sent to the high stage compressors.  \n\nThe high stage compressors then take the vapor discharge from the Low Pressure Receiver # 2 and generate a high pressure vapor.  The high stage discharge is transferred to the condensers where it changes phase and becomes a high pressure liquid and is returned back to the High Pressure Receiver where the cycle can begin again.  Discharge from the high stage compressors is also used as hot gas  defrost of the evaporators.  \n\nAll refrigeration equipment was installed per American National Standards Institute (ANSI) and the process flow lines handling ammonia were designed according to American Society of Testing and Materials (ASTM) standards, and are of steel construction.

To minimize property damage.\n\nDreisbach Enterprises, Richmond  maintains a safety committee whose members include the designated emergency coordinators for the facility.  The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year.  This Plan was reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations.\n\nDreisbach Enterprises, Richmond  has coordinated emergency response efforts with the local fire department/HazMat team.  In the case of an ammonia-related emergency, it is the policy of Dreisbach Enterprises, Richmond  to evacuate and to allow the fire department/HazMat Team to respond to the emergency.  The Dreisbach Enterprises, Richmond  Chief Engineer  will be available for guidance and assistance.\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nThe refrigeration cycle begins with the transfer of high pressure liquid ammonia from the High Pressure Receiver to the Low Pressure Receivers (2), where the pressure and temperature of ammonia is reduced.  The resulting low pressure ammonia liquid flows to the evaporators to provide cooling capabilities for the cold or frozen storage rooms. \n\nAs the air is cooled around the evaporator, the heat removed from the air vaporizes the ammonia liquid inside the coils or tubes.
