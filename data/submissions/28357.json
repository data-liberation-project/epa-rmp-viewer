If one of our loaded railcars were to lose its entire contents over a ten minute period we would have an endpoint of 6.9 miles from the tank.  this was determined using the RMP Comp software.  It is to our advantage that the local village is so small and is in such a rural setting.  This limits the number of major receptors within our endpoint.  There are some schools and a prison facility within this distance, but still relatively sparsley populated.  According to population research by the Claritas website, this endpoint has a population of 12000.  While this is a large number of people,  this worst-case scenario is not only very unlikely, but almost unrealistic.                  \n\nA more realistic situation would be if an excess flow valve were to fail.  This could occur if a hose was torn from a tank that was attached to a leaving truck or wagon, and then the excess flow valve failed to close.  If this were to occur,  up to 1160 pounds per minute of ammonia could escpape from a 3 inch valve.  Assuming it took 10 minutes to get the proper saftey gear and reach the emergency shut-off valve, a total of 11,600 pounds of product could escape.   According to the RMP Comp software a loss of this type indicated an endpoint of 6 tenths of a mile.  According to population research by the Claritas website,  the population in this radius is 77 people.  While this scenario is possible, we would expect our excess flow valves to operate as intended.  And if a hose were torn off,  the spill would be limited to just the small amount of product contained in the hose.  This would limit the risk of exposure to just the immediate area.  \n\nAs a result of our safety measures and the precautions taken, we are happy to say we have had no past accident history.  While we are proud of our safe history, we are not complacent about a safe future.  We continually update our employees with annual training and tests as well as make cons"

It has been deemed that the Dallas Township Volunteer Fire Department will be the primary responder and will be in charge of any emergency situations.  We have a very close relationship with them in that it is a volunteer fire department and many of the members are not only customers, but also employees of our Monnett branch.  We are also in contact with the Crawford County Emergency Planning Commitee as well as the local Sheriff, Police, etc..  Our employees have been trained to know where to go and what to do in case of an emergency.  We also have good relationships with utilities and contractors if need be, and have designated emergency coordinators in place to help keep things calm and to direct operations until the fire department shows up.  Conveniently the fire house is adjacent to our facility, so response time would be minimal.  We also have emergency procedures in place to help the coordinators deal with several different emergency situations.  We take safety very seriously, and our history reflects that."

      "SummaryText": "Central Ohio Farmers Co-op (formerly Marion Landmark) is a farmer-owned cooperative located in North Central Ohio.  Our Monnett branch, in addition to handling grain, is also involved with providing crop services and supplies to local farmers.  Part of this supply business includes the selling of anhydrous ammonia.  Farmers use this anhydrous ammonia as a source of nitrogen for their corn.  In terms of processes, ours is a very simple one.  We purchase anhydrous ammonia in bulk and then it is transferred to smaller tanks which are then taken to the fields for application.  As far as storage, we have two tanks which hold a total of 48,000 gallons.  Taking into account the 80% maximum fill level, we actually have storage for a maximum of 38,400 gallons of anhydrous ammonia.  Occasionally when we receive the product in bulk from the manufacturer, it is possible to have up to two railroad cars full of anhydrous ammonia at our site.  This increases our onsite capacity anadditional 62,250 gallons. \n\nWhen our anhydrous ammonia storage area was established, it was inspected and certified by the State of Ohio Department of Agriculture.   Our storage tanks are locked out at all times.  What this means is that the valves are padlocked for safety and security.  In addition to locking out the tanks, there are other safety features such as excess flow valves, and pressure release valves to insure that the highest level of safety and security are maintained.  These safety features are indicative of the commitment to safety that is shared by all employees of Central Ohio Farmers Co-op from the top down.  This commitment to safety is evident by the mandatory attendance to regular safety meetings, the training updates and reviews, and an overall genuine concern for our employees well being.                                                          \n\nAs a farm cooperative located in a very small farm village, we have very close ties to our community.
