      "SummaryText": "This document contains all required information in order to meet 40 CFR 68 ?Risk Management Program?.  This document consists of the executive summary and registration data elements (68.155 through 68.185).\n\n1.0    RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nThe ConAgra Foods Dry Sausage (St. Charles ConAgra Dry Sausage) facility in St. Charles, Illinois has a good record in preventing releases of anhydrous* ammonia.  As part of their release prevention program, the plant has an excellent and very detailed preventative maintenance program.  More information about these aspects of the prevention program is discussed in Section 4.0 of this Executive Summary.\n\nThe facility has implemented an Emergency Action Plan and a HAZMAT Response Plan which provide information to safely deal with an ammonia release.  This detailed emergency response program includes procedures for handling an emergency - the established response plan and appropriate personnel involved in containing an ammonia release ? HAZMAT Team. The Emergency Action Plan coupled with the HAZMAT Response program constitute a thorough and comprehensive plan for release prevention and emergency response.  The emergency response policies at the St. Charles ConAgra Dry Sausage facility ensure that there is emergency response coverage 24 hours - 7 days per week. \n\n*From this point in the Executive Summary, anhydrous ammonia will be synonymous with ammonia.\n\n2.0    PROCESS DESCRIPTION AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe St. Charles ConAgra Dry Sausage plant produces dry sausage products.  The NAICS code for the processes at this facility is 311612.   Many areas of the plant are refrigerated to preserve the meat products.  St. Charles ConAgra Dry Sausage has one regulated substance under 40 CFR 68: ammonia.  Ammonia is used as a refrigerant in the refrigeration of the products in the various areas of the plant.\n\nThe ammonia threshold for triggering applicability to 40 CFR 68 is 10,000 pounds.  There are three separate ammo"

      "SummaryText": "nia processes located in two separate plants at the St. Charles ConAgra Dry Sausage plant.  The Plant 1 ammonia process has approximately 27,000 pounds of ammonia.  The Plant 2 ammonia process has approximately 17,000 pounds of ammonia.  The Plant 3 ammonia process has approximately 7,750 pounds of ammonia.  The Plant 1 and 2 processes exceed the threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds as set by 40 CFR 68 and thus each are regulated by the Risk Management Program.  The Plant 3 process does not exceed the threshold quantity and is not regulated under the Risk Management Program\n\n \n3.0    WORST-CASE AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system has associated hazards that can potentially affect on-site employees and the general public off-site if there is a release from the system.  Described below are the associated hazards for the regulated chemical.  Though there may be other scenarios possible, EPA only requires that one worst-case and one alternative scenario be reported for each regulated chemical. \n\nAmmonia is classified as a Group 2 Refrigerant per ASHRAE Standard 34-1989.  The dominant characteristic of this chemical is its toxicity.  It is a self-alarming chemical by its distinctive pungent odor.  Due to this odor, persons exposed to ammonia vapor will not voluntarily stay in areas of even small concentrations.  Ammonia will burn at a very narrow and high range of concentrations accompanied with a high ignition temperature.  Although ammonia is not poisonous, it is corrosive to human tissue.  Ammonia is readily absorbed into the moisture of the skin and, at high concentrations, can cause severe burns.\n\nThe risks to persons in an accidental release of ammonia include:\n\n1.    Corrosive attack of skin and other tissue (including lung tissue)\n2.    Freezing of skin and other body tissue when contacted by liquid ammonia\n3.    Eye contact\n    \n4.0    GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nSt. Charles ConAgra Dry Sausa"

      "SummaryText": "ge has developed an OSHA (PSM) program for their ammonia refrigeration system.  At St. Charles ConAgra Dry Sausage, ammonia falls under the RMP Program 3 Prevention Program which is identical to the OSHA PSM program.  EPA has said that if the process is in compliance with OSHA PSM, then it is compliance with RMP Program 3.  Thus, ConAgra?s ammonia PSM system has been reviewed and the PSM system elements are being implemented for the RMP document.  \n\nListed below are the key aspects of the ammonia prevention program:\n\nThe plant is in the process of implementing a Computerized Maintenance Management System (CMMS) for control scheduling and accomplishment of preventative maintenance on components of the refrigeration system.  \n\n5.0    FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe review of St. Charles ConAgra Dry Sausage?s accident history includes the following range of dates: June 21, 1999 ? June 21, 2004.  According to 40 CFR Part 68.42(a), there have been no accidental releases at this facility.\n\n6.0    EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nAs mentioned previously, the St. Charles ConAgra Dry Sausage facility has developed an Emergency Action Plan.  The emergency plan is a detailed document that discusses the role of employees in an emergency situation.  The plan outlines specific procedures for evacuations for plant personnel. \n\nThe Emergency Action Plan contains specific information regarding:  notification procedures, information spokesperson, evacuation instructions, personnel accounting procedures, notification of response groups, medical information, critique and follow up of the plan.\n\n7.0    PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nBased on the completed Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) for ammonia, a list of action items to improve safety was developed and their status monitored to ensure that implementation was accomplished."
