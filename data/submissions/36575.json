Facility accidental release and emergency response policy.\n     The management and employees of Corn Belt FS, Inc. - Wapella Plant are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n2.  The stationary source and the regulated substances handled.\n     The premary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient.  Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel and authorized contractors.\n     The maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia that can be stored would be 250,000 pounds, this would include the nurse tanks normally stored there.\n3.  The accidental release prevention program.\n     This facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations.  This facility has implemented the provision of Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1, published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc. as adopted by state regulation and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia.\n4.  Five-year accident history\n     The following is a list of accidental releases in the past five years that have occurred at the facility in which injury on site did occur:\n          We had an accidental release of 2.65 pounds of anhydrous ammonia on April 12, 1996.  One employee was contacted by the small amount and received emergency room treatment only.  \n           We had an accidental release of 2.65 pounds of anhydrous ammonia on October 5, 1998.  One e"
