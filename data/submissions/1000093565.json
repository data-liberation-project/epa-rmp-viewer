Facility accidental release and emergency response policy.\n\n\n\nThe management and employees of New Century FS are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n\n\n2. The stationary source and the regulated substances handled.\n\n\n\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient.   \n\n\n\nThe maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia that can be stored would be 180,000 pounds.\n\n\n\n3. The accidental release prevention program.\n\n\n\nThis facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations. This facility has implemented the provisions of Iowa Administrative Code 21-43.6 (200) Standard for the storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia, which is based upon Compressed Gas Association's (CGA's) \"American National Standard Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\" (6th edition), commonly referred to as \"ANSI/CGA G-2.1 2014\", and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\". Compliance with these regulations and on-going training of our employees make up our accident release prevention program.\n\n\n\n4. Five year accident history.    \n\n\n\na. There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that:\n\n- have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor\n\n- to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, shelter in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n\n\n5.
