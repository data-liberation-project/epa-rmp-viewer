Americold has developed their Risk Management Plan Process Safety\n\nManagement (RMP/PSM) Manuals to include and to document policies and address the implementation of these regulations. The PSM sections pertain to the prevention of accidental releases and include the Process Hazard Analysis study and procedures for operating, training, maintenance, emergency response, and others. The RMP sections pertain to management systems and include the Hazard Assessment (Offsite Consequence Analysis) Report. Federal regulations require reporting when there is a release of ammonia exceeding 100 pounds in 24 hours. State regulations require reporting when there is an accidental release of ammonia or a threat of accidental release of ammonia. Americold interprets this regulation at any release that poses a threat of injury above and beyond minor irritation to anyone. All releases and near misses are to be recorded using the incident investigation forms. All releases are to be monitored and all readings recorded. All releases and near misses are to be reviewed to develop procedures that may prevent future incidents. Any release of more than 25 ppm may result in immediately shutting down the ammonia system depending on the location of the release. The General Manager and the Facility Service Manager are to be called if not on site"

Releases less than 25 PPM shall result in immediately calling the General Manager and the Facility Service Manager, if not on site, for instructions.\n\nThere are additional full time supervisory and operational employees at this facility in addition to the\n\nMaintenance Supervisor that have been trained to conduct visual and audible inspections of the\n\nammonia system on a regular basis. They are instructed to report any condition that could result in\n\nan ammonia release immediately to the site management team.\n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE ACTIVITIES AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\n\n\nThe Americold Plant #80549 facility is located at 525 S. Kilroy Road in Turlock, California. The\n\nfacility is situated approximately one-third mile south of west Main Street and one-half mile west of\n\nHighway 99. The immediate area is primarily industrial and commercial with residential areas to all\n\nsides\n\nThe facility chills and stores a variety of food products such as vegetables, and poultry. The facility\n\noperates the ammonia refrigeration system to maintain appropriate temperatures for storing these\n\nfood products. The facility was originally built in 1985. The facility currently covers approximately\n\n19.5 acres.\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system uses ammonia for cold storage rooms and process equipment,\n\nthe ammonia inventory exceeds the Threshold Quantity for Accidental Release Prevention. The\n\nmajority of the system is located in the engine room including three low pressure receivers, the\n\ncompressors, the sub cooler, and the purger. The pilot receiver, the high pressure receiver, the heat\n\nexchangers, and the condensers are mounted outside the engine room and all evaporative are\n\nlocated in their respective cold storage rooms/areas\n\n\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT\n\n\n\nThe regulation requires that the Worst-Case Release Scenario use the ammonia quantity in the\n\nlargest vessel or pipe.

NOTE: It is important to consider that\n\nthe Worst-Case Scenario is extremely unlikely to occur since this scenario does not consider any\n\nsafety features of the system in either design or operation. In addition, the system is separated by\n\nwalls and distance. Furthermore, as the refrigerant escapes pressure will decrease reducing the\n\nrelease rate. The scenario parameters are established by the regulation to provide uniformity for\n\ndialog between the industry, community, and regulatory agencies. The regulation allows the facility\n\nto select the Alternate-Case Scenario. Americold's Prevention Program is described in the RMP/PSM Manual.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION\n\n\n\nThe RMP Prevention Program is equivalent to OSHA's Process Safety Management Program\n\n(PSM). In addition, the Americold Plant #80549 has implemented a Process Safety Management program\n\nfor compliance with the Cal-OSHA regulation. \n\nThe Prevention Program implemented is essential to help prevent or minimize the effects if a release occurs. Key objectives of Americold's Prevention Program are briefly described below.\n\n\n\n1. Maintain current and complete refrigeration system technical information. (Addressed under the\n\n    Process Safety Information Element)\n\n2. Provide thorough team evaluation of the refrigeration system. The evaluation considers a number\n\n    of potential problems including mechanical problems, human errors, and external events (e.g.,\n\n    earthquakes, impact, terrorism, theft, etc.). All safety recommendations developed by the team are\n\n    reviewed and addressed by Americold. (Addressed under Process Hazard Analysis and Mechanical                    Integrity Elements).\n\n3. Written procedures and policies that establish how the refrigeration system should be operated\n\n    and maintained and how to investigate accidental releases.

Americold\n\n    certifies operators following completion of operator training and confirmation of the operator's ability\n\n    to apply what they have learned. (Addressed under Training Element.)\n\n5. Employee involvement in the Prevention Program. This is addressed on two levels. First,\n\n    refrigeration equipment operators participate in the planning and evaluation of the Prevention\n\n    Programs (e.g., Process Hazard Analysis study team, writing and/or reviewing operating procedures,\n\n    Incident Investigation team, etc.). This involvement encourages ownership of the Prevention\n\n    Program and positively affects the operators' day-to-day activities. Second, all Americold's,\n\n    employees (direct hires, contract) receive ammonia awareness \n\n    training. Additionally, they have access to the RMP/PSM information. These activities improve the\n\n    overall safety of the employees. (Both levels are addressed under the Employee Participation\n\n    Element)\n\n6. Implementation of additional measures when changes are planned (procedural or mechanical).\n\n   These measures begin before any changes are made and may include a Process Hazard Analysis,\n\n   operator training, and Process Safety Information updates plus other measures required by the\n\n   Management of Change Procedure. If a mechanical change is required and for maintenance\n\n   contracts, Americold has a procedure for selecting a contractor based on the company's experience\n\n   and safety history. Additionally, if welding, grinding, or other Hot Work occurs close to the\n\n   refrigeration system, an Americold's Hot Work permit is required. The purpose of the permit and the\n\n   associated Hot Work procedure is to minimize the possibility of a fire. Following completion of a\n\n   mechanical change, a pre-startup safety review is required before the system can be started.\n\n   (These areas are addressed"

Responders are trained to enter an IDLH condition. Responders are also trained to the (300 PPM) Air Purifying Respirator level. Responders will assist outside agencies during larger releases. Detailed plans (emergency action plans) have been developed to assist responding facility personnel. All areas (zones) inside the building can be brought under control within 20 minutes of any ammonia emergency or breakdown if personnel are on site. Small releases can be brought under control immediately. The emergency release response plan for all releases is to gain access to the shutdown valves and switches for the system with the release. If the system shut down areas are within the ammonia release area the entire ammonia system may be shut down if appropriate. The appropriate shut down switches are identified. The Federal and California Emergency Planning Regulations considered in this program include EPA's Risk Management Plan, OSHA's Emergency Action Plan, OSHA's Process Safety Stan"
