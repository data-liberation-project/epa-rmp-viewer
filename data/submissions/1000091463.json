A key element of this commitment is the safe and proper handling of chemicals.  Controls have been implemented to prevent accidental releases of hazardous substances.  In the event of an accidental release, mitigation steps are taken to stop, control, contain and clean up the releases.\r\n\r\nThe New Bern Mill is located on 1300 acres of land along Weyerhaeuser Road, in Craven County, North Carolina.  Approximately 330 workers team up to keep the New Bern Mill safely operating at peak efficiency 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 52 weeks a year.  Chlorine dioxide is utilized at the site to bleach pulp.  This substance is regulated under 40 CFR Part 68, Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions and by OSHA 1910.119 - Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals.\r\n\r\nThe New Bern Mill's key goals are to operate in 100% compliance with existing environmental regulations which include accurate and timely reporting, and striving for steady reduction of environmental impact.  The New Bern Mill is committed to operating in a manner that is safe for its employees, the public and the environment.  Our commitment is illustrated in or environmental policy.  Our policy states that \"the company will avoid causing any significant adverse effects on public health or the environment in which it operates.\"\r\n\r\nAs part of this commitment, the New Bern Mill has established a system that includes a classroom and on-the-job training, written operating procedures, process hazard analysis, incident investigations, computer safety interlocks and maintenance guidelines to help ensure the safe use of chlorine dioxide.  The facility maintains the components of this system by conducting visual inspections on a routine basis and performing nondestructive testing of tanks and piping to ensure that any potential failures ar"

If there is an incident with chlorine dioxide, a highly trained and skilled emergency response team is on standby 24 hours a day.  The Craven County LEPC provides backup resources if needed."
