      "SummaryText": "The City of Covingtons Peak Shaving Plant, which began operations in 1970, provides gas to supplement the Citys gas distribution system during peak power demands.  Propane is used at the facility and is considered hazardous by the EPA.  Therefore, certain safety precautions are in place in handling propane to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to personal health, and to reduce the threat to the surrounding community.  The facility is owned and operated by the City of Covington.\n\nWorst Case/Alternative Case Releases\nThe EPA Risk Management Program Guidance Document for Propane Storage Facilities was used for the off site analyses and LandView III was used to estimate population and public receptors.  It should be noted that LandView III uses 1990 census data and the current population will most likely be greater than indicated.\nThe worst case release scenario is the failure of a 30,000 gallon storage tank, yielding a release of 110,000 lbs. of propane to the atmosphere.  Using the EPA tables, the distance to the endpoint of 1 psi for urban conditions is 0.4 miles.\nThe alternative or more likely release scenario is a process pipe breaking while pumping.  The EPA Guidance Document (Chapter 2, Table 5) indicates a total release of approximately 6,000 lbs. and a distance to the endpoint of 0.1 miles.\n\nAccident Release Prevention Program\nActive environmental, health and safety programs with regards to the safe handling of propane are in place at the plant. The City of Covington complies with all Federal and State regulations as well as the safety procedures outlined in the facilitys Operation and Maintenance Manual.  The plant was constructed in accordance with National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) 59.\n\nAccident History\nThere has not been an accidental release of propane at the Covington Peak Shaving Plant within the past five years.\n\nEmergency Response Program\nThe Covington Peak Shaving Plant is included in the communitys emergency respons"
