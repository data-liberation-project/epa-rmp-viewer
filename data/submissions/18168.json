      "SummaryText": "1. The Facility Policy: The owners, management, and employees of Randolph Ag. Service are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia by utilization of proper equipment, regular inspections and maintenance and training of all persons that work with that material. Should an accidental release occur, the facility has orientated the local fire department and the local emergency planning committee so they can plan for response to any release and minimize the impact of the release to the people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information: A primary activity at the facility is the storage of anhydrous ammonia for sale to the farming and agriculture community. Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, distributed for direct application as a crop nutrient. The maximum quantity stored would be 140,000 pounds in the facility's tank.\n\n3. The worst- case release scenario would be a release of the total contents of the storage tank released as a gas over ten minutes. The maximum quantity released would be 140000 pounds, which represents the volume of the storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards and company procedures. The distance to the endpoint of dispersion based on the model used is 1.16 miles.\n\nThe alternate-case release scenario anhydrous ammonia is assumed to be a release from a rupture of a 3-inch transfer hose, with 26,600 pounds released over 2 minutes. The distance to the endpoint of dispersion is .80 miles.\n\n4. The accidental release program: The facility complies with the Rules and Regulations relating to The Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia and Low Pressure Nitrogen Solutions, Equipment, Containers and Storage Facilities. These regulations administered by the Illinois Department of Agriculture are consistent with ANSI K61.1 and OSHA 29 CFR 1910.111 regarding storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia.\n\n5. The Five-year Accident History: There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia for the covered p"

The Emergency Response Program: The facility has a written emergency action plan in accordance with OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.38 and provide state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to- know information as required under SARA Title III of EPCRA. Our emergency response action plan has been reviewed with the local fire department and provided to the local emergency planning committee for the coordination in the community response planning.\n\n7. Planned changes to improve safety: Safety improvement is an on-going process at the facility. Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe practices and operations. There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
