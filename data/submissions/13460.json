      "SummaryText": "Stonington Fertilizer, Inc. is an ag supply facility handling anhydrous ammonia, liquid 28% fertilizer,\ndry fertilizer, and chemical pesticides. Anhydrous ammonia, the only product covered by the Risk\nManagement Plan rules, is only handled in bulk about 45 to 60 days a year in the fall. At other times of the year our bulk facility is kept well below the threshhold level of 10,000 pounds. Our bulk storage tank has     \na maximum capacity of 12,000 gallons and is only filled to 85% full. Therefore, the maximum amount of product on hand in bulk is about 52,000 pounds.\n\nThe Company has always tried to safely handle all products and comply with all applicable rules and \nregulations for handling fertilizers and chemical pesticides. We have invested several hundred thousand dollars in a first class containment facility for our chemical pesticide business and liquid 28% fertilizer bulk storage tank. We always maintain our anhydrous ammonia equipment in top condition. We also try to have our employees attend training provided by our state trade association in all related areas including the anhydrous ammonia safety school which is put on annually. We have been fortunate enough to have maintained a stable workforce over the years thereby providing us with a group of well trained, experienced employees.As a result of our investment in equipment and maintenance and our havng an experienced, well trained workforce, Stonington Fertilizer, Inc. has been fortunate enough to avoid any reportable accidents in over 17 years in business.\n\nOur exposure in a worst case scenario for anhydrous ammonia would be limited to not more than 52,000 pounds and this would be further limited to a period of 45 to 60 days annually. Such an incident could only occur if the bulk tank ruptured (highly unlikely) or a valve attached directly to the tank was broken off.In the unlikely event that one of these incidents occurred there is only a small population of people that would be exposed to the hazard du"

      "SummaryText": "e to our rural location. There are only 6 homes located within 1.5 miles of our facility and these are scattered in different directions . Therefore,in our opinion the impact of a worst case incident on populations outside the facility would be minimal.\n\nAny alternative case incidents would be very minor. Such an incident would involve a hose or valve failure beyond the bulk tank itself and could be quickly controlled by shutting off valves at the tank.Such an incident would result in less than 1,000 pounds of product escaping and should have no impact on any population outside of the facility.\n\nStonington Fertilizer, Inc. is committed to continuing with its program of maintenance and training and thereby continue with its excellent safety record. We will continue to do our best to comply with the rules and regulations promulgated by the EPA, OSHA, and other government agencies in order to provide the agricultural inputs needed to help farmers feed the world in the safest possible manner."
