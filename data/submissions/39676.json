Chlorine is considered hazardous by EPA; therefore, certain safety precautions are observed when handling chlorine to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to the health of the employees at this facility, and to reduce the threat to nearby members of the community.  Safety precautions followed by the facility in the use and handling of chlorine come from the recommendations of the Chlorine Institute as well as the recommendations of its suppliers, who are the manufacturers of chlorine.\n\nIt is this facility's policy to adhere to applicable federal, state, and local laws and regulations.  This facility complies with the OSHA Process Safety Management standard and trains its employees to perform emergency response to hazardous materials incidents in accordance with the OSHA HAZWOPER standard.  In addition, the facility has implemented the NC State Pesticide Storage Contingency Plan and has developed a Hazardous Materials Management Plan, all of which address prudent management of the facility?s hazardous materials and emergency response procedures.  These plans outline who should be contacted and what steps should be taken in the event of an emergency.  If an emergency were to occur, it is this facility's policy to alert the following outside agencies:  Hamlet Fire Department, Richmond County Sheriff's Dept, the NC Highway Patrol, and Richmond County Medical Services.\n\nThe stationary source and regulated substances handled:\n\nThis facility is a chemical manufacturer of agricultural chemicals and bleach.  Chlorine is an ingredient used in the manufacture of these products.  Chlorine is brought onsite in railcars.  The railcars are maintained inside the fenced area of the facility.  Only one railcar is hooked up to the process at any one time.\n\nChlorine detectors have been installed at each railcar unloading point.  In addition, c"

Since detection should occur soon after a leak begins, offsite impacts should be minimal if any at all occur.\n\nThe chlorine supply system consists of the railcars onsite and associated piping, valves, and detection equipment.  In accordance with the recommendations of the Chlorine Institute and our chlorine suppliers, there is a safety shutoff device at the unloading valve on the railcar being unloaded, a safety shutoff valve where the railcar transfer hose attaches to the fixed piping of the plant system, and a safety shutoff valve midway to the process in the event of a problem.  These valves can be activated from multiple remote areas of the facility thereby shortening the release time involved with potential chlorine releases.  There are two chlorine \"C\" kits available for handling railcar emergencies.  Piping has been labeled and color-coded to minimize misidentification.\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and the specific prevention steps:\n\nThis manufacturing facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule, OSHA's PSM rule and all applicable federal, state, and local laws.  The facility follows the guidelines of the Chlorine Institute and its suppliers in the use and handling of chlorine.  This includes the design of piping installations, materials of construction, release detection equipment, maintenance procedures, emergency response procedures, and release mitigation equipment and installations as well as normal process activities.  The emergency response plan deals with the safety of the employees in the event of an accident and minimizing the release of any chemical onsite, including chlorine.\n\nEach employee receives hands on training in the use of emergency mitigation equipment, personal protective equipment, and communications equipment.  Each employee receives training in all aspects o"

Training is conducted throughout the year on various aspects of the routine handling and emergency response aspects associated with Chlorine.  Written procedures have been developed that address all chlorine handling activities from bringing the railcar onto the facility, connecting to and disconnecting from the railcar, to transferring chlorine from the railcar into the process, and includes what to do if abnormal circumstances occur.  Employees are observed when performing tasks related to the process and given feedback on their understanding and adherence to written procedures.\n\nOn-site training has been conducted with outside agencies that would be responding to emergencies.  This facility provides the outside agencies familiarization of the facility and potential hazards.  The agencies that would be contacted for an emergency are the Hamlet Fire Department, the Richmond County Sheriff's Department, the NC Highway Patrol, and the Richmond County Emergency Medical Services. \n\nFive year accident history:\n\nThere has not been an accident involving chlorine that caused death, injury, property or environmental damage, or evacuations at this facility in the past five years.\n\nThe emergency response program:\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving chlorine, employees can immediately shutdown the transfer operation from a remote location, which sounds an on-site emergency alarm.  If further action is required to stop a railcar release, employees can install a C-kit on the railcar.  It is this facility's policy to notify the following outside agencies in event of emergency:  Hamlet Fire Department, Richmond County Sheriff's Department, the NC Highway Patrol, and the Richmond County Emergency Medical Services.\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety:\n\nThis facility is constantly looking for ways to improve upon the existing safety systems and on safety for both the employees and members of th"
