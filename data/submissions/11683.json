These programs enable our facility to prevent the \noccurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant \nreleases of toxic substances as well as fires, explosions, \nand other types of catastrophic accidents. Overall, these \nprograms prevent accidental fatalities, injuries and \nillnesses and avoid physical property damage.\nOur safety programs are applied to any activity involving \nhazardous chemicals including any use, storage, \nmanufacturing, handling, or the on-site movement of such \nchemicals, or combination of these activities. Any group of \nvessels which are interconnected and separate vessels which \nare located such that a hazardous chemical could be \ninvolved in a potential release shall be considered a \nsingle process.\n\nOur safety programs prevent accidents because they focus on \nthe rules, procedures, and practices which govern \nindividual processes, activities, or pieces of equipment. \nThese rules are detailed and improved as necessary. They \nare also communicated to and accepted by all employees at \nthe facility.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF PROCESS\n\nThe London Facility is a milk processing and storage\nfacility.  The facility uses ammonia in an industrial refrigeration system\nto maintain temperatures in milk tanks, coolers, ice builder, and chillers. \nAmmonia refrigeration is the only process subject \nto the Risk Management Legislation. \n\nWORST CASE SCENARIO\n\nF"

Under worst-case weather conditions, \nammonia could travel 1.6 miles before dispersing enough to \nno longer pose a hazard to the public. This scenario is \nunlikely for the following reasons: worst- case weather \nconditions are uncommon; the vessel is enclosed in a \nbuilding that would withstand and help to contain such a \nrelease; industry standards for the manufacture and quality \ncontrol of pressure vessels; ammonia is not corrosive in \nthis service; pressure safety valves limit operating \npressure in this vessel; the accident prevention program in \nplace at the facility including the mechanical integrity \nprogram for regular maintenance, inspection and testing, \nand replacement of equipment, if necessary; installed \nammonia sensors in the system to warn of leaks; alarms and \nthe auto-dialing system in place to warn operating \npersonnel of process upsets; and the emergency response \nplan and equipment in place at the facility.\n\n\nALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nFailure of a distributor tube on one of the milk cooler \nevaporators would result in a release of 720 lbs. of ammonia over a \ntime period of sixty minutes. Under common weather conditions, ammonia \ncould travel .1 miles before dispersing enough to no longer pose \na hazard to the public. This particular scenario was chosen as \nan alternative because it is in an area of the \nplant where it could be struck and result in a release. \nThis scenario is unlikely for the following reasons: all \nforklift drivers are made aware of the dangers of ammonia and are \nproperly trained; the accident prevention program in place at the facility \nincluding operating procedures to have personnel present at \nall times during any forklift use, and the mechanical \nintegrity program for regular maintenance, inspection and \ntesting, and replac"

      "SummaryText": "ement of equipment, if necessary; and \nthe emergency response plan and equipment in place at the \nfacility.\n\nACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere has been one reportable accident at the facility in the past five years.  The incident occurred on June 8, 1997.  A maintenance man was performing the replacement of a valve.  The valve was removed, and one of the connecting lines was subject to ammonia pressure.  As a result the line began to leak.  The cooler area was evacuated and the maintenance men dressed in proper personal protective gear and returned to the scene and stopped the leak.  The property damage was an estimated $250,000.  (This is the cost of all of the milk that was contaminated as a result of the incident.  No physical damage to the building or any equipment was encountered.)  The bulk of the leak remained on the property.  The grass on the front lawn was distressed at the time but has since recovered.  There were no public evacuations as a result of the incident.  As a result of this incident, the facility has updated its maintenance programs, training, and emergency response plans.  There have been no other incidents since the new prevention programs have been in effect.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThis facility's emergency response program is based on the \nOSHA requirements for Emergency Action Plans (29 CFR \n1910.38 and 1910.119) and HAZWOPER (29 CFR 1910.120). We \nhave trained employees for emergency response and maintain \na written emergency response plan.\n\nThis plan is coordinated with the Local Emergency Planning \nCommittee (LEPC) and the local fire department. We conduct \nannual drills for implementation of the emergency response \nplan at the facility with the participation of the LEPC and \nthe fire department. The facility is equipped with a siren \nto warn plant personnel of an emergency. The last training at \nthe plant was on October 21, 1998."
