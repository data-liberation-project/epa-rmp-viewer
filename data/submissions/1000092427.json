      "SummaryText": "1. Overview\n\n\n\n  The Zinus USA, Inc. (Zinus) facility located in McDonough (Henry County), GA will act as a production facility for foam mattresses. The facility will be located at an existing building located at 830 Highway 42 South, McDonough, Henry County, Georgia. \n\n\n\n At the McDonough facility, chemicals arrive via truck and are stored on-site. Production for the site will start with memory foam mattresses, otherwise referred to as polyurethane foam or slab foam. The slab foam manufacturing takes place when ingredients are pumped into the slab foam machine. Combinations of methylene diphenyl diisocyante (MDI), toluene diisocyante (TDI), polyols (long chain) low vapor pressure alcohols, additives, catalysts, and a blowing agent are mixed in a dispensing head, then transferred to a laydown trough. The polyols used have very low vapor pressures (less than 0.1 mm Hg at 20 C), high molecular weights, and high boiling points of 300 F or greater. As a result of the chemical reaction and the low vapor pressures, the TDI components, polyols, and small quantities of catalysts become part of the produced foam.\n\n\n\n  The trough is supported by a slab conveyor. The two compounds (TDI and MDI) have similar chemical structures and behaviors during the slab foam manufacturing process. It is expected that TDI will be used in about 70% of the production, and MDI the remaining 30%. As foam moves across the line, it expands due to a blowing agent and chemical reactions between TDI, polyols and catalyst. The foam is set in a five (5) ft wide by five (5) ft tall trough, which equates to about five (5) mattresses per slab. This is many times larger in volume than the initial volume of liquid mixture discharged from the mixing head. When the foam begins to rise it is soft, flexible, and initially quite hot from the reaction of the ingredients. \n\n\n\n  When the slab nears the end of the line it is cooler and rigid enough to be cut into \"blocks\" of foam about 6 to 8 ft long.

      "SummaryText": "hs of the foam are cut, and those sections are transferred by fork truck to a nearby area to complete the setting process. When a foam block is \"set\", which is typically within 24 hours, it is stacked with other blocks to await further processing into practical lengths and thicknesses as needed for the mattresses being assembled.\n\n\n\n  TDI will be stored in three (3) 50-ton tanks in the chemical storage building. The tanks have an inner diameter for 9.186 ft (2.8 meters), and a height of 22.474 ft (6.85 meters).\n\n\n\n  The Risk Management Program (RMP) provisions apply to processes at Zinus USA Inc. as they involve a listed flammable or toxic chemical at or above the specified threshold quantities listed in 40 CFR 68.130. TDI (Toluene 2,4-diisocyanate [CAS # 584-84-9], Toluene 2,6-diisocyanate [CAS # 91-08-7], and Toluene diisocyanate [unspecified isomer, CAS # 26471-62-5]) is a regulated toxic chemical under 40 CFR 68.130 with a threshold quantity (TQ) of 10,000 lbs. TDI will be stored in quantities exceeding the TQ.  Zinus USA Inc.'s covered process is eligible for Program 2 requirements as it does not meet either of the requirements for Program 1 or Program 3 [40 CFR 68.10(c)]. \n\n\n\n2. Prevention of Accidental Releases\n\n\n\n  In order to prevent accidental releases, the Zinus USA Inc. team underwent a robust RMP \"what-if\" analysis for receiving and the transfer of TDI at our onsite dock areas to our TDI storage vessels in the tank farm. After receiving the material, our analysis then examined the TDI transfer from our tank farm to our Laaderburg foaming machine.  Outcomes from this process identified the need for visual, routine and preventative maintenance checks, start-up/shut-down and operating procedures.  To mitigate the risk, Zinus USA Inc implemented procedures that provide expectations that cover receiving TDI from of our suppliers and expectations of the process of unloading TDI at Zinus USA Inc.  During the analysis of the overall transfer system process, we "

      "SummaryText": "have implemented a self-contained TDI unloading area with a distinct hose tie-in from our other unloading areas to prevent inadvertent mixing at the tank farm with a valve closure process at the unloading area that is done prior to filling to fully contain spilled TDI material. When loading the tank farm TDI vessels our operators receive real time information on aspects of filling level and pressure readings with the venting process at each vessel while a truck at the dock is unloading.  In the tank farm, the vessels are monitored and have automatic shut off systems in place to prevent overfill.  Calibrated leak detection is present at the top and bottom of all vessels to alert operators of any potential VOC IDLH conditions that may be present.\n\n\n\n  Our \"what-if\" analysis extended to the transfer of TDI from the tank farm to the Laaderburg foaming machine.  Zinus USA Inc has also placed a calibrated leak detection device at the Laaderberg head where the chemicals in the process are mixed to provide forewarning in the event a malfunction occurs that could lead to a leak and subsequently an increase in VOC that would require evacuation. Outcomes from this process identified the need for visual, routine and preventative maintenance checks, start-up/shut-down and operating procedures.  In addition, Zinus USA Inc. will not only develop and continuously improve our existing aforementioned procedures, we continue our orientation and job specific training with current and future employees that cover actions taken in the event of an accidental release in the process. \n\n\n\n3. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\n  The only RMP-listed toxic chemical and covered process that is present at the Zinus USA Inc. McDonough facility is TDI.  The term \"process\" is defined in ?68.3 as:\n\n\n\n... any activity involving a regulated substance including any use, storage, manufacturing, handling, or on-site movement of such substances, or combination of these activities.

TDI Unloading - Offload liquid TDI from truck trailer into three TDI tanks (TDI Unloading Area)\n\n?  TDI Storage and Conditioning - Store and condition TDI in three TDI storage tanks (T2201-JA, T2201-JB, T2201-JC in Foam Bulk Storage Room).\n\n?  TDI Feed to Foaming Plant Mixer - deliver liquid TDI from TDI tanks to a Laaderberg MultiMax foaming plant.\n\n?  Foaming Plant Mixer Through Foaming Tunnel - produce flexible polyurethane foam from a reaction involving TDI, water, polyol, and additives, in the presence of a catalyst in the Laader Berg MultiMax foaming plant.\n\n\n\n  The remaining areas of the McDonough facility (bulk unloading and storage in Foam Bulk Storage Room of other materials, foam block curing area, mattress warehouse), are not covered process areas. TDI is converted to polyurethane foam in the Laaderberg foaming plant because the foam mixture contains significantly more than a stoichiometric amount of polyol to react with all the TDI and catalyst when forming the polyurethane foam. Therefore, TDI is no longer present in significant concentration downstream of the foaming plant.\n\n\n\n  The location of the TDI storage tanks was determined to be 33.418306? Latitude, -84.147639? Longitude (NAD 83: Zone 13N) using ArcGIS, converted to decimal degrees using http://www.rcn.montana.edu/Resources/Converter.aspx.

Therefore, the inspection and testing procedures do not specify the particular craft skills (e.g., basic valve assembly/disassembly) unless such details are warranted due to equipment-specific or safety-related considerations. Each preventative maintenance activity required by the inspection and testing plan has an associated frequency at which the task needs be performed. Maintaining the inspection and testing procedures is the responsibility of the Maintenance Manager or their designee.  \n\n\n\n  Equipment monitoring and evaluation is essential to reduce the likelihood of in-service equipment failure and, thus, maintain the mechanical integrity of the process.
