      "SummaryText": "1.  Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nProdica's Kennewick Plant is comprised of the three neighboring areas, Kennewick, Hedges, and Finley Facilities.  The Kennewick Plant along with the West Sacramento, Rivergate, and Fresno Facilities constitute the integrated operation known as Prodica Manufacturing.The Prodica Kennewick Plant - Hedges Facility  handles anhydrous ammonia and aqua ammonia which are considered hazardous materials and are regulated substances under the Federal Accidental Release Program (ARP) and are considered in this Risk Management Plan (RMP).  The properties of these chemicals make it necessary to observe safety precautions in handling them to prevent human exposure, and to reduce the threat to the facility's workers and nearby memebers of the community.  It is the facility's policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and State of Washington rules and regulations.  The prevention of accidental releases depends on adherence to the procedures used to handle anhydrous ammonia and aqua ammonia; the safety devices and systems designed and constructed into the facility; and the training of the pertinent personnel. The various programs and documentation are found in the facility's comprehensive loss control system. \n\n2.  Description of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nAt the Kennewick Plant, Hedges Facility anhydrous ammonia is received and stored at the Hedges Facility as a refrigerated liquid in two insulated atmospheric storage tanks.  Ammonia is received by barge from Rivergate on the Columbia River, by pipeline from the Finley Facility and by rail-car from other sources.  Anhydrous ammonia is shipped from the Hedges Facility by tank truck, rail-car, barge and pipeline.  Ammonia is transported to the Kennewick Facility via pipeline.  When loading tank trucks, rail-car or exporting through the pipeline, the ammonia is heated.   When ammonia is loaded to a barge, it is pumped directly from the stora"

Anhydrous ammonia is also mixed with water at the Hedges Facility to form aqua ammonia and shipped by tank truck.\n\nAdditionally, N-pHURIC (a soil amendment) is manufactured at the Hedges Facility.   N-pHURIC is produced using urea and sulfuric acid.  Aqua ammonia is produced at the Hedges Facility by mixing anhydrous ammonia with treated water (soft water).  Storage capacity exists at the Hedges Facility for aqua ammonia.   Both products are shipped by truck. These products are distributed from the Hedges Facility throughout the western United States, mainly for agricultural use.\n\n3a.  Worst Case Release Scenario\n\nThe Worst Case release scenario for interconnected equipment must consider the maximum contents of each vessel or pipeline that contains a regulated substance above the threshold quantity. Administrative controls may be take into account when determining maximum quantity.  In addition, smaller quantities of the regulated substance handled at higher process temperature or pressure must be considered if such a scenario would result in a greater distance to an end-point beyond the stationary source boundary.  The Worst Case scenario did not consider any administrative control to limit the amount of regulated substance in any subject vessel.  The aqua ammonia storage tank F-500, with aqua ammonia, yields the greatest distance to the end-point and is designated as the Worst Case release scenario.  The distance to the end-point of 200 ppm for the Worst Case scenario, determined by RMP*COMP, is beyond the boundaries of the stationary source.\n\n3b.  Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nThe Alternative Release scenario for anhydrous ammonia, as submitted, is the most credible release scenario with the greatest distance to toxic endpoint.  This is the continuous release of liquid anhydrous ammonia from a railroad car or tank truck loading arm due to sudden disconnection.  This results in the release of gaseous ammonia at the "

This is the continuous release of the 25% liquid aqua ammonia from the aqua ammonia circulation pump G-502A or G-502B due to complete seal failure.  This results in the release of gaseous ammonia from the 77 degrees Fahrenheit aqua ammonia liquid at the rate of 658 lb/min for 20 minutes.  The distance to the end-point of 200 ppm for the Alternative Release scenario for aqua ammonia, determined by RMP*COMP, is beyond the boundaries of the stationary source.\n\n3c.  Administrative Controls\n\nAdministrative controls are in place to prevent accidental releases.  Additional administrative controls, to limit the distances for each reported scenario, exist to minimize the amount of anhydrous ammonia and aqua ammonia, if an accidental release were to occur.  These administrative control are inherent in the operational procedures for the equipment, processes and systems that use anhydrous ammonia and aqua ammonia, as well as the training provided to the operators of these processes and systems.\n\n3d.  Mitigation Measures\n\nMitigation measures for each reported scenario exist that minimize the amount of anhydrous ammonia and aqua ammonia released to a minimum, if a release were to occur. The mitigation measures are based upon the design, inspection, testing, and maintenance of the processes, systems and related equipment and components that use anhydrous ammonia and aqua ammonia.\n\n4.  General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe facility complies with all applicable federal and state codes and regulations.

The implementation of PSM, Administrative Procedures and Safe Work Practices represent the facility's main active commitments to an accidental release prevention program.\n\n5.  Five-Year Accident History\n\nThere have been no accidents at the subject stationary source to be reported in this RMP in the previous five-year history of the facility.\n\n6.  Emergency Response Program\n\nThe details of the Emergency Response Program for the anhydrous ammonia and aqua ammonia processes at the facility are contained within two documents.  One is the Emergency Preparedness Action Plan that contains all of the emergency response program elements.  It is intended to be a compliance, reference and training guide.  The other is the On Scene Incident Management Guide which is a field guide for response actions based on the chemical involved.  It is intended to be used by the response personnel while responding to an emergency event.  The Emergency Response Program incorporates public notification and alert systems and procedures for notifying personnel at the facility to shelter-in-place or evacuation if required. Both the shelter-in-place and evacuation procedures have designated assembly areas and personnel accounting methods included. The facility has a qualified emergency response team trained in accordance with HAZWOPER 29 CFR 120. The facility conducts internal emergency drills and joint drills with the Fire Department.\n\n7. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\nThere are two commitments made under the Process Hazard Analysis element of the Process Safety Management (PSM) program to be completed.
