Ammonia is the only hazardous chemical used at this facility that is subject to the CalARP program or federal RMP requirements.\n\nThis facility recognizes the hazards associated with the use of highly hazardous chemicals.  As a reflection of our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws and regulations, we submit this plan to address the hazards inherent with the use of ammonia.  Our program addresses safety precautions regarding the handling and operation of this covered system as well as proper training for those who operate and maintain the system.  The company training policy requires that all employees will be properly trained for a job position before assignment to that job.\n\nOur accidental release prevention program is clearly defined by the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) Program for this facility.  This prevention program follows industry-recommended standards for preventing unnecessary human exposures and reducing the threat to the health of our employees as well as to members of the community and the surrounding area.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle these chemicals, the safety devices inherent in the design of this facility and its processes, and the training that we provide our personnel.  This Plan is updated as required by law.\n\nOur Emergency Action Plan (EAP) details the response this facility will take as a result of an uncontrolled release of ammonia.  The Plan includes procedures for notification of the local emergency responders.  This EAP also includes a specific protocol for responding to an ammonia release and assigns an Emergency Coordinator to implement the response.  This Plan is current and updated as required by law and conforms to the requirements for an Emergency Action Plan"

The facility lies approximately 500 yards west of State Highway 99 and 500 yards north of State Highway 120 near the intersection of the two highways.  The facility is situated in an area comprised primarily of light industrial facilities, commercial and office areas, some agricultural lands, and residential areas.\n\nThis facility stores ice cream products for distribution under approximately 98,000 square feet of total warehouse space, with approximately 70,000 square feet of refrigerated space.  The remaining areas include office areas, the control room, and the engine room.  There is no manufacturing at this facility.\n\nThe distribution center will employ 65 people and will operate six days per week.  The hours of operation will vary from a two-shift schedule 17 hours per day to a full 24-hour operation, depending on the season.\n\nThe following history was extracted from the Dreyer\u00bfs Inc. website (www.dreyers.com):\n\nDREYER\u00bfS HISTORY\n\nDreyer\u00bfs American Dream\n\nWilliam Dreyer began his love affair with ice cream in 1906 when, as a galley boy, he earned the prestigious job of making a frozen dessert to celebrate his German ship\u00bfs arrival in America.  After a brief career making ice cream in New York, he settled in northern California and began a 20-year apprenticeship with ice cream makers such as National I"

Over the next two decades, he taught ice cream courses at the University of California and served as an officer in the California Dairy Industries Association. \n\nGrand Beginnings\n\nDreyer found a business partner and kindred spirit in renowned candy-maker Joseph Edy after moving to Oakland, California.  Dreyer\u00bfs ice cream expertise and Edy\u00bfs candy-making acumen created a winning combination. Their small ice cream factory on Grand Avenue quickly became a gathering place.  \u00bfGrand\u00bf has been part of the company name ever since \u00bf both as a reminder of the company\u00bfs birthplace on Grand Avenue and a declaration of the outstanding quality of their ice cream.\nThe Birth of Rocky Road\n\nAt the time of Rocky Road\u00bfs birth in 1929, almost all ice cream was made in three flavors \u00bf vanilla, chocolate, and strawberry \u00bf and was always served as sundaes.  Dreyer added walnuts (later replaced with almonds) to his chocolate ice cream and, using his wife\u00bfs sewing shears, cut marshmallows into bite-sized pieces to make the first batch of Rocky Road. Dreyer and Edy picked a flavor name to give folks something to smile about in the face of the Great Depression.  Rocky Road became America\u00bfs first blockbuster flavor and remains one of the best-selling flavors of all time.  Dreyer invented a number of other flavors that are still made today, including Toasted Almond and Peppermint Stick.\n\nChange & Growth\n\nIn 1946, William Dreyer\u00bfs only son joined the ice cream business and Joe Edy focused on his candy business.  In July 1947, Edy and Dreyer officially dissolved their partnership.  The Dreyers opened a state-of-the-art ice cream plant in 1948.  In 1963, Dreyer\u00bfs son sold the company to his key officers \u00bf Al Wolff, Bob Boone and Ken Cook.  Dreyer remained active in the company until his death in 1975. \n\nThe company was purchased in 1977 by"

These include the description of all system and equipment information, process hazard analysis, operator training, contractor qualification, operating procedures, pre-startup safety review, hot work permitting, management of change, mechanical integrity, incident investigation, compliance audits, and emergency response.\n\nThose who operate, maintain, or monitor the system will be trained to understand the principles of ammonia refrigeration and ammonia properties, an understanding of the process equipment and proper operating and maintenance procedures, recognition of abnormal conditions and the steps to correct deviations, and emergency shutdown procedures as appropriate to the level of involvement each employee will have with the process.  Contractors that perform maintenance or that design changes to the system will be qualified by the facility based upon their experience and safety record before being selected to provide such services.\n\nThe general safety program includes hazardous communication, forklift operation, first aid, emergency response, and additional programs as necessary to maintain a safe operation.\n\nTHE FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThis process is a new installation and, therefore, has no history at this time.\n\nTHE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nEmployees are trained to understand the requirements of the Emergency Action Plan.  The Emergency Action Plan includes release notification for emergency responders and the procedures for evacuation.  The Emergency Coordinator implements the response in coordination with the local emergency responders (i.e. the fire department).  It is the policy and practice to conduct evacuation drills twice per year.\n \nP"

      "SummaryText": "LANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nA Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) was performed as required prior to initial startup of the system.  The PHA team developed a list of recommendations to improve safety by reducing potential hazards of the process.  All recommendations were implemented, deemed unnecessary since no improvements to safety would result, or planned for implementation at a later date.  Upcoming events include:\n\n1.  Training of employees to conduct daily monitoring of system conditions\n2.  Minor modifications to PLC control logic for pumps"
