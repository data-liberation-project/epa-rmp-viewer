This commitment is demonstrated by the amount of resources invested in accident prevention, such as training of personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.\n\nOur policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances and adhere to all applicable Federal, State and local rules and regulations.  Our site HSE Management System Commitment and Policy Statement mirrors our corporate guidelines to address such matters and is signed by the site manager and local union president. As part of this commitment, the SDPRC has established an HSE management system to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility that includes the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances.  One component of this system is a risk management program (RMP) that provides the basis for managing risks at the site.  The RMP complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency?s (EPA?s) regulation 40 CFR part 68 and the Occupational Safety & Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) 1910.119 standard. \n\nHowever, if a release does occur, our trained emergency response personnel will respond to control and contain the release to minimize impact to our employees and the public.  The site emergency response plan has multiple layers of response initiatives depending on the type of release and includes the requirements specified in the RMP, PSM as well as Shell corporate guidelines.  The facility maintains an active Emergency Response Team that is on call at all times to respond to accidental releases.

Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the Refinery and addresses each accident prevention program element.  In addition, SDPRC has a number of initiatives under way that address process safety and employee safety.  These initiatives include forming teams to promote both process and personal safety.  The teams typically have members from various areas of the plant, including operations, maintenance, engineering, and plant management.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nThe Shell Deer Park Refining Company maintains a variety of technical documents that are used to help sustain safe operation of the process by using the information to help train employees, perform process hazard analyses and design and maintain process equipment.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis information.  Specific departments within the Refinery are assigned responsibility for  keeping this process safety information up-to-date.  A table summarizing the reference documents and their locations is readily available to help employees locate any necessary process safety information.\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in Material Safety Data Sheets.  This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals. "

      "SummaryText": " For specific process areas, the Refinery has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g. temperature, level, composition) in a Key Process Parameters Document.  The Refinery ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g. automated shutdown systems).\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nThe Shell Deer Park Refining Company (SDPRC) has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled. Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to assure the risks have been reduced to as low as reasonably practicable.\n\nSDPRC primarily uses a hazard evaluation technique called hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis to perform these evaluations.  HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as incident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes it is necessary.\n\nThe HAZOP team findings are forwarded to local management for resolution.  Implementation of corrective actions to respond to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All corrective actions taken in response to the PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\nTo help ensure that the process hazard controls and/or process hazards do no eventually deviate significantly f"

These periodic reviews are conducted at least every five years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.  Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration and the final resolution of the findings are documented and retained.\n\nAnother process used by the site is the use of the Shell Hazard and Effects Management Process (HEMP) under HSE management systems to evaluate HSE risks.  The process evaluates risks to determine the measures necessary to control those risks.  The HEMP process comprises four major elements which are identify, assess, control and recover.  It also encompasses the HSE management system elements of  implementation, monitoring and corrective action.  \n\nOperating Procedures\n\nThe Shell Deer Park Refining Company maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process.  These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new employees.  These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.  The procedures are maintained current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.\n\nIn addition, the Refinery maintains a Key Process Parameter Document that addresses response to exceeding the upper or lower limit for specific process or equipment parameters.  This information, along with written operating procedures, is readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safety perform their job tasks.\n\nTraining\n\nTo co"
