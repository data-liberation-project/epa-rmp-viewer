This is evident due to the outstanding safety record we have in handling anhydrous ammonia. Our farmer customers, community and employees are all very important to us and we strive on a continuous basis to improve our operations.\n\nThe primary activity at our ammonia facility is the recieving of anhydrous ammonia by truck, storing that ammonia and then transfering the ammonia to nurse tanks. The farmers then take the nurse tanks from our faciities and apply the anhydrous ammonia (which contains 82.2% nitrogen) to their fields. The maximum quanity of anhydrous ammonia stored at our facility is 53,000 pounds due to tank design standards.\n\nThe worst case scenariao would be the release of the total contents of our largest tank, as a gas, during a 10 minute time span. The maximum quanity released would be 53,000 pounds from our 12,000 gallon tank. This represents  the volume of the largest storage tank at 85 percent capacity. The distance to the endpoint is 1.63 miles ( point of dispersion to  200 ppm).\n\nThe alternative release scenario, based on the most likely potential  release, is from a break in a transfer hose. The distance to the endpoint in this case is .89 miles according to the model used.\n\nDuring the past 23 years, we have had no accidental spills; therefore, we have had no deaths, injuries, or significant property damage.  Nor, to the best of our knowledge, has an offsite spill caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage.\n\nWe strive to keep our employees and staff informed of safely handling anhydrous ammonia by attending training seminars, by attending live demonstrations, and holding monthly \"company\" meetings during which safety topics, including anhydrous ammonia, are discussed.  \n\nWe strive to stay abreast of the most recent technologies in safely handling anhydrous ammonia;  we are contemplat"
