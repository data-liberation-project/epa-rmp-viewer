Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, our highly trained refrigeration personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  We are coordinated with local LEPC and Fire Department/HAZMAT Team which provides additional emergency response expertise if needed.\n\n\n\nWorst Case Release Scenario and the Alternative Release Scenario\n\nWorst case and alternate release scenarios were developed using the methodology given in the EPAs Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration.
