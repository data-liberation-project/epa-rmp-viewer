This document consists of the executive summary and registration data elements (68.155 through 68.185).\n\n1.0\tRELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nThe ConAgra Foods (ConAgra) facility in Jonesboro, Arkansas has a good record in preventing releases of anhydrous* ammonia.  As part of their release prevention program, the plant has a thorough preventative maintenance program.  More information about these aspects of the prevention program is discussed in Section 4.0 of this Executive Summary.\n\nThe facility has implemented an Emergency Action Plan which is to provide information and guidance to safely deal with an ammonia release.  This emergency response program includes procedures for handling an emergency - the established response plan and appropriate personnel involved in containing an ammonia release \u00bf First Response Team. The emergency response policies at the ConAgra facility ensure that there is emergency response coverage 24 hours - 7 days per week. \n\n*From this point in the Executive Summary, anhydrous ammonia will be synonymous with ammonia.\n\n2.0\tPROCESS DESCRIPTION AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe ConAgra Jonesboro Plant produces deli meat products for deli and foodservice distribution. The NAICS code for the processes at this facility is 311615.   Many areas of the plant are refrigerated to preserve the meat products. ConAgra has one regulated substance under 40 CFR 68: ammonia.  Ammonia is used as a refrigerant in the refrigeration of the products in the various areas of the plant.\n\nThe ammonia threshold for triggering applicability to 40 CFR 68 is 10,000 pounds.  The total quantity of ammonia stored in the refrigeration process is documented as approximately 42,000 pounds.  The process exceeds the threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds as set by 40 CFR 68 and thus is regulated by the Risk Management Program.\n\n \n3.0\tWORST-CASE AND ALTERNATIVE REL"

      "SummaryText": "EASE SCENARIOS\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system has associated hazards that can potentially affect on-site employees and the general public off-site if there is a release from the system.  Described below are the associated hazards and the worst-case and alternative release scenario for the regulated chemical.  Though there may be other scenarios possible, EPA only requires that one worst-case and one alternative scenario be reported for each regulated chemical. \n\nAmmonia is classified as a Group 2 Refrigerant per ASHRAE Standard 34-1989.  The dominant characteristic of this chemical is its toxicity.  It is a self-alarming chemical by its distinctive pungent odor.  Due to this odor, persons exposed to ammonia vapor will not voluntarily stay in areas of even small concentrations.  Ammonia will burn at a very narrow and high range of concentrations accompanied with a high ignition temperature.  Although ammonia is not poisonous, it is corrosive to human tissue.  Ammonia is readily absorbed into the moisture of the skin and, at high concentrations, can cause severe burns.\n\nThe risks to persons in an accidental release of ammonia include:\n\n1.\tCorrosive attack of skin and other tissue (including lung tissue)\n2.\tFreezing of skin and other body tissue when contacted by liquid ammonia\n3.\tEye contact\n\nBelow is a description of the release scenarios for ammonia and their off-site consequences:\n3.1\tWorst-Case Scenario Description\n\nOne worst-case scenario has been developed for the Jonesboro plant.  The largest potential release of ammonia would occur with a 1 3/4 inch diameter puncture in the liquid portion of the thermosyphon receiver.  Taking the specific definition of the worst-case from 40 CFR 68.25, the vessel that can store the largest quantity of ammonia is the 11-degree accumulator.  However, the thermosyphon receiver would be used as the primary liquid storage vessel during pumpout conditions.  The 11-degree accumulator would only be used to accommodate excess liquid"

      "SummaryText": "from the thermosyphon receiver.  The total quantity of ammonia that can be stored in the thermosyphon receiver is 29,245 pounds.  Therefore, the worst-case release quantity will be 29,245 pounds.  Administrative and passive controls are not applicable to this scenario.  It is assumed that the entire 29,245 pounds is released to the atmosphere in 10 minutes.  For the worst-case release, regulations dictate that the release height is at ground level.  \n\nUnder Section 68.25(c)(1), a regulated toxic substance such as ammonia that is normally a gas at ambient temperature and handled as a liquid under pressure shall be considered to be released as a gas over a 10 minute period.  Thus, ammonia\u00bfs physical state in the worst-case scenario is a gas.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario distance-to-endpoint will reach off-site receptors.\n3.2\tAlternative Release Scenario Description\n\t\t\nThe alternative release scenario is an ammonia release from the HTRL line on the roof. The release scenario considers a contractor dropping an object causing the HTRL line to crack. The opening in the damaged pipe is assumed be equivalent to a \u00bd diameter orifice, and is located 44 feet above ground level.  Administrative and passive controls are not applicable to this scenario.  Active mitigation of the release is human intervention.    \n\nThe alternative release scenario distance-to-endpoint will reach off-site receptors.\t\n\n4.0\tGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nConAgra has developed an OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) program for their ammonia refrigeration system. At ConAgra, ammonia falls under the RMP Program 3 Prevention Program, which is identical to the OSHA PSM program.  EPA has said that if the process is in compliance with OSHA PSM, then it is compliance with RMP Program 3.  Thus, ConAgra\u00bfs ammonia PSM system has been reviewed and the PSM system elements are identified in the RMP.  \n\nListed below are the key aspects of the ammonia prev"

Safety equipment includes ammonia detectors in both the engine room and the main plant.  Additionally, the plant has installed an emergency shutdown system with switches outside the engine room.  All ammonia piping and control groups are installed on the roof with minimal piping running to the evaporators installed in the plant.  The ammonia system is PLC controlled with remote PC based monitoring.\n\n5.0\tFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe review of ConAgra\u00bfs accident history includes the following range of dates: June 21, 1999 \u00bf June 21, 2004.  According to 40 CFR Part 68.42(a), there have been no accidental releases at this facility.\n\n6.0\tEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nAs mentioned previously, the ConAgra facility has developed an Emergency Action Plan (EAP).\n\nThe program describes procedures for the response of hazardous substances, spills, and releases.  The plan contains specific information about: HAZMAT emergency response; pre-emergency planning; roles and lines of authority; levels of training; HAZMAT roles; emergency recognition and prevention; emergency team job descriptions; decontamination; safe distances and places of refuge; emergency alerting and response procedures for ammonia release; critique of response and follow-up; standard operator procedures for HAZMAT response; and annual refresher training.\n\nThe Emergency Action Plan also consists of all notifications and plant evacuation procedures in the event of an ammonia release.  The purpose of this plan is to summarize the existing policies, procedures, and plans of action to protect the team members of this facility from dangers associated with these emergencies and provide for the notification and proper evacuation of plant personnel in the event of an emergency.\n\n\n\n \n7.0\tPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nBased on the completed Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) for ammonia, a list of action items to"
