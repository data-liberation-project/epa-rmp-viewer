We shall, as a minimum: (1) consult with employees and their representatives on the conduct and development of the process hazard review and other elements of the risk management plan, and (2) provide to our employees and their representatives access to the process hazard review and all other information required to be developed under that standard.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe City of League City believes that preventative maintenance is the key to minimizing the potential for accidental releases.  Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) have been reviewed and revised to enable the employees to perform their work in a safe and efficient manner.\n\nThe EPA has adopted a policy for non-responding facilities (another entity has agreed in advance to respond to the release).  This facility is a non-responding facility.  The City of League City Fire Department is the first responder.\n\nThis emergency response program does not include responses to incidental releases of hazardous substances, including chlorine and sulfur dioxide, where the substances can be \"adsorbed, neutralized, or otherwise controlled at the time of the release by employees in the immediate release area, or by maintenance personnel\".\n\nThe City of League City has taken steps to train the operators, supervisors, and maint"

The training includes classroom and hands on training on the proper use of emergency response equipment and procedures.  Above all, all employees know where the phone numbers of the first responders are located should a release occur.\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nThe Dallas Salmon Wastewater Treatment Plant utilizes chlorine for disinfection and \nsulfur dioxide for dechlorination of the treated wastewater.  The maximum inventory and threshold quantities for these chemicals are shown below.\n\nChemical                                      Maximum Inventory (lb.)

A dense-gas dispersion model (SLAB) was used to determine endpoint distances for both scenarios.  A dense-gas model is required since both chlorine and sulfur dioxide are heavier than air.  The model's input parameters are summarized in the table below.\n\nSLAB Input Parameters\n                                                            Worst-Case Scenario                                    Alternative Scenario\nWindspeed (m/s)                                 1.5                                                                  3\nAtmospheric Stability Class                 F                                                                     D\nTemperature (0 F)                                 104                                                                 104\nHumidity (%)                                         50                                                                   50\nHeight of Release (m)                "
