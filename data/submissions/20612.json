It is the policy of the Cloverland Greenspring Dairy, LP to operate all of the facilities within its jurisdiction in the safest and most efficient manner possible, with due regard for the health and safety of Cloverland Greenspring Dairy employees, the Public, and our environment.\n\nStationary Source and Chemicals\n\n\tThe Plant employs ammonia as a refrigeration system working fluid.  There are three independent refrigeration systems at the Loch Raven facility.  They are designated the Old, New, and Culture Box systems.  The New ammonia refrigeration system has the high pressure liquid receiver capacity to contain approximately 10,300 pounds of liquid ammonia, if both receivers are full.  Only the condensers are outside the building  The Culture Box system is completely contained within the Culture Box Building, except for the condenser,  has a very small receiver, and is estimated to have a  capacity of approximately 500 pounds of liquid ammonia.\n\n\tThe Old System has two receivers, the large receiver's capacity is 16,717 pounds, if full of liquid.  On January 6, 2000 the large receiver was observed to have a liquid level of 16 inches which is equivalent to approximately 4,500 pounds.  The smaller receiver was out of service, and empty.  The Old System receiver, piping and condensers are outside exposed to the weather.  For these reasons, the Old System is considered the higher risk.  Ammonia is delivered to the site by tank truck, as required.\n\nRelease Scenarios\n\n\tFor the Plant a worst case assumed an accidental release of 16,700 pounds of ammonia  during 10 minutes at 0 feet elevation"

The wind speed during class F conditions is calm to 1.5 meters per second or 3.5 miles per hour.\nThis matches the Environmental Protection Agency Worst Case input values.\n\n\tThe Alternative scenario for the facility assumes a break in the compressor to receiver liquid piping at the receiver connection, a temperature of 105 F (the maximum temperature, at the closest reporting station), a wind speed of 9 miles per hour (the mean wind speed at the nearest reporting station), and an atmospheric stability class of D. \n\nRelease Prevention\n\n\tThe general release prevention program is based on training, standard operating procedures,  and material selection.  The operating and maintenance personnel are trained in the proper operation, maintenance, connection-disconnection, and emergency response for the chemical employed at the Cloverland Greenspring Dairy, LP plant.  With regard to the other two systems,  the ammonia is present in quantities less than threshold, but Process Safety Management and Risk Management procedures have been performed in compliance with the General Duty Clause.\n\n\tAll gas-containing tubing and control devices are selected for specific material compatibility and compliance with appropriate Codes and Standards, and Current Best Engineering Practice.  The systems are regularly and routinely inspected, and maintenance or replacement is performed as appropriate.\n\nAccident History\n\n\tTo date, there has been one release, which occurred on July 7, 1999.  The release was due to a flange failure. The leak was corrected within 2 hours with an estimated release of 100 pounds of gaseous ammonia  There were no employee injuries and no off-site consequences.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\n\tThe Emergency Response Program is based on the use of Cloverland Greenspring Dairy, LP Plant employees who are trained to respond to, and control, certain aspects of an accidental release of ammonia.
