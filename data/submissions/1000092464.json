The facility is located at 6500 Power Line Road in Sacramento, California (Sacramento County), and is a storage and distribution warehouse that manages various consumer and professional products that are manufactured by S.C. Johnson & Son, Inc. (SCJ).  SCJ is a privately held, family-managed company, with worldwide headquarters located in Racine, Wisconsin.  The facility was constructed on a greenfield site in 2020 and started to receive products in January 2021.\n\n\n\nThe California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) program is intended to prevent accidental releases of substances that can cause serious harm to the public and the environment, to minimize the damage if releases do occur, and to satisfy community right-to-know laws.  This program is implemented at the local government level by Unified Program Agencies (UPA), which work directly with regulated businesses and determine the level of detail in the RMPs, review the RMPs, conduct facility inspections, and provide public access to most of the information.  The Sacramento County Environmental Management Department is designated by CalEPA as the Certified Uniform Program Agency (CUPA) for Sacramento County, and is the administering agency (AA) responsible for implementing CalARP in Sacramento County.\n\n\n\nPropellants comprised of flammable mixtures subject to the above-cited federal & state regulations are in select aerosol-based consumer and professional products stored and managed in association with the Sacramento RDC.  Consumer products are stored inside the warehouse (\"INTERIOR STORAGE\") - for which Level 2 & 3 aerosols are stored in a designated aerosol room, w"

      "SummaryText": "hile Level 1 aerosols may be stored throughout the warehouse.  Professional products are stored outside the building (\"EXTERIOR STORAGE\") in up to two (2) shipping containers.\n\n\n\nLiquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) propellant used in select aerosol products contains several components that are classified as flammable materials under federal and state RMP regulations.  Specifically, the propellants consist of blends of propane (CAS No. 74-98-6), butane (CAS No. 106-97-8) and isobutane (CAS No. 75-28-5).  These are collectively regulated as a flammable mixture.  The maximum projected quantities of aerosol products stored at the facility and product propellant weights were used to estimate maximum quantities of RMP-regulated chemicals in the warehouse storage & handling processes.  Although the size of each individual aerosol container is relatively small (typically 15 to 17.5 ounce cans), the number of such containers present onsite at any given time has the potential to exceed the corresponding 10,000 pound TQ.  The flammable mixture mass reported in Sec. 1.17.c (10,527,005 lbs) is the total of the reportable flammable chemicals, while the total mass of the entire mixture is calculated at 12,169,667 lbs\n\n\n\nSome products are solutions that contain aqueous ammonia (i.e., not anhydrous ammonia) in concentrations that are less than the 20 percent by weight qualifier for federally regulated substances; however, the state regulations are stricter with essentially only a one percent by weight qualifier and a 500 pound TQ.  Several products are estimated to contain up to 2.4 percent by weight ammonia.  Although the size of each individual container is relatively small (typically 64 to 70 fluid ounce plastic containers), the aggregate onsite quantity of such mixtures is approximately 536,100 pounds (containing about 13,025 pounds of ammonia), which exceeds the respective state TQ of 500 pounds.  In cases such as this, where a toxic substance is in a process above it TQ listed in 19"

      "SummaryText": " CCR 2770.5, Table 3 only, the AA is required to make a preliminary determination as to whether the facility poses an accident risk.  Based on this determination, the unified program agency may require an RMP, exempt the facility from the provisions of the CalARP program, or change the facility's program level.  Consequently, the Sacramento RDC will await the Sacramento County Environmental Management Department's determination as to whether the facility poses an accident risk in relation to the aqueous ammonia contained in select cleaning products.\n\n\n\nSources subject to the RMP requirements are classified under Program 1, 2, or 3, depending on whether they meet the respective eligibility criteria.  In general, the extent of the RMP requirements increases with an increase in the applicable Program designation.  The Sacramento RDC satisfies each of the Program 1 eligibility criteria."
