The storage and handling system consists of 1 30,000 gallon storage tank, loading risers, associated plumbing and nurse tanks.   Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel and authorized contractors.\n\nThe maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia that can be stored would be 230,000 pounds, this includes the amount of anhydrous ammonia that could be stored in nurse tanks.\n\n\n4.
