              "Description": "The Vinyl Acetate Monomer (VAM) storage tank is interconnected with two production reactors and a purification train. The VAM is stored as a liquid in a fixed roof 24,000,000 gal storage tank. The tank was built to  API code and is within containment. A fire water system with hydrant monitors is available for mitigation. The tank has a remote level sensor, which alarms at high and high-high levels in the control room as well as a direct reading gauge at the tank. The tank has manual and remotely actuated valves to control flow into and out of the tank The production reactors and purification train are protected by a variety of sensorsand pressure relief devices. The VAM unit is controlled by a DCS and has numerous alarms, warnings and process readouts which allow the unit operators to monitor and control the process. Millennium Petrochemicals participates in a complex Emergency Response Team. The team has trained fire and hazardous materials responders who have been trained to the appropriate standards. Unit operators are trained on emergency procedures, including the overfilling scenario.",

Inventory is limited and only one tube trailer is connected to the process at any given time. The process itself is protected by relief devices, vents, manual and remotely activated block vallves, a DCS system allows the operators to monitor the process and provides warnings and alarms for key areas. The BF3 storage are is an enclosure which is protected by a water curtain system which can be activated locally or from the control room. The plant operators undergo training covering standard operating procedures, abnormal and emergency situations and must recertify annually to maintain their operator status.  Millennium Petrochemicals participates in a complex Emergency Response Team which provides fire and hazardous materials response. Members of the team are trained to the appropriate standard for fire and hazardous materials response.",

Millennium has adopted and will diligently follow the guiding principles of the Responsible Care program, so as to achieve a safer workplace, improve employee health, minimize releases to the environment, and better inform the public. This policy has been adopted at all Millennium Chemicals facilities in the United States and foreign locations.  Millennium actively participates in the La Porte Citizen?s Advisory Council (CAC) and La Porte Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) through funding and commitment of plant personnel time to these activities.  Millennium has hosted plant tours for concerned citizens. The facility has an established, and tested, method for notifying our employees and surrounding community of an event that could, or would impact them. The facility has standard operating procedures in place, which define responsibilities and reporting requirements, depending upon the nature of the emergency. The facility has an Emergency Response Team (ERT) that is trained to respond to fire, hazardous materials, medical and rescue emergencies. The facility is also a member of the Channel Industries Mutual Aid (CIMA) organization and can call upon all of their expertise, manpower and equipment if needed. Millennium falls under the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard. The facility has adopted these recognized the 14 components of PSM to govern how Millennium runs all of its processes, not just those required by regulation.\n\nMillennium produces two final products at the La Porte facility: acetic acid, and vinyl acetate monomer (VAM). Millennium also operates a poly alpha olefins (PAO) unit owned by another company. Acetic acid is sold as an intermediate to customers who use it to manufacture other final products"

      "SummaryText": ". Millennium also uses acetic acid internally as a feedstock for the manufacture of VAM.  Millennium has three chemicals that fall under the RMP regulations. These are vinyl acetate monomer, anhydrous ammonia, and boron trifluoride. \n\nMillennium Petrochemicals has conducted an offsite consequence analysis (OCA) to estimate the potential impact to offsite environmental receptors and the public for an accidental release of a regulated substance. The OCS evaluates both a worst-case (WCS) and an alternate release scenario (ARS). Millennium Petrochemicals does not anticipate a WCS to occur, but has planned for and communicated the information concerning a WCS to the public. The ARS is a more realistic scenario. Alternate release scenarios are based upon a more likely set of circumstances.  \n\nMillennium maintains an active accident prevention program consisting of many elements. The La Porte site falls under the Risk Management Program (RMP) and Process Safety Management (PSM) standard. Millennium goes beyond the requirements of the PSM standard by adopting these procedures for all processes at the facility, not just covered processes. The La Porte facility has an in-depth training program for operators. This program includes standard operating procedures, mentoring, on-the-job training, and testing. Millennium reviews SOPs annually by professional staff as well as the technicians using the procedures. Millennium Petrochemicals utilizes contractors for plant maintenance and other projects. Millennium has established a qualification process for these contractors, which examines their safety records, procedures and training. All on-site contractors participate in the facility safety programs. Millennium maintains a Request For Change (RFC) and Management Of Change (MOC) process. Employees and permanent contractors participate in both these programs. Millennium has a predictive and preventive maintenance program in place and uses third party risk based evaluations to validat"

Millennium uses third party auditing to verify safety, health, environmental and mechanical integrity throughout the facility. The facility conducts weekly safety and housekeeping audits of all plant areas. Safety information is a priority communication to employees. Millennium Petrochemicals has adopted the Responsible Care program and communicates to its employees that the items covered in this program will be one of three basic programs upon which decisions are based.\n\nNo releases of the three RMP covered chemicals at the Millennium La Porte facility has occurred in the last five years that has resulted in any fatalities, injuries, or significant damage both onsite or offsite, or environmental receptors offsite.\n\nMillennium has a written Emergency Response Plan (ERP) for the protection of employees, contractors, visitors, the community, and environmental receptors. The ERP details how employees should respond to a variety of emergencies, including fire, hazardous materials release, medical and rescue situations.  Actions to be taken by all onsite personnel are detailed in the ERP. The La Porte Complex, which includes two adjacent facilities, maintains an Emergency Response Team (ERT) with personnel trained (to the applicable standard) to respond and actively mitigate in fire and hazardous materials emergencies. Additionally, the ERT has medical and rescue trained personnel for these situations. The facility is a member of Channel Industries Mutual Aid (CIMA) and Clean Channel Association (CCA), which gives the facility access to additional manpower, expertise and equipment in case of an emergency.
