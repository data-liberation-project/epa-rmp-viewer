      "SummaryText": "General Executive Summary for Chemical, Manufacturing and Oil Refining Facilities        \n\n1.    Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at Rhodia Inc. Morrisville Plant are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, our trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  We are also coordinated with Falls Township Fire Company No. 1 which provides additional emergency response expertise.\n\n\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities encompass Manufacturing of Phosphorus based Chemical Intermediates.  We have 3 regulated substances present at our facility.  These substances include Phosphorus trichloride, Chlorine and Phosphorus oxychloride [Phosphoryl chloride].  The regulated substances at our facility are involved in several uses. \n\nThe maximum inventory of Phosphorus trichloride at our facility is 1600000.00 lb. while Chlorine and Phosphorus oxychloride [Phosphoryl chloride] are present at our facility in quantities of 1440000.00 lb. and 480000.00 lb. respectively.\n\n3.    The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\nTo evaluate the worst case scenarios, we have used the look-up tables and equations provided by the EPA in the RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance as well as EPA's RMP Guidance for Waste Water Treatment Plants Reference Tables or Equations.  For alternative release scenario analyses, w"

      "SummaryText": "e have employed EPA's RMP*Comp(TM).  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 3 toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from the Phosphorus Trichloride Process.  The scenario involves the release of 180000 lb. of Chlorine in a liquid form over 10 minutes due to rupture of a chlorine tank car. Toxic liquid is assumed to be immediately released to form a pool of height 1 cm, from which evaporation takes place.   At Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s windspeed, the maximum distance of 14 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.0087 mg/L.\n\n\nOne alternative release scenario has been submitted for each toxic substance present in Program 3 processes.  \n\nThe alternative release scenario for Phosphorus trichloride involves a release from PCL3 Tank Truck loading hose in the Phosphorus Trichloride  process.  The scenario involves the release of 11700 lb. of Phosphorus trichloride over 10 minutes.  Toxic liquid is assumed to form a pool of height 1 cm, from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to have evaporated over 36.3 minutes. The release is also assumed to be controlled by active mitigation measures that include emergency shutdown systems.  All released Phosphorus trichloride is assumed to react completely to form stoichiometric quantities of HCL and non-regulated phosphoric acid.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.030 mg/L of Hydrogen chloride  is 0.9 miles.\n\n\nThe alternative release scenario for Chlorine involves a release of 3750 lb. of chlorine from a CL2 Tank Car unloading hose in the Phosphorus Trichloride  process.  Toxic liquid is assumed to be released to form a pool of height 1 cm, from which evaporation takes place.  The release duration is estimated to be 15 minutes. The release is also assumed to be controlled by active mitigation measures that include excess flow val"

The scenario involves the release of 12500 lb. of Phosphorus oxychloride [Phosphoryl chloride].  The release duration is estimated to be 10 minutes.

The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nOur facility has taken the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with various industry codes including; API, ASME, NFPA, and Rhodia Inc Process Hazards Management Program (PHMP).  Two processes at our facility are subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119.  Our facility is also subject to EPCRA Section 302 notification requirements.    The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nRhodia Inc. Morrisville Plant maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes in accordance wi"
