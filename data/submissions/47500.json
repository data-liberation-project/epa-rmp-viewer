The Plant Manager has overall responsibility for this program.\n\nThe Plant Manager is responsible for keeping operating procedures up-to-date, training operators so they can safely carry out these procedures, assuring that the plant is run safely on a daily basis, and when necessary, investigating incidents.  All employees participate in the safety program through team-based activities to improve safety and plant operation.\n\nThe Plant Manager maintains an Operating Guide that includes process safety information, operating procedures, and a training certification program.  Additional process safety information is also filed on site.  Operators use this Operating Guide as a training tool and for reference.  By applying the information it contains their actions will prevent accidental releases.\n\nProcess hazard analyses are conducted on an on-going basis to identify hazards and recommend safeguards that will prevent an accidental release.  Recommendations resulting from the process hazard analyses are entered into an action item database to track the items to completion.\n\nTwo methods are used to assure that changes to plant equipment, procedures, or processes do not cause accidents.  For equipment and procedure changes, a Change Worksheet initiates a safety review.  This review may include a process hazard analysis.  Changes to product formulations initiate a review by a chemist, process engineer, and the plant manager.  Training is performed as needed to assure that those affected by the change understand its impact.  Pre-Start-up Safety Reviews are performed to assure that the plant can be started up safely after a significant change is made.\n\nA preventive maintenance program maintains the mechanical integrity of process equipment.  A computer database is used to manage the preventive maintenance schedule.  Each month scheduled equipment inspections, tests, or servicing are performed.  The schedule is based on plant experience and manufacturer\u00bfs recommendations"

One important section describes safety measures for welding or other \u00bfhot\u00bf work, which includes a permit system to reduce the risk of fire. The Safety Manual also includes requirements for locking out equipment for maintenance. These procedures reduce the likelihood that a valving error will lead to a release.\n\nContractors, who periodically perform work in the plant, are given safety orientations to brief them on plant hazards and safety practices. Contractor safety programs and performance are evaluated prior to their selection for jobs that impact process safety.\n\nIncidents that cause or could cause a release are investigated. Recommendations may lead to improvements to help prevent recurrence. These recommendations may lead to improvements in equipment, procedures, operating conditions, or training.\n\nPeriodically, a safety professional from another Hexion Specialty Chemicals location conducts a comprehensive audit of the safety program. Addressing recommendations from this audit keeps the safety program effective.\n\n4.  Five-year Accident History\n\nIn the five (5) year period from May 1, 1999 to May 1, 2004, there were no offsite releases of regulated substances.\n\n5.  Emergency Response Program\n\nThe plant maintains a relationship with the Local Emergency Planning Committee of Saratoga County, which would provide help (if needed) during an emergency.  The plant Emergency Response Plan describes procedures for actual and threatened releases, including coordination with fire department responders.  This plan is written in the \u00bfOne Plan\u00bf format to satisfy regulatory requirements of several agencies.  Training and planning includes containment of spills and other releases.

Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies.\n\nAs stated in our Worldwide Health, Safety, and Environmental Policy and Principles, Hexion Specialty Chemicals, Inc., is committed to health, safety, and environmental excellence. To accomplish this we integrated health, safety, and environmental planning into all business activities. This includes complying with applicable laws, responsibly managing risks, and working collaboratively with others in addressing health, safety, and environmental issues.\n\nIn the Hexion Specialty Chemicals, Inc., Safety Manual, the Safety Policy Statement clearly states that safety will not be compromised to achieve any other operational or business objective. This manual defines requirements and guidelines developed to prevent injuries and accidental releases.\n\nIncluded in the Safety Manual are Emergency Response Policies that state that safety is the top priority in all emergency response situations. This policy refers to the plant Emergency Response Plan for specific procedures for handling releases of hazardous materials. \n\n2.  Stationary source and regulated substances handled\n\nThis plant produces formaldehyde solutions and urea-formaldehyde concentrate (UFC). The regulated substance in the plant is formaldehyde.  Formaldehyde and UFC are shipped offsite in tank trucks.\n\n3.  Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps \n\nThis plant has a Process Safety Management Program that is in compliance with the EPA Accidental Release Prevention Rule, the OSHA Process Safety Management Standard, and all applicable state codes and regulations. A safety management system is in place to assure on-going compliance. This management system includes the Safety Manual, a list of site safety responsibilities, a file system to maintain records of compliance, and a monthly safety committee meeting, where a management control check sheet is used to verify that tasks were completed on sch"
