Following are some of the different types of audits, inspections and reviews that are conducted:  PSM and Non-PSM audits, ISO audits, Corporate and Insurance surveys and audits,, Environmental and IndustrialHygiene audits, Management of Change audits.  We conduct pre-engineering safety audits and inspections on new process before any engineering work is done.  During the phase of construction walkthrough safety inspections are completed.  Pre-startup inspections are done before the process is started.\n\nSolutia at Decatur, Alabama is very dedicated in preparation just in case we might have an emergency.  We have 75 firefighters across the 4 shifts that  we work.  These firefighters train 48 hours annually at the site on things like flammable liquid fires, interior fire fighting, hazardous communications, incident command and others.  Our firefighters also train at Texas A&M Fire School on similar item"

Solutia Inc. - Decatur Plant is one of the 18 chemical manufacturing facilities that make up the company, which  has approximately 8,000 employees.  Staffing at Decatur Plant is currently about 1,000 Solutia employees and 500 permanent contractor employees.\n\nBuilt in 1952, the Decatur Plant is situated on a 668 acre tract, 4 miles west of the City of Decatur, on the Tennessee River  (river mile 302). Of the 668 acres, over 300 acres are presently in use.\n\nThe plant primarily manufactures Acrilan acrylic fiber and various nylon intermediate chemicals for the production of nylon fiber. There are six chemicals in our processes that are regulated by EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP) rule. They are:\n\n            Acrylonitrile (AN) ------------------- A raw material to make acrylic fiber and nylon intermediate chemicals.\n            Propionitrile (PN) ------------------  A by-product from manufacture of nylon intermediate chemicals.\n            Sulfur Dioxide (SO2) -------------  A raw material to make acrylic fiber.\n            Vinyl Acetate (VA) ----------------- A raw material to make acrylic fiber.\n            Vinylidene Chloride (VCL2) ---- A raw material to make acrylic fiber.\n            Dimethylamine (DMA) ----------- A raw material to make acrylic fiber.\n\nMost raw materials (i.e., AN and VA) arrive at the plant by barge on the Tennessee River.\n\nSolutia Inc. has officially adopted the following six commitments, expressing our intention to operate responsibly:\n  \n* We will ensure that"
