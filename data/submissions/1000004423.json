Senior management as well as Human Resources administer the facility's safety and environmental policies and programs.  These programs include but are not limited to forklift safety, hazard communications, lockout/tagout, Hazardous Materials Business Plan, employee safety manuals, manufacturers documentation, Emergency Response, as well as the Risk Management Plan.\n\nFroz-sun Foods, Inc. has coordinated emergency response efforts with the local fire department, the Santa Barbra County Fire Department.  In the case of an ammonia-related emergency, it is the policy of Froz-sun Foods, Inc. to evacuate the employees and to allow the fire department/HazMat team to respond to the emergency.  The refrigeration contractor will be available for guidance and assistance.\n\nThe majority of the equipment is located inside the engine rooms.  The system is closed loop refrigeration system similar to a residential refrigerator.  There are no emissions or planned releases of ammonia.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nThe facility is located in a rural area at 1315 South Blosser Road, in Santa Maria, California, which is approximately 2.0 miles east of Highway 101, and approximately 0.2 miles south of Highway 166.

The two systems are connected via one ammonia liquid and one ammonia suction line.  Unless the facility is transferring liquid from system 1 to system 2, the connection lines are normally closed.  Engine Room #1 was charged with 12,000 pounds of ammonia in 1956, while Engine Room #2 was charged with 10,000 pounds of ammonia in 1979.\n\nRefrigeration process equipment associated with system 1 operates continuously.  System 1 Compressors and Condensers cycle on and off to comply with system demand during operation.  System 1 provides cooling for eleven cold storage areas: Freezer Rooms (3), Poly Bag Room, Pre-cool area, Blast Cell area, Belt Freezer/IQF, Berry Cool area, Cold Storage area, Vestibule area, and the Sure Fresh area.  A majority of system 1 equipment is located inside Engine Room #1.  System 1 Condensers are mounted on Engine Room #1's roof, and the Evaporators/Coil Units are located in their respective cold/freezer storage areas. \n\nEngine Room #1's refrigeration cycle begins with the collecting of high pressure liquid ammonia in the High Pressure Receivers (3) from the Condensers.  The High Pressure Receivers serve as the main liquid storage vessels for system 1.  The High Pressure Receivers provide high pressure liquid ammonia to the IQF #9 Recirculator, Pre-cool Pump Package, Poly Bag Room Evaporators, and Intercooler.  The High Pressure Receivers also provide liquid injection, for oil cooling, to High Stage Compressors #8, #9, #10, and Booster Compressors #6 and #8.\n\nHigh pressure liquid ammonia passing through the Intercooler is provided to the Blast Cell Recirculators (2), Freezer Accumulators (3), Sure Fresh Pump Package, Berry Cool Pump Package, and when needed, to system 2.

After a predetermined amount of liquid has accumulated in the Suction Accumulator's Transfer Unit, the Transfer Unit opens the high pressure hot gas line, forcing the accumulated liquid out of the vessel and into the High Pressure Receivers.\n\nSystem 1 has a total of 48 Evaporators/Coil Units plus a Belt Freezer/IQF.  Fans in each Evaporator/Coil Unit are used to draw air across and in between the coils which partially vaporizes the liquid ammonia as heat from the room is transferred to the ammonia within the coils.\n\nThe High Stage Compressors pull vapor from the above mentioned vessels (and system 2 when needed) and discharge through a common header to the Condensers where the gas is condensed to a high pressure liquid and then drained back to the High Pressure Receivers.  The high pressure vapor is condensed by discharging latent heat in the ammonia to the atmosphere using sprayed water and fans.  High Stage Compressor discharge is also used for the defrosting of the Cold Storage, Poly Bag Room, Freezer #3, and Berry Cool Evaporators/Coil Units.  Booster Compressor discharge is routed to the Intercooler.\n\nAn auto purger periodically purges system 1 of non-condensibles collected in the Condensers.

The High Pressure Receivers serve as the main liquid storage vessels for system 2.  The High Pressure Receivers provide high pressure liquid ammonia to Economizers/Subcoolers and liquid injection to Compressors #1, #3, #5, #7 and #8 .  The Economizers/Subcoolers provide subcooled liquid to the IQF Pump Package.  The IQF Pump Package pumps liquid to the IQF where the liquid vaporizes (hence providing cooling).  The vaporized suction is returned to the IQF Pump Package.  Engine Room #2's Compressors pull suction from the IQF Pump Package through the Accumulator/Slop Tank.  The Accumulator protects the Compressors from directly receiving liquid.  After a predetermined amount of liquid has accumulated in the Slop Tank/Accumulator, the vessel's pump returns the accumulated liquid to the IQF Pump Package.\n\nSuction from the Accumulator first passes through the Low Stage Compressors before it's pressure is increased further by the High Stage Compressors.

In case of ammonia detection, an offsite monitoring station receives an alarm and then proceeds to alert the facility.  \n\nIn the event of a power failure, ammonia operations would automatically shut-down (solenoid valves close, compressors shut-down, condenser fans and water pumps shut-down, evaporator fans shut-down, etc.), thereby limiting the possibility of any ammonia releases.\n\nThe system also incorporates pressure relief valves.  In the event of over-pressurization, vessels will vent to atmosphere via relief lines which penetrate through the roof.  This mechanism prevents vessels from rupturing in case they become over pressurized.\n\nAmmonia refrigeration systems do not experience any chemical reactions or internal corrosion.  The only composition change that occurs within the systems are phase changes, as ammonia is cycled through various stages of liquid and vapor, similar to a household refrigerator.  The refrigeration system is a closed-loop system without any regular emissions or releases.  Any leaks are noted and repaired immediately by the refrigeration contractor.\n\nIn addition to the 1997 Uniform Mechanical Code, the facility will operate in accordance with the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) guidelines.  In particular, IIAR Bulletin 110, \"Startup, Inspection, and Maintenance of Ammonia Refrigeration Systems\" is used as a general guide.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nAn investigation into Froz-sun Food's accident history revealed that there has been one release of ammonia withing the past five years (March 2004 - March 2009) which is detailed below.\n\nJuly 10, 2008: An ammonia smell was reported and a vapor cloud was seen coming from the roof of Engine Room #2.

Further testing found that the relief valve was leaking continuously under lower pressure, which indicates that the valve could not seat properly.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nFroz-sun Foods, Inc. has an emergency action plan in effect at the facility.  The Emergency Action Plan is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of this PSM/RMP document.  Emergency response activities are coordinated with the County of Santa Barbra Fire Department  and the local fire houses.  In case of a major ammonia emergency, the facility will first call 9-1-1 to alert the local Police and Fire Departments.  Other responders will be called as needed, including the Department of Public Safety Emergency Management Services.  If a release exceeds the federal reporting quantity of 100 pounds for ammonia, the National Response Center and the Emergency Spill Report Center will be called.  All employees and contractors will evacuate based on a high ammonia leak alarm.\n\nFroz-sun Foods, Inc. maintains a safety committee whose members are the designated emergency coordinators for the facility.  The plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  The plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year.  This plan will be reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations, as well as to incorporate any facility changes.\n\nFroz-sun Foods, Inc. will be responsible for evacuating and ensuring the safety of its employees and will coordinate emergency response efforts with the fire department on a periodic and ongoing basis.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nA Process Hazards Analysis (PHA) was conducte"

These studies were performed to define potential hazards associated with operational deviations of the ammonia system.  As a result of the Process Hazards Analysis, a number of recommendations were made, such as procedural changes, ammonia awareness training and some equipment upgrades.  These recommendations are scheduled to be complete by March 2010.\n\nIn addition, the facility is planning to complete several items over the next year to help with their continued effort to provide a safe work environment for Froz-sun Foods employees.  These changes include the following items:\n\n1.  Continue to train all employees in Cal-OSHA's Process Safety Management, EPA's Risk Management Program, and the California Accidental Release Prevention program.\n2.
