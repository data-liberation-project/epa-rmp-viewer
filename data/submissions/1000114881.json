The Plan includes an analysis of the potential offsite consequences of an accidental release, a five-year accident history, and a release prevention and emergency response program.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nEmergency response procedures including evacuation procedures and notification procedures have been implemented by Wilbur-Ellis. In addition, Wilbur-Ellis has developed operating procedures and preventative maintenance activities to reduce the likelihood of accidental releases.  This Plan and the emergency response procedures document the accidental release prevention, safety, and emergency policies in place at Wilbur-Ellis.\n\nDescription of Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\nWilbur-Ellis is located at 404 North 1st Street in Fairfield, Washington (the \"facility\"). Wilbur-Ellis is a retailer of fertilizer in the forms of anhydrous ammonia stored under pressure. There is one anhydrous ammonia storage tank located at the facility with a capacity of approximately 30,000 gallons. The anhydrous ammonia is transferred from the storage tank into tender trucks totaling  a maximum of 15,500 gallons. The contents of the tender trucks are sold and delivered to the local farming community for use as fertilizer.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps Wilbur-Ellis has developed and implemented this Plan with the objective of complying with the requirements and guidelines set forth by the Federal Risk Management Plan program. \nWilbur-Ellis ensures that equipment meets the appropriate industry standards prior to use. Wilbur- Ellis implements operating procedures and maintenance procedures in accordance with manufacturer and industry specifications to prevent accidental releases at the"

Chemical specific prevention steps implemented at the site include excess flow valves, pressure relief valves, emergency shut off valves with cables that run along the length of the horizontal storage tanks for quick access, and ammonia training for personnel.\n\nFive-Year Accident History\nThere have been no applicable releases during the previous five years.\n\nEmergency Response Program\nThe facility coordinates with the Oakesdale Fire Department (\"fire department\") regarding specific actions to be taken in response to an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia. The facility has established emergency evacuation procedures to evacuate the site and notify the appropriate agencies regarding a release. The facility's emergency response program is\ndocumented in the facility's Emergency Response Procedures. The emergency procedures contain the following key elements:\n1. Procedures for informing local agencies responsible for responding to accidental releases.\n2. Information on emergency health care.\n3. Emergency response training for employees.\n\nPlans to improve safety at the facility\nTo improve both process safety and general safety, Wilbur-Ellis has implemented a comprehensive, risk-based safety management process to help guide employees to improved safety performance. The safety management process, branded Guiding People to Safety (GPS), is designed to be implemented in four steps, each one verified by an independent auditor. Step one includes the foundational components of a positive safety culture. RMP / PSM is addressed in detail in Step 2, The GPS process provides guidelines for each safety program that describe methods for effective implementation. The GPS program includes measures for tracking progress and success and for addressing opportunities for improvement within the\nprocess and individual safety programs. These measures include action tracking software to facilitate timely corrections of  deficiencies and recommended improvements identified during i"
