The regulated substance of concern and focus of this document is anhydrous ammonia.  The facility has three independent ammonia systems (Area 1, Area 2, and Area 3), but only one of these systems (Area 1) is over the 10,000-pound EPA RMP threshold. The facility is regulated under the local CalARP regulations and complies with all local regulations, as required.\r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\r\n\r\nSenior management at the facility is not only committed to offering superior service, but also to maintaining a safety and environmental program to promote a safe environment for all employees and the surrounding communities.  Senior management administers the safety and environmental policies and programs.  These programs include but are not limited to forklift safety, hazard communications, lockout/tagout, Hazardous Materials Emergency Business Plan, employee safety manuals, manufacturers' documentation, Emergency Action Plan, as well as the Risk Management Plan.\r\n\r\nThe Wine Group - Tulare facility has independently coordinated emergency response efforts with the local Fire Department.  In the case of an ammonia related emergency, it is the policy of The Wine Group - Tulare to evacuate the employees and to allow the fire department/HazMat team to respond to the emergency.  If an ammonia release could potentially impact the local community, a Community Notification Plan would be activated. If an ammonia release were to extend into the neighboring community, a Shelter In Place plan would go into effect. \r\n\r\nThe Wine Group - Tulare personnel circulate throughout the plant, taking note of unusual conditions in any portion of the system.  In the event that an ammonia leak is discovered, the person nearest to the leak will alert any personnel in the immediate area who are"

Emergency agencies will also be notified as necessary as outlined in the Emergency Action Plan.\r\n\r\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\r\n\r\nThe Wine Group - Tulare facility is located at 1887 N. Mooney Blvd. in Tulare, California, which is located on California Highway 63, approximately 1 mile north of California Highway 137.  The area immediately surrounding the facility is rural with a mixture of farmland and residential areas.\r\n\r\nThe primary business of The Wine Group - Tulare is the production and processing of wine products.  In order to conduct operations, the facility uses approximately 11,000 pounds of ammonia as a refrigerant within a closed-loop system. The refrigeration system, consisting of piping, valves, and equipment, cycles ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, and then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration to accommodate the storage and production of wine products.\r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\n\r\nA prevention program is in place to minimize the risk of hazardous chemical releases in accordance with the California Occupational Safety and Health Administration (Cal-OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (Section 5189 of Title 8, CCR) and the EPA Risk Management Program.  This prevention program covers those processes that handle ammonia above the threshold quantity of either PSM or RMP rules.\r\n\r\nThe prevention program provides a structured approach to preventing accidents.  Some of the specific activities in the prevention program include:\r\n\r\n- Process safety information is provided to all applicable employees upon hire and is accessible at all times.\r\n- In depth process hazard analysis are completed every five years by qualified personnel using techniques approved under the PSM stand"

The training, qualifications, and safety awareness of the operations, maintenance, and management personnel are a key element in reducing and mitigating accidents.\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\r\n\r\nThe Wine Group - Tulare facility has an emergency action plan in effect. This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\r\n\r\n  1.)  To save lives.\r\n  2.)  To minimize and avoid injuries.\r\n  3.)  To protect the environment.\r\n  4.)

This Plan was reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations.\r\n\r\nIn the event of an ammonia emergency, the operator of The Wine Group - Tulare facility plans to evacuate all employees in the facility and alert the local emergency responders (fire department).  The operator of the facility plans to coordinate emergency response efforts with the fire department on a periodic and ongoing basis.\r\n\r\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nThe facility's Five Year Accident History was reviewed during the PHA Revalidation Study conducted on March 5-6, 2014. Between March 2009 and March 2014, there have been no releases of a regulated substance from covered processes that meet specific EPA criteria for the Five-Year Accident History.  Such \"RMP accidents\" would involve serious accidents with either onsite deaths, injuries, or significant damage; or known, off-site deaths, injuries, property damage, or environmental damage. The Wine Group - Tulare (Franzia Tulare) realizes that the community may also be interested in smaller releases of regulated chemicals that do not meet such criteria. We have been diligent in reporting releases of hazardous materials and internally investigate and correct the causes of such releases.\r\n\r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\n\r\nThe Process Hazards Analysis, including a Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) study and a Facility Inspection, conducted March 5-6, 2014, provided mitigation measures to improve safety at The Wine Group - Tulare facility. The Wine Group - Tulare facility safety committee is planning to complete several items over the next year, as a continual effort to provide a safe work environment for their employees.  These changes include the following items:\r\n\r\n1. Continue to train all employees in the facility safety plan/programs.\r\n2. Continue"
