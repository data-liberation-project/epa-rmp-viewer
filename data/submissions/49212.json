This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of the facility\u00bfs processes.  It is the practice of Enterprise Products Operating L.P. (Enterprise) to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of substances.  However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will respond to, control and contain the release.\n\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nThe Jackson Terminal located in Jackson County, Minnesota, is owned and operated by Enterprise Products Operating, LP.\n\nThe Jackson Terminal is a wholesale terminal facility for the storage and loading of propane.  The propane is received from an Enterprise underground pipeline and is stored in nine above ground 30,000 gallon nominal capacity storage tanks.  The tanks  are equipped with automatic level indicators and alarms and automatic inlet propane shutoff valves to allow for unattended filling from a remote pipeline control facility.  Ethyl mercaptan is added to the propane during the tank filling operation as an odorant to aid in propane leak detection. The stored propane is transferred from the storage bullet tanks into highway transport trucks for delivery of the propane to wholesale customers.    The trace odorant remains present in the propane when it is loaded into the transport trucks.  The mercaptan is stored is one 500 gallon tank, which is filled to a maximum of 80% full.  The flammable ethyl mercaptan at the facility is never present above the threshold quatity specified in the RMP regulation.\n\nThe Jackson Terminal was evaluated to determine if any regulated flammable or toxic s"

Propane is the only listed flammable substance which is stored above the threshold quantiy at the Jackson Terminal.  As has been noted earlier, ethyl mercaptan is also present in storage at the facility, but in only a limited amount which is well below the threshold quantity.  The Terminal is an unoccupied remote facility and, as such, is not subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation.  Rather than classify Jackson Terminal as an EPA Program 2 RMP facility, Enterprise has chosen to classify Jackson as an RMP Program Level 3 facility since the company has chosen to implement a full fourteen issue safety management program identical to the safety management program in use throughout the company\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis Results\n\nThe offsite consequence analysis will not be reflected in the executive summary but rather is reflected in the data components.  There are flammable substances on site and no toxic substances above the threshold quantity.\n\n\nGeneral Accident Release Prevention Program\n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the Jackson Terminal.  The operations at the terminal are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) regulation, but are not covered under the OSHA PSM standard.  This summary addresses each of the RMP safety program elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.  A complete fourteen issue safety management program, identical to the program in use at OSHA PSM facilities, has been implemented at Jackson Terminal.  Since the facility is remote and normally unattended, the safety management program utilized at Jackson Terminal involves those employees who visit the facility on a periodic basis.\n\nEmpl"

Employee involvement helps to insure that all perspectives regarding PSM compliance and accident prevention are considered and that the best ideas are implemented.  Open communications are encouraged between supervisors and employees regarding all aspects of safety and health issues concerning the employees and the public.\n\nEnterprise strongly promotes employee involvement in safety issues through existing programs.  These programs include regularly scheduled safety meeting, tail-gate safety meetings, hazard communications, Safety Suggestion Forms, a \u00bfnear-miss\u00bf reporting system and special training programs such as emergency response training, first aid training, etc.\n\nEnterprise actively seeks employee involvement in the development and conduct of all accident prevention activities through the appropriate existing safety programs.  Accident prevention is discussed at the regularly scheduled safety meetings and/or during special training sessions if necessary.  Employees are encouraged to discuss accident prevention with their supervisors and to bring any questions, comments or suggestions forward for open discussion.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nComplete and accurate written process safety information concerning process chemicals, process technology and process equipment is essential to an effective PSM and RMP program as well as completing and maintaining a process hazard analysis.  The process safety information will be useful to the operators, the team performing a process hazard analysis and those in charge of updating the emergency preparedness plans.

These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters, specific chemicals inventories and equipment design basis/configuration information.\n\nChemical specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDS).\n\nEnterprise also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure ratings, temperature ratings and electrical rating of equipment.  This information in combination with written procedures and trained personnel provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to insure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\nThe Jackson Terminal has a comprehensive program to help insure that hazards associated with the various operations are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each portion of the facility is systematically examined to identify hazards and insure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nEnterprise primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) and What-if/Checklist method analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  The analyses are conducted using a team of Enterprise staff which has operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to local and corporate management for resolution.

All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\nTo help insure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the terminal periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every five years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.  Once again, the responses to the team findings are also documented and retained.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nThe Jackson Terminal maintains written procedures that address various modes of storage and terminal operations such as; (1) start-up, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown and (6) initial startup of any new equipment.  These procedures provide guidance for experienced operators and also provide the basis for training new operators.

Drivers are required to show that they understand the procedures required to safely load their trucks before they are allowed to load propane at the Jackson Terminal.  When a company technician is not present at the facility, access is blocked by a loading rack access gate.  Truck drivers must demonstrate knowledge of proper loading and safety procedures before they are issued an access code number that allows them to open the gate and access the terminal loading racks.\n\nTraining\n\nIn addition to training on operating procedures, the Jackson Terminal has a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating the terminal.  New employees receive basic training in pipeline, storage and terminal operations.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to insure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted at lease every three years.  All of this training is documented for each operator including the means to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\nAs has been noted earlier, the Jackson Terminal is a normally unoccupied remote facility.  Company technicians are present at the facility from time to time to monitor pipeline transfer operations, to perform basic safety checks and inspections and to check on and address any reported equipment problems.\n \nContractors\n\nThe Jackson Terminal uses contractors during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.

In addition, the Jackson Terminal evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the contractor selection process.  Enterprise personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to insure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\n\nPre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR)\n\nThe Jackson Terminal conducts a PSSR on any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in process safety information.  The purpose of the PSSR is to insure that safety features, procedures, personnel and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready.  The PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nThe Jackson Terminal has well established practices and procedures for maintaining process equipment.  The basic aspects of this program include (1) training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting equipment deficiencies, when identified and (5) applying quality assurance measures.

This helps insure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.\n\nSafe Work Practices\n\nThe Jackson Terminal has long standing safe work practices in place to help insure worker and process safety.  Examples of these include: (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) a lockout/tagout procedure to insure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous substances before process piping and equipment is opened, (4) a permit and procedure to control spark-producing activities (i.e., hot work) and (5) a permit and procedure to insure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space.  These procedures, along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help insure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely\n\nManagement of Change\n\nThe Jackson Terminal has a comprehensive system to manage change to all covered equipment and operations.  This system requires that changes to items such as terminal equipment, technology (including terminal operating conditions), procedures and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented.  Changes are reviewed to insure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and to verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.  Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits and equipment information, as well as procedures, are updated to incorporate these changes.  In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on the changes.\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nThe Jackson Terminal promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury.  The goal of each investigation is to gather the fact"

The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendation(s) to prevent a reoccurrence and forwards these results to the business management team for resolution.\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nTo help insure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, Enterprise periodically conducts an audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented.  Compliance audits are conducted at least every three years.  Both hourly and staff personnel participate as audit team members.  The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to terminal management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team\u00bfs findings are tracked until they are resolved and completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are retained.\n\n\nChemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe operations at the Jackson Terminal have hazards that must be managed to insure continued safe operation.  The following is a description of existing safety features applicable to prevention of accidental releases of regulated substances in the facility.\n\nUniversal Prevention Activities\n\nThe accident prevention program summarized previously is applied to all RMP covered operations at the Jackson Terminal.  Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human errors.\n\nSpecialized Safety Features\n\nThe Jackson Terminal has safety features throughout the terminal area to help contain/control a release, to quickly detect a release and reduce the consequence of a release.  The following types of safety features are used in the covered operations:\n\nRelease Detection\n\n?\tHydrocarbon (hazardous gas) detectors and alarms in the storage and loading areas.\n?\tFlame d"

Over the past five years there have been no large or small releases, with no injuries or offsite consequences.  \n\n\nEmergency Procedures Information\n\nThe Jackson Terminal maintains a written emergency procedure, which is in place to protect employee, truck driver and public safety as well as the environment.  The procedures are for the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address notification of local emergency response agencies if a release occurs.  Employees receive training in emergency procedures.  The emergency procedure is updated when necessary based on modifications made to the terminal facilities.  The emergency procedure changes are administered through the Management of Change process.\n\nThe overall emergency procedure program for the Jackson Terminal is coordinated with the Jackson County Fire Department.
