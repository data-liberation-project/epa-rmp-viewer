DAP Products, Inc. has implemented employee safety programs and a Process Safety Management program to help support the safe operation of the LPG gas system. \n\n\n\nDAP Products, Inc produces aerosol can products.  LPG operations include two large propellant tanks and pumps, piping, valves and fittings up to the aerosol can filling heads.  The largest propellant tank contains approximately 63,800 lbs of an LPG blend (15.75% propane, 34.25% isobutane, 50.00% dimethyl ether).  This flammable mixture is regulated under the EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP) and under OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) program.  No other regulated substances are on-site in amounts that would trigger RMP and/or PSM requirements.\n\n\n\nThe facility has a PSM program and a Hazard Communication program required under OSHA to ensure worker safety, and a RMP to ensure the safety of the surrounding community.  \n\n\n\nThe facility has a number of devices and procedures surrounding the LPG system to ensure its safe operation, including relief valves, check valves, manual shutoffs, alarms and procedures, grounding and excess flow devices.  \n\n\n\nThe facility has an excellent history of operating the LPG system, with no accidental releases ever.\n\n\n\nThe facility has an Emergency Action Plan in place that includes coordination with the local fire department.   The program includes frequent employee training and drills, as well as public notification procedures.\n\n\n\nDAP Products, Inc continues to evaluate and improve the LPG system to ensure safety to its employees as well as to the surrounding community through frequent program reviews, outside audits, and operator training and drills.\n\n"
