Plant 80513 facility abides by the emergency response procedures and policies detailed in the Emergency Response Plan manual.  This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n1.)\tTo save lives.\n2.)\tTo minimize and avoid injuries.\n3.)\tTo protect the environment.\n4.)\tTo minimize property damage.\n\nAmeriCold Logistics maintains an emergency response committee whose members are the designated emergency coordinators for the facility.  The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year.  This Plan will be reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations, as well as to incorporate any facility changes. \n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\n\u007f\tThe AmeriCold Logistics, Inc. Plant 80513 facility chills and stores a variety of food products in their cold storage warehouse.  The refrigeration process, consisting of piping, valves, and equipment, cycles ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration for cold storage rooms.  Changes in pressure are directly related to changes in temperature.  For example, lowering the ammonia pressure lowers its temperature.  Low pressure (cold) liquid ammonia provides refrigeration by removing ambient heat.  Removal of ambient heat causes the liquid ammonia (contained within the system) to vaporize.  Heat is later removed from the ammonia as it is condensed back into a liquid"

Plant 80513 has implemented a Process Safety Management program for compliance with the OSHA 1910.119 regulation since 1-1-94.\n\n FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere have been no reported releases of ammonia at this facility over the last five years 6-21-94 through 6-21-99.    \n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe AmeriCold Logistics, Inc. Plant 80513 has an Emergency Response Program in place.  The facility has an Emergency Response Team that is trained to First Responder Operations Level on an annual basis.  All Emergency Response Team members are fit tested and respiratory trained annually.   \n\nDuring the RMP Development Review, it was recommended that the facility conduct annual evacuation drills to ensure all employees understand the emergency response procedures.  In addition, it was recommended that the facility contact the local Fire Department regarding participation in the evacuation drills.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nDuring the development of the Process Safety Management program at this facility, the initial Process Hazard Analysis study (1-1-94) generated mitigation measures that would improve safety at the AmeriCold Logistics, Inc. Plant 80513 facility located at 2233 Jesse St. in Los Angeles, California.  These action items are as follows:\n\nR-01    Consider installing ammonia sensors in the engine room  \nR-02    Consider installing a King valve that is interlocked with the ammonia sensors. It would be             held open during normal operations and close when  the compressors are shut down\nR-03    Implement a maintenance program to recertify/test or replace relief  valves every years\nR-04    Formalize written standard operating procedures. Include procedures for manual oil drain"

These recommendations are a result of the review of the PSM prevention programs and the Emergency R esponse Program for preparation of the Risk Management Program and Plan. These recommendations are as follows:\n\nR-10    Fabricate and stock an Emergency cabinet with all mandated items"
