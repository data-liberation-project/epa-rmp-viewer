Production at the facility was initiated in January 2008.  Poet\n\nBiorefining-Leipsic produces ethanol using the dry mill method.  Corn meal \n\nis mixed with water and a digestive enzyme to produce starch, which is liquefied.  \n\nThe resulting mash is cooled and the starch is converted to fermentable sugars.  \n\nYeast is added to the mash to ferment the sugars to ethanol.\n\n\n\nThe fermented mash (beer) contains about 10% alcohol and is distilled,\n\nthen passed through a dehydration system to produce 200-proof anhydrous\n\nethanol.  After final dehydration, the ethanol is collected in two\n\n2,000,000-gallon storage tanks for addition of a denaturant (natural gas\n\ncondensate, NGC) to make the ethanol unfit for human consumption, per\n\nfederal and state requirements.  The NGC denaturant is stored (primarily)\n\nin Tank No. 805, which has a capacity of 112,800 gallons\n\n(approximately 710,000 pounds), and potentially in Tank No. 802, which has a\n\ncapacity of 250,000 gallons (approximately 1,574,000 pounds).  NGC is blended\n\nin-line with the ethanol and transferred to vehicles for transport\n\noff-site.  The denatured ethanol is shipped from the facility in tank\n\ntrucks and rail cars.\n\n\n\nChemicals Regulated Under EPA?s Chemical Accident Prevention Program\n\n\n\nThe NGC denaturant is the only CAPP/RMP regulated chemical which\n\nexceeds the CAPP quantity thresholds for applicability of the regulation.\n\nThe CAPP/RMP regulated process consists of the NGC denaturant storage\n\ntank and the associated blending/transfer equipment and piping.  The\n\ndenaturant is added to the ethanol to a concentration of 2% to 5%.  The\n\ngreatest CAPP regulated quantity of denaturant in a tank, vessel or piping\n\nsystem is the quantity in the denaturant storage tank, lo"
