This committment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.\n\n2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nOur facilitiy's primary activities encompass wholesale chemical distribution. We have six (6) regulated substances present at our facility. these substances include, Hydrofluoric Acid, Ammonia >20%, Formaldehyde solutions, Ethylenediamine, Isopropylamine, and Chlorine.\n\nThe maximum inventory of hydrofluoric acid at our facility is 101500 lb., while ethylenediamine, isopropylamine, ammonia, formaldehyde and chlorine are present at our facility in quanties of 42000 lb., 26000 lb., 23,490 lb., 22,200 lb. and 10,800 lb. respectively.\n\n3. The Worst Case Release Scenario and the Alternative Release Scenarios, Including Administrative Controls and Mitigation Measures to Limit Distances for each Reported Scenario\n\nTo perform offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used the EPA's OCA Guidance Reference Tables or Equations. The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from chlorine storage and handling. In this scenario, 10,800 lb. of chlorine is released. The toxic liquid is assumed to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place. The entire pool is estimated to evaporate over 10 minutes. At class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s windspeed, the maximum distance of 11 miles is obtained.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for formaldehyde involves a release from formaldehyde repackaging and storage. The scenarion involves the release of 1363 lb. of f"

The entire pool is estimated to have evaporated after 10 minutes. Passive mitigation controls such as buildings and drains are taken into account to calculate the scenario. Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance of 0.28 miles is obtained.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for ammonia >20% involves a release from ammonium hydroxide storage and handling. The scenario involves the release of 1179 lb. of ammonium hydroxide. Toxic liquid is assumed to be released to form a pool from which evaporation takes place. The entire pool is estimated to have evaporated after 10 minutes. Passive mitigation controls such as dikes and drains are taken into account to calculate the scenario. Under neutral weather conditions the maximum distance of 0.19 miles is obtained.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for hydrofluoric acid 70% invloves a release from the storage tank. The scenario involves the release of 2908 lb. of Hydrofluoric Acid. Toxic Liquid is assumed to be released to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place. The entire pool is estimated to have evaporated in 10 minutes. Passive mitigation controls such as dikes and drains are taken into account to calculate the scenario. Under neutral weather conditions the maximum distance of 0.19 miles is obtained.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for chlorine involves a release of chlorine from a cylinder. The scenario involves the release of 25 lb. of chlorine. Toxic liquid is assumed to be released to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place. The entire pool is estimated to have evaporated in 10 minutes. Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance of 0.12 miles is obtained.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for ethylenediamine involves a release from a drum.

Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance of <0.06 miles is obtained.\n\nThe worst case scenario submitted for program 2 and 3 flammable substances as a class involves a release from isopropylamine handling and storage. In this scenario, 26000 lb. Of isopropylamine is released. It is assumed that the entire quantity is released as a vapor, which finds an ignition source, with 10% of the released quantity participating in a vapor cloud explosion. Under worst case weather conditions, the calculated distance of 0.22 miles is obtained.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for program 2 and 3 flammable substances involves a release of isopropylamine from a 400 lb. drum.
