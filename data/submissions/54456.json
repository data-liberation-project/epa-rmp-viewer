We operate under our parent company, General Electric (GE), policy for Safety, Health & Environment.  This policy states:\n\n\u00bfGE is committed to achieving environmental, health and safety (EHS) excellence.  This are responsibilities for management and employees in all functions.  GE will strive to provide a safe and healthy working environment and to avoid adverse impact and injury to the environment and the communities in which we do business.  Our programs must combine clear leadership by management, the participation of all employees and functions, and the use of appropriate technology in developing and distributing GE products and services.\n\nPrevention Program Requirements:\n\n\u00bfComply with applicable environmental, health and safety (EHS) laws and regulations.\n\n\u00bfTake appropriate measures to prevent workplace injuries and illnesses, and to provide employees with a safe and healthy working environment.  Consider evolving industry practices, regulatory requirements and societal standards of care.\n\n\u00bfAssess EHS impacts before starting a new activity or project.  Consider EHS impacts in the design and production of GE\u00bfs products and services.\n\n\u00bfEliminate unreasonable risks from GE\u00bfs facilities, products, services and activities.\n\n\u00bfTo the extent reasonably practicable, reduce the use and release of toxic and hazardous materials, prevent pollution and conserve, recover and recycle materials.\n\n\u00bfContinue to improve our EHS systems and performance as an integral part of GE\u00bfs operational strategy.\u00bf\n\nFacility Description and the Regulated Substances Handled:\n\nGE Water & Process Technologies manufactures specialty water-treatment chemicals, primarily used for the treatment of water and wastewater in industrial process systems such as boilers and cooling towers.

Similarly, our raw materials which we receive from suppliers come in various size containers depending on customer demand for the product and the amount necessary to meet supply limitations and production demand.\n\nThe GE Water & Process Technologies New Philadelphia Plant covers 14.7 acres of property, of which 3.1 acres is used for offices, warehouse(s), production facilities and outdoor material storage.  The balance is used for access roads, parking lot and open lawn or idle areas.  The regulated substance at the facility is cyclohexylamine, a chemical raw material stored onsite as a liquid in a bulk storage tank.  It acts as a corrosion inhibitor by neutralizing acids and elevating pH in steam condensate, which makes it particularly useful as a component of our product line and to our customers.  This material is stored in a protected area and isolated from combustion sources.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps:\n\nThe purpose of the program is to define steps that are taken to identify, evaluate and prevent or mitigate releases of hazardous chemicals that could occur as a result of failures in processes, procedures or equipment.  The prevention program includes elements that include: 1) compilation of process safety information related to the process; 2) performance of process hazard review to identify and evaluate potential release scenarios; 3) development and use of operating procedures and safety procedures; 4) processes for ensuring training of employees who are involved in handling hazardous chemicals; 5) preventive maintenance for key equipment to limit the potential for failures that could cause releases; 6) processes for managing changes in the process; 7) conducting incident investigations for any release events tha"

Identification of emergency organization personnel structure and functional responsibilities;\n2. Quarterly inspections to check safety control devices and detect hazards;\n3. Fire extinguisher training;\n4. Fire drills conducted by our facility;\n5. Spill and release control instructions;\n6. Evacuation procedures and external response notifications;\n7. Incident coordination with local emergency responders;\n8. Incident analysis and review with plant personnel, and identification of procedure changes; \n9. Annual program review and re-training.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:\n\nOur plans for safety improvement include refresher training on safe handling of RMP-regulated substances during production operations."
