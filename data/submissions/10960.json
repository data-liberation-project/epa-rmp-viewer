(AGA) facility located in Maumee, Ohio complies with NFPA requirements for LP-Gas storage and applicable requirements for toxic substances, and it is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws.  If an emergency accidental release were to occur involving our propane, butane, isobutane/propane mixture, ammonia, chlorine, hydrogen chloride, hydrogen fluoride, hydrogen sulfide, sulfur dixode, and methly choride storage/handling systems, it is our policy to immediately notify the Monclova Fire Department and the AGA emergency response team, who would respond to the emergency.\n\n2.  A description of the facility and the regulated substances handled:\nThe AGA facility stores propane, butane and an isobutane/propane mixture in above ground storage tanks (ASTs). All three liquified gases are put into storage cylinders of various sizes before they are sold and shipped from the facility.   The propane, butane, and isobutane/propane storage/handling processes consist of one 14,400-gallon propane AST, two 1,482-gallon butane ASTs, one 4,800-gallon isobutane/propane AST,  cylinder filling equipment, filled cylinders of various sizes, and associated piping, valves, and other miscellaneous equipment.  Ammonia, Chlorine, Hydrogen chloride, Hydrogen fluoride, Hydrogen sulfide, Methyl chloride, and Sulfur dioxide are stored at the AGA facility in cylinders only.  The cylinders are transported to the facility, stored for a period of time, and then shipped from the facility.  \n\n3.  The worst-case release scenario:\nThe flammable worst-case release scenario for the AGA facility considers the potential failure of the 14,400-gallon propane storage tank filled to 80% of it's holding capacity (administrative controls limit each storage tank to 80% of capacity at 600F), resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.

The residential population within this 0.3-mile radius is approximately 78 persons, which was estimated using an Environmental Data Resources - Offsite Receptor Report.\nThe toxic worst-case release scenario for the AGA facility considers the potential failure of one 1,000-pound sulfur dioxide cylinder.  The 1,000-pound sulfur dioxide cylinders are rarely present at the facility (approximately one month per year).  Utilizing RMP*Comp, the distance to the toxic endpoint (0.0078 mg/L) was determined to be 2.1 miles.  The public receptors affected under this worst-case release scenario include:  commercial, office, and/or industrial facilities, agricultural land, residential property, hospitals, nursing homes, and schools.  The residential population within this 2.1-mile radius is approximately 8900 persons, which was estimated using an Environmental Data Resources - Offsite Receptor Report.\n\n4.  The alternative release scenario:\nThe flammable alternative release scenario for the AGA facility considers the potential release of propane from a 100-pound capacity storage cylinder (i.e., caused by a cylinder being knocked over, resulting in the cylinder valve being broken off), resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  The release rate of propane from the cylinder was estimated to be 1.67 pounds per minute.  It was assumed that the release occurred for a duration of 60 minutes.
