      "SummaryText": "The Airgas-Mid South Ponca City facility, owned and operated by Airgas-Mid South, Inc., is located at 1124 N. Waverly Street ? Ponca City, OK 74601. The management and employees at the Ponca City facility are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of Acetylene and Propylene. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities to mitigate the release and minimize the impact of the release to the surrounding community and environment.\n\nThis facility?s primary operation is the manufacturing and storage of Acetylene. Acetylene is manufactured using an acetylene generator to provide a controlled environment in which calcium carbide and water are combined to produce acetylene gas. The acetylene is compressed into compressed gas cylinders containing an inert filler material and acetone. The Acetylene dissolves into the acetone inside the cylinder, which stabilizes the acetylene. Each cylinder is checked by weight of Acetylene to insure that they have the proper amount of product. Cylinders are removed from the fill lines and placed into storage for shipment.\n\nThis facility?s secondary operation is the filling of propylene into compressed gas cylinders. Propylene is delivered via tanker truck by supplier to our location and transferred to a 12,000 gallon horizontal storage tank via process piping. This tank is used as the supply source to fill containers of various sizes for customers of our retail locations. All cylinders received are stored in a designated area before going to the filling process. Pryor to filling, all cylinders are inspected for correct color, proper valve, pressure rating and various DOT markings. After filling, cylinders are placed into storage for shipment.\n\nConsidering the acetylene manufacturing/filling and propylene filling processes, the Process Hazard Analysis Team determined the following to be the most likely worst case and alternative release scenarios:\n\n- "

      "SummaryText": "Acetylene Worst Case Scenario ? Uncontrolled release of 17,100 lbs. of gaseous acetylene from acetylene filling process. This process includes the acetylene generator, all cylinders connected to fill manifolds, the acetylene pipeline, and all cylinders connected to pipeline supply manifold, all of which are interconnected through piping. Using RMP*Comp, the distance to endpoint for a Vapor Cloud Explosion is 0.2 miles.\n\n- Acetylene Alternative Scenario ? Uncontrolled release of largest size acetylene cylinder stored on property, a 420 cubic ft. (29 lbs) cylinder. Using RMP*Comp, it was determined that the LFL could be met up 0.1 miles from release point.\n\n- Propylene Worst Case Scenario ? Uncontrolled, complete loss of 12,000 gallon propylene storage tank. Using RMP*Comp, the distance to endpoint for a Vapor Cloud Explosion is 0.3 miles.\n\n- Propylene Alternative Scenario ? Uncontrolled release of most common cylinder on site, a 99 lb. propylene cylinder. Using RMP*Comp, it was determined that the LFL could be met <0.1 miles from release point.\n\nAirgas-Mid South manages the safety of regulated processes by means of operating procedures, equipment testing and inspections, safety devices (e.g. alarms, shutdowns, instrumentation, relief devices) inherent to the design of the facility and other controls and systems designed to prevent accidental release of hazardous chemicals. Safe work practices and training of our personnel supplement the inherent safe design of the plant.\n\nOur emergency response plan includes procedures for notifying the local fire department hazardous materials response unit so that the appropriate measures can be taken by local emergency response personnel to control accidental releases.\n\nThis document has been prepared in accordance with EPA?s RMP regulation (40 CFR, part 68). The substances and processes considered during the preparation of this RMP and the scenarios described were selected based on criteria established in the regulation.\n\nThere h"

      "SummaryText": "ave been no accidents involving or accidental releases of product that have resulted in death, injury or property damage on site. Additionally, there have been no accidents involving or accidental releases of product known to have resulted in any off-site death, injury or property damage.\n\nAt this site, employees are trained to recognize emergencies and initiate response from outside agencies. Employees and contractors are trained on the emergency response plan prior to commencement of work. The emergency response plan is tested and reviewed twice a year to insure it is current. \n\nDuring the Process Hazard Analysis, which included a thorough review of process equipment and procedures, a number of action items were identified to improve the overall safety for this facility. Implementing each of these items will be an ongoing process which we hope to complete no later than December 31, 2009."
