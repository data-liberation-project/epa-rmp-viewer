      "SummaryText": "Molson Coors USA LLC operates a brewing and packaging facility in Golden, Colorado. This facility uses chlorine and ammonia.  Use of these chemicals is regulated under the Clean Air Act Amendments (CAAA), Section 112(r), and the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Accidental Release Prevention Risk Management (RM) Planning regulations (40 CFR, Part 68). Under the CAAA and the RM regulations, this facility is considered to be a stationary source.\r\n\r\nThere are two processes within the Golden Brewery Business Unit that require a Risk Management Program:\r\n1.\tBrewery ammonia refrigeration process.\r\n2.\tWater plant chlorine disinfection process\r\n\r\nThis document addresses the five EPA regulatory requirements for a RM Plan, which form the basis of the RM program for the Golden facilities.  EPA's five key regulatory requirements for a RM program are:\r\n\r\n1.\tManagement Plan\r\n2.\tHazard Assessment \r\n3.\tAccidental Release Prevention Program\r\n4.\tEmergency Response\r\n5.\tRisk Management (RM) Plan and Data Elements\r\n\r\nThis RM plan is summarized below.\r\n\r\nRequirement 1.  Management Plan\r\nThe facility has a program in place to manage the implementation of the RM program elements.  The program is under continuous review and improvement with the objective to reduce release risk.  The program engages operations personnel through the employee participation process. All changes are subject to review prior to approval and implementation following the Management of Change Process. Compliance with program elements is subject to auditing processes.  Corrective actions are implemented to address audit findings. \r\n\r\nRequirement 2.  Hazard Assessment\r\nA \"Worst-Case Scenario Offsite Consequence Analysis\" and an \"Alternative Scenario Offsite Consequence Analysis\" were performed identifying the public and environmental receptors within the toxic endpoint concentration radius of 200 ppm. The results are mitigated by the fact that all the vessels and the much of the piping are inside the"

A wide variety of administrative controls and computerized controls are in place to shut the system down when operating parameters and limits are exceeded.\r\n\r\nIn the last 5 years there has never been a release that has resulted in offsite property damage or offsite health consequences requiring medical treatment from the processes.\r\n\r\nRequirement 3.  Prevention Program\r\nThe prevention programs for the covered processes were developed to comply with Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations (29CFR 1910.119).\r\n\r\nFor the covered processes (which are subject to the PSM standard), EPA requires a Program 3 prevention program with 12 specific elements as listed below and described in Section 3.0:\r\n\r\n1.\tEmployee Participation\t2.\tProcess Safety Information\r\n3.\tProcess Hazard Analysis\t4.\tOperating Procedures\r\n5.\tContractors\t        6.\tPre-Startup Safety Review\r\n7.\tTraining\t        8.\tMechanical Integrity\r\n9.\tHot Work Permit\t       10.\tManagement of Change\r\n11.\tIncident Investigation\t12.\tCompliance Audits\r\n\r\nRequirement 4.  Emergency Response\r\nThe emergency response program is based on the Emergency Action Plan requirement to train all personnel to recognize releases and immediately inform Security by telephone at extension 73333.  Utilities sends trained personnel to the scene to assess the situation, act as the initial Incident Commander, and engage the proper internal and external emergency response personnel and equipment in accordance with National Incident Management System (NIMS) requirements and guidelines.  When external emergency responders are needed, a joint command is then established which is led by the authority having jurisdiction (AHJ) and supported by MC personnel.  The AHJ can call additional external emergency response resources to the scene including City of Golden Fire Department, Fairmont Fire Department, West Metro Fire Department, the Jefferson County Sheriff, Colorado St"

RM Plan and Data Elements\r\nThe specific data elements required to be electronically reported to EPA are included in Section 5.0.  The data elements are supported by this RM plan which documents and provides additional details for each RM regulatory requirement.  Section 5 consists of a complete printout from EPA's RMP Submit software.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlanned Improvements\r\nIn 2019 the RM Plan was resubmitted as a result of completed improvements. The facility eliminated the use of ammonia at the GDC (Golden Distribution Facility 3801 McIntyre Ct, Golden, CO 80403).\r\n\r\nActions taken to improve safety are the implementation of the Prevention Programs. The facility is incorporating and addressing recommendations resulting from the Process Hazard Analysis, Offsite Consequences, and program audits. The flexibility of the program allows the facility to respond effectively to prevent or minimize any potential exposure of facility employees, the surrounding public, and/or the environment to a release of anhydrous ammonia."
