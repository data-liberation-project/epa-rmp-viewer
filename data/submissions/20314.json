Box 98\nMalone, TX 76660\n\nBRANDON, TX LOCATION\n\nFor further information contact:General Manager\n\nRisk Management Plan - EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n1.The Facility Policy\n\nThe owners, management, and employees of Farmers Coop Gin & Grain are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire company, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2.Facility Information\n\n\u00b7The primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers.\n\u00b7Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for both direct application and for blending into      mixed-grade fertilizers for crop production nutrients.\n\u00b7The maximum quantity stored would be 55,000 pounds in our 12,000 gallon storage tanks.  \n\n3.The worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario.\n\na.The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank (or tank car) released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 55,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 1.5 miles.\nb.\tThe alternative release scenario based on the five-year accident history (or the most likely potential incident) is a release from a break in a transfer hose.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is .83 miles.\n\n4.The accidental release prevention program\n\nThe facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, Kk-611.1\", published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc., and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"St"
