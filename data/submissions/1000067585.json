(KIK) is committed to promoting a safe operating environment for the facility, its employees and the surrounding community. The facility is complying with OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) standard, and EPA's Risk Management Program rule. The purpose of these regulations is to ensure that the covered process (aerosol packaging) is designed, operated and maintained safely. Compliance with these regulations helps to prevent releases from this process. Additionally, these regulations require development of procedures to minimize releases if they do occur, and to outline appropriate emergency response steps to take in the event of a release.\r\n\r\nFACILITY DESCRIPTION AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES: \r\nKIK owns and operates a facility in Danville, Illinois and offers full service custom packaging for various consumer product industries, such as pharmaceutical, household, cosmetic, and personal care. The products packaged for these industries consist of liquids, semi-liquid creams, lotions, and aerosols. Some of the types of products that KIK packages include: hair products, body sprays, shaving creams, household cleaners, etc. Many of these products are aerosols and use a flammable gas like propane to pressurize the containers so that the desired product can be sprayed from the aerosol cans. The regulated chemicals used as propellants in the aerosol packaging process are:\r\n\r\nButane (CAS No. 106-97-8);\r\nDifluoroethane (CAS No. 75-37-6):\r\nDimethylether (Methyl ether) (CAS No. 115-10-6);\r\nIsobutane (CAS No. 75-28-5);\r\nPropane (CAS No. 74-98-6);\r\nIsopentane (CAS No. 78-78-4).\r\n\r\nProcess equipment includes propellant storage tanks, a tank farm for ingredients, filling, packaging, and warehouse equipment. \r\n\r\nRELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM: \r\nKIK maintains a Process Safety Management program for its aerosol packaging process operation and maintenance. The PSM program has been incorporated as bot"

Some of the safety measures that are in place to ensure the safety of KIK employees and the surrounding community include:\r\n\r\n- Gas detection systems are installed in areas where there is a potential for hazardous levels of flammable gas to accumulate.\r\n- State of the art explosion suppression systems have been installed in all areas where flammable gas is transferred to aerosol containers. These systems are designed to detect and extinguish an ignition before a catastrophic explosion can occur.\r\n- All storage tanks that store hazardous materials are inspected on a periodic basis.\r\n- Periodic inspections are performed to ensure that all process equipment is adequately grounded. This reduces the chance of hazardous static electricity discharge that could ignite flammable vapors.\r\n- Tankers are equipped with emergency shutdown capability, adding to the safety of the unloading process.\r\n- Pressure relief valves are installed on the storage tanks and piping systems.\r\n- Standardized operating procedures are utilized for unloading and handling of flammable materials.\r\n- Ventilation systems are installed to prevent the accumulation of flammable vapors in processing areas.\r\n- Water cannons are installed near the propellant tanks to aid in cooling tanks, or assist if firefighting, if required\r\n\r\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY: \r\nThere have been no accidents or injuries related to the covered process during the past five years.\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM: \r\nKIK's Danville plant has established an Emergency Action Plan (EAP) to ensure appropriate steps are taken to protect public health and the environment, as well as the safety of plant employees.  The EAP is designed to address foreseeable emergency situations at the facility and provide appropriate hazard and emergency preparedness information to employees, contractors, emergency response personnel, and the comm"

      "SummaryText": "unity.  Emergency situations can include fire, explosion, chemical release or spill, bomb threats, weather emergencies, site security (i.e., terrorism) and other natural emergencies.\r\nKIK has developed procedures to be followed in the event of an emergency and a command structure to evaluate an emergency to determine the appropriate action to be taken to remedy it.  KIK staff has a first response capability and can administer basic first aid and CPR.  KIK will rely on the Westville Area Fire Department and the Vermillion County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) for assistance in controlling emergency releases and extinguishing fires.\r\n\r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY: \r\nKIK is committed through its grass-roots Continuous Improvement process to the expansion and refinement of its safety programs with special emphasis on training.  KIK facilities maintain active safety committees with broad involvement in training, incident investigation, and auditing.  These efforts are supplemented by a Divisional Auditing Program for general and critical safety.  KIK utilizes external professional resources to validate its internal programs and activities.  KIK also maintains strong contact with local fire and emergency management agencies, participating in mock disaster training exercises."
