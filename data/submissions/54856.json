MillerCoors is extremely diligent in the handling of all chemicals and is dedicated to the safety of its employees and the neighboring community. MillerCoors staff is highly trained and utilizes modern equipment to monitor the facility and provide safeguards, while effectively and safely using anhydrous ammonia and chlorine.\n\nMillerCoors LLC facility has a long standing commitment to its workers and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training and consideration of safety in the design, operation, and maintenance of the Ammonia Refrigeration System. MillerCoors policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance\nMillerCoors LLC facility is located at 15801 E First Street, Irwindale, California. The facility operates an ammonia refrigeration system.  The regulated substance in use is: anhydrous ammonia for the Ammonia Refrigeration System.\nThe largest vessels for the ammonia refrigeration system are:\n?    Two Anhydrous Ammonia Receivers =16,100 lbs each.\n\nHazard Assessment Summary/Offsite Consequence Analysis\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario Results Summary:\nScenario Description: Per the EPA RMP Regulations, one worst case analysis has been defined for each covered process.
