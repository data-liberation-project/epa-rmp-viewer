Revision of the Plan when necessary.\n\nOur Shreveport, LA chemical distributing facility has tank, tote, bag, and drum. It handles millions of pounds of chemicals / year. We have an Emergency Response Plan that assigns responsibilities for preventing hazardous releases.\n\nThe following chemicals are listed in program 3: Sulfur Dioxide (Anhydrous), Chlorine\n\nIn regard to Chlorine Safety and Sulfur Dioxide (Anhydrous) Safety, this material is stored in 2000 pound cylinders, outside, and away from strong acids, strong alkalies, alkali metals, brass, hypochlorites, and other incompatible materials. We have available self-contained breathing apparatus in case of an emergency release of vapors. The following considerations are taken in the case of Chlorine.\n\n1a. In a worst case scenario (such as the bursting of a 2000 pound cylinder and releasing its contents), emergency services (such as the fire department), would be notified. Unnecessary personnel would leave the area to a distance of 1.30 miles. Other facilities would be informed within this distance, and appropriate personal protective equipment would be put on by trained personnel and the spill would be contained by use of a special rescue cylinder repair kit.\n\nChlorine and Sulfur Dioxide (Anhydrous) cylinders are ruggedly designed and DOT approved. A protective cap covers the cylinder valves at all times when the cylinder is not in use. The cylinders are equipped with pressure relief devices to prevent rupture of the cylinder if exposed to heat.\n\nChlorine and Sulfur Dioxide (Anhydrous) cylinders are unloaded, handled, and loaded by special equipment designed specifically for cylinder handling. Cylinders are visually inspected daily. The are inspected on a routine basis and are approved by the DOT. Employees are trained on the hazards of chlorine.

An empty, clean chlorine cylinder is used by Brenntag Southwest, Inc emergency responders to practice applying the special repair kit to quickly stop a leak. Brenntag Southwest, Inc maintains an emergancy response team whose members are specially trained and provided with proper personal protection to allow them to responde to a chlorine or sulfur dioxide leak, disperse the vapors and stop the leak. Response is coordinated with emergancy response agencies in the community if a release occurs. Brenntag Southwest, Inc has a contract with an emergency response company if the need arises."
