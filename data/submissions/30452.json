              "Description": "Preventive Maintenance Program consists of a maintenance schedule that involves draining oil, rebuilding pumps, changing out relief regulator, cleaning condensers ports, following manufactures suggested maintenance practices on all plant equipment, checking and inspecting divert valves.  Maintenance Program includes the constant monitoring of the ammonia system. The control system is comprised of an Allen Bradley SLC 5/04 Program Logic Controller (PLC).  The PLC runs continuously and provides all direct automatic control to the system.  The Allen Bradley Controller is also interfaced through personal computes in the Maintenance Shop, Maintenance Manger Office, and the Information Manager Office. RSView 32 provides communication audio alarms, pager alarms and direct link to EST alarm System. Ammonia Sensor are set to notified selected personnel at 5PPM at 10 PPM a computer generated voice is transmitted over the public address system at the same time each computer shows PPM in each room. At 100 PPM a call goes into the emergency management system. EST Alarm system is tied into Emergency Response system for Lackawanna County.  Daily maintenance inspection logs are kept for each shift any deviation from the standard operating procedure is addressed.",

All applicable procedures of the U.S. Environmental Protective Agency (EPA) prevention program are adhered to.  Mia Products emergency response policy involves the preparation of an emergency response plan and the emergency response services in the community. Mia Products is in compliance with all OSHA and EPA Emergency Response Program requirements.\n\nB.    Mia Product is a producer of novelty ice products.  On site we have 22,000 lbs. Anhydrous Ammonia.  Mia Products uses anhydrous ammonia as a refrigeration to cool products and chill liquids.  The plant is normally manned around the clock, the only exception would be holidays.  On holidays the plant is monitored by an in-house alarm system that is monitored by EST security.\n\nC.    The offsite consequence analysis includes consideration of two anhydrous ammonia release scenarios, identified as ?worst case release? and ?alternative scenario?.  First scenario is defined by EPA, which states that the owner or operator shall assume that the maximum quantity in the largest vessel is released as a gas over 10 minutes, due to an unspecific failure.  The alternative scenario is defined as ?more likely to occur than the worst-case release scenario?.  \n\nThe worst-case release scenario at Mia Products involves a failure of the receiver, which is connected, to the 22,000 lb system.  The offsite consequence analysis for the scenario was performed for the two sets of conditions.  The first set followed conditions pre-defined by the EPA, namely release of the entire amount as a gas in 10 minutes, using of the one hour average ERPG-3 as the toxic endpoint, and consideration of the population residing within the full circle with radius corresponding to the toxic endpoint distant.  EPA set these conditions to facility the performance of the offsite consequence analysi"

The amount of release anhydrous ammonia released is 24 lbs./min. at the average rate over one hour (the duration of the release) of 44lbs./min.  Toxic endpoint distance to ERPG-2 and ?3 levels were obtained.  The latter is defined as IDLH as ?the maximum airborne concentration below which that individuals could be exposed for up to without experience or developing life threat ting health effects?.  The typical meteorological conditions used were Stability E, Wind Speed 3m/sec, Average Temperature 62 degrees F., and 63% average humidity.  The estimated distance traveled to the toxic endpoint is .43 miles.  The estimated of residence population affected is 1520.\n\nD.    Mia Products accident release prevention program is based on the following key elements:\na.    High level of training of the operators and maintenance personnel.\nb.    Preventive maintenance program.\nc.    Use of state-of-art- process and safety equipment.\nd.    Use of accurate and effective operating procedures written with the participation of the operators.\ne.    Performance of a hazard analysis of equipment and procedures.\nf.    Implementation of an audit and inspection program.\n\nPreventive steps include availability of Full Face Mask both Canister and Cartridges, self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA), Class A Suits, Class B Suits, MSA DragonFly alarms, Motorola communication devices (two way earpieces), hand held ammonia detectors, fixed ammonia detectors, and training (Technician Level).
