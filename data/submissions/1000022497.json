The facility provides and secondary treatment of wastewater prior to the disinfection of the final effluent before being discharged to the Lawson Fork Creek.  The RMP regulations cover the chlorination and dechlorination processes at this facility which use chlorine and sulfur dioxide, respectively.  The chlorination system provides destruction of pathogenic microorganisms in the wastewater effluent.  The dechlorination system is needed to reduce chlorine residual before discharge to receiving waters.\n\nThe City of Inman Wastewater Treatment Plant emergency response policy involves the preparation of an emergency response plan as described in the RMP Management Program and to the emergency response services available in the community.  The emergency response program includes procedures for notification of the National Response Center, City of Inman Fire Department, LEPC (community response plan), and SCDHEC (state response plan).  The City of Inman Wastewater Treatment Plant emergency preparedness program is based upon recommendation of the Water Environment Federation (WEF) and the Chlorine Institute and is in compliance with the EPA Risk Management Emergency Response Program (40 CFR 68.90) requirements.\n\n2.\tThe Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe regulated substances handled and used at the City of Inman Wastewater Treatment Plant are chlorine and sulfur dioxide.\n\nThe City of Inman Wastewater Treatment Plant provides biological treatment of sanitary and industrial wastewater generated through out the City's service area.  Chlorine is used in the wastewater treatment process to destroy nuisance and pathogenic microorganisms in the wastewater (i.e., chlorine use as a wastewater disinfectant is an industry standard)."
