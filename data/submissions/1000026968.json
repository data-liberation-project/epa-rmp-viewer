              "Description": "Fertilizer Plant/ Anhydrous Ammonia- FOR PRODUCT STORAGE ONLY\n\nThis plan is to minimize those hazards to human health and to the environment that are associated with accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. Employees working at the bulk storage plant make routine observations prior to and during transfer operations of the anhydrous ammonia from the storage vessel(s) to nurse tanks. In so doing, they are able to detect problems before they arise. This routine inspection identifies any portion of the system that may be under stress or about to fail. Repairs can be made before they become problematic. Employees are annually trained to recognize the hazards associated with storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia. In addition to annual training for employees who have been on the job for a number of years, the company conducts training for new hires. This training includes classroom instruction, on-site training at the plant, and follow-up observation to determine their individual comprehension and understanding of the new hire. Finally, the company rountinely invites local fire department personnel to visit the site. In the event that the local fire department requests assistance in training its employees on anhydrous ammonia, the company cooperates fully in their endeavors.",

FERTILIZER PLANT, BLAIRSBURG, IOWA\n\n\n\nThis facility complies with ANSI Standard k-61.1995 requirements for Anhydrous Ammonia storage. It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal, State, and local regulations. If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to immediately vacate the premises, move to a safe location, and notify the Blairsburg Volunteer Fire Department (via 911 call) and request that it respond to the emergency. Incidental to the notification to the fire department, a call to the Region 5 LEPC will be made.\n\n\n\nWhile we have planned for an emergency, it is acknowledged that a real emergency will be unexcepted and may very well be different and cannot be ensured to duplicate what we have planned. In reality, the situation that develops may not happen in the manner in which it has been planned. In that event, what we may have planned will serve only as a guideline to follow. \n\n\n\nThe Emergency Action Plan for this facility describes certain procedures that are intended to minimize the hazards associated with the human health and the environment from fires, explosions, the sudden and unexpected release of chemicals (i.e. Anhydrous Ammonia), tornadoes, bomb threats or other accidents or acts of God which might occur on our premises.\n\n\n\nThe primary emergency response coordinator for the Blairsburg, Iowa locations is Mike Nelson, Operations Manager. His work and 24 hour emergency response numbers are provided in the Registration Section of this document. The 24 hour emergency response number provided in that section also provides a telephone tree for additional individuals who are available and can respond to an emergency at that location.\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE ANHYDROUS AMMONIA STORAGE/DISTRIBUTION PLANT AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCE HANDLED AT THE NEW COOPERATIVE BLAIRSBURG FERTILIZER PLANT\n\n\n\nThis facility is a bulk anhydrous ammonia storage and distribution plant.

      "SummaryText": "us ammonia that is stored at this facility is distributed to agricultural crop producers in the surrounding area who utilize the anhydrous ammonia for crop nutrient purposes.\n\n\n\nThis system consists of two (2) storage tanks with associated piping, valves, liquid pump(s), and other miscellaneous equipment and an inidentified number of nurse tanks. The anhydrous ammonia plant is only operated on a seasonal basis (Spring and Fall). Full-time equivalent employee numbers were computed on that basis. At a maximum, the plant operates a total of three (3) months (1/4 of the year). The FTEs for this company location is one (1). \n\n\n\nWORST CASE SCENARIO: The worst case scenario is the failure of the largest storage tank when filled to the greatest amount allowed (85% capacity), resulting in the release of the total volume in a gasous (hazardous ammonia vapor cloud) form. According to EPA's RMP* Comp Program (version 1/06) the distance to the endpoint is 3.6 miles. The alternative release scenario involves the transport delivery vehicle pulling away from the intake lines into the storage plant without disconnecting the transfer hose. The resulting release (according to EPA's RMP* Comp Program) has a distance to endpoint of 0.1 miles.\n\n\n\nSince this facility is located in relatively close proximity to the Town of Blairsburg, provisions have been designed to notify all affected persons. An evacuation plan is in place.\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS: This facility complies with the EPA's accident prevention rule and all applicable State and local codes and regulations. The anhydrous ammonia system is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with ANSI Standard k-61.1995 and state law. \n\n\n\nIn addition the company has specific operating procedures in place intended to minimize the potential for an accidental (and potentially catastrophic) release of anhydrous ammonia.

In the unlikely event that the Blairsburg Volunteer Fire Dept is unable to adequately respond to an emergency at our Blairsburg location, mutal aid ( reciprocal agreement between neighboring fire departments) will be summonded.
