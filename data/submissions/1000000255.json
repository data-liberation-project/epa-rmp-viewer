Hasa supports policies designed to ensure that America's roads, skies, railways, and shipping remain as secure thoroughfares for commerce and travel.  Hasa is committed to doing its part to promote public safety and security, and we are working cooperatively with other industries and government agencies on these issues of critical importance.\n\nAs mentioned above, Hasa manufactures commercial, institutional, industrial, and household bleach, also known by the chemical name sodium hypochlorite by reacting liquefied chlorine with dilute caustic solution under controlled conditions.  Liquefied chlorine is the only material on-site, which is regulated under the Environmental Protection Agency Risk Management Plan (EPA RMP), California Accidental Release Prevention Program (CalARP), Occupational and Safety Health Administration Process Safety Management (OSHA PSM), and California Occupational and Safety Health Administration Process Safety Management (Cal/OSHA PSM) programs.

Recreational water is a relatively new term and includes water systems in amusement parks with water slides.  Sodium hypochlorite, commonly known as bleach, is manufactured by reacting liquefied chlorine with dilute caustic solution under controlled conditions of temperature and pressure.\n\nAlong with many other segments of the American economy, Hasa recognizes there is a new reality, which requires a heightened level of vigilance and increased communication with law enforcement and security agencies.  Hasa has taken proactive measures to upgrade its security so that its products will continue to be manufactured, stored and transported in a manner that protects the public's health and safeguards our environment.\n\nChlorine has been part of our country's public health defenses for over 100 years.  As such, chlorine chemistry is part of the nation's first line of defense against terrorism.  Chlorine-based disinfectants are used by 98% of modern water purification plants to kill bacteria and viruses.  This is an essential factor in delivering safe water to homes for drinking, cooking, and bathing.  On top of the every day protection, chlorine also effectively kills many potential biological warfare agents.  \n\nIn the event of a terrorist attack using an airborne biological warfare agent, bleach can be used to decontaminate surfaces subject to such attacks.

Crossfield Chemical Company discontinued operations approximately five years before Hasa acquired the facility. During that time the plant was not in use.  \n\nHasa's first manufacturing facility opened in 1964 at Saugus, California location.  Subsequently, Hasa expanded the business through acquisitions and construction of additional plants. Hasa acquired the swimming pool sodium hypochlorite manufacturing and distribution division of Purex and all operations of the GPS Division of All Pure Chemical Company, itself a division of Pioneer Chemical Company. The Purex and GPS operations were consolidated at the Saugus plant. Three new plants were constructed: one in Eloy in 1982 (Phoenix area), Arizona; one in Longview, WA in 2005; and this one here in Pittsburg, California. The manufacture and unloading processes at all plants are essentially identical.  \n\nThe liquefied chlorine unloading system and bleach manufacturing module at Saugus survived two major earthquakes with no structural damage or loss of contents: the one in Sylmar in 1972; the other with an epicenter in Northridge in 1994. The unloading system and bleach-manufacturing module survived the earthquakes without damage, and manufacture of sodium hypochlorite solutions was restarted without any system repair or modification after appropriate safety reviews.\n\nPittsburg Facility\n\nThe unloading system and bleach-manufacturing module at the Pittsburg facility are state-of-the-art installations with redundant active and passive mitigation safety controls in place. There are chlorine gas sensors located strategically throughout the facility. If chlorine gas is detected, an automatic fail-safe-to-close valve system immediately closes the valves on the railroad tank car.

The program consists of sections on Employee Participation, Process Safety Information PSI, Process Hazard Analysis PHA, Operating Procedures, Training, Outside Contractor Requirements, Pre-Start up Review PSR, Mechanical Integrity, Hot Work Permits, Management of Change, Incident Investigation, Emergency Planning and Response, and Compliance Audits.\n\nEmergency Response\n\nHasa has in place an emergency response program in the event of a release of chlorine. Hasa HAZMAT employees are trained to respond to leakage in accordance with Department of Transportation requirements. Hasa has on site a Chlorine Institute Emergency Kit C, which contains fittings, hoods and devices to respond to and mitigate unlikely leaks from tank cars.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nHasa continually monitors and evaluates safety equipment and procedures.  At the present time there are no planed changes to improve safety or to change procedures, since the chlorine unloading system and bleach manufacturing module at the Pittsburg facility are already state-of-the-art installations with redundant active and passive mitigation safety controls in place.
