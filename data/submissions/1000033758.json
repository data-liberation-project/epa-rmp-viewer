              "Description": "WinCo's implementation of the PSM/RMP program includes employee/contractor education in the hazards of ammonia and measures that can be used to reduce employee and community exposure to accidental releases. The plan includes a regular preventative maintenance program (Mechanical Integrity) for the ammonia system components, and a program for both pre-startup safety (PSSR) reviews and management of change (MOC) to the ammonia refrigeration system. The program also includes operating procedures for the safe operation of the refrigeration system, specific requirements for safe work practices (such as safe approaches to welding and similar hot work), and safety requirements for contractors who may be hired to work on the refrigeration system. WinCo has a procedure in place for investigating incidents to ensure root causes are identified and corrective actions taken to minimize the potential for recurrence of incidents. The program also has a component for conducting compliance audits to ensure the PSM/RMP program is being implemented at the Woodburn facility. Lastly the PSM/RMP Program incorporates the facilities emergency response plan and places special emphasis on handling accidental releases of ammonia and the coordination of emergency response activities with the local fire department and other response agencies.",

Given the quantity handled, anhydrous ammonia is considered a hazardous substance by EPA.  Many of the properties that make ammonia valuable as a refrigerant also requires that precautions and procedures be in place to protect employee and public health and safety during a chemical emergency.  It is the policy of Winco Foods to be in compliance with all applicable federal and state rules and regulations.    \n\n\n\nSafety at our facility is inherent on the manner in which anhydrous ammonia is handled.  While the design of the facility incorporates a multitude of safety devices, safe handling procedures combined with appropriate training of our personnel are key aspects to maintaining safety at our facility.\n\n\n\nWe have a written Process Safety Management (PSM) plan that complies with the regulations stipulated by OAR 1910.119.  A crucial component of this plan is the Emergency Action Plan, developed in compliance with the Emergency Action provisions of OAR 437-002-0041.  The Emergency Action Plan includes pre-emergency planning and coordinating with outside parties.  This enables those who deal with emergencies to have a course of action to effectively deal with unplanned events.  \n\n\n\n1.20 Facility Description And Substances Handled\n\n\n\nThe Winco distribution center is a facility used for temporarily storing and transporting materials to the individual Winco grocery stores.  Storage of perishable items requires the use of a refrigeration system.   This refrigeration process uses ammonia as a refrigerant.  Access to the facility is restricted to authorized employees, management personnel, and contractors.\n\nThe regulated substance handled at this facility is anhydrous ammonia. The ammonia refrigeration system maximum inventory is 24,000 pounds of"

Offsite receptors were defined using Marplot and the 2010 U.S. census information.  This system estimates residential population within the circle defined by the endpoint of the worst-case and alternative release scenarios.

The design and construction of this facility was in accordance with published standards, tests or recommended methods of trade, industry or governmental organizations.  \n\n\n\nWinco Foods?s written PSM plan incorporates many policies and procedures to ensure safe operation and maintenance of this facility.  Plan elements essential to safe operation of the refrigeration system include employee participation, process hazard information, process hazard analysis, operating procedures, training, contractor safety, pre-startup safety review, mechanical integrity, management of change, hot-work permits, incident investigation, Emergency Action and planning, and compliance audits.  This plan will be reviewed annually and updated as necessary by the Winco Foods Facility Maintenance Manager. \n\n\n\nTraining is provided to ensure that each employee involved in operating a process has been trained in an overview of the process, the operating procedures, and safety considerations.

This minimizes the chances of inadvertent error in operation that could lead to a release of ammonia.
