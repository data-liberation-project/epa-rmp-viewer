      "SummaryText": "1.0  SOURCE AND PROCESS DESCRIPTION\n\n\n\n1.1 Source\n\n\n\nThe Le Sueur Cheese Company Facility in Le Sueur, Minnesota is subject to the USEPA's Risk Management Program (RMP) for Accidental Chemical Release Regulation (40 CFR 68) because it has a refrigeration system that contains more than the threshold quantity (10,000 pounds) of anhydrous ammonia (CAS Number 7664-41-7).\n\n\n\n1.2 Process Description\n\n\n\nThe facility is a cheesemaking plant.  It takes in milk and processes it into cheese, then further processes the by-products into other dairy products.  The anhydrous ammonia (ammonia) refrigeration system is used for jacket cooling of vessels, for making ice water, and for cooling of rooms, processes, and storage of cheese.\n\n\n\nThe refrigeration system includes vessels, piping, a cooling tower, three 400 HP screw compressors, and one 12-cylinder and two 8-cylinder reciprocating compressors.\n\n\n\n2.0  POTENTIAL RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\n\n\nAs required by the RMP rule requirements, two specifically defined release scenarios (a worst-case release and an alternative-case release) were analyzed to determine the maximum distance to an endpoint where the ammonia concentration is 200 parts per million in air, or 0.02 percent.  The release scenarios analyzed are based upon the guidance contained in the USEPA's Model Risk Management Program and Plan for Ammonia Refrigeration (the \"Model Plan\"), dated May 1996.\n\n\n\n2.1 Worst-Case Release\n\n\n\nThe worst-case release is considered to be defined by the catastrophic rupture and complete loss of the contents of the largest vessel and associated piping over a 10-minute period.  Using the specified worst-case meteorology contained in the \"Model Plan\" and assuming the facility is located in an urban area, the distance to the endpoint extends beyond the facility's property boundary.\n\n\n\nAlthough the worst-case consequence analysis is required by RMP, it should be considered a highly unlikely event.  Design, construction, and operation of the refrigeration s"

The vessel was designed and constructed in strict accordance with the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code (Section VIII), and was certified and stamped by the National Board of Pressure Vessel Inspectors (National Board).  Third party and state mandated inspections of the vessel's condition occurs every year by a Department of Industry, Labor and Human Relations Inspector.\n\n\n\nThe vessel is operated well below the design pressure (i.e., maximum allowable working pressure) and because of safety factors built into the ASME Code, a fourfold pressure excursion would have to occur before catastrophic vessel failure.  If this were to occur, the vessel is equipped with safety relief valves (SRVs) set to relieve at a pressure below the design pressure.  A high pressure excursion would not occur as long as the SRVs continued to function.  Actuation of the SRVs would result in an ammonia release similar to that described in Section 2.2 for the alternative release scenario.  The SRVs are replaced every five years, in accordance with the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) Guidance contained in IIAR Bulletin Number 109, Minimum Safety Criteria for a Safety Ammonia Refrigeration System, to ensure that they will function properly when required.\n\n\n\nThe worst-case release scenario is unlikely for the following additional reasons:\n\n\n\n- The facility has a preventive maintenance program in place to maintain the ongoing integrity of the vessels;\n\n- The facility has a training program designed to ensure that the system is operated by qualified personnel; and\n\n- The facility has emergency response procedures which enable trained personnel to respond quickly to isolate any potential releases.\n\n\n\n2.2  Alternative-Case Release\n\n\n\nThe alternative release scenario is considered to be defined by a release of ammonia that is more likely to occur than"

The \"Model Plan\" scenario was used for this analysis, which assumes a release of ammonia through a < 0.25 inch effective diameter hole in a pipe or vessel.  Using the specified meteorology contained in the \"Model Plan,\" the distance to the endpoint extends beyond the facility's property boundary.\n\n\n\nThe alternative release scenario is unlikely for the following reasons:\n\n\n\n- Industrial standards were followed for the manufacture and quality control of these lines;\n\n- The facility has a preventive maintenance program in place to maintain the ongoing integrity of the system; and\n\n- The facility has a training program designed to ensure that the system is operated by qualified personnel.\n\n\n\n3.0  PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe facility has carefully considered the potential for accidental releases of ammonia, such as the occurrence of the worst-case and alternative-release scenarios described in Section 2.0.  To help minimize the probability and severity of an ammonia release, a prevention program that satisfies the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), Process Safety Management (PSM) of Highly Hazardous Chemicals (29 CFR 1910.119) has been implemented.  The key components of the prevention program are summarized below:\n\n\n\n- The development of an employee participation program which includes Le Sueur Facility employees from all areas within the plant.\n\n- The development, documentation, and operator availability of critical process safety information regarding the hazards of ammonia, the design basis of the system, and the equipment.  This information is used to fully understand and safely operate the ammonia refrigeration system.\n\n- The performance of a formal process hazard analysis (PHA) on the ammonia refrigeration system using a \"What-If\" Protection Analysis.  A team with expertise in engineering, operations, maintenance, and safety evaluated the existing refrigeration system in depth and de"

The PHA is updated and revalidated every five years.\n\n- Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) are used to provide the basis for proper and safe operation of the ammonia refrigeration system.  The SOPs include procedures for normal operations, startup, shutdown, and emergency operations, and emergency shutdown.  They also describe safe operating limits for temperature and pressure, consequences of operating outside these safe operating limits, and a description of safety systems and how they operate.\n\n- Refrigeration system operators receive refresher training at least every three years.  The training content is based on the process safety information and operating procedures.\n\n- Contractors that are hired to work on, or adjacent to, the refrigeration system are \"pre-qualified\" based on their knowledge of ammonia refrigeration, understanding of applicable codes and standards, and their demonstrated ability to work safely.  In addition, these contractors are periodically evaluated to ensure that they continue to work safely.\n\n- A preventive maintenance program is in place at the Le Sueur Facility.  This includes regular inspection of major powered equipment, including compressors, pumps, bearings, couplings, shaft seals, mountings, etc. for vibration or incipient mechanical failure, and regular inspection and calibration of liquid level sensors, temperature and pressure instruments, switches and shutdown devices that have safety implications.\n\n- Formal authorization systems (i.e., Management of Change Procedure, Pre-Startup Safety Review) are in place to ensure that system changes or expansions are as safe as the original design and in a condition to be safely operated prior to startup.\n\n- Events that might cause an accidental or unexpected release of ammonia are subjected to a formal investigation.
