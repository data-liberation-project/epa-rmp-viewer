The most recent review was performed on 04/18/2000.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits\nThe La Porte Site conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented.  The most recent compliance audit was conducted on 09/30/1997.  These audits are carried out at least every three years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\nIncident Investigation\nThe La Porte Site promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of five years.\n\nEmployee Participation\nThe La Porte Site truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.  Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.

This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of all chemicals including regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, our highly trained emergency response personnel are on hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.   We are also coordinated with Channel Industries Mutual Aid (CIMA) which provides additional emergency response expertise. \n\n\n2.\tThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur primary activities encompass The Dow Chemical Company facility in La Porte, Texas, which is in the chemical manufacturing business.  The basic products manufactured at the site include Methylene Diphenyldiisocyanate based (MDI based) polymeric isocyanates, polyol systems, related polyurethane elastomers and foams, and phosgene.  Chloroformate chemicals are produced at this facility also.  We have six regulated substances present at our facility, which are involved in several uses. These substances include Chlorine, Formaldehyde (solution), Ammonia (anhydrous), Methyl Chloroformate, Propyl Chloroformate, and Phosgene  [Carbonic dichloride].  Chlorine is used for phosgene production.  Formaldehyde (solution) is used for polymeric amine production.  Ammonia (anhydrous) is used for phosgene leak mitigation.  Phosgene  [Carbonic dichloride] is used for polymeric isocyanate production.  Methyl and propyl chlorofomates are sold as specialty chemical intermediates. \n\nThe maximum inventory of Chlorine at our facility is 181797.68 lb. while Form"

The maximum inventory of methyl and propyl chlorofomates are 200,000 lbs. each.\n\n3.\tThe Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\nTo evaluate the worst case scenarios, we have used the EPA's OCA Guidance Reference Tables or Equations.  For alternative release scenario analyses we have employed Phast version 5.1.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 3 toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from Polymeric MDI Production.  In this scenario 17346 lb. of liquid Phosgene  [Carbonic dichloride] is released.  The toxic liquid released is assumed to form a 1-cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to evaporate over 10 minutes.  The released quantity has been limited to 20 % of the maximum capacity of the source by a system of administrative controls.  At Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s windspeed, the maximum distance of >25 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.00081 mg/L.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for Chlorine involves a release from the Phosgene Production Plant of 19560 lb. of liquid Chlorine.  Toxic liquid is assumed to be released to form a 1-cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to have evaporated after 10 minutes.  The release is also assumed to be controlled by excess flow valve(s), firewater monitor(s), and emergency shutdown system(s).  These active mitigation systems have the effect of limiting the release to a 10-minute duration.

These active mitigation systems have the effect of stopping the release in ten minutes and suppressing the released vapors.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.00081 mg/L of Phosgene  [Carbonic dichloride] is 4.9 miles.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for Formaldehyde (solution) involves a release from Polymeric MDI Production.  The scenario involves the release of 11440 lb. of 50% Formaldehyde solution from a broken transfer hose.  Toxic liquid is assumed to be released to form a 1-cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to have evaporated after 10 minutes.
