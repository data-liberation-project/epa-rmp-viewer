This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as recommends accident prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\r\n\r\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the facility periodically updates and revalidates its process hazard analyses. These periodic reviews are conducted at least every five years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating. The results and recommendations from these updates are documented and retained.\r\n\r\n2.3.4  Operating Procedures\r\n\r\nThe facility maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process. These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators. Procedures are maintained current by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made to the process. In addition, the facility's operating procedures provide guidance on how to respond to events that result in exceeding safe operating limits for specific process or equipment parameters. The written operating procedures are readily available to operators and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\r\n\r\n2.3.5 Training \r\n\r\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the facility has implemented a training program for all employees involved in operating a process.

Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the facility has procedures in place to ensure that contractors perform their work in a safe manner, possess the appropriate knowledge and skills needed, are trained of the hazards in the workplace, and are aware of the procedures to take in the event of an emergency. This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, (4) safe work practices, and (5) a work permit process prior to their beginning work. In addition, Shintech evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor. Shintech management personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\r\n\r\n2.3.7 Pre-Startup Safety Reviews\r\n\r\nShintech personnel conduct a pre-startup safety review for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information (not required for replacement in kind). The purpose of the review is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and the equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service. This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready.

Furthermore, the basic aspects of Shintech's mechanical integrity program include (1) conducting training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting identified deficiencies, and (5) applying quality assurance measures. In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process equipment.\r\n\r\nShintech maintenance personnel receive training on (1) an overview of the process, (2) safety and health hazards, (3) applicable maintenance procedures, (4) emergency response plans, and (5) applicable safe work practices to help ensure that they can perform their job in a safe manner. Written procedures help ensure that work is performed in a consistent manner and provide a basis for training. Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended, and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits. If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service (if possible), or a management of change team will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment.\r\n\r\nAnother integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance.

A fundamental part of this commitment is the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances in and around the facility. Within the past five years, there has been one release of a regulated substance from a regulated process that has occurred that meets the criteria for RMP incident reporting. On April 13, 2016, a gas release occurred for a period of five minutes which resulted in one injury. \r\n\r\n2.5 Emergency Response Program\r\n      \r\nThe facility maintains a written Emergency Response Plan (ERP), which aims to protect employees, public health, and the environment. The purpose of the ERP is to minimize potential adverse impacts on the facility and surrounding areas in the event of an emergency situation. The plan consists of procedures for responding to such emergencies as fires, explosions, hazardous gas or liquid releases, natural disasters, and terrorist threats. The plan addresses all aspects of emergency response including coordination with mutual aid organizations, timely notification of authorities, maintenance of proper documentation, and guidelines for compliance with applicable government regulations. Furthermore, the facility has procedures that address proper use, maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment. Based on job description, employees receive safety and process control training to instruct them in proper emergency response procedures.

      "SummaryText": "1.0 APPLICABILITY \r\nThe Risk Management Program, required under Section 112 of the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments, was promulgated on June 20, 1996. The requirements, codified in 40 CFR 68, Subparts A-H, require any facility that has more than a threshold quantity of a regulated substance in a process to comply with the requirements of the Risk Management Program and submit a Risk Management Plan (RMP). \r\n\r\nRegulated flammable and toxic substances and their corresponding threshold quantities (TQ) (under 40 CFR 68, Subpart C and Tables 1 through 4 of 68.130) are identified for the purpose of determining applicability. The threshold determination for mixtures of flammable substances is in accordance with 40 CFR 68.115(b)(2). In cases where the listed substance is greater than one percent by weight of the mixture (for a flammable), the entire weight of the mixture is considered in the threshold determination, unless it can be demonstrated that the mixture itself does not have a National Fire Protection Associations (NFPA) flammable hazard rating of 4. Where toxic substances are found in greater than one percent by weight of a mixture, only the weight of the toxic substance is considered in threshold determination.

The facility is designed as a vertically integrated polyvinyl chloride (PVC) manufacturing facility that also produces intermediate products, including chlorine (and caustic soda as a byproduct), ethylene dichloride, vinyl chloride monomer, hydrochloric acid, and ethylene. This facility has been designed in a manner that minimizes the potential for accidental releases. Shintech is committed to operating this facility in a manner that is safe for the plant workers, the public, and the environment. Shintech has many years of experience and an excellent environmental and safety track record. Shintech strives to protect and promote the health and safety of its employees, its neighbors, and others who may be affected by activities at the facility, and to limit adverse effects on the physical environment in which its activities are carried out. Shintech has established systems to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility. One part of these systems is a risk management program that helps manage the risks at the facility and that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) rule 40 CFR part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule), and the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality (LDEQ) regulation (LAC 33:III.Chapter 59). One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit a risk management plan (RMP) describing the risk management program at the fa"

Pursuant to LAC 33:III.Chapter.59, the registration was submitted to the LDEQ within 60 days of the stationary source becoming subject to this regulation. Shintech registered with LDEQ in June 2008. If anything changes within the registration, it will be submitted to LDEQ within 60 days of the change. Likewise, Shintech will update its RMP at least once every five years or when changes at the facility require revisions to the RMP. \r\n\r\nThis document is intended to satisfy the RMP executive summary requirement of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program at the facility.\r\n\r\n2.1 Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n\r\nShintech is committed to minimizing potential risks to the general public, to the facility employees, and to the environment. A fundamental part of this commitment is the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances in and around the facility. The facility utilizes engineering controls, inspection programs, and detailed procedures to prevent accidental releases. In the event of a release, the facility has well-trained emergency response teams to contain, mitigate, monitor, and stop the release. The facility has fully staffed and trained emergency response teams for firefighting and emergency rescue. In addition to handling the release, the facility also participates in established communication systems to alert the community in the event of a significant release. Through the coordination with the local emergency planning commission (LEPC), the facility has the ability to provide emergency notification to the local community through cable override systems, radio broadcasts, and/or through an automated telephone notification system.\r\n\r\n2.1.1 Develop and Implement a Management System\r\n\r\nThe Shintech Environmental Manager is responsible for the development and implementation"

However, the specific responsibilities for certain aspects of that program will be delegated to other personnel who will report either directly or through other management personnel to the Environmental Manager. Similarly, responsibility for the RMP offsite consequence analysis and five-year accident history has been delegated to the Environmental Supervisor. The Safety/Security Supervisor is responsible for Emergency Response and Process Safety Information. Furthermore, it is the facility's policy that safe operation is part of everyone's job; therefore, many other site personnel will also be involved in RMP activities on an ongoing basis.\r\n\r\n2.2 Facility Regulated Substances\r\n\r\nSee Table 1 for list of regulated RMP substances that are above threshold in a process at the facility.\r\n\r\n2.3 Accidental Release Prevention Program\r\n\r\nBecause the facility is also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard, and because the OSHA PSM requirements are very similar to the EPA RMP requirements, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements. The PSM program at this facility has been extended by the facility, where necessary, to satisfy EPA's Program Level 3 accident prevention program requirements.\r\n\r\n2.3.1 Employee Participation\r\n\r\nAs employee participation is required by both PSM and RMP, Shintech encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention. Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the facility and addresses each accident prevention program element.\r\n\r\n2.3.2 Process Safety Information\r\n\r\nThe facility keeps a variety of technical documents used to help maintain safe operation of the processes. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process paramete"

Specific departments within the facility are assigned responsibility for maintaining and updating process safety information. \r\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in safety data sheets (SDSs). This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known concerns and hazards. In addition, the facility has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) in the operation manuals. Shintech ensures that the process is maintained within these limits by using process controls and monitoring instruments, operating procedures, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\r\nShintech also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment. This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, etc. This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\r\n\r\n2.3.3 Process Hazard Analysis\r\n\r\nThe facility has a comprehensive process hazard analysis (PHA) program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled. Within this program, the covered process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage those hazards.\r\n\r\nThe facility primarily uses the What If, HAZOP, and Fault Mode and Effects Analysis techniques to perform these evaluations. These analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating, mainten"
