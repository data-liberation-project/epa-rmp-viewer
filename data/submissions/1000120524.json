These programs enable our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of toxic substances as well as fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents.   Overall, these programs prevent accidental fatalities, injuries and illnesses and avoid physical property damage.  Our safety programs are applied to any activity involving hazardous chemicals including any use, storage, manufacturing, handling, or the on-site movement of such chemicals, or combination of these activities.  Any group of vessels which are interconnected and separate vessels which are located such that a hazardous chemical could be involved in a potential release shall be considered a single process.  \n\n\tOur safety programs prevent accidents because they focus on the rules, procedures, and practices which govern individual processes, activities, or pieces of equipment.  These rules are detailed and improved as necessary.  They are also communicated to and accepted by all employees at the facility.\n\n\tUniversal Pure South Plant is a cold storage plant located in Lincoln, NE.

In the case of an emergency, Matt Webb is the emergency response coordinator and has overall responsibility for the preparation and implementation of the emergency response plan. The alternate emergency response coordinator is Chris Neild Safety Manager.  Arrangements have been made to coordinate Universal Cold Storage's Emergency Action Plan and applicable emergency services with the following local agencies:\n\nLancaster County LEPC \n(402)-441-7441\n\nLancaster County Sheriff Department\n(402)-786-6500\n\nLincoln Fire Department\n(402)-786-3055\n\nUpon discovering an emergency situation, all employees shall immediately notify their supervisor or the Maintenance Department using the phone, vocally or wireless phones. The supervisor of the affected area should immediately contact the Emergency Response Coordinator to determine if evacuation of the plant is the safest course of action.  If the emergency involves the release of ammonia and a decision is made to evacuate the plant, the Emergency Response Coordinator will sound an evacuation alarm, then determine the assembly area.  The location of the assembly area will be based on the current wind direction and will be upwind of the release area and will be relayed to the Evacuation Coordinators.  If your immediate contact options cannot be reached, dial 911.  In the event of an evacuation, all employees should proceed to the designated assembly area and await further instructions from their evacuation supervisor. Facility map identifying exit doors, evacuation routes and assembly areas are posted at various locations throughout the facility.

The critical operations shutdown procedures to be followed by those employees who have been assigned for essential building operations include:\n\nPlant Engineer: Shutdown the ammonia refrigeration system by using one of the Emergency Stop (E-stop) switches located just inside of the engine room doors.\n\nIn response to an ammonia release, Universal South Pure will not respond to releases of hazardous chemicals in an offensive manner. The facility does not have any employees trained at the HAZMAT Technicians or First Responders Operations Level.  However, in the case of a minor ammonia release, designated maintenance personnel are allowed to isolate or maintain the release.\nUniversal Cold Storage has not had any accidental releases to report since the commissioning of the plant.\nThe total charge in the system is 18,522 lbs. In the event of a worst case scenario, we will assume the entire charge is released for ten minutes. The high pressure receiver is located outside of the engine room.
