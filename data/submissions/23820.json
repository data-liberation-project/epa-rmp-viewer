We are an agricultural based business that primarily buys and sells grain as well as other inputs necessary for crop production.\n\nOur NH3 plant consist of two-12,000 GALLON storage tanks,  with associated piping, valves and other miscellaneous equipment. The total capacity of the plant is 102,000 pounds when filled to 85% capacity. \n\n The worst case scenario for our Anhydrous Ammonia would be failure of one of the 12,000-gallon tanks,  resulting in a gas release over a 10 minute period.  According to our DEGADIS guide, the distance to endpoint is 1.63 miles with an approximate population of approx 10 area residents.  Public receptors include only residences.  The alternative release scenario would be a transfer hose rupture with a total of 11,908 pounds released to the air.  The distance to endpoint would be .83 miles affecting only a total of 6 people.  This facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule and all applicable state and local codes, are regulations.   The anhydrous ammonia system is designed, installed,and maintained in accordance with Kansas State Ag Department, which inspects our plant annually and we respond to all their request for improvement.\n\n We are pleased to report we have had no accidents in the past five years at this facility, and hope to maintain this good safety record, by constantly upgrading and reviewing our safety procedures and practices.  Our employees are trained annually in the safe use of the product, the hazards of NH3, proper plant maintenance practices as well as the recommended operatimg procedures.  The employees always wear the appropriate personal protective equipment (goggles and gloves) during nurse tank filling operations.  Clean safety water is always on hand during these operations. \n\nIn the event of an emergency involving  our anhydrous system, it is this company's policy"
