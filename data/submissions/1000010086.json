This process has proven to greatly reduce chlorine leaks by reducing the amount of equipment that is exposed to pressurized chlorine.\n\no\tThe chlorine storage area and hoist were also upgraded in 1985. \n\no\tA full vacuum system for chlorine delivery is under consideration. This upgrade would eliminate the remaining small section of the delivery system which is under pressure. \n\nThe department's Emergency Response Plan has been significantly upgraded. In 1995, the ERP was revised to include offsite response and communication. A&D Environmental Services was contracted to provide qualified hazardous materials emergency response services for the plant. Chlorine Response Drills are being routinely conducted.\n\nIn addition to Process Safety Management, the organization has an active safety program. For the past three years, Davidson Water, Inc., has had an active safety committee. The committee meets monthly.  The committee's duties include reviewing new safety procedures, accident investigations, safety surveys and safety communications.\n\nWithin the water plant organization, there are monthly safety meetings to review an OSHA subject or discuss a safety issue. Routine training is conducted for topics such as:\n\n- Hazard Communications\n\n- Personal Protective Equipment\n\n- Lockout/Tagout\n\n- Confined Space\n\nAs a result of our programs, the plant has had an excellent safety record with no lost time accidents over the past five years. We plan to continue our emphasis on safety to maintain and improve our safety performance.\n\nSubmitted by:\n\nRon Farnsworth\nWater Plant Superintendent"

It is located at 388 Koontz Road in Davidson County, North Carolina. The chlorine safety record at the Water Treatment plant site has been excellent. There have been no chlorine incidents or accidents in the past Five-Year history period.\n\nIn 1995, a Process Safety Management (PSM) program was initiated at the Plant. A PSM Implementation Manual was edited to be site specific for the Water Plant. The Manual was issued to the plant. In 1999 the Manual was expanded to address the EPA Risk Management Program (RMP).\n\nKey items included in the updated manual are:\n\no\tA written Management Program defining the positions and individuals responsible for implementing the RMP and PSM regulations\n\no\tWritten site specific procedures for Employee Involvement, Management of Change, Incident Investigation, Pre-Startup Reviews and Self Audits\n\no\tChlorine safety information as required by the regulations\n\no\tStandard Operating Procedures for safe Chlorine Management\n\no\tA Mechanical Integrity Program for chlorine equipment \n\no\tAn Emergency Response Plan to address chlorine emergencies and offsite response and communication\n\nNext, these steps have been continually implemented to maintain compliance with the PMP/PSM program.\n\no\tTraining on RMP/PSM and its key components including Management of Change, Mechanical Integrity and Incident Investigation;\n\no\tConducting periodically Process Hazards Analyses for the two chlorine processes;\n\no\tImplementing the Mechanical Integrity Program for chlorine regulators, controls and material handling equipments such as cranes\n\no\tConducting Self Audits to review compliance with the elements of RMP and PSM\n\no\tConducting Chlorine Response Drills.\n\no\tPerforming an annual review of our Chlorine Operating Procedures\n\nThe supervisor and plant operators meet several times per year to rev"
