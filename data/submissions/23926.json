      "SummaryText": "FACILITY DESCRIPTION\n\nPolypro Inc. has been in business for approximately 10 years and produces guar gum products for the carpet, oil, and other industries. Polypro recently installed a new process to produce hydroxy propyl guar. This new process will involve the use of propylene oxide which is both toxic and flammable.\n\nPolypro Inc. has worked very close with Huntsman Chemical, the Georgia Environn1ental Protection Division, the Dalton Fire Department and Midsouth metal to insure that the system was installed properly and meets and complies with all local, state and federal safety and environmental regulations. The new process consist of a tanker unloading system7 storage tank, day tank and a reactor. The storage tank has a storage capacity of 10,000 gallons, however, inventory controls and safety procedures allow no more than 7,000 gallons of propylene oxide to be stored at any time.\n\nPROCESS SAFETY DEVICES\n\nThe following devices are used throughout the system to ensure a safe operation and quick response if an incident should occur:\n\nSTORAGE TANK AND TANKER UNLOADING AREA\n\n* Concrete dikes and berms around both the tanker unloading station and the storage tank to contain any accidental spills.\n\n* The storage tank area is equipped with a foam system for vapor suppression And fire protection should an accidental spill occur.\n\n* Both the storage tank and tanker unloading headers are equipped with dry disconnect valves to prevent spillage.\n\n* The Pump transfer system is equipped with an emergency shut off to ensure Quick shut down should a problem arise during the transfer from the tank truck to the storage tank.\n\n* A nitrogen blanket of 5-10 PSI will be maintained at all times on storage tank.\n\n* Nitrogen will be used to purge all lines after unloading.\nREACTOR AND REACTOR AREA\n\n* The reactor will be pressurized (low pressure) and inspected for leaks On each and every Monday.\n\n* The Reactor is equipped with both high pressure and high temperature Process control ala"

      "SummaryText": "rms.\n\n* The reactor area is isolated form all other production processes. All electrical Equipment located within the reactor area is rated for hazardous locations (Explosion proof) This eliminates any possible ignition source should an accidental spill or vapor release occur.\n\n* The reactor is also equipped with a computer system which will allow reactor activities to be monitored form any computer screen in the plant. Example: Engineers office, plant managers office and General managers off.\n\n* The reactor area is also equipped with several explosion proof exhaust fans which Would ventilate the reactor and prevent the build of flammable vapors should an accidental spill occur.\n\nEMPLOYEE SAFETY TRAINING\n\n* Employees have participated in all aspects of the development and installation Of the HPG reaction system.\n\n* All employees are trained in the proper safety and handling procedures of the Propylene Oxide.\n\n* All employees involved in the use of propylene oxide have received training which includes:\n\n1. Classroom training and discussion.\n\n2. Written exam and testing.\n\n3. On the job training.\n\n* All employees have been trained in emergency response and evacuation Procedures should an incident occur.\n\nRISK ASSESSMENT AND WORST CASE SCENARIO\n\nPolypro Inc. has invested a lot of time and money to ensure that the propylene oxide system was installed properly and complied with all local, state and federal regulations. However, Polypro realizes that accidents can occur even with the best of equipment and procedures, Therefore, Polypro has performed a worst case scenario to determine what could possibly happen and who may be effected should an incident occur. Polypro used the loss of the entire contents of the propylene oxide storage tank ( 7,000 gallons ) as a worst case scenario. It was determined that an area of approximately 1.2 miles may be affected if such an incident should occur.\n\nHowever, Polypro has installed a safety system to greatly reduce the area affected if"

      "SummaryText": " tan incident occurs. As mentioned earlier in the executive summary the safety system around the propylene oxide storage tank consist of a concrete dike around the tank which would contain any spill and a foam system which would apply a layer of foam to cover the spilled propylene oxide. This layer of foam would greatly reduce the amount of vapors leaving the spill area, therefore limiting the exposure to the immediate storage tank area.\n\nPolypro takes great pride in its company, and wishes to maintain a facility that is safe for its employees, the community and the environment. Polypro will continue to work with all local, state and federal regulatory agencies to ensure that they comply with all safety and environmental regulations."
