      "SummaryText": "General Information\n\nThe Lima Water Treatment Plant (WTP) is a municipally owned and operated water purification facility that uses chlorine for water disinfection.  The existing chlorination system utilizes gaseous chlorine and consists of eight (8) 1 ton cylinder containers, four (4) digital scales, vacuum regulators on each cylinder, an automatic changeover valve, three (3) 500 lbs./day and two (2) 1000 lbs./day chlorinators, and a distribution manifold.  The average chlorine usage is 560 lbs./day.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nTraining and chemical awareness are key factors in the department's Emergency Response Plan (ERP).  All operators receive annual refresher training on best safe work practices with regard to chlorine use and feed processes.  Training is handled by chlorine vendors every three (3) years, per the RMP requirements.  Knowledge and comprehension of chlorine handling practices, storage, usage, and spill prevention are reviewed annually in house.\n\nChlorine containment and feed operations are secure within the facility and only accessible to authorized plant personnel.  The ERP prepared in March, 2006, was reviewed and updated with the operations and management groups in the fall of 2010.\n\nWorst Case Scenario\n\nChlorine is received and unloaded in 1 ton cylinders.  The chemical unloading procedures are carefully designed and reviewed annually.  Due to the fact that a release can occur during the unloading process, no passive mitigation is used.  In the event of a full cylinder release, the endpoint distance is approximately 1.3 miles within a 10 minute time span.\n\nAlternate Release Scenario\n\nIn the event of a leak from a 1 ton cylinder already put in service, housed within the chlorination room of the administrative building, passive mitigation is applicable.  The endpoint distance is approximately .1 miles, with release duration of approximately 60 minutes.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Speci"

      "SummaryText": "fic Prevention Steps\n\nLima WTP is in compliance with OSHA regulations with respect to the Accidental Release Prevention Program.  The chemical specific prevention steps are compliant with all Ohio EPA requirements, Recommended Standards for Water Works, 1997 - Ten States Standards, Chlorine Institute Standards, and Regulations Concerning Chlorination Equipment and Facilities for Public Water Supplies.\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\t\nThe Lima WTP has had no accidental releases of chlorine in the past 5 years.  There have been no accidental chlorine releases in the known history of the plant that have resulted in injury to off-site personnel or public evacuations.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nA written copy of the ERP is located at the WTP, as well as in the administrative offices at City Hall.  The plan includes first aid procedures, medical management of chlorine exposure information, emergency response training, pre-emergency coordination guidelines, a summary of emergency chlorine release response procedures, and a quick reference guide allowing an operator to respond immediately and accurately in the event of an observed or detected chlorine release.  The Allen County Local Emergency Planning Committee is the overall coordinator of emergency response services, although the WTP is diligent in contacting the Lima Fire Department as part of their current program.  Lima Fire Department performed a walk through of the WTP in 2010 and jointly reviewed training requirements for both parties, established equipment and personal protective equipment (PPE) uniformity, and reviewed annual refresher guidelines.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThe Lima WTP is committed to reviewing and following the guidelines presented in the ERP.  All training and management programs will be reviewed annually and updated as necessary.  The City will support the implementation of these programs as a part of the Risk Management Program."
