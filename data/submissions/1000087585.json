Our safety strategy revolves around our Do It Right value and permeates our business in three key ways:\r\n\u00bf\tRobust systems that provide a clear, repeatable direction toward excellence.\r\n\u00bf\tSuperior performance that aligns effective and efficient EHS activities with operations.\r\n\u00bf\tEngaged culture that empowers consistent behaviors that drive toward excellence.\r\nCF Industries works closely with emergency responders and other local officials to develop detailed emergency response plans that extend beyond our physical operating locations.\r\n\r\nCF WOODWARD PLANT AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\r\nThe CF Woodward Plant (Woodward, Oklahoma) manufactures anhydrous ammonia, urea solutions, urea ammonium nitrate solution and by-product gaseous carbon dioxide. Intermediates in the manufacture of the products include nitric acid, and ammonium nitrate solution. The regulated substance, as defined by 40 CFR Part 68, which is present at the facility in more than a threshold quantity is ammonia.\r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\r\nThe Woodward Plant has taken all the necessary steps to comply with all of the accidental release and chemical-specific prevention requirements as set forth in U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) 40 CFR Part 68. This facility is also subject to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard 29 CFR 1910.119. The following summarizes the elements of the release and chemical-specific prevention that are in place at our facility:\r\n\u00bf\tProcess safety information that is accurate and up to date;\r\n\u00bf\tWell-trained operating, maintenance, and contract personnel;\r\n\u00bf\tWritten operating procedures;\r\n\u00bf\tMechanical integrity procedures for process equipment inspections and quality control;\r\n\u00bf\tManagement of change and pre-startup safety review proc"

Emergency Response of the RMP is based on such designation. Notwithstanding, the Woodward Facility has an extensive emergency response program with a written Emergency Response Plan (ERP). The ERP is designed as a guide to help in determining the magnitude of an incident, the steps needed to bring the incident under control and the requirements to ensure that all federal, state, and local laws are complied with. The ERP is a definitive plan that assigns responsibilities, defines several different methods of communication, designates evacuation procedures, and coordinates with outside assistance. The plan also designates the type and frequency of training that employees are required to have depending on their responsibilities. Furthermore, the plan commits the company's management team to devote the necessary resources to prepare, implement and audit the ERP.\r\n\r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\nRigorous training, drills, audits, cooperation with emergency"
