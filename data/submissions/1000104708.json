This commitment is demonstrated in the resources invested in safety throughout facility design, construction, operation and maintenance. MCS has developed detailed programs and procedures to effectively implement this commitment. The programs and procedures systematically integrate safety, health, environmental protection and quality assurance into all levels of management and work practices. \n\n2.0          Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nMCS operates a Depleted Uranium Hexafluoride (DUF6) Conversion Facility for the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) at Kevil, Kentucky to disposition DUF6 into a safer, more manageable product. The facility employs a dry conversion process that converts DUF6 to uranium oxide powder that is collected and packaged for reuse or disposal. The process also utilizes steam and hydrogen as reaction gases, which produce hydrofluoric acid (HF) as a saleable end product.  \n\nThe maximum HF acid concentration produced is approximately 55 wt% HF acid solution, per the MCS Safety Data Sheet (SDS).  However, the typical concentration is less than 50%.  A total maximum quantity of 460,000 pounds of HF acid is temporarily stored on-site in several tanks before transfer to tanker trucks or rail cars for offsite shipment. This amount exceeds the threshold quantity specified in 40 CFR 68, Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions.  Further evaluation indicates that the Conversion Facility is subject to Program 1 requirements of 40 CFR 68. HF acid is the only chemical associated with the DUF6 Conversion Facility that exceeds the threshold quantities specified in 40 CFR 68.\n\n3.0          General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\nM"

MCS has implemented the required controls through an extensive set of programs and procedures. These programs and procedures also apply to the management of structures, systems, components and programs that pertain to Risk Management Plan (RMP) covered process and related activities.\n\nAs part of the DSAs, process safety analyses have been conducted to identify potential hazards in the process and associated controls to prevent and mitigate releases. These controls include passive barriers, active features, and operator actions.\n\nThe primary controls associated with the storage of HF acid are the HF storage tanks. These tanks are designed to contain the HF acid under conditions such as credible natural phenomena events. A dike around each tank provides secondary containment for potential tank leaks. HF vapor detectors and tank level sensors provide indications should a leak occur, and automatically actuate valves to isolate the HF storage tanks. Operators are required to monitor transfers from the HF storage tanks to the rail cars or tanker trucks and manually stop the transfer should a leak occur. Installed pumps and piping can be used to pump any leaked material back into the HF storage tanks for sampling and reprocessing.\n\nIn addition to the aforementioned controls, MCS also has programs to ensure safe and effective operations. These programs include but are not limited to the following: Radioactive and Hazardous Waste Management; Industrial Safety, Initial Testing, In-Service Surveillance and Maintenance; Fire Protection; Procedures and Training; Emergency Management; Configuration Management; Conduct of Operations; Unreviewed Safety Question; and Quality Assurance.\n\nOperating and maintenance procedures have been established and operators have been trained on rou"

MCS is responsible for overall compliance of the DUF6 program with applicable regulations and implementation of the site-wide Emergency Management (EM) plan and the D&R Contractor's implementing procedures. MCS provides input and approval of the site Emergency Plan (EP) and other programmatic documents and flows down the applicable requirements of the site-wide Emergency Plan and implementing procedures into the MCS programs and procedures. \n\nThis program has been established to manage and respond to accidents or other emergency situations that may occur at the site in a consistent and integrated way.  The structure of this program is intended to ensure that the consequences of emergencies are promptly mitigated and that the health and safety of the public, personnel on the surrounding DOE reservation, plant personnel, and environment are protected, regardless of the cause or nature of the emergency.  The site EM organization is responsible for maintaining and updating the EP as appropriate.\n\nThe EP describes the emergency response structure and roles and responsibilities prior to, during, and after an emergency.  The plan describes the actions during an emergency which include the following: declaration of an emergency, activation of the Emergency Operation Center (EOC), emergency response, reentry, and event termination.

Emergencies are classified through a site-wide standardized system that uses Emergency Action Levels (EALs) as criteria for equating an incident to a specific emergency classification level.  Using the specific criteria outlined in the EALs, the D&R Contractor Incident Commander (IC) determines the level of response and protective actions required and determines if the event meets the proper criteria to classify the event as an Alert, Site Area Emergency (SAE) or General Emergency (GE). Upon determination of event classification, the IC directs notifications to off-site agencies and activates the EOC Cadre.  \n\nEmergency response facilities have been pre-designated and equipped for use in an emergency. The Plant Control Facility is continuously staffed and serves as the sites emergency call center. Dedicated facilities, such as the EOC, are immediately available to support emergency operations upon arrival of staff.  \n\nPrompt notification of on-site personnel, emergency responders, and off-site organizations and agencies is critical during an emergency event. The D&R Contractor IC is responsible for notifying the ERO using the plant radio system, pagers, Public Address (PA) system, computer software and/or the plant telephone system.\n\nThe severity of some emergencies on site may warrant the use of off-site response personnel, organizations, and agencies. As a result, agreements with off-site support agencies have been developed and are maintained by D&R Contractor.  Offsite services may include medical assistance, fire control, evacuation facilities, law enforcement, and ambulance services. \n\nDuring emergencies, the D&R Contractor IC, designee, or Crisis Manager (CM) must determine the best initial protective actions to limit exposure of on-site and off-site personnel to potential or actual threats.
