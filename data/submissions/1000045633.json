This commitment is reflected in a comprehensive accidental release prevention program. This program addresses the design, installation, operation, maintenance, and employee training associated with the process equipment at the facility. \n\n\n\nLineage Logistics senior management is not only committed to offering superior service, but also to maintaining a safety and environmental program to promote a safe environment for all its employees and the surrounding communities. Lineage Logistics' safety and environmental policies as they relate to the ammonia refrigeration systems are administered by the Director of Engineering/Designee, who conducts inspections of the facility to ensure compliance.   The facility coordinates the emergency evacuation drill with the Oxnard Fire Department on an annual basis. \n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\n\n\nThe Lineage Logistics facility is located at 908 E 3rd Street in Oxnard, California, which is approximately ? mile east of the Pacific Coast Highway (California State Route 1) and 2 miles south of US Route 101. The area immediately surrounding the facility is urban.  The area immediately surrounding the facility is mostly commercial, industrial, and residential areas.\n\n\n\nThe primary business of the Lineage Logistics facility is to provide refrigerated warehousing and storage for various food products.  In order to conduct operations, the facility maintains four interconnected refrigeration systems which operate independently, and contain approximately 49,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia, a regulated substance.  The refrigeration systems, consisting of piping, valves, and equipment, cycles ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, and then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refriger"

Typical operating conditions range from approximately 2 psig on the low-pressure side of the system (with the exception of System 1, which runs at 8\" Hg on the low side) to 115 psig on the high side.  \n\n\n\nThe systems were constructed in accordance with all applicable federal, state, and local regulations in place at the time of construction, including the NFPA-58 Standard, 1967 Edition.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nIn order to operate the ammonia refrigeration systems, the facility complies with the following risk management regulations:\n\n\n\n?    OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM);\n\n?    EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP); and\n\n?    California Accidental Release Prevention Program (CalARP).  \n\n\n\nAdministrative Measures:\n\nThe facility operates in accordance with the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) guidelines and standards including the following:\n\n\n\n?    IIAR Bulletin 107, \"Suggested Safety and Operating Procedures When Making Ammonia Refrigeration Tie ins\"\n\n?    IIAR Bulletin 109, \"Minimum Safety Criteria for a Safe Ammonia Refrigeration System\" \n\n?    IIAR Bulletin 110, \"Startup, Inspection, and Maintenance of Ammonia Refrigeration Systems\"\n\n?    IIAR, \"A Guide to Good Practices for the Operation of an Ammonia Refrigeration System\"\n\n\n\nThe Lineage Logistics ammonia refrigeration systems have many safety features.  Much of the safety of the systems is inherent in the policies and procedures that govern the operation of the system.  For example, the Lineage Logistics facility operates in accordance with the Process Safety Management (PSM), Risk Management Program (RMP), and California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program.  It is important to note that the refrigeration systems have been designed with several safety features to prevent the accidental release of ammonia.  For example, the compressors are equipped with safety mechanisms that will cause the units to shut down if operating condi"

Also, level indicators, alarms, and switches are installed in key points within the system to monitor the supply of liquid ammonia and to ensure that a vessel is not overfilled.\n\n\n\nEngineering Measures:\n\nOther safety features of the ammonia refrigeration systems include: emergency break-glass shutdown switches that kill power to the engine room equipment and contact the offsite alarm company (located outside each of the Engine Room doors); ammonia detectors in the engine rooms, cold rooms, vessel rooms, and vent lines; relief valves on all pressure vessels, ventilation fans in the Vessel Room, Engine Rooms 2, 3 and 4.  Detectors are monitored by a PLC, which notifies operators when triggered.  In addition, the Chief Engineer and operators live within 10 minutes of the facility.  Operators also have remote capabilities in place.   \n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nThe EPA's RMP regulation defines \"accident\" as the following:\n\n\n\n\"The release must be from a covered process and involve a regulated substance held above its threshold quantity in the process.\n\n\n\nThe release must have caused at least one of the following:\n\n\n\n?    On-site deaths, injuries, or significant property damage (?68.42(a)); or\n\n?    Known offsite deaths, injuries, property damage, environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place (?68.42(a)).\"\n\n\n\nBased on the above definition, there have been no significant releases of ammonia that exceeded the Federal Reportable Quantity of 100 pounds in the last five years (June 2009 through June 2014). In addition, there have been no injuries or property damage resulting from an ammonia release nor any releases or \"near misses\" that warranted an internal incident investigation.  Although there have been odor investigations, including a valve packing leak approximately 12 months ago, there have been no injuries resulting from an ammonia release, nor any releases that warranted an internal incident investigation.\n\n\n\nEMERGEN"

This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:  \n\n\n\n?       save lives;\n\n?       minimize and avoid injuries;\n\n?       protect the environment; and\n\n?       minimize property damage.\n\n\n\nSince facility personnel will not respond to an ammonia release at the facility that poses a health or safety threat, the Plan provides the notification procedures and evacuation routes for emergencies that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year to ensure compliance with the PSM, RMP, and CalARP regulations.  Facility personnel receive annual training regarding the emergency procedures.  The facility coordinates the emergency evacuation with the local Oxnard Fire Department on an annual basis.\n\n  \n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nThe Process Hazard Analysis Revalidation, conducted on December 17-19, 2013, included a HAZOP study, checklists, and a facility inspection to satisfy the five year update requirements.  \n\n\n\nThe Process Hazard Analysis Revalidation generated mitigation measures (recommendations to improve safety at the Lineage Logistics facility located in Oxnard, California.  The Lineage Logistics safety committee is planning to complete several items, including the recommendations, over the next year, as a continual effort to provide a safe work environment for their employees.  These changes include the following items:\n\n\n\n1.    Continue to train all employees in the facility Safety Plan/Programs.\n\n\n\n2.    Continue to have employee involvement in Safety Plan Development.\n\n\n\n3.    Continue employee involvement through safety team participation.\n\n\n\n4.    Continue internal and external safety audits/inspections and implement changes as needed.\n\n"
