THE FACILITY POLICY\n\n     The owners, amangement and employees of Farmers Coop Assn. are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire company or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2.  FACILITY INFORMATION\n\n     -The primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for the sale to farmers.\n\n     -Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for both direct application for crop production nutrients.\n\n     -The maximun quantity of anhydrous ammonia stored would be 220000 pounds in our 1 25000 gallon storage tank and nurse tanks.\n\n3.  THE WORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO AND THE ALTERNATE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\n     a. The worst case scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank as a gas over 9.5 minutes for anhydrous ammonia. The maximum quantity released would be 110000 pounds which represents the volume of the tank at 85% capacity as limited by design standards. The distance to the endpoint dispersion to 200ppm is 1.06 miles.\n\n     b. The alternate release scenario for ammonia is a 2 minute release from a 3 inch pipe break resulting in a distance of .78 miles.\n\n4.  THE ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n     The facility has implemented the provisions of safety requirements for the storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia, K-61.1, published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc., and the Standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration-OSHA-,29CRF 1910.111 Storage and handling of Anhydrous Ammonia. In addition, the Minnesota Department of Agriculture Ammonia Rules.\n\n5.  THE FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n     There have been n"

A written Emergency Action Pla, in accordance with OSHA Standard 29CRF 1910.36;\n\n     b. Provided State and Local authorities the Emergency Planning and Community Right-To-Know information as required under SARA Title lll-EPCRA.\n\n     c. Coordinated with Local Emergency Responders.\n\n7.  PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n     Safety is an on-going process at the facility. Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions. There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
