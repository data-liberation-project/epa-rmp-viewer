This document has been\nprepared to satisfy multiple regulations and is governed by the following agencies:\n1. OSHA's Code of Regulations, OSHA 29 CFR 1910.119, Process Safety Management of Highly\nHazardous Chemicals (PSM)\n2. Federal EPA's, Code of Federal Regulations, Title 40, Part 68, Accidental Release Prevention\nRequirements: Risk Management Programs Under Clean Air Act Section 112(r), Program 3\nRequirements (RMP)\nThe purpose of this document is to:\n1. Increase the protection of public health, the environment, and facility employees by ensuring\nproper emergency response and mitigation procedures when handling regulated substances.\n2. Assist Merchants Terminal and local government agencies in their communication and\ncoordination efforts to improve facility safety while handling regulated substances.\nThis document addresses Lineage's administrative and operational programs to prevent\naccidents related to regulated substances and to reduce potential risks. The regulated substance of\nconcern and focus of this document is anhydrous ammonia. Ammonia is used to provide refrigeration\nfor warehouse cold storage and dock operations.\nThis Executive Summary contains tables outlining the PSM/RMP sections. It includes the purpose,\nfrequency of use, responsibilities and requirements, and forms for each section of the PSM/RMP\nprogram.\n\nFACILITY DESCRIPTION\nLineage operates a refrigeration system utilizing anhydrous ammonia as the primary\nrefrigerant. The refrigeration system is located in the main building.\nMechanical refrigeration is a thermodynamic process where the refrigerant, ammonia, is used as a heat\nexchanging fluid to maintain a desired"

Evaporation and condensation are\ndesigned to alter the quantity of energy associated with refrigerant. Compression and expansion are\ndesigned to change the availability of the associated energy. The refrigeration cycle is a closed-loop\nprocess. The ammonia refrigeration cycle utilizes fluid temperature, pressure, and latent heat of\nvaporization for cooling. The refrigeration system utilizes these phenomenons to remove heat from a\ndesired area, and then to discard that heat, through condensation, to an area where it is of no\nconsequence.\nLineage facility utilizes ammonia refrigeration to cool various storage areas. The\nrefrigeration system contains the following equipment: nine screw compressors, three evaporative\ncondensers, one -43\u00b0F recirculator with pumps, one -25\u00b0F recirculator with pumps, one high pressure\nreceiver, one thermosyphon receiver, six blast cells evaporators, four minus -20\u00b0F penthouse evaporators,\neighteen -10\u00b0F penthouse evaporators, two cooler penthouse evaporators, and eight dock evaporators.\n\nEMPLOYEE PARTICIPATION\nEvery section of the RMP/PSM program must allow for employee participation in its development and\nimplementation. The plan allowing for this participation must be documented. Employees and their\nrepresentatives must have access to all information that is developed, for the Process Safety\nManagement program without regard to possible trade secret status of such information.\nFrequency of Use Responsible Party Requirements\nAll employees especially those new to the facility or transferred from another department\n\nDirector of Engineering or Designee\nNotifying all employees of the use of ammonia at the facility. \nProvide information and hazards related to ammonia to employees.\nAnnually\n\nDirector of Engineering or Designee\nInformation on the most likely accident scenarios and consequences of ammonia releases.\nRe"

The information to be compiled about the chemicals needs to be\ncomprehensive enough for an accurate assessment of the fire and explosion characteristics, reactivity\nhazards, the health and safety hazards to workers, and the corrosion effects on process equipment as well\nas monitoring and safety related equipment. MSDS information can provide a portion of the required\ndata but other information will be required.\nProcess technology information is also required. This includes information on the amount of hazardous\nmaterial stored and used at the facility as well as operating limits for the process. Diagrams of the\nsystem and information on all of the equipment utilized in the system are required. Piping and\ninstrumentation diagrams (P&IDs) are required in the Process Hazard Analysis and are included in the\nProcess Safety Information.\n\nFrequency of Use Responsible Party Requirements\nUpdate if a change is made and train operators at least every three years\nDirector of Engineering or Designee\nMake available to all employees who work on or near the equipment of the ammonia process.\nRelated Form: NOT APPLICABLE\n\nPROCESS HAZARD ANALYSIS\nThe Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) is the basis for many of the decisions and procedures associated\nwith an effective PSM/RMP program. It is a systematic effort to determine the potential hazards\nassociated with the process and to evaluate mitigation alternatives including equipment modifications,\nprocedural modifications, training, and administrative controls.
