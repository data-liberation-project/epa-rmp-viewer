There were no covered process releases that resulted in an EPA RMP recordable accident. \n\n\nEmergency Response Programs\n\nLinde has an emergency response program in place to minimize the effects of accidental release of regulated substances on employees, the public, and the environment.  Linde employees will respond to minor incidents.\n\nFor other than minor incidents Linde has in place an emergency response plan in coordination with  the Marmet Volunteer Fire Department and the Chesapeake Fire Department. The Marmet Fire Department is the primary responder and Chesapeake is the alternate responder. Emergency response is also coordinated with the Kanawha/Putnam Co. LEPC.\n\nIn the event of an emergency, the facility has an emergency action plan in place, which contains procedures for employees to follow, including notification of local response agencies.\n\nAll facility employees are trained in their role in the emergency plan and emergency drills are conducted at least annually.\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nLinde has a commitment to safety that is expressed in a company-wide goal of Zero/Zero, which means zero accidents and zero injuries or illnesses at each and every location. We look to constantly improve the safety of our processes using recommendations developed through the prevention program and a program soliciting safety suggestions from our employees."

Following is a description of some of these safety features.\n- Ammonia sparger system to prevent releases of ammonia to the atmosphere from process relief devices\n- Ammonia monitoring system designed to shut down the process in the event of an uncontrolled release.\n- Automatic isolation of critical ammonia processes to minimize releases to the atmosphere if an uncontrolled release occurs.\n- Advanced"

      "SummaryText": "Facility Description\n\nThe Linde facility at Marmet, West Virginia is a carbon dioxide purification plant.  We receive carbon dioxide gas as a byproduct from a nearby natural gas well source.  Normally, this carbon dioxide gas is vented to the atmosphere, but it is collected and transferred to our facility via pipeline.  Linde purifies and liquefies the carbon dioxide using a simple process of drying and distillation.  The final liquid carbon dioxide product is stored in our insulated storage tanks, and is shipped by truck and railcar to customers throughout the east.\n\n\nRegulated Substances\n\nThis facility uses, manufactures, or stores a chemical listed in part 68 of Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations, beyond a threshold quantity, as established by the EPA; Anhydrous Ammonia\nAs part of the carbon dioxide production process, the Marmet facility uses a standard ammonia refrigeration process to purify and liquefy the carbon dioxide.  Similar to the freon used in a home refrigerator, the ammonia is neither produced nor consumed in the process, but is repeatedly compressed, cooled and expanded in order to produce the cold temperatures necessary to cool and condense the carbon dioxide gas.  \n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Policy\n\nLinde is dedicated to being the best performing industrial gas company in all aspects of our business, including safety, health, and environmental affairs. Our safety, health, and environmental policy call for a commitment to protecting the health and safety of our employees, contractors, customers, and communities where we operate. This policy is the basis for engineering and construction programs that produce equipment and process systems that minimize the possibility of accidental chemical releases and operational safety programs that help ensure safe operation of our facilities. Linde is committed to the continuous improvement of these programs.\n\nLinde is an active member of the American Chemistry Council ACC) and endorses ACC's progr"
