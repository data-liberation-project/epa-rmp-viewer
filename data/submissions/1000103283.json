This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, our trained refrigeration personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release from a safe distance. We are coordinated with the Hanover Fire Department which provides emergency response.\n\nThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nOur facility's primary activities revolve around fruit and vegetable processing. Anhydrous ammonia is the only regulated substance present at our facility.
