Given the quantity handled, anhydrous ammonia is considered a hazardous substance by EPA. Many of the properties that make ammonia valuable as a refrigerant also require that precautions and procedures be in place to protect employee and public health and safety during a chemical emergency. It is the policy of Atlas to be in compliance with all applicable federal and state rules and regulations.\n\n\n\nWe have a written Process Safety Management (PSM) plan in accordance with 29 CFR 1919.119. A crucial component of this plan is the Emergency Response Plan, developed in compliance with the Emergency Response provisions of 29 CFR 1910.120. The Emergency Response Plan includes pre-emergency planning and coordinating with outside parties. This enables those who deal with emergencies to have a course of action to effectively deal with unplanned events.\n\n\n\n1.20 Facility Description And Substances Handled\n\n\n\n- Atlas stores and distributes refrigerated and non-refrigerated foods. Storage requires the use of a refrigeration system to preserve the product integrity. This refrigeration process uses ammonia as a refrigerant. Access to the facility is restricted to authorized employees, management personnel, and contractors.\n\n- The regulated substance handled at this facility is anhydrous ammonia.\n\n\n\n1.30 The worst-case release scenario(s) and the alternative release scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario. \n\n\n\nRelease scenarios were modeled using RMP*Comp (Version 2.01), a software program developed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and EPA.  Offsite receptors were defined using ESRI ArcMap 10.1 in"

In addition, it lists whether certain types of public receptors and environmental receptors are within the circles.\n\n\n\n1.40 General Accidental Release Prevention Program And Chemical-specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nAtlas complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations. The design and construction of this facility was in accordance with published standards, tests or recommended methods of trade, industry or governmental organizations.\n\n\n\nAtlas' written PSM plan incorporates many policies and procedures to ensure safe operation and maintenance of this facility. Plan elements essential to safe operation of the refrigeration system include employee participation, process hazard information, process hazard analysis, operating procedures, training, contractor safety, pre-startup safety review, mechanical integrity, management of change, hot-work permits, incident investigation, emergency response and planning, and compliance audits. This plan will be reviewed periodically and updated as necessary by the Safety Coordinator in conjunction with the refrigeration department.\n\n\n\n1.50 Five-Year Accident History\n\n\n\nThere has been no significant release of ammonia at Atlas in the past five years.\n\n\n\n1.60 Emergency Response Program\n\n\n\nAtlas has a written Emergency Response Plan developed to ensure that precautions and procedures are in place to protect employee and public health and safety during a chemical emergency. It complies with the provisions of OSHA emergency Response regulations, 29 CFR 1910.120. The Emergency Response Plan includes pre-emergency planning and coordinating with outside parties.

      "SummaryText": "eson Fire Department.\n\n\n\nThe approach in the development of this plan has been to identify the ammonia emergencies most likely to occur at Atlas and establish precautions and procedures to protect life, safety and health during an emergency. The refrigeration process has back-up prevention systems to keep processing malfunctions from becoming ammonia release emergencies.\n\n\n\nThe role and procedures for obtaining external emergency assistance will be formally established with the Tolleson Fire Department, including the Maricopa County HazMat Team. The Emergency Response Plan also includes procedures for notification of any potentially affected neighbors.\n\n\n\nAll Atlas personnel will be trained to fulfill their designated responsibilities in an emergency. Mock emergency drills will be held periodically to maintain familiarity with response actions and identify plan elements requiring improvement.\n\n\n\nThis plan will be reviewed annually and updated as necessary by the Atlas Lead Refrigeration Technician.\n\n\n\n1.70 Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nAny upgrades or extensive maintenance work performed in the future will be in compliance with those standards applicable at that time.\n\n\n\nAtlas identified recommendations to improve safety during the most recent compliance audit in February, 2011. These recommendations are scheduled to be completed by June, 2013."
