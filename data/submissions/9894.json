Box 318\n2786 Co Rd 9 999 West First Street South\nCottonwood, MN 56229\n\nFor further information contact Roger Breyfogle, Plant Manager\n\nRisk Management Plan - EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n1. The Facility Policy\n\n     The owners, management, and employees Cottonwood Coop Oil Company (the facility) are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia and propane. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire company, or other authorities, to mitigale any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the enviroment.\n\n2. Facility Information\n\n     The primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers fo sale to farmers, and propane sales and delivery.\n\n     Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application. Anhydrous ammonia is used for crop production nutrients. Propane gas is received, stored, and distributed for delivery for home heating, farm and commerical business uses.\n\n     The maximum quanity of ammonia stored would be 500,000 pounds with our 26,000 and 18,000 gallon storage tanks.  The maximum quanity handled would be the unloading of a tank truck holding 40,000 pounds.\n\n     The maximum quanity of propane gas stored would be 220,000 pounds with our two 30,000 gallon storage tanks.  The maximum quantiy handled would be the unloading of a tank truck holding 40,000 pounds.\n\n3. The worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario.\n\na.  The worst-case release scenario for anhydrous ammonia would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released as a gas over ten minutes. The maximum quantity released would be 120,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance the the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 1.09 miles.\n\n     The worst case release scenario for propane would be the failure o"

According to EPA lookup tables, the distance to the endpoint is .43 miles.\n\nb. The alternative release scenario for anhydrous ammonia based on the hazard review is a 2 minute release from a break in a 3 inch pipe. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is .78 miles.\n\n     The alternative release scenario for propane would be the faliure of one 30,000 gallon storage tank when filled to 85 percent (150,000 pounds) resulting in two-thirds of a vapor cloud explosion.  (factor .67x.43)=.29 miles.\n\n4.  The accidental release prevention program.\n\n     The facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc. and the Standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia\".  In addition, Minnesota Dept. Ag Rules. For propane, NFPA-58 rules.\n\n5.  The Five-year Accident Histiory.\n\n  a. There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia or propane in the past five years that:\n      have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage.\n\n6.  The emergency response program.\n\n     The facility has:\n\na. A written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.38;\n\nb. Provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).\n\nc.  Coordinate with local emergency responders.\n\n7.  Planned changes to improve safety.\n\n     Safety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  There"
