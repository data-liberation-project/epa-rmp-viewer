The facility maintains freezer and cooler storage spaces of just over 4 million cubic ft. which is used to store perishable products.  Storage areas at the facility operate at -5\u00b0F to +70\u00b0F.   The facility has ten truck loading and unloading spots and four railcar spots to facilitate the transportation of products.  A mechanical refrigeration system, utilizing anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant, is used to maintain desired temperatures.  The refrigeration system operates in a closed loop; the ammonia is not mixed with other chemicals.\n\nFACILITY CONSTRUCTION:  The facility was designed and constructed in accordance with mechanical and building codes in effect at the time of the various phases of construction.  These codes outline requirements for the safe installation and operation of ammonia refrigeration systems.\n\nSAFETY FEATURES:  The ammonia refrigeration system has many safety features.  Safeties include, but are not limited to: pressure relief valves, stop valves, ammonia detectors, a computerized refrigeration monitoring and control system, as well as trained and experienced operators.  Much of the safety associated with the system is inherent in the policies and procedures that govern its operation.   For example, the facility operates in accordance with the OSHA Process Safety Management standard (29 CFR 1910.119) and the EPA Risk Management Program (40 CFR Part 68). \n\nMANAGEMENT COMMITMENT TO SAFETY:  Management takes safety very seriously and mandates that the facility maintains a safe working environment for employees, visitors, neighbors, and products at all times.  Employees are trained on all safety issues relative to their duties and are made aware of all required safety programs.  \n\nA Safety Committee has been established at the facility.

Appropriate training is provided to refrigeration technicians employees.\n6. Contractors are qualified to work on or near the refrigeration system and trained on potential hazards associated with the system.\n7. Pre-Startup Safety Reviews are performed on all new and modified systems prior to placing ammonia into the system.\n8. Mechanical Integrity Inspections are performed as required.  All deficiencies are noted and addressed in a timely manner.\n9. A Hot Work program is implemented and all persons affected by the hot work are aware of potential hazards.\n10.

The Plan explains what actions employees, contractor employees, and visitors are to take in the event of an emergency which include steps to take in the event of a fire, earthquake, tornado, etc. \nThe Emergency Action Plan states that all employees shall: \n1. Initiate an evacuation by activating the public announcement (PA) system and/or two-way radios.\n2. Notify the appropriate emergency responders. \n3. Assist in a safe and orderly evacuation. \n4. Gather at the designated assembly area(s) for a head count.  \n\nIn the event of an ammonia release, employees are instructed to follow the steps as noted above.  Maintenance employees that have been properly trained on the usage of the hand-held ammonia detector may use it, along with the proper PPE, and the buddy system in an attempt to locate the ammonia leak.  In the event that readings on the detector approach 25 parts per million employees in the vicinity of the release are instructed to evacuate immediately to the designated assembly area, report all findings to Supervisors and/or Management and wait for further instruction.    \n\nThe Emergency Action Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year. \n\nPREVENTION PROGRAM 3:  \n1.

Information has been gathered to enable employees to identify and understand the potential hazards of the system.  The process safety information includes the Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) for anhydrous ammonia.   An ammonia inventory is collected and retained in the PSI Library.  Relief Valves are identified and labeled.  System equipment is operated according to good engineering practices.  \n\n3. Process Hazard Analysis:  A formal study of the ammonia refrigeration system with management, safety, and maintenance personnel was conducted using the What If/Checklist method to evaluate the potential hazards of the system.  A recommendation summary is used to track completion of all recommendations. \n\n4. Operating Procedures:  Written standard operating procedures (SOPs) have been developed and implemented to ensure safe operation of the refrigeration system.  SOPs are annually re-certified by the Chief Engineer or qualified designee.   \n\n5.
