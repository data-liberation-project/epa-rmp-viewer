Trained plant  personnel acting in conjunction with the Fire Department's \nHazardous Materials Response Team ensure local citizens  optimum attention to \naccident prevention and hazard consequence response and mitigation.\n\nIn the water treatment process for potable supply, chlorine is used as a disinfectant. The \nwater treatment plant is currently evaluating other alternate disinfectants in an effort to \nmove away from gaseous chlorine. The plant can store up to 10 one-ton cylinders or \n20,000 pounds of chlorine at any given time, exceeding the threshold of 2,500 pounds as \nestablished by the EPA, thereby qualifying this facility to comply with the elements of \nEPA's Risk Management Plan (RMP).  \n\nThe worst-case chlorine release scenario involves the rupture of a one ton cylinder \nwhereby all 2,000 pounds of gaseous chlorine are released at a rate on 200 pounds per \nminute for 10 minutes.  Other predetermined factors affecting the release are a wind \nspeed of 1.5 meters per second and an \"F\" atmospheric stability class.  Using EPA's \nOffsite Consequence Analysis (OCA) guidelines for urban topography, the resultant \nplume radius is 2.6 miles or a circle of influence 5.2 miles in diameter.  The receptors \naffected by this scenario would be schools, residences, major commercial and industrial \nareas, and a bird sanctuary.  \n\nThe alternative or most-likely case scenario involves the failure of a transfer pipe from 4 \nchlorine cylinders, a typical arrangement with 2 cylinders in use and 2 on stand-by.  \nAgain using EPA's OCA guidance 1,268 pounds of chlorine would be released at a rate \nof 46.8 pounds per minute for 27.1 minutes.  Also, the wind speed for this scenario would \nbe 3.0 meters per second with a \"D\" atmospheric stability class.  The resultant distance to \nthe endpoint of the radius would be 1.0 mile for an urban setting or a circle of influence 2 \nmiles in diameter.  T"

The Hazmat Team is fully trained in hazard \nresponse and communication and will represent the Fire Department as the lead agency \ndetermined by the Kingsport Emergency Preparedness Plan. They also have access to a \npre-programmed computer located in their van that enables them to predict the nature of \nthe site-specific release.  This was accomplished as part of a pre-plan of the facility by \nthe Hazmat Subcommittee of the Local Emergency Preparedness Council.  With this \ninformation available, the responders can efficiently mitigate risk and inform the affected \ncommunity about poper response action.  Other departments involved in the response \ninclude Police for traffic control, site security and assistance in evacuation, if necessary; \nTEMA (Tennessee Emergency Management Agency) for information, equipment and to \nnotify the EPA; and Sullivan County EMS and the Kingsport Life Saving Crew to \nprovide medical aid and transport of victims.  A full-scale training exercise was \npreviously conducted at the facility, resulting in invaluable experience and knowledge in\nresponding to a significant release scenario.\n\nContinued training of personnel, updating of PSM and RMP programs, will assure the \npublic, personnel and responders that their health and safety are of highest priority should \na significant release of chlorine occur at the City of Kingsport's Water Treatment Plant.  \nThis will continue to be our philosophy as we seek to alleviate thi"
