This pump station is owned by Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Authority (PRASA) which is a Government Agency.  PRASA has developed the RMP following the Program # 3 for the Management and Prevention of Risks associated with the storage and handling of the toxic substance used as for water disinfection: Chlorine.  The RMP was prepared in compliance with EPA 40 CFR Part 68.  The Prevention Program was prepared in accordance with OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation, as established in 29 CFR Part 1910.119.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release:\n\nIt is PRASA policy to comply with EPA and OSHA Federal and State applicable requirements. Chlorine is a toxic substance regulated by EPA, for that reason the Matadero Tank and Chlorination Station is already observing many engineering controls.  Changes have been put in place to improve security and as a part of the Prevention Plan implanted to protect the wellness of workers, employees, contractors, visitors and immediately surrounding areas and inhabitants.\n\n\n\nThe Stationary Source and Regulated Substance handled.\n\nMatadero Tank and Chlorination Station is located close to the area where the plants supply the potable water.  The chlorine is used as a disinfectant to destroy the microorganism that could cause illness in humans.\n\n\n\nThe chlorine is delivered from the PRASA Storage Center in Puerto Nuevo to the plant in one (1) ton containers, and cylinders of 150 pounds. Flexible connections (serpentine) extend from the one tone containers and then are connected to chlorinators from wich the chlorine flows to the ejectors and mixed with the water. Also, at the facility there is a Chlorine Distribution Center. The 150 pounds cylinders stored at the facility are distributed to facilities in the Arecibo area. \n\n\n\nWorst Case Scenario:\n\nThe Worst Case Scenario was determined as indicated in the EPA Was"

This guidance considers the release of the Chlorine Gas of the entire container (2,000 pounds) during 10 minutes and other specifications related to the weather conditions and a radio of 1.3 miles, for a chlorine concentration equal or higher than 3 ppm, which is the American Industrial Hygiene Association exposure limit above which it is determined human health will be affected. No known environmental receptors (state parks, or official designated wildlife preserves) are located within this radio area.  \n\nAlternative Case Scenario:\n\nThe more realistic scenario was also simulated as per EPA Wastewater Treatment Plants parameters, as a release of the total content of a 2,000 pounds container, but throughout a pipe leak.  In the case the end point distance is calculated at 0.1 miles and 0 public receptors were identified over the most recent map.  No known environmental receptors are located within the radio area.\n\n\n\nGeneral Accident Release Prevention Program \n\nPRASA is actually in a very aggressive operation to implement a Prevention Plan to ensure the maintenance and mechanical integrity of the facility which will improve significantly the safety scope of the current prevention plans.  Standard Operational Procedures (SOP's) are already in place to comply the OSHA and PROSHO requirements in order to keep all the involved parties aware of the hazardous and risk related to the chlorine.  List of all SOP's are indicated in the PSM report and are located in the plant.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program:\n\nPRASA has various SOP?s to manage emergency programs associated to a release of the chemical and also related to the emergency actions to be taken before and after hurricanes and other atmospherics events.\n\n\n\nFive years Accident History:\n\nNo mayor release of chlorine in excess of ten (10) pounds has been reported during the last five years. \n\n\n\nPlanned "

But during the past two years we have conducted internal metrics evaluation. With each internal metrics evaluation we request an action plan to correct the findings. PRASA has develop these evaluations to establish the level of compliance of our facilities with the RMP/PSM Programs Regulations Requirements."
