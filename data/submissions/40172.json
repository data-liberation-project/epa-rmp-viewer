In the ammonia plant, a catalytic reaction involving natural gas, steam and air is used to manufacture anhydrous ammonia with carbon dioxide as a by-product.  Some of the anhydrous ammonia produced is then separated and stored for use in the granulation plants. In the granulation plants, phosphoric acid is reacted with the anhydrous ammonia to produce granular monoammonium phosphate and / or diammonium phosphate.  Chlorine is used for water treatment in the cooling towers associated with the utilities area.\n\nRegulated toxic substances involved in these processes include: anhydrous ammonia, and chlorine, which exceed the threshold quantities at the Faustina facility. Regulated flammable substances involved in these processes that exceed threshold quantities include the flammable gas mixtures reacted and generated in the ammonia plant. \n\nAnhydrous ammonia is stored in a large refrigerated storage tank surrounded by a dike.  In addition to the anhydrous ammonia manufactured in the facility's ammonia plant, the Faustina facility also receives anhydrous ammonia via an underground commercial pipeline, as well as by ship and barge at the facility's river dock on occasion.  Chlorine is brought into the facility in multiple cylinders by trucks.  These cylinders are then individually connected to the process. Natural gas is received at the facility by an underground commercial pipeline that is connected by piping to the ammonia plant.\n\n\n3. General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\nAnhydrous ammonia, chlorine and flammable mixtures are regulated as highly hazardous chemicals under OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) standard.  Based on the quantities of these substances present at the Faustina facility, the Faustina facility is subject to OSHA's PSM requirements, and the"

Accident Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe IMC Phosphates Co., Faustina Facility has a long standing commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training, emergency equipment, participation in St. James Parish emergency drills, meetings with other companies and the St. James Parish emergency operations center, and meetings with the Ascension Parish emergency response organizations.\n\nThis commitment is also consistent with the corporation's environmental, health and safety policy which provides that:\n\n1)  All facilities will be designed, operated, and managed to protect the health and safety of the employees and the public; \n2)  All employees will be educated on the applicable environmental, health and safety standards, and procedures; \n3)  Sufficient human and financial resources will be allocated to sustain these goals; \n4)  Audits will be conducted regularly to verify compliance with this policy.\n\nThese corporate policies also emphasize the importance of complying with OSHA's Process Safety Management standard, so that all employees and the surrounding community will be adequately protected from potential fire, explosion and /or toxic hazards associated with catastrophic releases.\n\nIt is IMC Phosphates Co.'s policy to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated and hazardous substances.  If an accidental release does occur, IMC Phosphates Co. trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.  IMC Phosphates Co. has a comprehensive program for complying with safety and environmental regulations for all regulated and other hazardous substances handled.\n\n\n2.

The Faustina facility has fully implemented OSHA's PSM standard requirements and is using this program as its RMP Prevention Program. A brief summary of the facility's PSM program is as follows:\n\nIMC Phosphates Co., Faustina facility encourages all employees to participate in all facets of process safety and accident prevention.  And has an employee participation plan that documents the many ways employees are involved in these processes.\n\nIMC Phosphates Co., Faustina facility also has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards through the use of process hazard analysis techniques.\n\nIMC Phosphates Co., Faustina facility periodically revalidates its process hazard analyses to incorporate regulatory changes, new developments (such as lower toxicity standards and technology improvements), and offsite consequences.  These revalidations occur every five years and the findings along with their resolutions are kept for the life of the process.  The revalidation process is currently underway.\n\nIMC Phosphates Co., Faustina facility has well-established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition.  The basic aspects of this program include: (1) Conducting training; (2) Developing written procedures; (3) Performing inspections and tests in accordance with recognized standards; and (4) Correcting identified deficiencies and applying quality assurance measures.\n\nIMC Phosphates Co., Faustina facility also has procedures in place to ensure continuation of the entire PSM program, including: writi"

The storage vessel is constantly monitored by operators for ammonia leaks and has continuous monitoring electronic leak detection equipment with control room alarm monitoring the annular space between the double wall for ammonia leaks.  Typically, the vessel operates significantly below maximum capacity.  In the event of a long-term compressor outage, the anhydrous ammonia could be flared; sent to another ammonia producer in nearby Ascension Parish; or consumed in the granulation plants.  In the event of a vessel rupture, there is a dike completely surrounding the vessel sufficiently high to contain its entire contents with a margin of safety.  There is also an internal dike within the main dike that would keep smaller spills from spreading out to the maximum area of the dike thus reducing spill evaporation.  A series of relief valves connected to a flare also protect the tank from overpressure.\n\nOther smaller pressurized anhydrous ammonia storage vessels in the ammonia plant have relief valves that are piped directly to a flare system or vented to atmosphere.  Other ammonia relief valves are placed such that a discharge is elevated and would be significantly diluted before reaching areas affecting people.  There are also automated shutdown systems for the anhydrous ammonia manufacturing plant at the site.\n\nChlorine cylinders are provided by vendors who are required to maintain and inspect their mechanical integrity prior to shipping.  Visual inspections are also performed by Faustina facility personnel prio"

Five -Year Accident History\n\nThe five-year accident history includes a review of all accidental releases of regulated substances held above threshold quantities in covered processes that resulted in on-site deaths, injuries, or significant property damage, or known off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering-in-place, property damage, or environmental damage.  On July 31, 2000, the Ammonia Plant experienced an explosion and fire incident resulting from a process line failure.  No injuries or off-site impact resulted from this incident, it had significant economic impact only.\n\n\n5. Emergency Response Program\n\nIMC Phosphates Co., Faustina facility maintains a written emergency response program that is in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment.  The program consists of procedures for responding to releases of regulated and other substances, including the possibility of ammonia releases, chlorine releases, fire or explosion.  \n\nIMC Phosphates Co. Faustina facility is located in St. James Parish Louisiana and is also very close to Ascension Parish.  When an emergency situation arises requiring outside assistance, Faustina's overall emergency response program is coordinated with the St. James Parish Emergency Operations Center (St. James EOC).  Via this organization, Faustina works closely with other emergency response organizations including the sheriffs of both parishes, St. James and Ascension Parish emergency response personnel, Louisiana State Police and Prevost Memorial Hospital in Donaldsonville.  Faustina has 24-hour capability to communicate with these organizations.  Faustina uses an Incident Command System for emergency response."
