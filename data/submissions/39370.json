The Facility Policy:\n\nThe owners, management, and employees of Ostrander Farmers' Co-op (LeRoy Location) are commited to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2.  Facility Information:\n\n-  The primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers.\n\n-  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct soil application for crop production nutrients.\n\n-  The maximum quantity stored would be 220,000 pounds in our two (1-30,000 gal. & 1-18,000 gal.) storage tanks.  The maximum quantity handled would be the unloading of a semi tank car holding 44,000 pounds.\n\n3.  The worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario:\n\n-  The worst-case scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank (or tank car) releases as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity releases would be 130,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 1.12 miles.\n\n-  The alternative release scenario based on the five-year accident history (or the most likely potential incident) is a release from a break in a transfer hose.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is .78 miles. \n\n4.  The accidental release prevention program:\n\nThe facility has implemented the provisions of Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, \nK-61.1, published by the American National Standards Institute, inc., and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), CFR 1910.111, Storage and Handaling of Anhydrous Ammonia.\n\n5.
