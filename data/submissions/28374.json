      "SummaryText": "ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nRinchem Company, Inc. (Rinchem) is totally committed to safety and the implementation of safe \nprocedures.  Its committment is exemplified by its overall safety policy which states:\n\n      \"No job is more important than the health and safety of our employees, our communities and the\n       environment.\"\n\nThis policy is supported by everyone at Rinchem, but first and foremost by senior management.  \n\nTHE FACILITY AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nRinchem's Chaparral Chemical Warehouse at 511 Highway 213 stores chemicals for industry.  There are two substances regulated under 40 CFR part 68 - 70% hydrofluoric acid and chlorine - that are stored above the threshold quantity at this facility.  The hydrofluoric acid and chlorine are not involved with any processes at this location other than handling and storage of closed containers.   \n\nRinchem is located in an isolated rural setting with very few nearby residential neighbors.  The Chaparral \nWarehouse was built taking into consideration fire codes, building codes and industry standards for \nwarehouses that store hazardous materials.  There are many features designed into the building that help \nto prevent a liquid release of any of the stored substances to the environment such as secondary containment at the docks and dikes in the rooms where the materials are stored.  The materials in the warehouse are segregated by hazard class according to the applicable federal and state regulations.\n\n\nWORST-CASE AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nThe modeling of the worst-case and alternative release scenarios was performed using EPA's RMP* COMP(TM) program which is a very conservative model. The worst case scenario consists of the largest vessel in the facility containing the regulated substance releasing all of its contents.  This would involve a release from one 55-gallon drum.  The passive mitigation system that is in place at the facility and considered for the mo"

      "SummaryText": "deling of the scenario is that material is stored in an enclosed space in direct contact with outside air.  The worst case of the contents of an entire drum being released is very unlikely because of the daily inspections that are performed in the facility to verify that no drums are leaking, and the policy that any release is stopped and then cleaned up immediately upon detection.\n\nThe alternative release scenario that was modeled for the 70% hydrofluoric acid was the same as the worst-case scenario of a release from a 55-gallon drum except it was assumed to take place in typical weather conditions.  This scenario was chosen because it would be the most likely situation that could occur.  The same mitigation measures were considered.  Because releases are cleaned up immediately, the chance of the alternative release having an offsite impact is very unlikely.                                                The alternative release scenario for the chlorine that was modeled consisted of a slow release from the valve in a multi-stage pattern due to the freezing and unfreezing process of the gas at the point of release.  The chlorine cylinders are stored indoors within the warehouse which is considered an enclosed space that is in direct contact with outside air.  It was conservatively estimated that the total cylinder volume of 150 pounds would be released in 30 minutes over rural surroundings.\n\nAccording to the method used to do the modeling of the scenarios, the estimated distance to toxic endpoint for the worst-case scenario is 1.4 miles, the distance to toxic end point for the separate alternative release of hydrofluoric acid or chlorine is 0.3 miles and 0.1mile, respectively.\n\n   \nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe three key elements of Rinchem's release prevention program are (1) compliance with federal and state regulations, (2) use of engineering and administrative controls, and (3) dedication to training an"

No cylinders with leaking valves will be accepted into the warehouse. The facility is inspected daily to ensure that all operations are running safely and smoothly and to determine if any of the containers in storage are leaking.  It is Rinchem's policy that any time a release is detected, the supervisor is notified and it is cleaned up immediately by properly trained technicians.
