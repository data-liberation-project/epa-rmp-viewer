This commitment is inherent to our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with our regulated processes. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible accidental releases of regulated substances. However, if such an accidental release does occur, we are coordinated with the local Fire Department and the Adams County Emergency Management Agency for emergency response support.\n\n\n\nStationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nPlainville Farms-Distribution Center is a cold storage distribution facility.  The facility is primarily responsible is for processing and storage. The facility is located in the rural area of the city of New Oxford, PA.  \n\n\n\nThe substance regulated under the Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions (40 CFR 68) that is located on site is anhydrous ammonia.  Ammonia  (Anhydrous) is the only RMP regulated substance present at this facility in a threshold quantity and is utilized as the primary cooling media in our closed-loop refrigeration system. The system's purpose is to provide refrigeration and cold storage capabilities for our product. Due to the size and characteristics of our ammonia refrigeration system, as well as Process Safety Management (PSM) applicability, this facility is covered under Program 3 of the RMP regulations.\n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nThe DC has taken all necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set forth in 40 CFR Part 68.  Plainville Farms is also subject to the OSHA PSM Standard under 29 CFR 1910.119, as well as the EPCRA Section 302 and 311/312 notification/reporting requirements.\n\nEmergency Response Plan\n\n\n\nPlainville Farms Emergency Response Policy fo"

The facility maintains a written Emergency Response Plan to document specific procedures to be implemented in the event of various emergencies, including ammonia release. The Emergency Release Plan includes procedures for facility evacuation, as well as for notification to the local emergency response agencies, which are responsible for notifying the public. The plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within the facility that would require modified procedures.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:\n\n\n\nPlainville Farms currently has no changes planned for the ammonia refrigeration processes at this time.   However, the processes will be subjected to periodic process hazard analysis reviews for the purpose of identifying potential hazards and implementing the necessary improvement to provide a safer system. Plainville Farms personnel will also periodically review all potential opportunities to improve the safety of our personnel, the surrounding community, and the ammonia refrigeration processes.\n\n"
