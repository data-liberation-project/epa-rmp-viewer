This commitment is reflected in a comprehensive accidental release prevention program. This program addresses the design, installation, operation, maintenance, and employee training associated with the process equipment at the facility. \n\n\n\nE&B Natural Resources is committed to conducting business lawfully, ethically and in a socially and environmentally responsible manner. E & B Natural Resources' safety and environmental policies are administered by the Production Superintendent with assistance from the Environmental/Regulatory Tech. The Production Superintendent conducts periodic inspections of the facility to ensure compliance.  The Plant Manager oversees the entire safety and environmental programs, including the PSM/RMP/CalARP Program with the assistance of the operators and engineering staff. \n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\n\n\nThe facility is located at 1848 Perkins Rd. in New Cuyama, California.  The facility is approximately 3 miles south of highway 166 and 10 miles west of highway 33. The area immediately surrounding the facility is rural.  The facility is currently under construction and is scheduled to begin operations in late 2019/early 2020.\n\n\n\nThe primary equipment in the \"covered process\" is as follows:\n\n\n\n?    18,000 NGL/LPG Tank \n\n?    Associated NGL/LPG Piping\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nThe E & B Natural Resources ' NGL/LPG process has many safety features. Much of the safety of the system is inherent in the policies and procedures that govern the operation of the system. For example, the facility operates in accordance with Cal/OSHA's Process Safety Management regulation. The facility conducts preventative maintenance and any necessary minor repairs in house, but an outside contractor is hired for major repairs or maintenance.\n\n\n\nThe facility, including the NGL/LPG Process, was designed and co"

Level indicators are located on the NGL/LPG tank.  Pressure and temperature indicators are located throughout the process. The level, pressure, and temperature indicators allow operators to monitor system operations and to determine potential adverse situations in the event of deviations from standard or acceptable operating conditions. Regular system inspections also permit operators to monitor operations. \n\n\n\nPressure relief valves are present on all vessels and on various sections of piping. These devices are designed to ensure high pressure conditions within the equipment do not transpire. The design ratings of these valves are dependent upon the operating pressure of the equipment. The relief valves ion the NGL/LPG vent to the atmosphere; all other pressure relief valves vent internally.\n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nThe NGL/LPG process at E & B Natural Resources  is of new construction.  System start up is scheduled for December 2019/early 2020.  There have been no releases of NGL/LPG that meet the EPA criteria for the five year accident history.  In addition, there have been no injuries resulting from a NGL/LPG release, nor any releases or \"near misses\" that warranted an internal incident investigation.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe E & B Natural Resources  facility has an emergency a"

To minimize property damage.\n\n\n\nThe operator of the facility maintains a safety committee whose members are the designated emergency coordinators for the facility.  The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, NGL/LPG health hazards, and mitigation procedures, which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year. This Plan was reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM, RMP, and CalARP regulations.\n\n\n\nIn case of a NGL/LPG emergency, the facility plans to evacuate all employees and contractors and activate the facility's action plan to respond to the situation.  If necessary, they will alert the local emergency responders (fire department) for assistance. The facility plans to coordinate emergency response efforts with the fire department on a periodic and ongoing basis.\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nThe Process Hazards Analysis, with the initial review performed on October 25, 2018, updated on January 24, 2019, and finalized on December 6, 2019 which included a Cause/Effect study and provided mitigation measures to improve safety at the E & B Natural Resources  facility.

Catastrophic failures encompass the following external events: fire, high ambient temperature, and low ambient temperature. A catastrophic line failure of the NGL/LPG system could result in a line break which was examined in the Hazard Assessment.  \n\n\n\nIn accordance with the CalARP Program Seismic Assessment Guidance Document, a facility's Seismic Assessment must be reviewed and updated every five years.  An inspection of the NGL/LPG process equipment will be conducted by a Structural Engineer in early 2020.  Recommendations from the Seismic Assessment study are included in the Seismic Assessment Report.  All recommendations from the Seismic Assessment study will be completed by system startup.\n\n\n\n\n\n"
