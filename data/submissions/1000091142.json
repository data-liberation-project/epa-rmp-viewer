In the D-Gun process, acetylene is mixed with other gasses to create an explosive mixture that when ignited, will expel hot metal powders as a coating onto customer parts.   The plant is subject to 29 CFR1919.119 and 40 CFR Part 68.\r\nRegulated Substances:\r\nThis facility uses a chemical listed in part 68 of Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations, beyond a threshold quantity, as established by the EPA. That chemical is:\r\n- A flammable mixture containing acetylene that is stored and used on site.\r\nAccidental Release Prevention Policy:\r\nPraxair Surface Technologies as a part of Linde is dedicated to being the best performing industrial gas company in all aspects of our business, including safety, health, and environmental affairs. Our safety, health, and environmental policy call for a commitment to protecting the health and safety of our employees, neighbors, and the surrounding environment.\r\nThis policy is the basis for engineering and construction programs that produce equipment and process systems that minimize the possibility of accidental chemical releases and operational safety programs that ensure safe operation of our facilities. PST is committed to the continuous improvement of these programs.\r\nChemical-specific Prevention Steps:\r\nIn addition to the required prevention program elements, we have implemented safety features specific to the covered process at our facility. The following is a description of some of these key safety features.\r\n- Fire suppression deluge systems are installed above the acetylene storage trailer.  These systems will minimize the impact of a fire on the facility and the community by cooling the trailer to prevent the spread of fire to surrounding cylinders. \r\n-Fire extinguishers are in key areas of the plant. They are maintained monthly a"

      "SummaryText": "nd undergo yearly inspections.\r\n- D-gun control panels have emergency stops buttons that will stop the flow of acetylene to the at the coating cubicle.  Additionally, the acetylene control valves at the building entrance and at the trailer can be closed as needed to stop the flow of acetylene.  \r\n-Flash Arrestors are installed on the acetylene system to prevent the flashback of a flame to the supply line. These flash arrestors only allow the gas to flow in one direction.  The arrestor will seal if a flame is detected on the exit side.  Flash arrestors are located near the carbon column manifold and in the D-Gun gas panels.\r\n-During plant emergency alarm conditions, the plant employees evacuate and the LEPC is contacted.\r\nFive-year Accident History:\r\nThere were no releases of a regulated substance above its threshold quantity from the process in the previous five years.\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program:\r\nPraxair Surface Technologies has an emergency action program in place to minimize the effects of accidental release of regulated substances on employees, the public, and the environment.  The plan requires the LEPC be called for any incident on site related to fire, spills, or release of the covered chemical.  All facility employees are trained on the emergency plan and emergency drills are conducted at least annually.\r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to improve safety\r\nPraxair Surface Technologies has a commitment to safety that is expressed in a company-wide goal of \"Zero/Zero\", which means zero accidents and zero injuries or illnesses at every location. We look to constantly improve the safety of our processes using recommendations developed through the prevention program and we actively solicit safety suggestions from our employees."
