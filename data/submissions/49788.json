The facility is subject to the RMP requirements as greater than 10,000 lbs. of a regulated substance (anhydrous ammonia) is maintained and operated in a process for cooling of campus buildings.  Bayer had previously notified EPA regarding RMP applicability and the agency had issued EPA Facility ID #1000-0015-7527.\n\nIn order to ensure a smooth transition, Yale has contracted with Bayer to operate certain utilities including the subject anhydrous ammonia cooling system at the campus through December 31, 2007.  Hence, Bayer will continue to operate the system as was the case in the past in conformance with its RMP programs.  We understand that the EPA recently completed an on-site audit of these programs on June 27, 2007.  Although a final report from the audit has not been made available, Bayer personnel indicated that the agency conveyed that it did not find significant deficiencies.\n\nAs this submission is primarily an administrative change identifying Yale as the site owner, we understand that the notification method through the RMP Submit process is to complete the submission as a ?correction? with a code of C04 (Notification of facility ownership change).  Please note that the content and compliance dates included in this submission are representative of Bayer?s activities related to the RMP programs.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is currently used primarily as a refrigerant for cooling buildings located on the campus.  Yale is in the process of evaluating whether ammonia will continue to be used for this purpose.  As the need for cooling is seasonal and will not be required again until 2008, Yale intends to drawdown ammonia from the active operating system into storage for the winter season.  Yale will be evaluating options for future use of ammonia "

In the event that the use of ammonia is discontinued and the RMP requirements are no longer applicable, Yale will contact EPA and provide appropriate notification.\n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at the facility, the regulated substances handled, the general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps, the five year accident history, the emergency response program, and planned changes to improve safety are addressed within the existing RMP program managed by Bayer."
