We are strongly committed to safety by maintaining comprehensive maintenance, prevention, and industrial safety programs that protect against any accidental release or spill which may result in on- or off-site consequences.\n\nIn the unlikely event of a mishap, an emergency response plan has been developed in cooperation with the Lancaster County Emergency Preparedness Agency, which serves to ensure the safety and well being of the community and the environment.  Our emergency response program is based upon the recommendations by The Chlorine Institute, Inc. within the \"Emergency Response Plans for Chlorine Facilities.\"       \n\nFacility Description\n\nChlorine is stored on-site for use in the disinfection process of treated wastewater prior to final discharge.  One 2,000-pound pressurized chlorine cylinder is located within an enclosed building south of the treatment ponds.  An additional 2,000-pound chlorine cylinder is stored on-site as a reserve tank.  The latest technology in process control systems are present in the chlorine storage area to minimize and prevent the impacts of any spillage, fire, explosion, or equipment failure.            \n\nAccident History\n\nThe City of Lancaster Wastewater Treatment Plant has had an excellent record of preventing accidental release over the past 5 years.  Due to our stringent release prevention policies, no accidental releases have occurred or were identified within the time period in question.  Since the facility has been in operation, no deaths or injuries have resulted from the accidental release, explosion, or fire involving this regulated substance.  Furthermore, no fish kills or other environmental impacts have resulted from an accident or spill incident at the Lancaster, South Carolina facility.    \n\nOff"

Details for each chosen scenario hve been provided in the following paragraphs.\n \nChlorine\n\nThe worst-case release scenario, as developed for the chlorination system, involves a catastrophic release of 2,000 pounds of chlorine from the chlorine cylinder connected to the chlorination process equipment.  It has been assumed that the entire quantity of chlorine is released as a gas over a 10 minute time frame as a result of a tank rupture.  Under worst-case weather conditions, the maximum distance of 3.0 miles corresponds to the toxic endpoint of 0.0087 mg/l.  Industrial facilities, schools, hospitals, recreational areas, residential subdivisions, creeks, and rivers would be affected by such a release.    \n\nAn alternative scenario may include the catastrophic release of chlorine gas during 3 m/s windspeeds, D Class atmospheric stability, and 77degrees fahrenheit weather conditions.  It has been assumed that a quantity of chlorine gas is released at a rate of 41.2 pounds per minute from the storage cylinders as a result of a pipe rupture within the chlorination building.  The facility's hazard response team would control the release by preventing flow through the piping within a 60 minute period.  Under the alternative weather conditions, the maximum distance of 0.3 miles corresponds to a toxic endpoint of 0.0087 mg/l. Residential subdivisions would be affected by such a release.  Environmental receptors exposed to chlorine concentrations  above the 0.0087 mg/l level include creeks and rivers.  \n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe City of Lancaster Wastewater Treatment Plant has taken the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements "

The prevention program consists of the elements as follows:\n\n1. Employee Participation\nEmployees at the City of Lancaster Wastewater Treatment Plant are provided access to all elements of this Risk Management Plan for review and input.  Site management, whenever possible, involve employees in the development, revisions, review, and implementation of this plan.  Employees, knowledgeable in the specified processes, are included in any task group or team for their invaluable experience and input for developing a successful program to ensure the well being of co-workers, the community, and the environment.  \n \n2. Process Safety Information\nThe City of Lancaster Wastewater Treatment Plant maintains a detailed written record of all safety information regarding the operation of each covered process.  Information includes the chemical hazards, operating procedures, and equipment design parameters.\n\n3. Process Hazard Analysis\nThe checklist hazard analysis method is utilized at the Lancaster, South Carolina facility to identify and prevent any activity that may result in a release of a regulated substance.  A team of qualified personnel perform periodic reviews of operating procedures, equipment functions, and handling practices to identify potential hazards every three years, or in the event of any process or equipment change.  Any findings related to the hazard review is addressed in a safe and timely manner.\n\n4. Operating Procedures\nWritten operating procedures addressing initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, and emergency operations have been developed to ensure the safe operation of the covered processes.\n\n5.
