This commitment is inherent to our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with our regulated process. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible accidental releases of regulated substances. It is our goal to achieve and sustain \"Zero Accident Tolerance\" through communication, information, and training. However, if such an accidental release does occur, we are coordinated with the Rumford Fire Department and the Oxford County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) for emergency response support.\n\n\n\n- The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nRumford Power is a combined cycle power plant. The regulated substances handled on location are Anhydrous Ammonia, which is used in the Chiller System as a coolant to enhance gas turbine performance. The second regulated substance is Aqueous Ammonia, which is used in the Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) system to reduce NOx emissions from the power plant.  The Chiller System regulated substance is covered under Program 3 of the RMP regulations.  The SCR systems regulated substance is covered under Program 2 of the RMP regulations.\n\n \n\n- Offsite Consequence Analysis\n\n \n\nThe Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario have been completed.  To evaluate the worst case and alternative release scenarios, EPA's RMP Comp software was utilized exclusively. The worst case and alternate case release scenarios have been calculated and the results of the calculations are documented in the Rumford Power RMP Plan.

      "SummaryText": "sibly be affected by the release scenarios were determined through the use CAPS, Circular Area Profiling System software and US Census Bureau 2020 data. \n\n\n\n- The General Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\n\n\nThe general accident release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps at Rumford Power are to comply with EPA's Accidental Prevention Rule, OSHA's Process Safety Management Standard, and all applicable state and local codes and regulations. Each process and the process equipment at Rumford Power was designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with the  previously mentioned codes, laws, and regulations.\n\n\n\n- Accident History\n\n\n\nRumford Power has had no accidents associated with ammonia use.\n\n\n\n - Emergency Response Program\n\n\n\nRumford Power is equipped with an ammonia detection and emergency alarm system for the Chiller System.  In the event of an alarm there are specific procedures that all employees must follow. These written procedures can be found in the Rumford Power Emergency Plan.  The procedures include evacuation of personnel and notification of authorities. The Oxford County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and the Rumford Fire Department are trained and equipped to respond to ammonia releases at Rumford Power\n\n\n\n- Planned Changes to Improve Safety:\n\n\n\nRumford Power currently has no changes planned for the Chiller System and SCR System at this time. However, the process will be subjected to periodic process hazard analysis reviews for the purpose of identifying potential hazards and implementing the necessary improvement to provide a safer system. Rumford Power personnel will also periodically review all potential opportunities to improve the safety of our personnel, the surrounding community, and the ammonia refrigeration process through required compliance audits and management of change procedures.\n\n"
