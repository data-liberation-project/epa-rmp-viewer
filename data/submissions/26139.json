If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department and law enforcement personnel to mitigate any release to residents and the environment of our community.\n\n2.  Facility Information:  The primary activity at the facility is the storage and sales of fertilizers to farm producers in the area.  Feeders Grain & Supply has operated a grain elevator in Corning, Iowa for approximately 27 years.  Approximately six years ago Feeders Grain and Supply installed a anhydrous ammonia tank, approximately three miles east of Corning and one-half mile south of Highway 34.  The  anhydrous ammonia tank is located in a rural area.  The maximum quantity stored at this rural location would be 171,800 pounds.  Anhydrous ammonia is not stored at the Corning elevator location.  Feeders Grain & Supply has 11 full time employees.  During the planting season one employee is located, as needed, at the anhydrous ammonia facility.  During the off-season the anhydrous ammonia facility is not staffed on a regular basis. \n\n3.  Worst-Case Release Scenario and Alternative Release Scenario:\n\n    a.  The worst-case release scenario would be the  total release of the anhydrous ammonia from our storage tank.  The Distance to the endpoint would be approximately 1.8 miles.  The worst case will include the amount released and @ 85% of the tank which is standard limitations of the tank.  Alternative release will include mitigation measures in place to limit exposure to off situations.\n\n    b.  The alternative release scenario is a release from a break in a transfer hose.  The distance to the endpoint would be approximately 0.7 mile.\n\n    c.  Administrative Controls:  The administrative control are through our operating procedures, training, maintenance and audit programs.\n\n4.  Accidental Releas"

      "SummaryText": "e Prevention Program:  The facility has implemented the provisions of Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61, published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc.  During periods of non operation of the anhydrous ammonia facility local law enforcement and our personnel conduct inspection of the area.  Anything out of the ordinary is reported to our 24 hour number and appropriate action is taken. The facility has implemented the provisions of the Ia.Fertilizer Laws.\n\n5.  Five Year Accident History:  There have been on accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years  that have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility, nor to our knowledge, have resulted in off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmentaql damage.\n\n6.  Emergency Response Program:  Our facility has coordinated with the local responders and we do not plan to have our employees respond to a major release. The company complies  with OSHA 1910.38 and Sara Title III EPERA.\n\n7.  Planned Changes to Improve Safety:  Safety is an on-going  process at this facility.  At this time there are no major improvements planned for our safety program.\n\n8.  For further information contact Mr. Jim Curtis, Feeders Grain & Supply, Inc., P. O. Box 283, Corning, IA, 641-322-4012."
