This submission treats the Refinery as a single process.  The Risk Management and Process Safety Management Programs for the Refinery are applied uniformly to each operating unit as refinery-wide accidental release prevention programs.\n\nThe Refinery is in compliance with both the RMP and PSM prevention programs and conducts reviews and updates of each program in order to certify and assure continuing compliance.  Both programs require the Refinery to implement practices and procedures for accidental release prevention. These procedures include operator training and certification, standard operating and emergency operating procedures, emergency notifications, equipment maintenance and inspection procedures, process hazards analysis and hazards mitigation in equipment design and operation, management of changes to equipment, operating and maintenance procedures, emergency procedures, and emergency notification for additional public risk reduction. The Refinery must also adhere to recognized safe equipment design, materials design, and engineering standards. All of these elements of the Refinery risk management and release prevention programs are designed to limit the possibility of accidental releases of toxic or flammable materials and minimize effects of Refinery operations on the general public and its employees from injuries, fatalities, and property damages\n",

In order to maintain safe operations, the Refinery has had long-term control programs and procedures that are reviewed on a regular basis and updated to be current with facility operations and regulatory requirements.  The Refinery uses both management controls and engineering controls to eliminate or reduce the risk of an accidental release.   Management controls are work procedures, safety policies, rules, supervision, and training implemented with the goal of reducing the possibility of an accidental release.  Engineering controls eliminate or reduce the possibility of an accidental release through the use or substitution of engineered machinery or equipment.

To improve emergency response the Refinery has developed an Integrated Contingency Plan (ICP) that conforms to the National Response Teams Integrated Contingency Plan Guidance.  The ICP is designed to minimize hazards to human health, property and the environment from fires, explosions, or any unplanned sudden on non-sudden release of hazardous waste or hazardous constituents at the Refinery.   \n\nStationary Sources and RMP Regulated Substances\n\nThis submission treats the Refinery as a single stationary source process for the production of petroleum fuels.  In the past 5 years the refinery has had two major changes to equipment and/or processes.  In March 2006, additional equipment was added to the refinery??A?s diesel hydrotreater (HDS unit) to produce ultra-low sulfur diesel (ULSD) to meet EPA fuel requirements.  In December 2006 Wyoming Refining Company received a permit to increase the refinery??A?s maximum crude throughput.  Neither project resulted in the constr"

In response to these changes, Wyoming Refining has conducted a facility siting study and a flare study and have projects in place to address the findings of these studies.\n\nIn 2009 the company received a construction permit for a new unit known as the SWAATS (Sour Water Ammonia to Ammonium ThioSulfate).  The SWAATS unit consists of an amine unit to remove hydrogen sulfide gas (H2S) from the refineryA?s sour fuel gas system, a sour water stripper unit to remove hydrogen sulfide and ammonia from the refineryA?s sour wastewater, and a third unit to combine the hydrogen sulfide and ammonia into ammonium thiosulfate, a feedstock used in the fertilizer industry.  The SWAATS unit requires the installation of a new anhydrous ammonia storage tank to supplement the amount of ammonia that is generated from the sour water stripper.  Wyoming Refining CompanyA?s RMP plan has been revised to include this new regulated substance. \n\nToxic Materials at Wyoming Refining Company\n\nThe Refinery uses several potentially toxic chemicals in its facilities.  None of the toxic materials is in a quantity sufficient to be considered by OSHA and EPA as a concern to the public from an accidental release except for hydrofluoric acid (HF)used to produce high-octane gasoline and anhydrous ammonia used in the SWAATS process.   Anhydrous hydrogen fluoride is used as a catalytic agent in the HF Alkylation process for the production of gasoline from isobutane and olefins.  Anhydrous ammonia is used in the SWAATS process to convert hydrogen sulfide gas to ammonium thiosulfate.  \n\nHydrofluoric acid is highly corrosive to living tissue and can cause severe burns to skin, eyes, and the respiratory system, depending on the exposure concentration and exposure time.  Inhalation can cause irritation, inflammation, and fluid accumulation of the lungs.  Exposure can cause coughing, tearing, difficulty in"

First aid requires immediate irrigation of exposed skin and subsequent application of calcium gluconate to neutralize the acid.\nExposure to HF is immediately apparent at a concentration far lower than that which can cause health problems. This becomes an early warning to move to a safe upwind location.\n\nThe HF Alkylation process has been used for decades by the petroleum refining industry in the production of gasoline with few accidental releases.  Wyoming Refining has never had a significant release of hydrogen fluoride from the Alkylation unit and has had only one reportable incident or accident involving the Alkylation unit during the last five years. The Alkylation unit is equipped with a water deluge system, which can be activated in the event that a release of hydrogen fluoride is detected.  This emergency system mitigates the toxic effects of hydrogen fluoride gas by dissolving and diluting the hydrogen fluoride in sufficient water to prevent dispersion of the gas to the atmosphere. This system is tested weekly in summer months to assure reliable operation.\n\nThe total inventory of hydrogen fluoride in the Alkylation unit is 58,000 lb. This quantity is subdivided into 38,000 lb. in low pressure storage and 20,000 lb. contained under pressure in the alkylation reactor.  The two inventories are infrequently connected. The Refinery has procedures and equipment designed to mitigate a release of HF to the environment.  These procedures include removal of all HF in high-pressure equipment to low pressure storage before any equipment is opened for maintenance.  In the event that an HF release is detected, the facilities can be deluged with water to dissolve and dilute virtually all of the released HF before it leaves the unit.  The water deluge system will prevent upwards of 95% of the release hydrogen fluoride from being dispersed d"

Anhydrous ammonia can cause severe burns to skin, eyes, and the respiratory system, depending on the exposure concentration and exposure time.    Inhalation of vapors may result in pulmonary edema and chemical pneumonitis.  Anhydrous ammonia is corrosive and irritating to the upper respiratory system and all mucous type tissue.  Depending on the concentration inhaled, it may cause burning sensations, coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, nausea, with eventual collapse.  Inhalation of excessive amounts affects the upper airway (larynx and bronchi) by causing caustic-like burning resulting in edema and chemical pneumonitis.  If it enters into the deep lung, pulmonary edema will result.  Pulmonary edema and chemical pneumonitis are potentially fatal conditions.  Anhydrous ammonia has a pungent odor and is lighter-than-air.\n\nThe SWAATS process is a new industry process and new to Wyoming Refining Company, therefore the company does not have any release or accident history data.  A process hazard analysis (PHA) has been completed on the initial design of the unit and has plans in place to close out all recommendations prior to start-up of the new unit.  The maximum inventory of anhydrous ammonia in the SWAATS unit is 107,000 lb contained in the new anhydrous ammonia storage tank.  The Refinery has procedures and equipment designed to mitigate a release of anhydrous ammonia to the environment.  Since anhydrous ammonia is very soluble in water, these procedures include the manning of fire hoses while off-loading the material into the storage tank.  In the event of a release, the release point can be deluged with water to absorb the ammonia and mitigate the amount of material from being dispersed downwind.\n\nFlammable Materials at Wyoming Refining Company\n\nThe Refinery processes flammable materials as a matter of course.

The Refinery has four flammable materials in excess of RMP reporting thresholds: propane (C3H6), normal butane (C4H10), isobutane (iC4H10), butylenes (C4H8).  All four flammable materials are liquids in pressure storage, but will evaporate into the atmosphere in the event of a leak presenting possible fire and explosion hazards.  None of these compounds are toxic, but all can cause asphyxiation from oxygen displacement. Of these, isobutane has the greatest potential for offsite effects in the event of an accidental release.  Isobutane is stored in 1500 and 500 barrel pressure storage vessels.  The liquefied gases are held in pressure storage with water sprinkler systems for fire control.  Revisions to the sprinkler systems for the isobutane bullets were completed in 2006 to provide improved coverage.\n\nPrevention Program\n\nThis Risk Management Plan 2009 re-submission for Wyoming Refining, Inc., Newcastle, Wyoming complies with the EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) 40 CFR 68 as well as the OSHA Process Safety Management Program (PSM) 29 CFR 1910.119.  This submission treats the Refinery as a single process.  The Risk Management and Process Safety Management Programs for the Refinery are applied uniformly to each operating unit as refinery-wide accidental release prevention programs.  \n\nThe Refinery is in compliance with both the RMP and PSM prevention programs and conducts reviews and updates of each program in order to certify and assure continuing compliance.  Both programs require the Refinery to implement practices and procedures for accidental release prevention. These procedures include operator training and certification, standard operating and emergency operating procedures, emergency notifications, equipment maintenance and inspection procedures, process hazards analysis and hazards mitigation in equipment design and operation, management of changes to equipment, operating and maint"

All of these elements of the Refinery risk management and release prevention programs are designed to limit the possibility of accidental releases of toxic or flammable materials and minimize effects of Refinery operations on the general public and its employees from injuries, fatalities, and property damages.\n\nRMP 5-year Accident History\n\nIn the past 5 years WRC has had only one accidental release of RMP chemicals stored on-site above the threshold quantity from a covered process unit as defined by 40 CFR part 68.42(a).  On March 26, 2009 two Wyoming Refining employees received minor burns from exposure to HF acid while performing maintenance work on an exchanger in HF service.  Both employees received first aid treatment immediately after the incident and received follow-up care at the local hospital.  The amount of HF acid released during this incident is estimated to be less than 1 pound.  This incident was investigated and the recommendations from the investigation, including changes to procedures and revising PPE requirements for this type of work, are being implemented.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nThe refinery has developed an integrated contingency plan that addresses all of the RMP pubic emergency response plan requirements for a release of toxic or flammable materials.  This plan was developed with the local emergency planning committee and includes Weston County/Newcastle and Upton Hazardous Material Plan.  Both the Refinery and the LEPC develop plans for a public response to such an emergency.  Emergency responses include public emergency notification, public evacuation or sequestration, as appropriate, and training of local police, fire, medical, and other emergency officials in handling, with trained Refinery personnel, a significant pub"
