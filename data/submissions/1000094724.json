The facility incorporates a standard evaporation and compression closed loop ammonia refrigeration system. The compressors are split as High Stage and Low Stage Compressors. There exists, two different levels of saturated suction temperatures. Each level of suction temperature services a specific area of the plant. \r\n\r\nSUMMARY OF THE FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\nCase Farms has had no reportable accident(s) in the past five years involving ammonia.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN\r\nIn the event that an ammonia leak is detected employees are to notify a member of management, who will immediately contact the Emergency Response Coordinator (ERC).\r\nIn the event that the ERC is unreachable, an Alternate should be contacted. The ERC or Alternate has complete authority to commit all available resources in the event of an emergency. In the event that none of the listed personnel are on-site, the senior management person shall direct operations until the ERC or Alternate arrives on-site.\r\nThe ERC and alternates are responsible for emergency response coordination with state and local agencies on a 24-hour basis. Upon notification of an existing, or imminent emergency situation, the ERC will immediately identify the character, exact source, amount and extent (area) of the emergency.\r\nThe ERC will assess possible hazards both direct and indirect to human health, the environment and/or property both inside and outside of the plant. After this information is received, a decision is made whether or not to implement the provisions of the Emergency Response Plan. Upon enactment of the Emergency Response Plan, the ERC will be responsible for:\r\nDetermination of the need for a plant evacuation, or Sheltering in Place;\r\nNotification"
