There was a release of 994 lbs of anhydrous HCl over the duration of the event.  There was an off-site impact from this incident that resulted in a call for shelter-in-place of one unit at an adjacent facility as a precautionary measure.\n\n- On September 8, 2020 at 8:45 am, after Hurricane Laura, assigned a classification as a Category 4 hurricane by the National Hurricane Center, impacted the Westlake Chemicals & Vinyls LLC facility on 8/26/2020. Due to loss of power associated with Hurricane Laura, vent movement from the HCl storage tank to the HCl column was required to equalize the system and prevent excessive pressure buildup in the tank. During the process of moving vents from the HCl storage tank to the HCL column, the bypass valve opened up, routing the vents to the emergency scrubber area. The emergency scrubber stack was damaged in the hurricane and so the vents were released from the shortened stack base. There was a release of 691 lbs of vinyl chloride and 743 lbs of anhydrous HCl.  Operations personnel quickly secured the area, rerouted the vents, and stopped the release. Westlake Chemicals & Vinyls LLC personnel notified an adjacent industrial facility to shelter in place in an abundance of caution. There were no injuries as a result of this event and no offsite impact.\n\n- On December 14, 2021 at 3:00 pm, a leak on a section of piping associated with a VCM furnace developed.
