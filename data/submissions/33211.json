Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies:\n\nAt this production facility, we use propane, butane, and dimethyl ether, which is considered hazardous by EPA.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal and state rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle liquified petroleum gases, combined with the safety devices inherent in the design of this facility, combined with the safe handling procedures that we use and the training of our personnel.\n\nOur emergency response program covers scenarios involving LP-Gas, and includes procedures for notification of the Rantoul Fire Department, and notification of any potentially-affected neighbors.\n\n2.  The stationary sources and regulated substances handled:\n\nThe primary purpose of this facility is the manufacture and distribution of personal care products, with aerosol products accounting for approximately 20% of our business.  LP-gases are received by truck (transports) and stored in three 12,000-gallon stationary storage tanks on the North side of our facility.  The gas is used as a propellant in the filling of aerosol cans.  Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel, and authorized contractors.\n\nThe regulated substances we handle at this production facility are:  propane, butane, and dimethyl ether.\n\nThe maximum amount of propane that can be stored at this plant in stationary tanks is 141,000 pounds.  At different times, we might also have up to three 11,000-gallon truck tankers (transports) containing special blends of propane, butane, and dimethyl ether for use in the same process, pushing the maximum amount of storage at any one time to 270,250 pounds.\n\n3.  The worst-case scenario(s) and the alternate release scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario.\n\nWORST-CASE SCENARIO:  A vapor cloud explosion involving one of the stationary"

      "SummaryText": "storage tanks, when filled to the greatest amount allowed, would release approximately 55,692 pounds of propellant.  Assumptions for this scenario using RMP COMP include a wind speed of 3.4 miles/hr (1.5 meters/second), Stability Class:  F, and an air temperature of 77 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nThe distance to the endpoint of 1 psi of the worst-case scenario is 0.3 miles, and could potentially impact the businesses of the industrial park, as well as one private residence (3 people).\n\nALTERNATIVE SCENARIO:  A vapor cloud fire from a process piping break (using RMP COMP).  In this situation, it is estimated we would release approximately 6,000 pounds of propellant, with the resulting vapors reaching an ignition source, and causing a vapor cloud fire.  This release would affect an area 0.1 miles in diameter, and have a slight possibility of extending beyond the facility boundary.  The only industrial park business that might be affected would be the Eagle Wings Industries parking lot to the North.\n\n4.  The general accidental release prevention program and the specific prevention steps.\n\nThis manufacturing facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule, and with all applicable state codes and regulations.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-58.  All production employees receive training in how to work safely with aerosol products, while maintenance employees are trained in the hazards of propane, and how to work safely with the equipment.\n\n5.  Five-year accident history.\n\nConair Corporation has not had any accident or incident involving propane or any other LP-gas.\n\n6.  The emergency response program.\n\nConair Corporation has developed a comprehensive emergency response program, and have discussed this plan with the Rantoul Fire Department.  The fire department toured the facility on February 24, 1999.\n\n7.  Planned changes to improve safety.\n\nThe facility was constructed in 1990 with two tanks.  A third was added in 1992.  In"
