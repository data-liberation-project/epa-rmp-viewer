      "SummaryText": "The City of Milan, Missouri has a new water treatment plant that was started up on January 23, 2001.  The plant is a 2,000 gpm max plant.  The plant has Dual settling basins, flocculator basins, 5 10x14 filters and a clearwell with a capacity of 375,000 gallons. The bulk chlorine tanks are isolated from the building in the chlorine storage room. The chlorine storage room also includes fans, louvers and vacuum regulators and chlorine detector.  The new plant will need a RMP, which is submitted with this report.  Two \"SCBA\" breathing masks with tanks are on site, to deal with a potential leak.  If a leak occurs the personnel at the plant will try to the best of their ability to fix and contain the leak as quickly as safely as possibly.  The personnel are taking training classes, demostrations, and observation from DNR."
