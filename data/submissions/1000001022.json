All contractors receive a Facility Orientation to the hazards of ammonia and emergency procedures. Those contractors that are working on the ammonia system or could impact the safety of the system receive additional training on the facility work practices and procedures.  \n\n(10) Hot Work pemits: At the facility we followed the Hot Work Permitting Process for all spark or flame producing operations. \n\n(11) Emergency Response: To ensure the safety of our employees, contractors, and the general public we have developed an emergency action plan. The facility coordinates emergency response with the fire department.   \n\n(12) Incident Investigation: All incidents are investigated to determine the incident causes so corrective actions can be identified and improvements made.   \n\n(13) Aproximately every three years we conduct a compliance assessment of our PSM Program to determine those program elements which need improvement and to verify compliance to the program.  \n\n(14) Trade Secrets: Our Trade Secrects Program is maintained for \ncompliance."
