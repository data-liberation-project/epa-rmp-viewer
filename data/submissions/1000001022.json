We are commited to  obeying local, state, and federal laws that apply to our business and ammonia system. To ensure compliance with EPA's RMP and OSHA PSM requirements, we have developed an extensive Process Safety Management System. Our priority is to prevent accidental releases of ammonia. The Facility Process Safety Management Program Includes the following  programs.                                                                                                                                                          \n\n(1) Employee Participation:  We involve our employees at all appropriate elements of the program \n                                                                                                                                                                     \n(2) Process Safety Information: We maintain the information relating to system design, maintenance, and ammonia exposure information.                                                                                                                                                             \n\n(3) Process Hazards Analysis: We conducted a detailed PHA of the ammonia system to identify system hazards and potential operational problems. \n                                                                                                                                                      \n(4)Operating Procedures: We provide written Standards of Operation for the ammonia system.
