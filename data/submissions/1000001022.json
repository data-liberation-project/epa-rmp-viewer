At this facility, we store various food products which are later distributed to restaurants and other customers. Like most cold storage warehouses, we use Anhydrous Ammonia in our refrigeration system.\n\nUS Foods Baltimore is commited to maintaining a safe manufacturing and food distribution environment. We are commited to  obeying local, state, and federal laws that apply to our business and ammonia system. To ensure compliance with EPA's RMP and OSHA PSM requirements, we have developed an extensive Process Safety Management System. Our priority is to prevent accidental releases of ammonia. The Facility Process Safety Management Program Includes the following  programs.                                                                                                                                                          \n\n(1) Employee Participation:  We involve our employees at all appropriate elements of the program \n                                                                                                                                                                     \n(2) Process Safety Information: We maintain the information relating to system design, maintenance, and ammonia exposure information.                                                                                                                                                             \n\n(3) Process Hazards Analysis: We conducted a detailed PHA of the ammonia system to identify system hazards and potential operational problems. \n                                                                                                                                                      \n(4)Operating Procedures: We provide written Standards of Operation for the ammonia system.

All contractors receive a Facility Orientation to the hazards of ammonia and emergency procedures. Those contractors that are working on the ammonia system or could impact the safety of the system receive additional training on the facility work practices and procedures.  \n\n(10) Hot Work pemits: At the facility we followed the Hot Work Permitting Process for all spark or flame producing operations. \n\n(11) Emergency Response: To ensure the safety of our employees, contractors, and the general public we have developed an emergency action plan. The facility coordinates emergency response with the fire department.   \n\n(12) Incident Investigation: All incidents are investigated to determine the incident causes so corrective actions can be identified and improvements made.   \n\n(13) Aproximately every three years we conduct a compliance assessment of our PSM Program to determine those program elements which need improvement and to verify compliance to the program.  \n\n(14) Trade Secrets: Our Trade Secrects Program is maintained for \ncompliance.
