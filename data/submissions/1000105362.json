Any chemical incidents that may have off-site impacts are reported to the Morgan County Emergency Management Agency (EMA) which can initiate a county-wide emergency alerting system.  The Ascend-Decatur site also supplies equipment in emergencies as backup for the EMA's systems.\n\nWe maintain an emergency contingency plan, which addresses various federal, state, and local regulatory requirements for emergency response planning.  Our program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.  Furthermore, we coordinate our plan with the community emergency response plan.\n\n7.0  Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThe following is a list of activities that will be continued, or implemented, at the facility to help prevent and/or better respond to accidental chemical releases:\n\n*  Maintain a capital and maintenance program to enhance reliability of operating units, therefore reducing upset conditions. \n*  Maintain OSHA VPP Star Status\n*  Maintain ISO 9001 Status \n*  Maintain ISO 14001 Status \n*  Maintain RC 14001 Certification\n\n8.0  Certification\n\nAscend - Decatur Plant has no Program 1 or 2 processes.\n\nTo the best of the undersigned's knowledge, information, and belief formed after reasonable inquire, the information submitted is true, accurate, and complete.\n\n\n\n\n\n____________________ \nSite Director\n\n\n_____________________ \nDate\n\n9.0  RMP Data:\n\nThe attached RMP summary presented the information about our risk management plan as required by EPA's RMP rule.

The EMT's receive 8 hour CPR and 1st aid training every other year.  On alternating years, the EMT's receive EVOC and EMR training.  We have a fully stocked ambulance readily available should we need to transport any of our employees to a local hospital.  Our EMTs are all nationally registered and state licensed.\n\nThe entire fire brigade is trained to the HAZMAT A&O and technician levels and are pro-board certified and will respond to on-site chemical emergencies.  We also have specialists that respond to on-site and to off-site chemical emergencies.  These dedicated people are trained to handle both railcar and highway emergencies.  They train on chemical data, shipping containers, vessels, tanks and incident command.  We have a fully stocked emergency van that carries supplies that the Specialist use to control any chemical emergencies.\n\nOur site budgets appropriately and provides resources for projects that protect the environment, health and safety of our employees and our surrounding community.  Some examples of projects implemented are maintaining approximately 37 deluge automatic sprinkler systems, 13 smoke detection systems, 7 wet-pipe systems, 8 fire pumps, miles of underground fire mains, hundreds of fire extinguishers, and other protection equipment.\n\nAscend is a charter member of the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and has a representative on the Executive Steering Committee of this organization.  We are a charter member of the Industrial Emergency Association (IEA) and have a representative on the Emergency Response Committee of the same.  Participation in planning and execution of community drills through our membership in these two organizations has always been rewarding.

He smelled an odor that he thought was Propionitrile and finished sampling the container.  He observed the vent line block valve was open and the cap was not put back on the Propionitrile vent line at an adjacent loading spot.  The operator shut the sampling process down and told his team lead he felt sick.  The operator was taken to the hospital via ambulance by an onsite EMT. At the hospital he received an prescription for nausea and was released.  \n\n6.0  Emergency Response Program\nWe at the Decatur plant use several types of safety audits to ensure that our plant runs safely.  Following are some of the different types of audits, inspections and reviews that are conducted: PSM and Non-PSM audits, ISO audits, Corporate and Insurance surveys and audits, Environmental and Industrial Hygiene audits, RC 14001 audits, and supervisor audits.  We conduct pre-engineering safety audits and inspections on new process before any engineering work is done.  During the phase of construction walk-through safety inspections are completed.  Pre-startup safety reviews are done before the process is started.\n\nAscend at Decatur, Alabama is very dedicated in preparation just in case we might have an emergency.  The entire Emergency Response Team receives CPR and First Aid/AED training.  We have approximately 45 firefighters across the 5 shifts that we work.  These firefighters train 48 hours annually at the site on incidents involving flammable liquid fires, interior firefighting, hazardous communications, incident command and others.  Our firefighters receive off-site training at fire schools such as LSU and Texas A&M.  We have two fire trucks on-site.  One fire truck is equipped with foam and another truck is equipped with dry chemical extinguishing agent to supplement"

Cleanup would be handled by the HAZMAT team.\n*  Low level alarm on the tank would be triggered.  The area is also visually inspected at least twice daily. \n*  ACAM sensors are located in the units to alarm operations when the detection of AN is present in the areas.\n\n  Propionitrile (PN) \n\n* ACAM system would alarm due to high PN concentration in the air.  The sump level alarm would trigger.  This alarm can only be turned off at a location next to the tank, so someone would have to notice the release while acknowledging the alarm.  Low level alarm on the PNT Tank would go off. The area is inspected at least twice daily. \n*  Tank dike would contain the material and prevent ground contamination.  Check valves on the discharge side of the transfer pumps would prevent material from flowing back into the tank if the release occurred while loading a railcar. \n*  An operator would stop the flow of material into the tank and immediately contact the site coordinator.  Cleanup would be handled by the HAZMAT team.\n\nThese individual elements of our prevention program work together to prevent accidental chemical releases.

Ascend - Decatur Plant is one of the chemical manufacturing facilities that make up the company.  Staffing at Decatur Plant is currently approximately 327. Ascend employees and approximately 55 permanent resident contractor employees.\n\nBuilt in 1952, the Decatur Plant is situated on a 651.82 acre tract (peninsula), 4 miles west of the City of Decatur, on the Tennessee River (river mile 302).  The peninsula is shared by guest operations.  Linde occupies 4 acres, Calpine 20 acres, Toray 50 acres, Styrolution 21 acres.  Over 300 acres are presently in use by Ascend.  The remainder acreage is the old Acrilan footprint which is currently unutilized.\n\nThe plant was designed to primarily manufacture Acrilan acrylic fiber and various nylon intermediate chemicals for the production of nylon fiber.  In April of 2005, the production of Acrilan permanently ceased at this site.  The bulk chemicals in the production units and tanks were subsequently removed, with completion occurring by the end of the Third Quarter of 2005.  There are two toxic chemicals in our remaining processes that are regulated by EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP) rule.  The RMP regulated chemicals are:\n    \tAcrylonitrile (AN) -- A raw material to make nylon intermediate chemicals.    \nPropionitrile (PN) -- A co-product from manufacture of nylon Intermediate chemicals.\n\nThe main raw material for production of nylon chemicals (i.e., AN) arrives at the plant by barge on the Tennessee River.  AN is fed to an electrohydrodimerization system to produce a mixture of liquid and gas phases.  The"
