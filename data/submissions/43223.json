This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  If such an unforeseeable release does occur, we are completely coordinated with the Salix Fire Department and the Sioux City Hazardous Material Response Team which provides highly trained emergency response personnel to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  We have conducted joint training with the outside agencies and both local hospitals.\n\n\n2.\tThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility\u00bfs primary activities encompass the production of zinc based micro-nutrients for fertilizer and animal feed supplements.  We have one regulated substance present at our facility.  This substance is Ammonia, which is involved in two uses.  Ammonia is used to control the pH and to react with zinc, sulfur, and chlorides to form the zinc amine complex for our products.\n\nThe maximum inventory of Ammonia at our facility is 67690 pounds.\n\n\n3.\tThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-58 Standard, 1967 Edition.  A number of processes at our facility are subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119.
