      "SummaryText": "        Wabash Alloys provides employment for 170 workers in Syracuse, New York.  This facility is one of eight other Aluminum recycling plants in the United States owned by Connell Ltd.  As a manufacturer of aluminum ingots its products are sold globally under its corporate company, Connell, Ltd, 1 International Place, Fort Hill Square, Boston Massachusetts.\nSite Description:\n    The Wabash Alloys facility is located at 6223 Thompson Road, Syracuse, New York.  The site is approximately 20 acres in size.  The site is serviced with electricity, water, natural gas, and sewer lines.  \n    The surrounding vicinity consists generally of residential structures.  \nA 90-ton chlorine tanker car is stationed on the north side of the property.  Access to the property is to the east side with the employee parking lot to the southwest.  The entire site is fenced.\nOperation Description\n    The site process involves the sorting, grading, processing (removing organics via a rotary kiln), melting, and alloying of metals for sale.  As part of the sorting process, large aluminum scrap is shredded or crushed, and ferrous metals are removed using a maseparation process.  A dryer with a secondary combustion unit and baghouse is used to remove impurities from the aluminum scrap such as moisture, paints and resins.\n    The sorted aluminum is charged into one of four furnaces where the metal is melted.  Once melted, various additives are used to modify the composition and hence the physical characteristics of the metal.  The metal is degassed by bubbling nitrogen through the molten metal.   Magnesium is removed by bubbling chlorine through the melt to form magnesium chloride.  Materials kept on-site for the process are aluminum, magnesium, zinc, copper, silicon, sodium, beryllium, and strontium.  Approximately 8,000,000 pounds of these materials are on-site at any given time.\n    Once the molten product is prepared, the melt is either poured and cooled as ingots or sows, or is transferred to heated crucibles fo"

The emissions from the dryer are treated first using a secondary combustion unit, and then with a baghouse.  Emissions from melters, ingot and sow molding processes, and dross cooling operations are controlled using a baghouse.\nChlorine is receives in a 90-ton tanker car via Conrail on the Carrier Spur.  The tanker comes in on the Carrier Spur and must be pulled onto a neighbor's property - Oberdorfer/Citation.  Wabash Alloys has a formal agreement with them.  Delivery is made once every month.      Wabash Maintenance personnel connect the tanker to a transfer station.  Assess to the connection area is by stairs to a platform.  The connection is made by flexible piping.  The tanker is padded with nitrogen continuously during the transfer.\nThe chlorine is transferred from the tanker car through pipes over the driveway going from North to the South side to a vaporizer room.  A new vaporizer was installed in January 1999.  At each particular furnace the chlorine gas passes a shut off valve, then through another flowmeter, and then through a needle valve where its flow is regulated by the furnace operator to the molten metal pump.  Each inlet line has a pressure sensitive valve which automatically closes if pressure on the gas side decreases.  Also, the nitrogen line is automatically opened to purge the line.  Close to the needle valve is the tubing connection that connects to a carbon lance, which feeds the gas to the pump housing.  Here the chlorine reacts with magnesium and aluminum to demag and clean the aluminum alloy.\nOperation - Connecting 90 ton tanker\n    (1)  Receipt of Chlorine\n     Wabash Alloys receives Chlorine by rail.  Wabash personnel complete the connecting of the tanker to the transfer lines.  There is only one person present during transfer.  \nOperation - Filling of Vaporizer\n     (2)   Filling Vaporizer\n    A manual value is opened allowing flow of li"

A 1\" pipe leads to the vaporizer at approximately 50 pounds pressure regulated by an inline regulator.  The flow continues from the vaporizer through a 1\" pipe to the furnaces.  The vaporizer heats the chlorine to the vapor state by a recirculated hot water electric heater, which is thermostatically controlled.  Chlorine gas exits the vaporizer through one main and four regulators from the chlorine control room.  Regulated to 50 psi the chlorine gas travels to the furnaces where the flowrate is controlled.\n  There is a warning light to alert passer-byers that a transfer is in progress is used.\nDuring the transfer the volume is monitored by the amount of weight present.  A gauge in the Office, Building 1 monitors the weight.  The tank car sets on a weight scale.  During transfer, a maintenance person is station at the tanker and in the Office with communication by radio. There are also pressure gauges on the outside of the building that are monitored during the transfer.\n    There are concentration monitors to monitor releases of chlorine in the vaporizer room.\n\nCommunity Description  \n\nGeography and Weather:\nThe city is located in Onondaga County which covers 784 square miles.  The city of Syracuse covers 3,087 square miles.  The terrain is rolling hills and flat plains.  The altitude is between 364 to 681 feet.
