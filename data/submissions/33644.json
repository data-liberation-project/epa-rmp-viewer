      "SummaryText": "The Nash Finch Company ? Lumberton Distribution Center business is food products warehousing and distribution to client grocery stores and distribution centers.  The principal building includes a Perishable Warehouse with an ammonia refrigeration system which contains over 10,000 pounds of ammonia.  The closed ammonia refrigeration system contains a maximum intended inventory of 15,000 pounds.\nThe facility has an active Process Safety Management Program.  Access to the ammonia equipment is restricted to only a select few trained, authorized operating/maintenance personnel.  Most of the service work is done by a service contractor.  The majority of the distribution piping and critical isolation valves which contain ammonia are located outside of the refrigerated spaces, above the roof, and therefore are not susceptible to damage from accidental, inadvertent contact by lift trucks and lifted loads.  However, air cooling units are located within the refrigerated spaces, but so as to minimize susceptibility to inadvertent contact, all equipment and associated piping within those spaces is located as high as possible within the spaces.\n\nA hazard analysis was completed for this facility and worst case and alternative case scenarios were completed.\n\nAn OSHA-proscribed Process Safety Management Program is in place at the Perishable Warehouse.  Under that Program, the major components of the process are inspected frequently.  Operating conditions are constantly monitored by a computerized system with integral alarms that notify process operators of an upset.  The readily distinguished odor of ammonia alerts persons in the constantly inhabited areas where ammonia containing piping and equipment is located that even the slightest release may have occurred.  Shutoff valves which allow operators to isolate sections of piping/equipment from areas of safety, such as the somewhat isolated compressor room area, are installed and are readily accessible.  The compressor room area is w"

      "SummaryText": "ell vented with high volume fans, and is readily accessible in case of a release in that area.\nAs testimony to the overall safety of the ammonia refrigeration at this facility, and the diligence of the process operators, no accidents have occurred within the last five years which have necessitated an off-site or have had any offsite consequences.\nThe Robeson County LEPC is charged with the primary responsibility for emergency response at this location.  Nash Finch ? Lumberton has adopted the INTEGRATED CONTINGENCY PLAN format preferred by EPA and OSHA for preparing and implementing its onsite Emergency Action and Response Plan.  Under this plan, emergency training and practice drills will be frequent and will cover a multitude of potential scenarios.  Three key managers will become involved immediately upon the recognition and characterization of all non-incidental ammonia releases, and their duties will be as follows:  (a) coordination of and direction to onsite and external emergency responders; (b) notification of agencies and on-site safety and security; (c) protection and continuation of business operations and employee welfare; and (d) communication with the public as necessary.  Nash Finch Company continues to investigate and implement changes to the ammonia process in order to improve safety and minimize risks associated with it.  The annual operating budget includes sufficient allocation of fiscal resources to continuously maintain and improve the process and promote the training of operators and supervisory personnel."
