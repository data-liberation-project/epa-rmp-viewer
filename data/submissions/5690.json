      "SummaryText": "The Farmers Coop Elevator (Clonmel) is an agricultural retail business which serves crop producers in the area.  This facility adheres to all local, state, and federal rules and regulations.  In the event of an emergency, the Sedgwick County Fire Dept. will be our first responder.  The Anhydrous Ammonia plant consists of 1- 12,000 gallon tank.  The bulk of our business is selling fertilizer to our crop producers which raise wheat, milo, and beans.  The worst case scenario resulting in a rupture of our largest tank would release 53,000 pounds of NH3 effecting nearly 300 patrons with a distance to endpoint of 2.5 miles.  Our employees are trained on a rotational 2-year basis where they attend a state conducted NH3 school.  They receive classroom training as well as a written test.  Our facility is maintained in accordance with the State of Kansas...Dept. of Agriculture.  Farmers Coop Elevator Company (Clonmel) has never experienced an injury accident in the last five years.  Our EmergencyResponse Plan is shared with the County Fire Dept. each year and they have agreed to assist us in the event of an emergency."
