In 2019 the facility name was officially changed to FXI, Inc.  (FXI, Inc.) owns and operates a polyurethane foam manufacturing facility in Portage, Wisconsin.  FXI, Inc. receives raw materials at its facility, mixes the materials to produce a polyurethane foam bun on a foam production line.  The foam is then cured and stored on site prior to shipping to customers.  Some limited fabrication takes place at the facility.  The polyurethane foam produced by FXI, Inc. is used in many common household products, including seat cushions, bedding and pillows, and many automotive products where soft foam cushions are required.\n\nA.  Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:\nFXI, Inc. is committed to protecting facility personnel, the public, and the environment from any workplace and accidental release hazards. An appropriate response to releases of TDI is in the written Risk Management Program. Safety, environmental, and risk management programs are fully implemented and coordinated with community emergency responders for emergency planning and response. \n\nB. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled:\nFXI, Inc. is a urethane foam manufacturing facility which produces various type of flexible urethane foam products located in Portage, WI. The facility fabricates some of the urethane foam into various finished products.\nFlexible urethane foam is a product made by combining various chemicals that undergo a chemical reaction. The finished product is produced in a variety of colors, thicknesses, and densities.  One of chemicals used is 2, 4-Toluene Diisocyanate (TDI). The TDI is stored in three (3) 12,500-gallon TDI Storage Tanks within the tank storage area and delivered via tanker truck.  The TDI Storage tanks have a combined storage capacity of"

When including this 95% limit, the Maximum TDI on-site is 35,625 gallons (362,306 pounds).  Conservatively, the total amount in CDX is rounded up to 363,000 pounds. \nThe EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) is part of the Clean Air Act and applies to a process storing a specified chemical above a threshold quantity. The chemicals and threshold quantities are specified in Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 68. One such chemical is Toluene 2, 4-Diisocynate (TDI) in excess of 10,000 pounds which is used as an ingredient in the manufacturing process.\nAfter reviewing the facility operations and the RMP regulations, it was determined that the entire facility is considered one process.  Based on the Off Site Consequence Analysis, facility processes and applicable regulations, it was determined that the facility is subject to Program 1 of the RMP regulations.\n\nC.  Accidental Release Prevention and Specific Prevention Steps:\nFXI, Inc.is committed to protecting facility personnel, the public, and the environment from any workplace and accidental release hazards.  An appropriate response to releases of TDI is in the written Risk Management Program. Safety, environmental, and risk management programs are fully implemented and coordinated with community emergency responders for emergency planning and response. \nFXI, Inc.'s specific prevention steps include:\n1. Develop, review and update operating and maintenance procedures for the TDI process.\n2. Provide the appropriate training for TDI process operators, maintenance personnel, and emergency response personnel.\n3. Conduct timely investigations of all incidents involving the TDI process.\n4. Conduct RMP Compliance audits as per RMP regulations.\n\nD. Hazard Assessment: (OCA)\nThe RMP requires FXI, Inc. to evaluate the maximum potentially affected area for accidents involving TDI fo"

      "SummaryText": "r a worst-case release scenario and an alternative scenario.\nThe worst-case release is highly improbable since it involves the combination of a certain set of conditions for a large release of the chemical without any employee intervention.  Because the assumptions required for the worst-case analysis are very conservative, the results likely will be very conservative. The endpoints specified for regulated toxic substances are intended to be protective of the general public. The distance to the endpoint estimated under worst-case conditions should not be considered an area in which the public would likely be in danger; instead, it is intended to provide an estimate of the maximum possible area that might be affected in the unlikely event of catastrophic accident. EPA intends the estimated distances to provide a basis for discussion among the regulated community, emergency responders, and the public, rather a basis for any specific actions.\nA catastrophic release of one 12,500-gallon storage tank of 2,4-toluene diisocyanate (2,4-TDI) into the secondary containment located inside a permanent building has been identified as the worst-case release and was considered in the hazard assessment.  It is assumed the catastrophic release would release the entire contents of the tank. The impact distance from the worst-case scenario has been estimated using EPA's ALOHA Model.  The ALOHA Method estimates a distance to the endpoint of 64 yards for the worse-case release scenario. The impact distance does not extend beyond the facility property line.\n    \nThe alternative scenario is not required due to the worst-case scenario not extending beyond the property line.     \n       \nE.
