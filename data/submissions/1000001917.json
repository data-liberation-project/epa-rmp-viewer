THE FACILITY POLICY\r\n\r\nThe management and employees of farmers co-operative grain association are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. It an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire company, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\r\n\r\n2. FACILITY INFORMATION.\r\n\r\nThe primary activity the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers. Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for crop production.  The maximum quantity stored would be 191,935 pounds.  This would include 261538# in bulk storage, and 61,166# in rolling stock(14 available nurse tanks).  The largest amount handled at one time would be 41,000# in a delivery by truck.  All numbers are calculated from gallons (1-29,931 gallon tank), multiplied by 85%, which is the most you can legally fill a tank, and multiplied by 5.14, which is the pounds per gallon as converted from the specific gravity.  \r\n\r\n3. THE WORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO AND THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO.\r\n\r\nThe worst-case and alternative scenarios have been eleminated from the summary at the request of the EPA.  These corrections were made due to security concerns and new requirements of the Homeland Security Act.  All relevant information is still given to the first responders to insure their safety and assist them in performing their job duties.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4. THE ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM.\r\n\r\nThe facility has implemented the provisions of safety requirements for the storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia, K-61.1, published by the American National Standards Institute, inc., and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia.

THE FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY.\r\n\r\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that:\r\n\r\n-have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor\r\n-to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\r\n\r\n6.  THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM. \r\n\r\n-THE FACILITY HAS:\r\n\r\nA. A written emergency action plan, in accordance with osha standard, \r\nB. Provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).\r\n\r\n7. PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY.\r\n\r\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions. There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for the implementation."
