      "SummaryText": "Indiana American Water Company's Borman Park Water Filtration Plant, located in Gary, Indiana, utilizes chlorine for the purpose of disinfecting and treating potable, drinking water for use by the surrounding communities.  The hazards associated with the chlorination process necessitate certain safety precautions associated with the receipt, storage, handling, and use of this chemical.  Precautions are taken to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to employees, and ultimately to reduce the threat of exposure to nearby members of the community.  A new dry system scrubber has been installed to mitigate/eliminate the possibility of a chemical release into the atmosphere.  In addition, important mandates, associated with the EPA's Risk Management Plans, are adhered to.  A combination of a) proper handling and storage, b) inherent, modern, safety designs of the equipment and the process itself, c) mitigation control via an active dry scrubber system,and d) sufficient training of all appropriate personnel contribute to the overall goal of zero accidents and zero release exposure incidents.\n\n"
