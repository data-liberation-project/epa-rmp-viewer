All applicable procedures of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) prevention programs are adhered to.  Americold Logistics emergency response policies involve the preparation of response plans which are tailored to each facility and to the emergency response services available in the community.  It is in compliance with the EPA emergency response program requirement.\n\nAmericold Logistics operates two refrigeration systems to support a frozen food warehouse and uses ammonia as a refrigerant.  The refrigerant is located in two engine rooms and three frozen food warehouses.  The facility is manned nine hours per day, Monday through Friday.  The other hours through the week are unmanned, but the facility has trouble alarms and ammonia detection alarms monitored 24 hours per day, seven days per week.\n\nThe off-site consequence analysis includes consideration of two release scenarios identified as worst case release and alternative release.\n\nThe first scenario is defined by the EPA, which states, The owner or operator shall assume that the maximum quantity in the largest vessel is released as a gas over ten minutes due to an unspecified failure.\n\nThe second (alternative release) scenario is defined as more likely to occur than the worst case release scenario.\n\nAtmoshperic dispersion modeling has to be performed to determine the distance traveled by the ammonia  before the concentration decreases to the toxic end point of .14 ppm, as selected by the EPA, which is the emergency planning guideline level 3 (ERPG-3).\n\nThis is defined by the American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA) as the maximum airborne concentration below which is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects or symptoms which c"

The residential population within a circle with a radius corresponding to the toxic end point distance has to be defined to estimate the population potentially affected.\n\nThe worst case release scenario involves a failure of a tank which is connected concurrently to 2612 lbs. of ammonia.\n\nThe offsite consequence analysis for this scenario was performed following conditions pre-defined by the EPA, namely, release of the entire amount of gas in ten minutes,  EPA mandated meteorological conditions, namely, stability--F, wind speed--1.5 m/sec, highest daily maximum temperature--98 degrees F, and average humidity--90%.  When atmoshperic dispersion modeling for the worst case scenario was performed using the EPA assumptions, a distance to end point was 0.62 miles and the estimate of the residential population potentially affected is 772.\n\nWhen the same modeling was performed for the alternative release, using a vapor release with a ten minute average of 3000 ppm and consideration of the plume footprint only, a distance to end point was 0.19 miles and estimate of the resdiential population potentially affected is 208.\n\nThe alternative release scenario involves the failure of a pipe at the bottom of an ammonia tank.  The pipe rusted at the threads.  The pipe size was 1.\n\nThe general Americold Logistics Accidental Release Prevention Program is based on the following key elements:\n\nA.     High level of training of the operators.\nB.     Preventive maintenance program.\nC.     Use state-of-the-art process and safety equipment.\nD.     Use of accurate and effective operating procedures, written with the participation of the operators.\nE.     Performance of a hazard review of equipment and procedures.\nF.
