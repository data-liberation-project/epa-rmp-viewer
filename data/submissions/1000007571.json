This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, gas plant trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n \n DESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n \n The Grayson Field Gas Plant, located in Columbia County, Arkansas, operates a variety of processes to produce petroleum products (e.g., natural gas, ethane, propane, butane) from natural gas.  The Grayson Field Gas Plant has several regulated flammables, such as ethane, propane and butane. \n \n GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n \n The following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the plant. The gas plant process is regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) risk management program (RMP) regulation.  This summary addresses the elements of the Grayson Field Gas Plant's accident prevention program and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n \n Process Safety Information\n \n The Grayson Field Gas Plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  Personnel at the gas plant are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.  \n \n Chemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response"

This information is supplemented by documents that specifically any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  For specific process areas, the gas plant has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) in the Grayson Field Gas Plant Operating Procedures Manual. The gas plant ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\n \n The gas plant also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings of equipment. This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n \n Process Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n \n The Grayson Field Gas Plant has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n \n The Grayson Field Gas Plant primarily uses the Checklist analysis technique to perform these evaluations. Checklist analysis, performed by trained and knowledgeable personnel is recognized as an extremely thorough hazard evaluation technique. The analyses are conducted by personnel who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. The PHA personnel identify and evaluate hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mi"

Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned during the PHA process.  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options in response to PHA findings are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n \n To help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the plant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.  Once again, the PHA findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\n \n Operating Procedures\n \n The Grayson Field Gas Plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process.  These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  These procedures are periodically reviewed at least annually to verify completeness and accuracy. \n \n In addition, the Grayson Field Gas Plant Operating Procedures Manual also contains a section pertaining to the consequences of deviation, which provides guidance on how to respond to upper or lower limit exceedances for specific process or equipment parameters.

New employees receive basic training in gas plant operations if they are not already familiar with such operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate (e.g., through oral tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently. In addition, all operators periodically will be re-certified on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This re-certification is conducted at least every 3 years.  All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n \n Maintenance\n \n The Grayson Field Gas Plant has well-established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition.  The basic aspects of this program include: (1) conducting training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting identified deficiencies, and (5) applying quality assurance measures.  In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the integrity of the process.\n \n Maintenance personnel receive training on (1) an overview of the process, (2) safety and health hazards, (3) applicable maintenance procedures, (4) emergency response plans, and (5) applicable safe work practices to hel"
