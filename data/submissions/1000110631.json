The Hazard Assessment was conducted as an initial screening procedure as part of determining into which Program Level (1, 2, or 3) the Burton Creek WWTP. Public receptors are located within the EPA-defined endpoint concentrations of Burton Creek's Worst-Case releases. Therefore, the plant is ineligible for Program 1 and because Texas public utilities are currently excluded from Program 3, Burton Creek is understood to be a RMP Program 2 facility.  \n\nWorst Case Scenarios\nThe Worst Case Scenarios were defined as a ton cylinder (2,000 pounds) of chlorine or sulfur dioxide, each being released by a catastrophic event within 10-minute duration. These scenarios were developed and modeled using the EPA RMP*Comp. The toxic endpoints for both chlorine (0.0087 mg/L) and sulfur dioxide (0.0078 mg/L) were determined to be 1.30 miles.\n\nAlternative Release Scenarios\nThe Alternative Releases Scenarios of chlorine and sulfur dioxide were also modeled using RMP*Comp. Source term estimations of approximately 175 pounds of either chlorine or sulfur dioxide gas released were derived from a scenario of a flexible connection failure. The dispersion model estimated chlorine (0.0087 mg/L) and sulfur dioxide (0.0078 mg/L) endpoints to extend 0.10 miles.\n\n5-Year Accident History\nNo accidents have occurred at the plant involving either onsite or offsite consequences. \n\nDocument Management System\nA Document Management System was established to attribute responsibility for the development, implementation, and maintenance of the Risk Management Program. The Program must be updated every three years, or any time a covered process undergoes a physical or administrative modification.  The Document Management System is largely a function of the Risk Management Program Team, described below.\n\nRisk Man"

The Public Works Director has the ultimate responsibility.\n\nPrevention Program\nThis section is comprised of Safety Information, Hazard Review, Operating Procedures, Training, Maintenance, Incident Investigation, and \tCompliance Audit procedures.  Each has an entire chapter devoted to it in this RMP, and is described in more detail below.\n\nSafety Information\nSafety Information is divided between Chemical Safety Information, and Process Safety Information.  Each is described below:\n\nChemical Safety Information\nComprehensive chemical data is provided in this section to include regulatory reporting and action thresholds, health hazard and chemical exposure limitations, as well as detailed physical properties of each regulated substance. This information was compiled from numerous sources, and is intended to be a one-stop source for the reader seeking data on these substances. The physical data will provide useful information in the inevitable event the plant processes are modified, thereby requiring revisited dense gas dispersion modeling.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nProcess Safety Information was meticulously compiled on each system studied. Specifications on each process are collocated in one place for easy reference. Details such as Maximum Intended Inventory, Safe Upper and Lower Temperatures, Safe Upper and Lower Pressures, and Codes and Standards Used to Design, Build and Operate the Process are provided in this section. \n\n*NOTE* Site is manned 10 hours per day, 7 days a week. Afterhours monitoring and control is accomplished through SCADA.\n\nHazard Review\nA Hazard Review was conducted for each regulated process. The team consisted of plant management and operations personnel knowledgeable in use of the plant\u0092s gas systems and the Hazard Review process. The Hazard Review technique used was a hybrid Hazard and Operability Study (HA"

The Rule under 40 CFR 68.50 requires the City of Bryan to ensure that problems identified are \"resolved in a timely manner.\"  For those items that can not be promptly resolved, it is recommended that a schedule be developed that addresses those issues, with personnel responsibility assigned for each.  \n\nOperating Procedures\nOperating Procedures have been developed for the Burton Creek WWTP. They provide system descriptions, specifications, and operating procedures for the chlorine and sulfur dioxide gas systems. Procedures include Start, Shutdown, Normal, Abnormal, and Emergency Operation. Also included are Troubleshooting Procedures.\n\nTraining \nTraining is required by EPA to be included in the Risk Management Program. A program has been developed with guidelines on how to conduct regular and structured plant training. Training record forms are included with the Program for the required training documentation. Additionally, a training record has been compiled and included for all affected personnel associated with the covered processes.\n\nMaintenance\nA Maintenance Program has been developed with associated documentation forms. Sound preventive maintenance will reduce potential hazards to personnel onsite, and to the off-site public. State and federal regulators will most surely expect to see documentation and recordkeeping associated with the Maintenance Program. \n\nIncident Investigation\nAn Incident Investigation Program has been developed. The EPA has established strict guidelines to follow in the aftermath of any release involving either the chlorine or sulfur dioxide system. The Incident Investigation Program outlines key milestones that must be accomplished as soon as possible, but not later than 48-hours following the incident.
