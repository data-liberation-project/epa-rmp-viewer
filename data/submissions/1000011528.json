The database record may be searched according to:\n\n* Source of the recommendation\t\t\t* Unit or location\n* Target date\t\t\t\t\t* Completion date\n* Status\t\t\t\t\t* Priority\n* Individual or departmental responsibility\n\nChemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe processes at Premcor involve hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation.  The accident prevention program is applied to all RMP-covered processes at Premcor.  Collectively, these activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused"

In addition to the accident prevention program activities, Premcor has safety features on many units to help 1) contain/control a release, 2) quickly detect a release, and 3) reduce the consequences of (mitigate) a release.  The following types of safety features are used in various processes:\n\nRelease Detection\n\n* Hydrocarbon detectors with alarms\n* HF detectors with alarms\n* Hydrogen Sulfide detectors with alarms\n* Personal Hydrogen Sulfide detectors worn while in the refinery\n* LPG alarms\n\nRelease Containment/Control\n\n* Process relief valves that discharge to a flare to capture and incinerate episodic releases\n* Valves to permit isolation of the process (manual or automated)\n* Emergency shutdown system\n* Hydrofluoric acid dump tank\n* Curbing or diking to contain liquid releases\n* Redundant equipment and instrumentation\n* Atmospheric relief devices\n\nRelease Mitigation\n\n* Fire suppression and extinguishing systems\n* Deluge system for Alky Unit\n* Trained emergency response personnel\n* Personal protective equipment\n* Blast-resistant buildings to help protect control systems and personnel\n\nEmergency Response Program Information\n\nPrevention is the best emergency plan.  Refinery operations are always conducted to minimize the chance of encountering emergencies.  When prevention fails, however, preparedness is the key to effective emergency response.  The Memphis Refinery maintains a written emergency response plan to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment.  The plan consists of procedures and guidelines for responding to various emergencies, including release of a hazardous substance, fire or explosion.  The emergency response program addresses the following:\n\n* Implementation of the Incident Command System (ICS)\n* Scope of incident - Level I vs. Level II\n* Level I incidents managed/controlled by the Area or Shift Supervisor. \n* Level II incidents managed/controlled by the refinery General Manager.

The refinery has 24-hour communications ability to notify appropriate emergency response organization in the event of an emergency.   Any public notifications will be coordinated through the Memphis-Shelby County Emergency Management Agency.   \n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nPremcor is committed to a high level of corporate citizenship, placing the highest priority on the safety of persons both within the refinery, and in the neighboring community.  The Memphis Refinery strives to continually improve the safety program, and to reward employees for outstanding safety performance.\n\nValero Energy Corporation has committed to having all their refineries (12 of the 16 domestic refineries are already STAR sites) meet the standards for OSHA's Voluntary Protection Program.  A plan is being formulated at the Memphis Refinery to move the refinery toward this goal.  This plan is supported by the Corporate VPP Coordinator.\n\nNotes on RMP Information\n\nMaximum inventories of RMP flammables in process units were estimated using a conservative technique that yields overstated process inventories.   \n\nThe largest inventory of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) in the refinery is found in the SRU, which was investigated to determine if an amount above the threshold quantity (10,000 lbs) of H2S was present.  It was determined that the amount of H2S in SRU#1, SRU#2, or elsewhere in the refinery did not exceed the threshold quantity of 10,000 lbs for H2S.\n\nNote:   September 2006, Ultra-Low Sulfur Diesel Hydrotreater DHT-18- Startup Submission\n\nRMP regulations require that a RMP update be submitted on or before the startup date of a new process.  Therefore, all data concerning DHT-18 in the September 2006, RMP submission was gathered prior to the startup.  Since the unit has not yet been operated, some of the projected operating"

Duties are subdivided by the type of incident, the incident level, Incident Command positions, and pre-emergency, emergency, and post-emergency duties.\n* Written procedures are included for fire incidents, HAZMAT incidents, Hydrofluoric Acid (HF) incidents, Hydrogen Sulfide incidents, and LPG incidents.  \n* Fire incident procedures include sections for an exchanger fire, a process heater fire, and a pump fire.\n* HF, Hydrogen Sulfide, and LPG response procedures include properties/hazards of the subsurface, essential protective equipment, and first aid measures.\n* Guidelines for HAZMAT incidents, bomb threats, and civil disturbances.\n* Decontamination procedures    \n* Incident communication tools\n* Evacuation plan and procedures to account for employees\n* Emergency alarms\n* Security\n* Emergency phone numbers such as 911, fire, police, ambulance, Coast Guard, hospitals, and doctors\n\nEmployees receive annual training in various elements of safety, PSM and emergency response. The emergency response program is updated whenever necessary due to changes in the refinery processes or refinery facilities.  Any changes in the emergency response program are administered through the Management of Change (MOC) process.\n\nThe overall emergency response program for Premcor is coordinated with the Memphis-Shelby County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  This coordination includes monthly LEPC meetings, which consist of local emergency response officials, local government officials, and industry representatives.  Premcor conducts periodic emergency drills that involve local, state, and federal emergency response organizations, and the refinery provides refresher training to local emergency responders re"
