(Caviness), located southeast of Amarillo, in Randall County, Texas. The facility uses an ammonia refrigeration system for cooling and freezing products throughout the plant, which is identified as the stationary source for the purposes of the Risk Management Plan (RMP). Ammonia is the only substance covered by the Accidental Release Prevention Regulations at this facility. \r\n\r\nThe plant is newly constructed with full operation anticipated for July 2022, so no accident history exists. An accidental release prevention program and emergency response program have been developed and will be implemented in accordance with OSHA and EPA regulations. All OSHA PSM information will be incorporated into this Risk Management Plan. Through these programs, the Caviness team prioritizes preventing accidental releases and will continuously look for ways to improve safety of the ammonia refrigeration system.\r\n\r\nThe prevention program at the plant will include regular inspections and preventative maintenance of all system components, along with operating procedures for startup, normal operation, shutdown and emergency shutdown, inspection and maintenance schedules and identifies responsibilities of key personnel. Other safety features designed into the system include alarms and automatic shutdown devices used to identify and prevent unsafe conditions.\r\n\r\nThe emergency response program will include employee safety training, procedures for evacuation and notification for all types of emergencies, including accidental ammonia releases, and will identify response actions and responsibilities of key personnel. Employee safety training will be conducted both during pre-employment orientation and annually thereafter. Evacuation drills at the plant will be conducted annually. A copy of the plant's emergency response plan and procedures will be provided to the Potter &"
