The NGS is one of three electrical generating stations located throughout the city that are part of the JEA Power Business Unit.  JEA is committed to operating this system and other JEA systems and facilities in a manner that is protective of the health and safety of JEA and Contractor employees, the public, and the environment.  In addition, JEA is committed to operating this and other JEA facilities in full compliance with all applicable Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulatory requirements.\n\nTo ensure that the System is operated in a safe manner and in compliance with applicable EPA regulations relevant to accidental release prevention, JEA has developed this Risk Management Plan (the Plan).  Among the important components of this Plan are JEA's system of policies and procedures for operation and maintenance of the Facility, and JEA's Emergency Response Plan (ERP) for the Facility.  JEA has designated the Results Manager of the Operations Group as the individual with primary responsibility and accountability for seeing that this Plan and its associated components accurately reflect actual conditions and that it is fully implemented.   \n\n\n1.2 STATIONARY SOURCE DESCRIPTION\n\nThe facility generates electrical power for the City of Jacksonville.  JEA operates a boiler condensate chemical injection system (the system) that uses aqueous ammonia (concentration greater than 20%) for control of pH in the boiler condensate water.  Aqueous ammonia is delivered to the Facility via tanker truck and stored in a 6,000-gallon vertical steel tank near the center of the Facility property.  The maximum intended inventory of aqueous ammonia at this location is 35,200 pounds based on an administrative maximum fill volume of 88% of the tank capacity.\n\n\n1.3 WORST CASE AND"

      "SummaryText": " ALTERNATIVE CASE RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nThe worst case release scenario is the 10 minute release of the contents of a full tank, or 35,200 pounds, as required by applicable Risk Management Plan (RMP) regulations. \n\nIn addition to assuming a release of the worst case quantity, the worst case scenario includes other worst case assumptions, such as a low wind speed (1.5 meters per second (m/s)), a highly stable atmosphere (Class F), and the maximum ambient temperature over a three year period (100 degrees F).  Using the EPA lookup tables, these worst case assumptions result in  a distance to the toxic endpoint 0.2 miles from the point of release.  Although this release would migrate off site, there are no residential or environmental receptors within the radius.\n\nA more realistic, alternative release scenario also was examined.  For this scenario, it was assumed that a line leak resulted in a release of 855 pounds of aqueous ammonia over a period of 60 minutes. Using the EPA lookup tables, these alternative case assumptions result in distance to the toxic endpoint less than 0.06 miles from the point of release.  This scenario does not result in an off-site release.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.4 ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe Facility has an aggressive accidental release prevention program that is based upon a foundation of employee awareness and proactive system maintenance.  This program is documented in this integrated Plan.\n\n\n1.5 FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere was one accidental release at the Facility in the five years prior to the date of this Plan that resulted in injuries to Facility employees on site.  On June 14, 2000, ammonia vapors exited the tank vent line during routine filling at a higher than normal flow rate.  Four employees required oxygen and a medical examination.  As a result of that incident, JEA implemented a capital project to replace the tank with a newer design.  The expected construction completion date for the new tank system is July 2001.\n\n\n1.6 EMER"

      "SummaryText": "GENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe Facility has an Emergency Response Plan (ERP) that defines the sequence of actions to be taken by Facility employees in the event of an accidental release of hazardous materials.  This ERP has been communicated to the City of Jacksonville Fire and Rescue Department (JFRD) and the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  The JEA is currently in the process of revising the Facility ERP.  With regard to public notification of a chemical release that has the potential to go off site, the JFRD is presently responsible for determining when evacuation of off-site areas is necessary and for public notification.\n\n\n1.7 PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThis Plan incorporates a number of modifications to Facility procedures designed to improve employee safety awareness, enhance safe operations and maintenance of the aqueous ammonia system, reduce the potential for accidental releases to occur, and increase the speed and effectiveness of the Facility's response should a release occur.  The primary change is replacement of the existing tank system with a newer design."
