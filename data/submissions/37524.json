      "SummaryText": "The Pleasant View Utility District (PVUD) Water Treatment Plant is located in a remote rural setting with minimal residences in the area. Our facility appilies chlorine in the treatment process to disinfect the water.  The feeding apparatus is in good condition with leak detectors in process areas and alarms to minimize any release that may occur.  The staff at PVUD has been trained by our supplier for safe handling and use of chlorine gas.  The Cheatham County Emergency Response Director has been given an onsite tour of our facility and understands our risk management plan.  Continual training is required of all plant operators to insure safety procedures are current and efficient.\nThe management has designed the facility with several safety features to minimize loss if a release does occur.  The facility has chlorine monitors and alarms in the chlorine storage room and the injector room, with self-contained breathing apparatus located outside these areas and available for immediate use.  Also, two emergency showers with eye wash are installed.  We hope to reduce, if not elimated any loss if a release occurs.\nThe worst case scenario modeling was performed using the EPA assumptions and concluded with an endpoint of 1.3 miles with approximately 500 people affected."
