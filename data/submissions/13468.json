Facility Accidental Release Policy\n\nThe owners, management, and employees of Calamco, Port of Stockton Terminal facility (herein referred to as the Facility) at Port Roads 15th and G, Stockton, California, 95203 are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia or aqua ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.  A detailed emergency response plan has been developed and will be implemented in the event of an accidental release.\n\n2.    Facility Information\n\n7 The primary activity at the Facility is the storage and shipment of anhydrous ammonia, and blending, storage and shipping of aqua ammonia.\n \n7 Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for both direct application and for blending into mixed grade fertilizers for crop production nutrients.  In addition, anhydrous ammonia is shipped for use in the refrigeration industry.\n \n7 Anhydrous ammonia is received by ocean-going ship and stored in two above ground tanks at the site.  The maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia handled is 80,000,000 pounds.\n\n7 Anhydrous ammonia destined for refrigeration use is stored in one aboveground pressurized tank.  A second aboveground pressurized tank is used for agricultural grade anhydrous ammonia.  Both these tanks are similar in size, each holding 158,820 pounds of product.\n \n7 Aqua ammonia is blended on-site and stored in one above ground tank at the site.  The maximum quantity of aqua ammonia handled is 4,162,670 pounds.\n\n3.    The Worst-Case Release Scenario and Alternative Release Scenario\n\n    a.  Anhydrous Ammonia Worst-Case and Alternative Release Scenarios  \nThe worst-case release scenario is failure of the largest storage tank.  When filled to ca"

The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 1.6 miles using the EPA modeling program RMP Comp.\n\nThe alternative release scenario is a release from pressurized storage tanks.  Release quantity from this source is 160,000 pounds.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) based on the TFI lookup tables is 1.22 miles.\n\n    b.  Aqua Ammonia Worst-Case and Alternative Release Scenarios  \nThe worst-case scenario is failure of the storage tank.  When filled to the maximum operating capacity this event would release 4,162,670 pounds of aqua ammonia.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 0.9 miles.  The alternative release scenario is based on a release from a hose and associated pipeline during truck filling operations.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 0.1 miles.\n\n\n4.    Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia and Aqua Ammonia: The Facility has implemented the provisions of the \"Safety Requirements for Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc.; California Code of Regulations, Title 8, Subchapter 1, \"Unfired Pressure Vessel Safety Orders\"; and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia.\"\n\n\n5.    Five-year Accident History\n\n7 The following is a list of accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia and aqua ammonia in the past five years that have occurred at the facility:\n \n7 Release 1: October 16, 1995.  Heat exchanger mechanical tube failure caused the release of approximately 800 pounds of anhydrous ammonia to the Stockton Deep Water Channel.  The exchanger was removed from service, repaired, and subsequently returned to service with no further complications.  There were no fatalities, injuries, evacuations, shelter-in-pl"

Internal electrical outage caused a water diversion to the aqua ammonia diversion tanks, and subsequent overfilling of the tanks resulted in estimated 400 gallons of water contaminated with anhydrous ammonia being spilled on the ground (this formed a weak aqua ammonia solution of less than 10% strength).  All of the product remained on Company property and was either pumped back into the system or volatilized to atmosphere.\n\n7 Release 3: May 25, 1998.  A mechanical failure in a heat exchanger associated with the aqua ammonia conversion process caused a release of aqua ammonia to the water return side of the system.  This released approximately 10 pounds of aqua ammonia into the Stockton Deep Water Channel.  There were no fatalities, injuries, evacuations, shelter-in-place requirements, or property damage.  Minor environmental impacts occurred (some fish were reported dead).\n\n\n\n6.    The Emergency Response Program\nThe Facility's emergency response program was written in accordance with the following regulations:\n\n    7    OSHA 29 CFR 1910.38;\n\n    7    OSHA 29 CFR 1910.120; and\n\n    7    Section 25503, Division 6.95 of the California Health and Safety Code\n\n       7    33 CFR Part 127 \n\n7.    Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the Facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  Changes to the systems that occurred as a result of the releases outlined in paragraph 5 included the addition of in-line pH monitoring devices to detect pH imbalances, replacement of older heat exchangers with stainless steel heat exchangers, total replacement of the aqua ammonia conversion process with a system that is completely separated from the Stockton Deep Water Channel.\n\nThere are no additional specific planned changes to the anhydrous ammonia and aqua ammonia processes a"
