              "Description": "Rich Products Corporation - Murfreesboro Facility's ammonia refrigeration system contains equipment to minimize the potential of an ammonia release.  The Facility has in place the following for the ammonia refrigeration system:  preventative maintenance procedures, automatic alarm systems, ammonia detectors and ventilation, process safety information tracking logs, automatic system shutdown capabilities, periodic leak and pressure testing, periodic visual inspections, control valves, refrigeration hand service valves for manual operation, solenoid valves, pressure relief valves, computer generated work orders for maintenance and hot work permits.  The ammonia refrigeration system is run through a programmable logic controller (PLC).  The PLC is used for system monitoring, data trending/logging, and operator set point entry.  System monitoring is provided through a variety of displays that show equipment status, temperature and pressure readings, current operating settings, and various other parameters.  The displays provide the operator with continuous and up to date status of the ammonia refrigeration system.  Please note that setpoints can only be changed by authorized Associates (refrigeration).\n\n\n\nThe Facility's administrative procedures are as follows:  periodic training for Associates, compliance audits, pre-startup safety checks, process hazard analysis to address what-if scenarios and the measures taken to mitigate a release, screening of all contractors performing work on the ammonia refrigeration system per OSHA and USEPA regulations, and management of change procedures.\n\n\n\nCompressors have the following safeguards:  pressure and temperature gauges on suction and discharge piping, high and low temperature alarms and shutdown, high and low pressure alarms and shutdown, high and low oil level alarms and shutdown, high and low oil temperature alarms and shutdown, high and low oil pressure alarms and shutdown, and pressure relief valves.\n\n\n\nThe intercooler and accumulators have the following safeguards:  dual pressure relief valves, high and low level alarms and shutdown, continuous level controller, and liquid level sight glasses.\n\n\n\nEvaporative Condensers have the following safeguards:  dual pressure relief valves, liquid level indicator, water pump startup and shutdown, and high pressure over-ride.\n\n\n\nHigh Pressure Receiver has the following safeguards:  dual pressure relief valves, level column with level indicator and level sight glass, and high and low level alarms and shutdown.\n\n\n\nEvaporators have the following safeguards:  high and low level alarms and shutdown, temperature controls, liquid level alarm and shutdown, liquid level gauge, high and low pressure alarms and shutdown, emergency stop switch, and pressure and temperature gauges on suction and discharge piping.",

The ammonia refrigeration system contains approximately 95,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia which is liquified under pressure.\n\n\n\nRich Products Corporation - Murfreesboro Facility endeavors to eliminate accidents and health hazards to Associates, customers, and the community by having procedures to provide Associates educational training, safe working conditions, and the means to increase awareness of potential dangers.  Rich Products Corporation - Murfreesboro Facility's objective is to prevent unwanted releases of ammonia into locations that could potentially expose Associates and others to serious hazards.  An effective program requires a systematic approach to evaluate the entire ammonia refrigeration system.  Workplace and process safety are major concerns to management and Associates alike.  The prevention and mitigation of unwanted releases of ammonia into locations that could expose Associates and the community to serious hazards is of primary concern.\n\n\n\nRich Products Corporation - Murfreesboro Facility has developed this program in accordance with OSHA Title 29 CFR 1910.119 and USEPA Title 40 CFR 68.  The program is designed to inform all Associates of the hazards of ammonia, procedures for the safe use of ammonia, and the steps taken for the safety of Associates in the event of a release or spill (i.e., emergency response plan, management of change procedures, preventative maintenance program, associate training, etc.).  In addition, Rich Products Corporation has generated the \"Rich Products Corporation Standards for Safety Performance\" which outlines the corporate policy for safety policies, safety procedures, and sample programs to be implemented at each Rich Products Corporation Facility.\n\n\n\nRich Products Corporation - Murfreesboro Facility has not had an accidental release over the last five years.\n\n\n\nThe em"
