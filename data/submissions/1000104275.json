They include, location of the company's Emergency Response Plan, a general site plan indicating the locations of Extraordinarily Hazardous Substances, Material Safety Data Sheets, location of atmospheric monitoring equipment, location of two way radio equipment, location of portable battery powered lanterns, location of emergency event log book, available equipment such as leak kits and heavy machinery and location of first aid kits, training provided to all employees and frequency of emergency response drills.\nThere are employees trained in emergency response.  They have periodic drills and assessments of how to mitigate and stop a chlorine release on site, chlorine release off site, sodium and potassium hydroxide solution spills, sodium hypochlorite solution spills, fires and explosions.\nThe general accidental release prevention program includes routine maintenance checks of equipment, containment vessels and safety measures that are in place.\nThere have been no accidents in the last five years requiring reporting in the five-year accident history.\nWe have commissioned the Brine to Bleach plant (Gaseous chlorine process) which has reduced the throughput of bulk chlorine significantly. \nThis resubmission is due to reverting back to our previous maximum inventory of 999,999 lbs of liquid chlorine. Kuehne temporarily increased the maximum inventory due to the threat of rail strike in late November 2022."
