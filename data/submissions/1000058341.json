Brenntag Great Lakes, LLC is part of Brenntag North America Inc.  Brenntag Great Lakes, LLC is an advanced distribution company providing customers worldwide with products, chemicals and advanced materials.  Our major operations are located in the Midwest and employ approximately 245 people.\n\n\n\nThe Brenntag Great Lakes, LLC (Brenntag) facility, located in Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin, is a chemical distribution facility with an NAICS code of 42469.  Three (3) of the chemicals handled at the facility trigger RMP threshold values.  These chemicals include Toluene Diisocyanate - Mixed Isomers (TDI), Cyclohexylamine, and Ethyl Ether.  The TDI storage process was previously reported to be a Program Level 1 process.  Cyclohexylamine and Ethyl Ether are being reported in this Risk Management Plan submittal as Program Level 2 processes.  A release of Cyclohexylamine has been determined to be the worst-case toxic release scenario.  An alternative release scenario is also included in this submittal for Cyclohexylamine.  A vapor cloud explosion has been determined to be the worst-case flammable liquid release scenario.  An alternative release scenario from a vapor cloud fire is included for Ethyl Ether.\n\n\n\nIt is the worldwide policy of Brenntag to design, blend and distribute its products, and to manage those products throughout their life cycle in a manner that protects the environment and safeguards employees, customers, and the public from unacceptable risk.  This facility participates in the Responsible Distribution Process program of the National Association of Chemical Distributors.

These substances include Toluene Diisocyanate - Mixed Isomers (TDI), Cyclohexylamine and Ethyl Ether.  The TDI is received in tankers and is drummed on site.  TDI is stored in larger storage tanks and is drummed into 250 gallon pressure-rated cylinders.  Cyclohexylamine is received in Isotainers (in-transit) and is drummed into 55 gallon drums and stored on the plant floor or in racks until it can be transported to the Wauwatosa Warehouse facility.  Ethyl Ether is received in 55-gallon drums that are never opened on-site.  They are stored remote from the main building and are redistributed as needed.  TDI, Cyclohexylamine and Ethyl Ether are materials only handled for repackaging and resale to customers and are not used in any processes on site. \n\n\n\n3.    The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe Brenntag facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set forth under 40 CFR Part 68 of the EPA.
