              "Description": "40 CFR Part 68 regulates owners and operators of plants when chemicals stored onsite and used in the process exceed the specified threshold limits (2,500 pounds for chlorine).  The Program 2 Prevention Program is required to include and discuss, for each regulated substance, the following:\nA?    Safety information \n\nA?    Hazard review\n\nA?    Operating procedures\n\nA?    Training\n\nA?    Maintenance\n\nA?    Compliance audit\n\nA?    Incident investigation\n\nThe following sections discuss, in detail, the requirements for the Prevention Program for the chlorine system at the Southwest WTP.\n\nAccording to 40 CFR Part 68 Subpart C, the owner and operator of covered processes is required to compile and maintain up-to-date safety information related to regulated substances as part of the Prevention Program.  This information, related to chlorine, includes the following: \nA?    Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDSs) that meet the requirements of 29 CFR 1910.1200(g)\n\nA?    Maximum intended inventory of the regulated substances\n\nA?    Process information, such as safe upper and lower temperatures, pressures, flows, and compositions\n\nA?    Equipment specifications\n\nA?    Codes and standards used to design, build, and operate the processes\n\nThe owner or operator is also required to ensure that the processes are is designed in compliance with Federal or state regulations, standards, and codes.  This safety information must be updated whenever changes occur in the processes, equipment, or regulations.\nMATERIAL SAFETY DATA SHEETS\nThe MSDS for chlorine is maintained onsite at the Southwest WTP in accordance with state and federal requirements.  Appendix A provides a copy of the MSDS. The MSDS gives information on the toxicity, physical properties, reactivity, corrosivity, and thermal stability of chlorine.  In general, chlorine exhibits three characteristics that are relevant in considering hazards and prevention: (1) toxicity, (2) physical properties, and (3) reactivity.\nToxicity\nChlorine is mainly a respiratory irritant, but also irritates the eyes, skin, and mucous membranes.  Low concentrations (below 1 ppm) are easily detected by smell.  Several hours of exposure to low levels of chlorine (0.5-1.0 ppm) cause mild irritation of the eyes and mucous membranes in the respiratory system.  As duration or concentration increases, an exposed individual may experience throat irritation, coughing, sneezing, and excessive salivation.  Liquid or highly concentrated gas may cause skin burns or blindness.  Concentrations above 5 ppm are so irritating that it is unlikely one would remain in such an exposure for more than a very short time unless trapped or unconscious.  Chlorine produces no cumulative effects and complete recovery usually can be expected to occur gradually following mild, short-term acute exposures.  Exposure to chlorine is both concentration and time dependent.  The following information on the health effects of chlorine was obtained from the Chlorine Institute, Pamphlet 151, page number 12:\nThe detectable odor threshold for chlorine is between 0.2 to 0.3 ppm, with no known acute or chronic effects at less than 0.5 ppm.  The OSHA ceiling level is 1.0 ppm.  \nPhysical Properties\nChlorine is a greenish-yellow gas that is 2.5 times heavier than air.  When unconfined, liquid chlorine vaporizes to gas at approximately a 1:450 ratio (liquid volume to gas volume), creating a large cloud of chlorine gas.  \nIn the absence of a dispersing wind, a cloud of released gas can be expected to concentrate in low-lying areas including sewers, ditches, sumps, pits, and basements.  The area and exposure duration depend upon the quantity released, the rate of release, the height of release, and the weather conditions present at the time.\nReactivity\nChlorine is corrosive and will react with aluminum and tin at ordinary temperatures.  Although it is neither explosive nor flammable, chlorine, like oxygen, is capable of supporting the combustion of certain substances.  It should therefore be stored away from flammable materials and other compressed gases, such as ammonia.  Chlorine may react to cause fire or explosion upon contact with turpentine, ether, ammonia, hydrocarbons, certain metal hydrides, carbides, nitrides, oxides, sulfides, and phosphides.  At 212 degrees Fahrenheit, chlorine is insoluble in water.  Between 49 and 212 degrees Fahrenheit, chlorine dissolved in water forms a weak corrosive mixture of hydrochloric and hypochlorous acids.  Water contamination in chlorine gas systems will facilitate slow corrosion in common metals, such as copper and steel.\nMAXIMUM INTENDED INVENTORY\nInventory of the chlorine kept onsite is a function of the following factors:\nA?    Processing and residual requirements for current water production at the plant (40 MGD) create an average demand of 2,600 pounds per day of chlorine at the Chlorine Expansion dock, and 500 pounds per day at the Chlorine Dioxide Room.\nA?    An annual supply arrangement with the chlorine supplier must be arranged.\nA?    Texas State design criteria for Public Water Systems mandates that water treatment process chemicals be stored onsite in sufficient quantities to meet the expected demands of the plant over a thirty-day period.  Based on the above rate, 38 one-ton cylinders for the Chlorine Expansion dock and 5 one-ton cylinders for the Chlorine Dioxide Room should be stored onsite. \nManagement acknowledged intent when ordering and storing chlorine to achieve the following objectives:  \nA?    To maintain at least a 30-day supply of chlorine onsite at all times. However, TCEQ grants waivers when an agreement with a reliable vendor can be demonstrated.  \n\nA?    To maintain a chemical supply during high demand period that is 1.25 times greater than the supply required by the average demand to prevent interruptions.\n\nSAFE UPPER AND LOWER CHLORINE EQUIPMENT LIMITS\nBecause chlorine confined in a container may exist as a gas, liquid, or both, any consideration of liquid chlorine includes that of gaseous chlorine.  The vapor pressure of chlorine in a container is a function of temperature and is independent of the contained volume of chlorine.  A container having one pound of chlorine will have approximately the same vapor pressure under the same temperature as a container holding 100 pounds of chlorine.  When the temperature increases, so does the pressure.  Increased temperatures may produce pressures that could result in hydrostatic rupture of the container.  Therefore, the industry has placed restrictions on maximum fill volumes and has recommended storage procedures.\nNote:  The temperatures of chlorine containers and gas pipelines should be lower than the temperature of the chlorinator to prevent condensation; if chlorine gas condenses, the chlorine will be reliquified and result in erratic chlorine feeding.\nGenerally accepted upper and lower limits for the operation of a system are included in Table 3-1.\nTable 3-1\nOperating Limits of the Chlorine System\nParameter    Upper   Limit     Lower Limit    Consequence of Exceeding Upper Limit\nTank Temperature    158 F    -20 F    Fuse plug will melt\nSteel Pipe Pressure    150 psig    Vacuum    Pipe failure\nSteel Pipe Temperature    300 F    -20 F    Reaction with chlorine\nPVC Pipe Pressure    6 psig    Vacuum    Inspect vacuum regulator for failure\nPVC Pipe Temperature    130 F    0    Pipe failure\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPROCESS EQUIPMENT\nA list of the various process components is presented in Table 3-2.

The regulatory requirements are designed to protect the public welfare, and the employees.  The industry guidelines provide for consistency and adequacy of equipment, design, and operation.  They are used when more stringent regulatory requirements do not already exist.\nTitle III of the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act (SARA Title III)\nTitle III is the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know section of SARA.  This section was adopted to make the general public more the aware of hazardous chemicals stored in their communities and the emergency response plan to follow should a hazardous chemical release occur.  The USEPA created a list of extremely hazardous substances (EHS), along with the threshold quantities for each.  Sites that contain more than the threshold amounts of an EHS must comply with SARA Title III.  The following are some of the major points that apply to Southwest WTP.\nA?    The site must designate a Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) coordinator.  The LEPC must ensure development of an emergency response plan for the site.\nA?    If a release occurs from an EHS in excess of a defined reportable quantity, the owner/operator must report the release.\nThe Southwest WTP has designated a LEPC and is currently in compliance with SARA Title III.  \nThe Chlorine Institute  \nThe Chlorine Institute is a non-profit organization founded in 1924 to promote the safe storage, handling, and production of chlorine.  The institute publishes guidance documents and pamphlets addressing general and specific application of chlorine, in order to minimize chlorine related accidents.  Recommendations from the Chlorine Institute deal with safe design and maintenance of chlorine facilities.  While the information published by the Chlorine Institute is recommended practices and not regulations, they are industry guidelines that are used throughout industry for the safe use of chlorine.  Some of the Chlorine Institute publications that are relevant to this water treatment facility include:\nA?    The Chlorine Manual  \nA?    Pamphlet #151 A? Training Guide for Distributors and End-Users of Packaged Chlorine\nA?    Pamphlet #155 A? Water and Wastewater Operators Chlorine Handbook\nThe Southwest WTP utilizes the Chlorine Institutes recommended practices for the safe handling, storage, and operation of their chlorine facilities.\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality A? Rules and Regulations for Public Water Systems.\nThe Texas Commission on Environmental Quality is the state agency responsible for the administration of regulations in all the water and wastewater facilities in the State of Texas.  Section 290.42 of the Rules and Regulations for Public Water Systems details the requirements that must be met for water treatment.  Under Subsection E, the following are specific requirements for chlorine facilities.\nA?    A full-face self contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) or supplied air respirator that meets OSHA standards for construction and operation, and a small bottle of fresh ammonia solution (or approved equal) for testing chlorine leaks, shall be provided and accessible outside the chlorinator room when chlorine gas is used.\nA?    Housing for gas chlorination equipment and cylinders of chlorine shall be in separate buildings or separate rooms, with impervious walls or partitions separating all mechanical and electrical equipment from chlorine facilities.  Housing shall be located above ground level as a measure of safety.  Equipment and cylinders may be installed on the outside of buildings when protected from adverse weather conditions and vandals.\nA?    Adequate ventilation, which includes both high-level and floor-level screened vents, shall be provided for all enclosures in which gas chlorine is being stored or fed.  Enclosures containing more than one open 150-pound cylinder of chlorine shall also provide forced air ventilation, which includes screened and louvered floor-level and high level vents, a fan which is located at and draws air in through the top vent and discharges through the floor vent, and a fan switch located outside the enclosure.  Systems may install negative pressure ventilation in lieu of the above as long as the facilities also have gas containment and treatment as prescribed by the current UFC.\nA?    Safety equipment and training programs for all chemicals used in water treatment shall meet applicable standards established by OSHA or the Texas Hazard communication Act, Health and Safety Code, Chapter 502.\nThe Southwest Water Treatment Plant is in compliance with the TCEQ rules and regulations for public water systems.\nInternational Fire Code A? 2006 Edition\nA?    The International Fire Code 2006 edition is the current codes and standards facilities are required to comply with in the City of McAllen. Current facilities are in compliance with these standards.\n\n40 CFR Part 68.52 requires that the owner or operator of a facility prepare written operating procedures.  The purpose of the operating procedures is to provide clear instructions or steps for the safe conduct of operating activities in each process area involving a regulated substance. The owner must have in place written operating procedures that address, as a minimum, the following scenarios:\nA?    Initial Startup: These procedures cover all the steps required for starting the process for the first time.  This scenario includes all steps required to check out equipment as well as to start the process itself.\nA?    Normal Operations: These are the core procedures that are required of operators on a daily basis to safely run the processes.  These procedures cover every day operations and include all the steps operators take to check the process and ensure the equipment is functioning properly.  These procedures can include such functions as connecting and disconnecting containers and might also include safety precautions such as having an emergency respirator available or ensuring that the emergency equipment is functional.\nA?    Temporary Operations: These operations are short-term and occur either when a regular process is down or when additional capacity is needed for a limited period. The procedures should cover pre-startup checks and set points including maximum flow rates, temperature, and pressures of the temporary operations. \nA?    Emergency Shutdowns and Operations: These procedures cover the steps to be taken when the process must be shut down quickly.  The procedures are similar to the normal shutdown procedures, in most cases.\nA?    Normal Shutdown: These procedures should provide all steps needed to stop a process safely.  The procedures should establish the time that should be taken and the checks that must be made before proceeding to the next steps.\nA?    Startup Following an Emergency or Normal Shutdown: These procedures should include all the steps the workers should take to ensure that the process operates safely.  These procedures may be similar to those for Initial Startup; however, these procedures may involve more equipment checks than the Initial Startup Procedures because the system integrity may have become challenged due to the nature of the emergency requiring shutdown.  Startup after an emergency shutdown will generally require more checks to ensure that valves that were closed are open and that they and other equipment are still functioning properly.\nA?    Consequences of Deviations: The operating procedures should tell the operator what happens if the chemical delivery system operates outside of its limits.  For example, if the temperature begins to rise or fall unexpectedly, or the flow rate suddenly drops sharply, the operator must know (1) whether this poses a problem that must be addressed and (2) what steps must be taken to correct or respond to the problem.  \n\nA?    Equipment Inspections: These procedures should include steps for routine inspection of equipment by operators.  These inspections cover the items that operators look for on a daily basis to ensure that the equipment is running safely.  These inspections are not the same as those checks performed by maintenance workers, but rather are the A?eyeballA?, A?soundA?, and A?feelA? tests that experienced operators do, often without realizing it. Operators, vendors, and trade associations can help define the things that should trigger concern.\nThe Southwest WTP is subject to Program 2 requirements in the regulation.  Program 2 operating procedures are not specifically required to address safety systems but must address equipment inspections.\nTo prepare the Operating Procedures, previously prepared procedures were reviewed with operating staff, including the Plant Manager and a representative of the production staff. The Southwest WTP staff, for each operational system, presented actual sequences of their procedures.  Procedures were discussed with the staff to ensure consistent and progressive sequencing of activities for each scenario. The Initial Start-up scenario was used as a base for describing subsequent operational scenarios.\nINITIAL START-UP\nChlorine Delivery\n1.    Operators on-duty monitor usage of chemical during operational rounds every two hours. This information is provided to the Plant Manager and the Working Supervisor and verified through the SCADA system.    \n2.    After the manual switchover of the system to new tanks already on-line the Working Supervisor informs plant management of the need for the chemical and coordinates getting a P.O. number and vendor contact.  The Plant Manager or Working Supervisor contacts the vendor and informs the vendor of the number of container needed, and a date for delivery is established.  The plant management informs plant operations of the delivery date.  \n3.    The vendor arrives (M-F, 8-12 or 1-4) and reports to the office where they contact the Working Supervisor.  The Working Supervisor will look over the manifest to confirm the shipment quantities and assign two operators to escort the vendor to the Expansion Plant Chlorine Storage Area.\n4.    The driver will pull vehicle up adjacent to loading dock, beneath the first crane.  The vendor sets the outrigger on the truck and then gets out and chocks the wheels.  \n5.    The plant operator will inspect tank condition and report any signs of corrosion/leakage/damage to Working Supervisor.\n6.     Serial numbers will be recorded from each container to be removed and delivered prior to loading or off loading any containers.\n7.    The vendor will use the crane on his vehicle to unload the first container from his truck, and place it on the ground, chock the container in place and disconnect the crane. \n8.    One operator will then place the plant crane on the container and guide it while the other operator operates the controls for the crane.  If the crane is not functioning properly, do not attempt to pick up container with the crane, and report the problem to the Working Supervisor.  Using the crane, one operator will guide the container to the deepest empty trunion.  Once in the trunion, the operator guiding the container will disconnect the lifting bar from the container. \n9.    Operators will rotate full container so that the valves are in a vertical position and identification tag is facing upward.\n10.    The operator will then connect the lifting bar to an empty container, and the container will be moved to end of the chlorine train, in the same manner as above.  The vendor then places the empty back on his truck, using the truck crane.  This process is repeated for all the chlorine tanks on the first line, and then the vendor will move his truck into position to take the container off the second line following the same procedures until all containers are delivered to the dock.\n11.    Once all containers are loaded at the Expansion Plant Chlorine Storage area, the two operators will escort the driver to the Chlorine Dioxide Building storage area.  The driver will then set the outrigger and chock the wheels of the vehicle.  The vendor will unload the full containers using the crane on his truck and place it in an empty trunion scale, with the operators helping to guide the container and keep it from rocking.  Once in place the operators will unhook the crane, and place it on an empty container and signal the operator.  The operator will then pick up the tank and place it on the truck.  This process continues until all tanks are delivered.  The Operators will then escort the vendor to the office, and sign the manifest.  The Operators will notify the Chief Operator of the chlorine delivery.\nChlorine Tank Hook-Up for Chlorine System\n1.    Two or more operators will go to the chlorine storage area.  The Operators will move the tanks into the proper place using the crane to position the new container onto the scales.  The Operators will then take the doom caps off the containers and position them so that the two valves are vertical on the tank.\n2.    One operator will inspect and don an SCBA.  The operator will then place a chlorine container wrench on the top valve and turn it clockwise to insure that the valve is closed.  Remove the plug from the chlorine container, and remove the gasket and replace with a new one.  The Operators then verify that the manifold valve is closed and the vacuum regulator tubing is free of kinks, and attached securely to the regulator and manifold valve.\n*If valve is turned counterclockwise it will release chlorine gas into the valve cap. This gas will be released into air once the cap is removed creating a hazard.\n3.    Using the container wrench, open the container valve a quarter turn and immediately close.  One wrench should be left on the valve of each container.  Check the line from the container to the manifold for leaks using an ammonia bottle.  If leaks are found, inform the other operators to stay back, and inform the Working Supervisor of the leak.  Insure the container valve is shut, loosen the fitting to vent to the atmosphere.  Inspect the line to determine the problem, and make necessary repairs if able. One of the operators should report the problem to the Working Supervisor. If a major leak occurs, or the container valve cannot be shut, proceed with the emergency shut down procedures.  Repeat the procedure for each tank on the system.\n*If the system is not properly inspected this could result in a potential leak at a time when no one is present to shut the valve causing an uncontrolled release.\n4.    Open the valves from the manifold to the vacuum regulator.  Open and close the container valve as before, and test for leaks along the line from the manifold to the regulator.  \n \n\nFigure 3-4: Vacuum Regulator for Main Plant Chlorinators\n\n5.    If no leaks, set valve path from manifold to injector that you wish to be operational (if not already in operation).  Check that water pressure is greater than 35 psig and that the vacuum gauge reads approximately 20 inches of mercury.  Open the valves on the tanks by turning the chlorine wrench counter- clockwise 1/2 turn.  Repeat for each tank.  Adjust chlorinators to desired flow rate, and insure that the system is working properly.\n \nFigure 3-5: Chlorinator at Expansion Plant\n\n \nFigure 3-6: Injectors at the Chlorine Main Plant\n\n\nChlorine Tank Hook-up for Chlorine Dioxide System\n1.    Chlorine Tanks for the chlorine dioxide system have the same vacuum regulators that attach to the tanks.  The same procedures shall be followed for hooking up the system as outlined in the previous procedure.  Once you have checked for leaks proceed with Step 5 above.\n \n\nFigure 3-7:  Vacuum Regulators attached to one-ton tanks at ClO2 Main Plant\n\n \n\nFigure 3-8: ClO2 Generator at Main Plant\n\nNORMAL OPERATIONS\nThis scenario presumes the chlorine system is working well as a part of the overall process. Therefore, procedures associated therewith involve ancillary control procedures.\n1.    Operators are responsible for observing chlorine weight readings from active containers in use, confirmation that the vacuum gauge is registering full vacuum, review of the chlorine feed at the chlorinators through the sight glass, review of the chlorine detector lights to determine if the visual indicator identifies a leak. These observations are to be made every 2 hours, 24 hours per day.\n2.    Hourly observations of the chlorine weight readings and the chlorine feed are to be recorded.\n3.    Once the system is operational, there will be both an active and a standby bank of containers hooked to the system.  Operator will check vacuum regulators to determine which containers are empty and close all identified by turning valve clockwise until tight. Empty containers shall be marked empty.\n4.    Should the chlorine detector light begin flashing, production staff is to notify plant maintenance for a battery, power check or leak problem.\n*Failure to check leak detection system may result in a small leak going unnoticed for some time and possible harm to staff.\nTEMPORARY OPERATIONS\nIn cases of maintenance to a line or piece of equipment, the section can be isolated to be worked on while the chlorine is diverted through one of the redundant flow paths.\nEMERGENCY SHUTDOWN\nIn cases of emergency shutdown, plant personnel who respond to alarms, and who have SCBA training should place a SCBA on and close the valves on the containers using the wrench that is kept on the tanks.  Another operator should notify the plant of the emergency and facilitate contacting emergency response personnel. \nEMERGENCY OPERATIONS\nThis scenario relates to the instance following emergency shutdown. For any leak requiring HazMat response, the Plant Superintendent will evaluate the option of shutting down the plant for an extended period of time. In advance of starting up the chlorine system, the local service representative should be called onsite to inspect, repair, and/or replace any equipment exposed to the chlorine leak. Therefore emergency operations consist of verifying equipment safety in advance of start-up.\n\n\nNORMAL SHUTDOWN\nThis scenario is addressed through use of chlorinator feed reduction for short periods of time or through turning off chlorine at the containers for any extended period of time. In those instances where chlorinators have been adjusted to zero, the excess solution line located in the chlorinator room should remain on to continue carrying water from the chlorinators to the plant process water.\nSTART-UP FOLLOWING A NORMAL SHUTDOWN OR AFTER AN EMERGENCY SHUTDOWN\nThis scenario reflects a situation that should follow the steps for an initial start-up. However, if new containers are not required, it involves the operators turning on the vacuum, awaiting a 15 minute evacuation of the lines, and then turning on the top valve on the containers.\nSTART-UP FOLLOWING A MAJOR PROCESS CHANGE THAT REQUIRES A HAZARD REVIEW\nPerformance of a hazard review will generate observations for changes in prevention that may involve new training, equipment, and procedures. Accordingly, management will seek a modification to these areas within the scope of the designed improvement warranting a hazard review. In this way, manufacturer and design representatives will develop a specific plan for the specific major process change as it affects the RMP.\n\n40 CFR Part 68.54 requires that each employee operating a process be trained or tested to ensure competency in the operating procedures discussed in the previous section.  The owner or operator must certify, in writing, that each employee has the required knowledge, skills, and abilities to safely carry out their duties. Refresher training is also required every three years or as necessary.  \nPOLICIES AND PROCEDURES\nThe Southwest WTP requires employee training as a part of their job responsibilities. The assurance and confirmation that each employee undergoes sufficient training for assigned jobs lies with the Safety Officer.  The district has established additional procedures to address the training of onsite contractors and their employees.\n\nPLANT TRAINING RESPONSIBILITIES\nThe Safety Officer is responsible for the day to day operation of the training program for the plant.  These duties include the following:\n\nA?    Developing, reviewing, and updating training courses and materials, if necessary\nA?    Implementing specific job training requirements based on a review of distinct operating job functions\nA?    Selecting the preferred method and the basis for qualifying current operators\nA?    Developing or updating job training matrices to specify and track the conduct of required training\nA?    Identifying current personnel deficiencies in specific skills and knowledge requiring training\nAPPROVALS OR AUTHORIZATIONS FOR TRAINING\nThe Safety Officer has the responsibility for implementing new training programs or certifying operator competence through the provision of training, testing, or grandfathering.  In carrying out these responsibilities, the Safety Officer relies upon the recommendations of Supervisors and Chief Operators regarding specific employees and training decisions.\n\nON THE JOB TRAINING\nAll new water plant operators are given a six month probation period in which to familiarize themselves with the assigned job specifications.  A senior operator or team of operators will mentor and supervise the new employee on all procedures pertinent to the post.  As always, the new operator is encouraged to ask questions or for assistance when in doubt and strongly urged to follow safety rules at all times! \nTEXAS WATER UTILITIES MEMBERSHIP\nYearly membership to the Texas Water Utilities Association provides the water plant operators with a continuing education and with opportunities for professional development.  This membership includes monthly association meetings at a host city every second Tuesday of the month.  Furthermore, TWUA membership furnishes monthly journal by mail.  These journals contain information on job opportunities, exam certification questions, water/wastewater products, upcoming TWUA schools, seminars, and conferences.  Guest speakers at these TWUA meetings supply information on the latest technological advances in operation and maintenance procedures of water/wastewater utilities.  As a result, operators are able to earn credit hours towards renewal of their certification by attending them.\nTEXAS WATERWORKS CERTIFICATION PROGRAM\nTexas state law requires that all personnel operating public water and wastewater facilities receive a certificate of competency.  The certifying agency for both water and wastewater is the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality.  Credit hours toward State certification are given for attendance at Texas Engineering Extension Service approved training courses.  Certifications for water treatment extend from Grade D to Grade A, with Grade A certification representing the highest level of attained training.  Grade D certification requires a basic understanding of disinfection and safety including the following:\nA?    Identification of the steps involved in the procedures for starting up, shutting down, chlorinators and the disinfection system\nA?    Safety features for chlorinators and the disinfection system\nA?    Hazards of chlorine\nA?    Basic reactions of chlorine in water\nA?    First aid for victims of chlorine gas.  \nThe Southwest WTP is required, based on its size, to have at least a Grade C operator onsite during regular operation of the plant. The current staff includes operators at all levels of certification, including Grade C, on each of the shifts. Table 3 6 provides a list of the water treatment divisionA?s employee certification and assignment status.  Appendix B contains information on the TCEQA?s A?need-to-knowA? criteria for the different grades of water operators.\n\n\n\n\nTable 3-6\n\n Southwest Water Plant Operations/Certification\nPersonnel    Title    Certification Grade    Assignment\nPlant Operations\nAguirre, Pedro    Operator    C    North Plant\nAlaniz, Felipe    Journeyman Mechanic    A    North Plant\nBaugus, Steven    Journeyman Mechanic    A    South Plant\nCavazos, Bernabe    Operator    B    South Plant\nCortez, Agustine    Operator    D    South Plant\nDe Leon, Juan    Operator    C    North Plant\nEncina, Angel    Operator    C    North Plant\nFlores, Estevan    Operator    B    South Plant\nFlores, Jesus    Operator    B    South Plant\nGarcia, Ivan    Operator     D    South Plant\nGonzalez, Noe    Operator     C    South Plant\nGuerra, Bernardo    Operator     D    South Plant\nHernandez, Toby    Plant Manager    A    North Plant\nIbarra, Joe D.

On June 20, 1996, the USEPA finalized 40 CFR Part 68, which established the criteria of the Risk Management Plans (RMPs) required under the ARPP.  Sources covered under 40 CFR Part 68 have three (3) years from when the rule was finalized, or until June 1999, to compile data, implement a Risk Management Program and submit the RMP to USEPA.\nThe ARPP is similar to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) Process Safety Management program, which is designed to protect workers from accidental releases of hazardous substances.  40 CFR Part 68 regulates the accidental release of over 100 chemical substances, 77 of which are acutely toxic and 63 of which are flammable gases.  Threshold quantity levels range from 500 pounds to 20,000 pounds.  USEPA estimates that over 100,000 sources are covered by the rule, including chemical manufacturers and wholesalers, certain retailers, potable water treatment systems, wastewater treatment plants, ammonia refrigeration systems, and federal facilities.  \nThe McAllen Public Utility is responsible for developing RMPs for the regulated facilities.  City personnel are required to implement potential changes to facility operations, revise the plan in the future as required, and continue to safely meet its obligation of effectively treating water. \nUSEPA divided facilities into three categories, or Programs, depending on certain criteria.  Program 1 eligibility requires that (1) the process has not had an accidental release of a regulated substance in the previous 5 years that led to an offsite death, injury, or environmental remediation activity; (2) the distance to the toxic endpoint for a worst-case release scenario is less than the distance to a public receptor; and (3) emergency response procedures have been coordinated between t"

Expressway 83.  Water is treated at the plant and subsequently pumped to the distribution network of pipelines, pump stations, and storage tanks.  The plant is in an urban area of town that consists of both commercial and residential development.  The plant site is entirely fenced and has two points of access. \nChlorine Storage Area\nThe treatment plant consists of several buildings, including and administration building with filters, a laboratory, a main pump building, and 2 chemical buildings where chlorine is used.  Aside from the buildings, the plant has clarifiers, flocculation basins, an aerator and clearwells.  The chlorine storage area is located inside an enclosed building with a chlorine neutralizer system.\nThe plant consists of two chlorine storage areas.  The expansion plant dock houses the bulk of the chlorine containers for the plant, with ten (10) one-ton containers on-line and ten (10) one-ton containers in stand-by mode.  Both the chlorine dioxide generation system for the expansion plant and the chlorination system"

      "SummaryText": "s for both the expansion and main plants are connected to the one-ton containers on the expansion plant dock.  The main plant dock is smaller, with one (1) one-ton container on-line and one (1) one-ton container in standby mode, and is used solely for feeding the chlorine dioxide generation system at the main plant.  \nAt the expansion plant dock, chlorine is removed by vacuum with the use of vacuum operated regulators.  The regulators are attached to a vacuum header with individual shutoff valves and plastic tubing. The chlorine is under pressure only inside the ton containers.\nAt the main chlorine dioxide dock, vacuum regulators are directly attached to the main valve on the one-ton containers, eliminating the need for pressure piping.\nChlorine Process Areas\nBetween the containers and the vacuum regulator, the chlorine is under pressure; between the vacuum regulator and the injector, the chlorine is under a vacuum.  Four separate chlorine areas exist at the plant.  Chlorine can take three routes from the expansion dock.  The first route leads to 4 500-ppd chlorinators for the expansion plant. The second route leads to the 2000-ppd chlorinators for the main plant. These chlorinators are located in a completely enclosed room with leak detection.  The third route leads to the two 150-ppd chlorine dioxide generators for the expansion plant.  The chlorinators and chlorine dioxide generators are located in separate completely enclosed rooms with leak detection.  From the main plant chlorine dock, the chlorine is fed into the main chlorine dioxide generator building, where 2 500-ppd chlorine dioxide generators and one 150-ppd chlorine dioxide generators are located.  The chlorine can be injected into numerous feed points in the system, depending on the chlorinator/chlorine dioxide generator being used.  The amount of chlorine fed to each feed point is manually adjusted at the individual chlorinator. \n"
