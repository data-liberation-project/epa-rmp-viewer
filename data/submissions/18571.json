The nearest major intersection is West Main located approximately 2 miles Northwest of the facility.\n\nThe facility recycles by-products from the beef, plultry, and pork processing industries.  In addition the facility recycles by-products from butchers, grocers, and restaurants.  The finished products include tallow, meat and bone meal, and yellow grease.  Finished products are stored in abovegound tanks and silos.  The plant operates 24 hours/day, six days a week from Monday to Saturday.  \n\nOdorous emissions from the processing for the above mentioned by-products are captured, delivered, and treated through a wet scrubbing system at the facility.  The system uses chlorine as an oxidant to destroy the organics that are odor producing."
