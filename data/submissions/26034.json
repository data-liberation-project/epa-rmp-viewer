ACCESS TO THE SITE IS RESTRICTED TO AUTHORIZED FACILITY EMPLOYEES, AUTHORIZED MANAGEMENT PERSONEL AND AUTHORIZED CONTRACTORS.\n\n      THE MAXIMUM QUANTITY OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA THAT CAN BE STORED WOULD  BE 224,000 \n      POUNDS. THIS INCLUDES ANHYDROUS AMMONIA THAT COULD BE STORED IN NURSE TANKS.\n\n3.   THE WORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO AND THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO.\n\n      THE WORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO WOULD BE THE RELEASE OF THE TOTAL CONTENTS OF A\n      STORAGE TANK RELEASED AS A GAS OVER 10 MINUTES.  THE MAXIMUM QUANTITY RELEASED\n      WOULD BE 52,000 POUNDS, WHICH REPRESENTS THE VOLUME OF THE LARGEST STORAGE TANK\n      AS LIMITED BY DESIGN STANDARDS.\n\n      THE DISTANCE TO THE ENDPOINT OF .14 MG/L FOR THE WORST-CASE SCENARIO IS 2.30 MILES.\n\n      THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO BASED ON THE MOST LIKELY POTENTIAL INCIDENT IS A \n      RELEASE FROM A BREAK IN A TRANSFER HOSE.
