Therefore Columbia River Processing has established the Risk Management Plan to set policy and give direction to managers, operators, and employees at this facility.\n\nScope and Application: This Plan applies to all ammonia refrigeration units, lines, tanks, and compressors throughout this facility.\n\nEmployee Participation: The Risk Management Plan is the responsibility of everyone at Columbia River Processing. Consequently, managers and employees are jointly responsible to ensure the effectiveness of the plan. Maintenance staff and the appointed RMP Manager will consult with affected employees on a regular basis regarding conduct and development of Process Hazard Analysis (PHA\u00bfs) and in the development of any program element.  \n \nColumbia River Processing Risk Management Plan\n\nProduction of superior dairy products requires the use of some chemicals that could pose a risk to both employees and the public if handled improperly, spilled, or released.  Columbia River Processing recognizes the duty to protect the safety and health of employees, the community, and our customers.  Therefore Columbia River Processing has developed and implemented, a Risk Management Plan for anhydrous ammonia.  The purpose of this plan is to keep safe operation a company priority through establishing policy, identifying risks, documenting maintenance, and tracking compliance with established standards.\n\nThis plan is a living collaborative effort developed by employees, maintenance staff, and management. The Corporate Safety Manager and Engineering Manager are the plan managers and will consult with employees on a regular basis regarding conduct and development of Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) and plan modification.\n\nColumbia River Processing produces natural"

      "SummaryText": "cheddar cheeses, which are stored for a time period, which requires precise temperature control and extensive refrigeration.  As is common in the industry, this facility uses an anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system in all cheese storage areas.  Approximately 12,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia is contained in the refrigeration system.  Another 3000 pounds is used in the cheese making process.  It is the intent of the Risk Management Plan to identify and prepare for a worst-case release of anhydrous ammonia.  This plan applies to all ammonia refrigeration units, lines, tanks, and compressors located throughout this facility.\n\nThe worst-case scenario identified in the Risk Management plan is the catastrophic loss of 12,000 pounds of ammonia within 10 minutes.  Such a release will have off-sight consequences that will require notification, and potential evacuation of near by facilities.  Anhydrous ammonia is a colorless gas or liquid with a readily detectable odor at 0.7 ppm.  Ammonia gas is a severe irritant to the eyes, Skin, and respiratory tract.  Exposure to concentrations of 2,500 to 6,500 ppm, which could occur in a worst-case scenario, can cause corneal irritation, shortness of breath, bronchospasms, chest pains, and pulmonary edema, which may be fatal.  Contained in the plan are procedures to mitigate the off-sight consequences and procedures to implement resident notification.\n\nAn alternate more likely scenario identified in the Risk Management Plan is the release of 1 to 5 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.  A release of this size still presents a risk to employees.  However, such a release does not have the off-sight consequences identified in the worst-case scenario, and will not require notification or evacuation of nearby residences or facilities.  Maintenance policy and training have been developed to facilitate immediate resolution of any ammonia leak, before it can develop into a worst-case scenario. Within the plan are procedures to evacuate employees whi"

      "SummaryText": "le repairing the leak.\n\nThe Risk Management Plan also outlines a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) program.  This program identifies each component of the ammonia refrigeration system and evaluates the potential ammonia release risk.  An important item of the PHA program is a \u00bfwhat if analysis\u00bf of each component.  The intent of the \u00bfwhat if analysis\u00bf is to identify ways in which ammonia could be released, and develop a response to minimize the magnitude of the release.\n\nDevelopment of a Risk Management Plan is a proactive effort by Columbia River Processing to protect both the employee, and the community from future releases of ammonia.  While small releases of ammonia do occur, there has not been a release of a reportable amount of ammonia at this facility.\n\nAnother important aspect of the Risk Management Plan is the Emergency Response Program.  This program is a written action plan outlining the response to any release of ammonia from the refrigeration system. Key issues outlined in this plan include escape routes, decontamination procedures, medical duties, post evacuation procedures, and reporting requirements.\n\nThe Risk Management Plan developed by Columbia River Processing is a dynamic document.  This plan is updated annually, or whenever any component of the ammonia system changes.  This facility is committed to reducing the likelihood of an ammonia release.  To improve process safety, and protect employees, improvements to the ammonia refrigeration system will be identified and implemented.\n \nWorst Case Scenario \nColumbia River Processing currently uses ammonia as its main refrigerant.  In the event of a major ammonia catastrophe all ammonia could be lost.  Approximately 12,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia would be released into the plant and surrounding areas.\n\nDependant upon the time of the year, the wind could blow the ammonia in either the northeast or easterly directions.  The wind speed could range from 5mph to 60mph, again dependant upon the time of the ye"

Most often, the leak will quickly be isolated and taken care of by a trained member of the maintenance staff.  However, if the leak occurs within a highly populated working area, employees in that area would be evacuated.\n\nIf the ammonia leak occurs within a work area of low population, the leak would be isolated and vented into the atmosphere.  Employees would not have to be evacuated from their stations and production could continue as normal.\n\nMaintenance mechanics are continuously on sight and would be notified of the leak immediately, thus greatly reducing the chances of a minor incident turning into a major incident."
