Ave. & CoRd. 15 S.W.\nMontevideo, Minnesota 56265\n\nThe board of directors, management, and employees of Farmers Union Oil Company are committed to the prevention of any accidential releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidential release should occur,  the facility is prepared to work with the Montevideo Fire Department, or other authorities, to minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.  \n\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage of anhydrous ammonia and loading nurse tanks for delivery \nto the farm for application. \n\nAnhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application for crop nutrients.\n\nThe maximum quantity stored would be 247,200 lbs. in one 18,000 and one 30,000 gallon  tank.  The maximun quantity handled would be the unloading of a transport truck vessel containing 53,000 pounds.\n\nThe worst case scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank release over ten minutes.  The maximum quantity would be 131325 pounds representing 85 percent of the largest tank  capacity, as limited by design standards.   \n\nThe alternate release scenario based on a two minute release is a release from a break in a three inch transfer hose.  The distance to the endpoint in this case would be .81 miles.\n\nThe facility has implemented the provissions of \"Safety Requirements for the Starage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc. and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA),29 CFR 1910.111, \"Starage and handling of anhydrous ammonia\".\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of Anhydrous Ammonia in the past five years at this site.\n\nFarmers Union Oil Company  has a written action plan, in accordance with OSHA Standard"

The company has several employees on the local fire department which makes the information and fire drill practices at this site happen more often."
