We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public as well as protection of the environment.  This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including:\n\n *  A description of our facility and use of substances regulated by EPA's RMP regulation\n *  A summary of results from our assessment of the potential offsite consequences from accidental chemical releases\n *  An overview of our accidental release prevention programs\n *  A five-year accident history for accidental releases of chemicals regulated by EPA's RMP rule\n *  An overview of our emergency response program\n *  An overview of planned improvements at the facility to help prevent accidental chemical releases from occurring and adversely affecting our employees, the public, and the environment\n *  The certifications that EPA's RMP rule requires us to provide\n *  The detailed information (called data elements) about our risk management program\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nOur facility takes propane off the Cochin Pipeline, operated by Dome Pipeline Corporation, and stores it in 90,000 gallon above ground bullets.  Ethyl mercaptan, an odorant, is also stored at the terminal and is injected into the propane stream to odorize the propane prior to truck loading.  The facility is completely automated and is available for around the clock loading by trained, qualified drivers.  The facility is equipped with hand scan devices so only qualified drivers can gain access to the terminal and loading operations.  In our processes, we use the following chemica"
