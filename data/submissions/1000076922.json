An RMP comprises several elements, including an evaluation of potential accident scenarios and a comprehensive program to prevent accidental releases of regulated chemicals. \r\n\r\nThe RMP summarizes the management, administrative, procedural, and technological controls that the facility uses in combination to minimize the risk of hazardous chemical releases to the surrounding community.  The RMP includes the following information:\r\n\r\n- Introduction;\r\n- Facility identification, regulated substances, and covered processes;\r\n- Policies to protect health, environment, and safety;\r\n- Hazard Assessment;\r\n- Prevention Program;\r\n- Five-Year Accident History;\r\n- Emergency Response Plan; and\r\n- Planned Changes to improve safety\r\n\r\nKinder Morgan Liquids Terminals (KMLT) submitted an update of the RMP for KMLT's Argo Illinois Terminal on June 26, 2006 for removal of Tank C-11 from cyclohexylamine storage service at the Argo Terminal.  On November 4, 2009, KMLT submitted an update of the RMP for addition of Tank W-1 for ethylenediamine storage service at the Argo Terminal. The 2012 update is for the removal of ethylenediamine storage service at the Argo Terminal, effective December 2011. The 2015 update includes the addition of the Butane Blending process. In 2019, KMLT completed a resubmission to update the information on file for both processes.\r\n\r\nThe Argo Terminal stores vinyl acetate, a regulated toxic material under the RMP Program with a threshold quantity of 15,000 pounds, and Butane, a flammable gas under the RMP Program with a threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds.\r\n\r\nKinder Morgan Liquids Terminals, LLC (KMLT) - Argo Terminal is a bulk petroleum storage and distribution facility that includes butane blending and vinyl acetate monomer handling operations."

      "SummaryText": "This Risk Management Plan (RMP) covers the Butane Blending Process and the Vinyl Acetate Monomer Storage and Distribution Process. KMLT owns the Vinyl Acetate Monomer Process and the real property associated with the Butane Blending Process.  Energy Transfer owns all the equipment associated with the Butane Blending Process.  Energy Transfer and KMLT each have operational responsibilities for the Butane Blending System.   Energy Transfer controls and monitors all butane blending operations remotely from its control center located near Houston, Texas, conducts all maintenance activities, and schedules the delivery of butane trucks.  KMLT oversees the unloading of butane trucks into both storage vessels and conducts routine visual inspections.\r\n\r\nThe Butane Blending System was constructed in accordance with the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA Code) No. 58 (2011 Edition) for Liquefied Petroleum Gas Storage.  Energy Transfer designed, constructed, and maintains the Butane Blending System, in accordance with NFPA No. 58 and the manufacturer's instructions and recommendations.\r\n\r\nIt is the Parties' policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws/codes.  If an emergency were to occur, it is the Parties' policy to notify the City of Bedford Park Fire Department as well as the Illinois Department of Emergency Management.  Medical emergencies will require notification of the local Emergency Management Services (911).\r\n\r\nThe Parties comply with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's EPA) Accident Prevention Rules (40 CFR Part 68 Subpart D), the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard and associated 14 elements (29 CFR Part 1910.119), and all applicable state and local laws and regulations.

The facility emergency response plans are coordinated with the local fire department.  The City of Bedford Park Fire Department personnel have participated in the initial RMP/PSM training session for this system.\r\n\r\nProcess safety controls include excess flow valves, low-melting point pneumatic valve feeds to pneumatic valves (fail closed), 85% fill shut-off (80% alarm and 90% ESD actuation) on the vessels, emergency shut-off devices on the system and video display terminal, line thermal/hydrostatic reliefs, and grounding interlock devices.  Additional vessel protection includes an intumescent coating.  Note: In contrast to the PSM requirements, this stationary source as defined under 40 CFR Part 68 is bounded by the off-load station and the points of injection. \r\n\r\nThe Parties actively seek employee input on process safety improvements.  Additionally, the City of Bedford Park Fire Department is contacted regarding participation in site emergency response drills. Additional actions include consolidating separate system inspection checklists for ease of completion.\r\nFacility Identification and Regulated Substances\r\n\r\nThe KMLT Argo Terminal is a public for-hire bulk liquid storage terminal, approximately 145 acres in area and located approximately 15 miles southwest of the Chicago, Illinois.  GATX Terminals Corporation owned and operated the Argo Terminal from 1951 until it was acquired by KMLT in March 2001.  The terminal is bounded by the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal to the west, Corn Products Corporation to the north, Archer Avenue to the east, and the Shell Oil Terminal and the Univar Distribution Facility to the south.  Bedford Park Fire Station Number 1 is located at the entrance to the Argo Terminal.  The terminal provides tank storage for liquid chemicals, petroleum, food grade products, and raw materia"

Presently approximately 215 permitted aboveground storage tanks are available (approximately 111,000,000 gallon capacity) for storage and distribution of customer products or for support activities.  Materials are received at the terminal by tank trucks, rail cars, barge, and pipeline.   \r\n\r\nOf the permitted aboveground storage tanks, one tank, Tank 5-15 (for storage of vinyl acetate) is covered by the RMP regulation. Tank 5-15 has a total capacity of 215,000 gallons, but is restricted to a maximum working volume of 137,347 gallons to limit air emissions.\r\n\r\nPolicies to Protect Health, Safety and the Environment\r\n\r\nRisk management and safety are important concerns at the Argo Terminal.  This RMP formalizes and documents these activities.  The facility is committed to conducting its operations in a safe and responsible manner and to reducing risks to human health and the environment. KMLT Argo Terminal reviews its safety and operating procedures annually to ensure accurate information is presented therein.\r\n\r\nPrevention Program \r\n\r\nAn Accidental Release Prevention Program is in place to minimize the risk of hazardous chemical releases in accordance with the EPA Risk Management Program requirements (40 CFR 68). This prevention program covers those processes that handle regulated substances above the threshold amount.  The prevention program provides a structured approach to preventing accidents. Some of the specific activities in the prevention program include:\r\n\r\n- Keeping process safety information accessible at all times.\r\n- Conducting a hazard review as part of the preparations for RMP compliance.\r\n- Using written operating procedures to train and guide operators.\r\n- Providing training to all employees that operate the system.\r\n- Operating a program to properly maintain the system and equipment.\r\n- Investigating incidents and taking actions as part of a continuous improvement effort.\r\n- Conducting routine audits to ensure that safe pract"

The facility also has implemented a maintenance program to monitor the physical condition of process equipment, and replace or repair equipment before it fails.\r\n\r\nIn the unlikely event of a spill or release involving a hazardous material, the Argo Terminal has developed an emergency response plan providing procedures to be followed to minimize the potential impacts of a fire at the facility. In the event of a release, the facility calls the Bedford Park Fire Department located at the facility boundary.\r\n\r\nFive-Year Accident History\r\n\r\nFor the 2015 RMP update, KMLT reported that no accidents had occurred during the previous five years. No accidents have occurred since the prior update was submitted.\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Plan\r\n\r\nThe RMP regulations require that response actions have been coordinated with local emergency planning and response agencies (40 CFR 68.12(b)(3)).
