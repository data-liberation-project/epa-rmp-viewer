An RMP comprises several elements, including an evaluation of potential accident scenarios and a comprehensive program to prevent accidental releases of regulated chemicals. \n\n\n\nThe RMP summarizes the management, administrative, procedural, and technological controls that the facility uses in combination to minimize the risk of hazardous chemical releases to the surrounding community.  The RMP includes the following information:\n\n\n\n- Introduction;\n\n- Facility identification, regulated substances, and covered processes;\n\n- Policies to protect health, environment, and safety;\n\n- Hazard Assessment;\n\n- Prevention Program;\n\n- Five-Year Accident History;\n\n- Emergency Response Plan; and\n\n- Planned Changes to improve safety\n\n\n\nKinder Morgan Liquids Terminals (KMLT) submitted an update of the RMP for KMLT's Argo Illinois Terminal on June 26, 2006 for removal of Tank C-11 from cyclohexylamine storage service at the Argo Terminal.  On November 4, 2009, KMLT submitted an update of the RMP for addition of Tank W-1 for ethylenediamine storage service at the Argo Terminal. The 2012 update is for the removal of ethylenediamine storage service at the Argo Terminal, effective December 2011. The 2015 update includes the addition of the Butane Blending process. In 2019, KMLT completed a resubmission to update the information on file for both processes.\n\n\n\nThe Argo Terminal stores vinyl acetate, a regulated toxic material under the RMP Program with a threshold quantity of 15,000 pounds, and Butane, a flammable gas under the RMP Program with a threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds.\n\n\n\nKinder Morgan Liquids Terminals, LLC (KMLT) - Argo Terminal is a bulk petroleum storage and distribution facility that includes butane blending and vinyl acetate monomer handling operations.

KMLT owns the Vinyl Acetate Monomer Process and the real property associated with the Butane Blending Process.  Energy Transfer owns all the equipment associated with the Butane Blending Process.  Energy Transfer and KMLT each have operational responsibilities for the Butane Blending System.   Energy Transfer controls and monitors all butane blending operations remotely from its control center located near Houston, Texas, conducts all maintenance activities, and schedules the delivery of butane trucks.  KMLT oversees the unloading of butane trucks into both storage vessels and conducts routine visual inspections.\n\n\n\nThe Butane Blending System was constructed in accordance with the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA Code) No. 58 (2011 Edition) for Liquefied Petroleum Gas Storage.  Energy Transfer designed, constructed, and maintains the Butane Blending System, in accordance with NFPA No. 58 and the manufacturer's instructions and recommendations.\n\n\n\nIt is the Parties' policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws/codes.  If an emergency were to occur, it is the Parties' policy to notify the City of Bedford Park Fire Department as well as the Illinois Department of Emergency Management.  Medical emergencies will require notification of the local Emergency Management Services (911).\n\n\n\nThe Parties comply with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's EPA) Accident Prevention Rules (40 CFR Part 68 Subpart D), the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard and associated 14 elements (29 CFR Part 1910.119), and all applicable state and local laws and regulations.

The terminal is bounded by the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal to the west, Corn Products Corporation to the north, Archer Avenue to the east, and the Shell Oil Terminal and the Univar Distribution Facility to the south.  Bedford Park Fire Station Number 1 is located at the entrance to the Argo Terminal.  The terminal provides tank storage for liquid chemicals, petroleum, food grade products, and raw materia"

This RMP formalizes and documents these activities.  The facility is committed to conducting its operations in a safe and responsible manner and to reducing risks to human health and the environment. KMLT Argo Terminal reviews its safety and operating procedures annually to ensure accurate information is presented therein.\n\n\n\nPrevention Program \n\n\n\nAn Accidental Release Prevention Program is in place to minimize the risk of hazardous chemical releases in accordance with the EPA Risk Management Program requirements (40 CFR 68). This prevention program covers those processes that handle regulated substances above the threshold amount.  The prevention program provides a structured approach to preventing accidents. Some of the specific activities in the prevention program include:\n\n\n\n- Keeping process safety information accessible at all times.\n\n- Conducting a hazard review as part of the preparations for RMP compliance.\n\n- Using written operating procedures to train and guide operators.\n\n- Providing training to all employees that operate the system.\n\n- Operating a program to properly maintain the system and equipment.\n\n- Investigating incidents and taking actions as part of a continuous improvement effort.\n\n- Conducting routine audits to ensure that safe pract"
