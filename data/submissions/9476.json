Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nThe CITY of BAY CITY is strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program in place that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our Wastewater Reclaimation Plant.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, we are coordinated with BAY CITY FIRE DEPARTMENT and Matagorda County LEPC which provides emergency response personnel to control and mitigate the effects of the release.\n\n\n2.   The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities encompass WASTEWATER TREATMENT.  We have 2 regulated substances present at our facility.  These substances include Chlorine and Sulfur Dioxide.   Chlorine is used for Disinfection and Sulfur Dioxide is used for Dechlorination before discharging processed water.\n\nThe maximum inventory of Chlorine at our facility is 8000.00 lbs.\nThe maximum inventory of Sulfur Dioxide at our facility is 8000.00 lbs.\n\n3.   The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release \nScenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario.  To perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used the look-up tables and equations provided by the EPA in the RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance.  \nThe following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from DISINFECTION or DECHLORINATION.

Under worst case weather conditions, namely Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s windspeed, the maximum distance of 1.3 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.0087 mg/L.\n\nOne alternative release scenario has been submitted for each toxic substance present.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for Chlorine involves a release from CHLORINE BAY in the DISINFECTION process.  The scenario involves the release of 370 lb. of Chlorine in a gaseous form over 10 minutes.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.0087 mg/L is 0.1 miles.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for Sulfur Dioxide involves a release from SULFUR DIOXIDE BAY in the DECHLORINATION process.  The scenario involves the release of 180 lb. of SulfurDioxide in a gaseous form over 10 minutes.  Passive mitigation controls such as drains are taken into account to calculate the scenario.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.0078 mg/L is 0.1 miles.\n\n4.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of our release prevention program that are in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nCITY of BAY CITY maintains a detailed record of written safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes \nare identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses is   (what if list).  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in wastewater treatment and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of (6 months).    Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.  Our personnel also attend local and state utility operat"
