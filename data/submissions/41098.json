We are committed to responsible chemical processing and handling.  As an example of our commitment, the plant and the Paper, Allied-Chemical & Energy Workers Union, Local 6-0591 have joined together to implement the Triangle of Prevention (TOP) Program to further enhance safety, health, and protection of the environment.\n\nArkema Inc. takes pride in our commitment to protect the environment.  We are dedicated to continuous reduction of waste, and have a comprehensive program called AWARE (Arkema Waste And Release Elimination) designed to promote recycling and waste minimization.  We have substantially reduced waste and emissions in recent years.\n\nArkema Inc. also participates in the American Chemistry Council Responsible Care initiative.  Through Responsible Care, our company and industry demonstrate its continuing commitment to health, safety, and the environment.\n\n\nFACILITY IDENTIFICATION AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES IN COVERED PROCESSES\n\nThe Arkema Inc. Riverview Plant is located at 17168 West Jefferson Avenue, Riverview, Michigan.  The facility manufactures industrial chemicals, primarily amines and acids.  Our products are used to produce a wide variety of products including photographic products, pharmaceuticals, electronics, cosmetics, paints, cleaners, tires, water treatment products, and agricultural chemicals.  \n\nCertain substances used and produced within the facility are regulated under 40 CFR Part 68, the EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) Rule.  \n\nAmmonia, chlorine, dimethylamine, ethylene oxide, ethyl mercaptan, furan, isopropylamine, methylamine, and methyl mercaptan, are used as process feedstocks.  Monoethylamine is produced at the facility and is also used as a process feedstock.  These substances are present at or above the minimum threshold for RMP applicability.\n\nPropylene oxide is no longer used or stored at the Arkema Inc. Riv"

Therefore all references to propylene oxide have been deleted from the Risk Management Plan.\n\n   \nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nArkema Inc. has a prevention program in place to minimize the risk of hazardous chemical releases in accordance with the Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (29 CFR 1910. 119) and the EPA Risk Management Program.  This prevention program covers those processes that handle covered chemicals above the threshold quantity of either the PSM or RMP rules.\n\nThe prevention program provides a structured approach to preventing accidents.  Some of the specific activities in the prevention program include:\n\n -In-depth process hazard analyses are completed at least every five years by qualified personnel using techniques approved     under the OSHA PSM standards;\n\n -Written operating procedures are used for training and directing the work of operators, who receive refresher training every three  years;\n\n -Operators, mechanics, and contractor personnel are qualified, trained in the general hazards in the facility, and informed of any temporary situations affecting safety;\n\n -A safety work permit system assures that work is done safely and properly;\n\n -A management system is in place to ensure that changes are managed safely;\n\n -Critical equipment, including instruments, is inspected on a planned, periodic basis to assure proper operating conditions;\n\n -Pre-startup reviews are done to ensure that conditions for safe operation have been satisfied prior to starting new or modified equipment;\n\n -Incidents, including near-misses, are investigated and actions are taken as part of a continuous improvement effort; \n\n -Routine audits are conducted to assure that safe practices are being followed;\n\n -Periodic process walk-through inspections are conducted by supervisors; and\n\n -Routine safety meetings are held where managers and hourly participate.\n\nThis systematic approach t"

The training, qualifications, and safety awareness of our operations, maintenance, and emergency response personnel are a key element in reducing and mitigating accidents.\n\n\nCHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS:  Worst-Case Scenarios\n\nMeasures that would prevent worst-case scenarios for chlorine and dimethylamine include:\n\n -The tanks are pressure vessels which are designed and constructed in accordance with industry pressure vessel standards using industry-standard materials of construction;\n\n -As part of the Mechanical Integrity program, and per DOT requirements pressure vessels are periodically inspected and tested;\n\n -The risk of over-pressure is addressed by a system of pressure relief valves installed on the vessels;\n\n -Access to the facility is restricted through security barriers and trained security personnel, thereby minimizing the risk to the tanks of vehicular damage or sabotage;\n\n - Fire hazards are controlled through procedures, training, and the hot work permit system; and\n\n -Continuous observation is required during the unloading of any toxic gas (chlorine) per DOT requirements. \n\n\nCHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS:  Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nPrevention measures for the alternative scenarios selected for anhydrous ammonia, chlorine, dimethylamine, furan, and methyl mercaptan include:\n\n -Railcar and tank truck stops (or wheel chocks) to prevent movement of a railcar or tank truck;\n\n -Signage that indicates railcar unloading;\n\n -Careful control of the switching of railcars, including proper training and procedures that prohibit hooking up to a car that is still connected;\n\n -Replacing flexible hose connections and railcar fittings on a frequent basis to ensure hoses are always in good condition;\n\n -Frequent inspection of unloading lines to ensure the lines are in good condition; and\n\n -Control of fire hazards through procedures, training, and the hot"

In July 2001, there was a release and subsequent fire of methyl mercaptan that also resulted in a release of chlorine.  There was an estimated 27,000 lbs of chlorine and an unknown quantity of methyl mercaptan and decomposition products released during this incident. There were three fatalities and eight additional recordable injuries as a result of this incident.  In addition, houses in the area were evacuated as a precautionary measure.  \n\nArkema Inc.realizes that the community may also be interested in information on how Arkema responds to smaller releases of regulated chemicals that do not meet EPA criteria for the Five-Year Accident History.  We have been diligent in reporting releases of hazardous materials and in internally investigating and correcting the causes of such releases.\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN\n\nA written emergency response plan is maintained at the Arkema Inc. facility.  The plan was developed in cooperation and was coordinated with the community emergency response plan developed under 42 U.S.C. 11003.  The Wayne County Local Emergency Planning Committee, local fire departments, and other emergency responders have copies of these plans.  \n\nThe emergency response plan includes procedures for notifying civil authorities and the public in the event of an incident.  The plan also includes documentation of proper first-aid and medical treatment necessary to treat accidental human exposures; pro"

Some drills are done with the local fire and police departments and critiqued by members of the community.  ATOFINA Chemicals on-site emergency equipment includes a fully equipped fire truck with fire fighting foam capability and a 2,000-gallon vacuum truck for quickly collecting spills.  There are first-aid trained personnel on each shift.  The Arkema Inc. Emergency Response Team receives over 40 hours of annual emergency response training. \n\n  \nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nArkema Inc. is improving monitoring and modeling capabilities for potential releases.   The additional information that will be provided is intended to improve emergency response capabilities."
