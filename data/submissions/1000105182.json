Energy Transfer\u0092s management philosophy goals are achieved through the implementation of the Environmental, Health, and Safety Management Systems, by the personal commitments of employees and contractors, and by open communication with employees, customers, neighbors, and regulators. \nThe purpose of this Risk Management Plan (RMP) is to provide information about operations at the facility, programs to prevent accidental chemical releases, emergency planning and response activities in the event an accidental release should occur, the five-year accident history of the facility and continuous improvement efforts to improve safety at the facility.\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances\nEnergy Transfer owns and operates a natural gas processing plant located near Stanton, Texas.  The Martin County Gas Plant treats and dehydrates natural gas to produce residue gas (methane) and natural gas liquids (NGL).  After processing, the residue gas, NGL, and condensate exit the plant via product pipelines.   \nPre-treated, sweet inlet natural gas enters the plant via a pipeline and passes through an inlet scrubber to remove entrained and free flowing liquids.  Following the scrubber, the gas is compressed and sent through molecular sieve gas dehydration units, which remove any remaining water.  The gas then flows through filters, is cooled using gas-to-gas exchangers, and enters the cryogenic NGL recovery plant.  Propane is used as a refrigerant in this process.  Gas is routed to a demethanizer tower, which separates it into a residual gas product stream and an NGL product stream.  The residue gas then exits"

The NGL stream passes through a liquid amine treater to remove carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulfide, if any, and is pumped into the product sales pipeline for distribution.  \nThe RMP flammable substances and mixtures stored or processed at the facility are the flammable mixture comprised of methane, ethane, propane, isobutane, butane, isopentane, and pentane, which is being processed through the plant; as well as propane, which is used as refrigerant in the cryogenic process.  There are no toxic substances present at the facility in amounts greater than threshold quantity.  \nEnergy Transfer has determined that the entire gas plant should be considered one process under the RMP rule.  Although the systems containing the flammable mixture and the propane are not interconnected, an incident in one of the systems could trigger a release in the other system, therefore, the two systems should be considered one process (see definition of process at 40 CFR 68.3).\nEnergy Transfer has determined that Martin County Gas Plant is classified as a Program Level 3 facility under the RMP regulation because the nearest public receptor is within the worst-case scenario flammable endpoint radius and the facility is subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management Standard. \nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response programs in place at the facility are part of the high standards striven for by Energy Transfer.  These high standards include:\n-\tOperating in compliance with required environmental permits and regulations. \n-\tOperating and maintaining assets in such a manner that unintentional releases are minimized.\n-\tOperating and maintaining assets in such a manner that the small releases associated with normal operation and maintenance will be minimized to the extent possible.\n-\tCorrecting non-compliance found by regular audits of the facility. \nPrevention Program\nThe Martin County"

A few examples of the prevention features implemented at this facility include:\n-\tProviding overpressure relief valves on pressurized vessels.\n-\tProviding level transmitters and alarms on vessels to help prevent overfilling.\n-\tMinimizing the possibility of an interruption in the combustion of hydrocarbon vapors by having a continuous flare.\n-\tProviding automated and manual valves to isolate portions of the process.\n-\tInstalling hydrocarbon gas detectors throughout the gas plant.\n-\tInstalling fire eye detectors throughout the gas plant to alarm personnel of a possible fire.\n-\tInstalling security lighting to facilitate observation of the entire facility.\n-\tMinimizing the possibility of emergencies by manning the facility continuously.\n-\tProviding an evacuation alarm system in order to safely evacuate the facility during emergency situations.\n-\tConducting periodic operational rounds to ensure problems are detected and corrected in a timely manner.\n\tFive-Year Accident History\n\tNo incident resulting in onsite injuries, death or significant property damage or known offsite impacts (e.g. death, injury, property ]damage, shelter in place, evacuation, or environmental damage) from the accidental release of a regulated substance has occurred at the facility within the last five years.\t\n\tEmergency Response Program\n\tThe facility will conduct emergency response preparedness activities and coordinate any emergency response actions necessary with the Martin County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and the Martin County Volunteer Fire Department.

The emergency planning and response program provides the essential information for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.\n\tContinuous Safety Improvement Efforts\n\tEnergy Transfer\u0092s Environmental, Health, and Safety Management Systems forms the framework for continuous process safety improvement.  Some of the key components are: \n-\tThe Management of Change provisions ensure that the potential safety and health impacts of any change made to process chemicals, technology, or equipment are considered.\n-\tThe Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) provisions serve as a tool to ensure timely evaluation of potential hazards and verification of safeguards, thereby leading to continual improvements in process safety.\n-\tThe Mechanical Integrity provisions ensure that process equipment and instrumentation are designed, constructed, installed and maintained to minimize the risk of hazardous releases, thereby serving as an integral part of the safety program.\n-\tIncident Investigation procedures are in place to ensure that corrective and/or preventative measures are taken, as applicable, following an incident.  This ensures that process design, operating equipment, and operating and maintenance safe work procedures are evaluated to determine changes needed to prevent recurrence of an incident.\n-\tInternal and third-party compliance audits will ensure that the level of safety protection at the facility is periodically evaluated for improvements with any action items tracked to completion.\n-\tAn annual dialogue with the Martin County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and the Martin County Volunteer Fire Department will ensure a readiness to respond to potential emergencies, as well as a means to implement improvements as the need develops."
