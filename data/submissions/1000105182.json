WTG\u0092s management\nphilosophy goals are achieved through the implementation of the Environmental, Health, and\nSafety Management Systems, by the personal commitments of employees and contractors, and\nby open communication with employees, customers, neighbors, and regulators.\nThe purpose of this Risk Management Plan (RMP) is to provide information about operations at\nthe facility, programs to prevent accidental chemical releases, emergency response plans in the\nevent an accidental release should occur, the five-year accident history of the facility, and planned changes to improve safety at the facility.\n\nStationary Sources and Regulated Substances\n\nWTG owns and operates a natural gas processing plant located near Stanton, Texas. The Martin\nCounty Gas Plant (MCGP) treats and dehydrates natural gas to produce residue gas (methane)\nand natural gas liquids (NGL). After processing, the residue gas,  NGL, and condensate exit the plant via product pipelines. \n\nPre-treated, sweet inlet natural gas enters the plant via a pipeline and passes through an inlet\nscrubber to remove entrained and free-flowing liquids. Following the scrubber, the gas is\ncompressed and sent through molecular sieve gas dehydration units, which remove any\nremaining water. The gas then flows through filters, is cooled using gas-to-gas exchangers, and\nenters the cryogenic NGL recovery plant. Propane is used as a refrigerant in this process. Gas\nis routed to a demethanizer tower, which separates it into a residual gas product stream and an\nNGL product stream. The residue gas then exits the plant via prod"
