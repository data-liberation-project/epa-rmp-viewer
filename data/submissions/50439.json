The water filtration plant has prepared a Risk Management Plan (RMP) in accordance with the EPA and OSHA regulatory requirements. A brief overview of the RMP and the associated policies at water treatment plant is described below.\n\nPrevention and Response Policies \nThe City takes an active role in preventing accidental releases by ensuring that its employees are properly trained in the safe operation of covered processes and the safe handling of treatment chemicals. The City has also established and maintains procedures for emergency notification and response. These are reviewed with employees on a periodic basis and revised to accommodate changes in staffing when they occur. To increase employee safety and awareness, the City: \n. Maintains up-to-date safety information and operating procedures, \n. Performs regular preventative maintenance. \n. Provides periodic refresher training on safe handling of chemicals, and \n. Conducts monthly safety drills. \n\nFacility Description and Regulated Substances \nThe wastewater treatment plant treats wastewater prior to discharge to adjacent stream; it has facilities for maintaining chlorine residual at the appropriate levels. \nThe regulated substance handled at the wastewater treatment plant is chlorine is stored in 1-ton containers.\n\nRelease Scenarios \nWorst-case and alternative release scenarios have been determined after careful review of the regulation and consideration of the storage vessel configuration at the facility.  The release scenarios have been performed in accordance with the regulation\n\nPrevention Steps for Chlorine \nThe prevention program fulfills the requirements of the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) rule and the EPA RMP rule, and includes \n. Formal and on-the-job training, \n. Written operating procedures, and \n. A process equipment preventive maintenance program \n\nAcciden"

      "SummaryText": "t History \nThere has been no accidental release of the covered chemical in the past five years. \n\nEmergency Response Program \nThis facility has established and maintains an emergency response program that is coordinated with local response agencies. The goals of the program are to protect on-site employees from the hazardous effects of the releases and to minimize the effects of releases on the general public. The program is routinely reviewed and updated to reflect personnel and regulatory changes. \n\nPlanned Changes for Improved Safety \nIdeas for changes to improve safety are actively sought from employees. Employee meetings that focus on safety issues are held regularly at the facility Employees are encouraged and trained to recognize hazards and present ideas to eliminate them or to minimize the potential consequences of those hazards. \n\nDuring the development of this RMP document, a process hazard analysis of the chlorine system was conducted with key employees to fulfill the prevention program requirements. During these sessions, recommendations were made for the purpose of improving safety and preventing accidental chemical releases. \nEach recommendation will be or has been considered for implementation. Though not all recommendations may be implemented, the exercise provided all affected employees with a heightened awareness of safety issues related to the covered processes."
