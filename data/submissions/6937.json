      "SummaryText": "Pioneer Plastics Corporation operates a manufacturing plant in Auburn, Maine.  The principle products are Pionite, a decorative laminate used for counter tops and furniture, and low pressure laminates, a melamine coated paper used as a decorative surface for particle board, and other substrates.  Pioneer also manufactures specialty resins both for resale and use in the production of Pionite and low pressure laminates.  Formaldehyde is used as a monomer incorporated into Pioneer's amino resins synthesis.  Formaldehyde is delivered as a Formalin solution(50% Formaldehyde) by commercial trucks in quantities of average loads weighing 56,000 pounds four to five times per week.  The Formalin is transferred to a 20,000 gallon storage tank(approximately 140,000 pounds) and via a pipe bridge the Formalin is transferred to the production area.  The worst case scenario that will produce the greatest distance to endpoint without the effect of mitigation would be the maximum quantity contained in a transport truck that has been disconnected from the truck.  This scenerio would be that if the tanker were hit and released all 56,000 pounds of Formalin onto the containment pad.  This event would overflow approximately 21,000 pounds of Formalin outside the containment pad.  The distance to end point would be approximately 2.2 miles with an effected residential population of 5,691.  The alternative scenerio is the release of 140,000 pounds of Formalin via a rupture of the 20,000 gallon storage tank located within the chemical tank farm building.  The mitigation effect of the containment within the building would reduce the surface area of the pool and the environmental effects resulting in a distance to endpoint of 0.1 miles with an effected residential population of 13.  Pioneer Plastics accidential release prevention program for RMP would be in conjuction with the current program regulated by the OSHA PSM requiremnets, Stormwater Pollution Prevention, and Wastewater regulations.

      "SummaryText": "he PSM requirements have resulted in various projects by which high level alarms, vessel inspections, hazard analysis and improving operations by written procedures being implemented.  The five year accident history indicated one accidental release of 10 gallons of Formalin resulting in the solution being sprayed onto an employee.  No off-site exposures or environmental events occurred during the November 13th, 1997 release.  Pioneer Plastics has an Emergency Response Plan that involves the local fire departments, emergency medical personnel, and hospitals in the event of an accidential release at the facility.  The Pioneer Plastics Emergency Response Team consists of 50 to 55 members with 35 to 38 trained to the HAZMAT Technician level.  The local fire department is not trained to Technician level and will only provide support in decontamination operations and evacuation of effected residents.  Sara Title III and the Maine DEP require that the local fire department and LEPC be notified in the event of a release via telephone.  Pioneer Plastics conducts annual drills, table top excersises and meetings with the local agencies to address any public concerns.  Pioneer Plastics continuely evaluates the process to improve technology and operator procedures to reduce potential accidental releases."
