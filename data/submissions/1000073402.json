Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nOur facility's primary activities include support services for crop production. The Risk Management Program covers our Anhydrous Ammonia storage and transfer system. Our RMP process consists of one 18,000 gallon ASME bulk storage tank, one 15,000 gallon ASME bulk storage tank and a liquid transfer system for unloading and loading cargo tanks. We operate three 2,500 gallon DOT cargo tank trucks from this facility. We also have nine 1,000 gallon applicator tanks and seven 1,000 gallon nurse tanks. Applicator and nurse tanks are stored at the facility when not in use. Minimal product is stored in the applicator and nurse tanks when at our facility. The average maximum amount stored at our facility is 47,250 gallons (243,300 lbs) including the applicator and nurse tanks. The largest single storage container at our facility is the 18,000 gallon bulk storage tank which holds 15,300 gallons (78,795 lbs) when filled to its maximum capacity of 85%.\n\n\n\n2.
