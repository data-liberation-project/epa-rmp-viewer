This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release. Non-essential personnel will be evacuated to more remote locations outside the main refinery.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\r\n\r\nThe BP Cherry Point Refinery operates a variety of processes to produce petroleum products from crude oil.  The refinery has several regulated flammables: isobutane, butane, pentane, propane, and flammable mixtures.  In addition, the refinery uses aqueous ammonia, which is a regulated toxic substance.  Other toxic substances common to refineries were evaluated; hydrogen sulfide, anhydrous ammonia, sulfur dioxide, and mercaptans do not exceed their respective threshold quantities and therefore are not reported.\r\n\r\nCrude/Vacuum Unit\r\n\r\nThe Crude/Vacuum Unit consists of two processes.  The Crude Unit is the initial process unit in the refinery, and is designed to remove salt and sediment from raw crude oil then heat and fractionate the crude into finished and intermediate products.  The Vacuum Unit is designed to process crude tower bottoms in the vacuum diesel fractionator tower and the vacuum tower.  Negative pressure (i.e., a vacuum) is required to fractionate this heavy material without forming coke.  The Crude Unit is Program Level 3 because of regulated flammable mixtures.

The following types of safety features are used in various processes:\r\n\r\nRELEASE DETECTION\r\n\r\nHydrocarbon detectors and hydrogen sulfide detectors with alarms.\r\n\r\nRELEASE CONTAINMENT/CONTROLS\r\n\r\nProcess relief valves that discharge to a flare to capture and incinerate episodic releases.\r\n\r\nScrubber to neutralize chemical releases.\r\n\r\nValves to permit isolation of the process.\r\n\r\nAutomated shutdown systems for specific process parameters.\r\n\r\nCurbing or diking to contain liquid release.\r\n\r\nRedundant equipment and instrumentation.\r\n\r\nRelief devices.\r\n\r\nRELEASE MITIGATION\r\n\r\nAutomatic fire suppression and ex"

The frequency of accidental releases has been extremely low. The refinery has not had any release that has gone outside of the refinery boundaries. There have not been any OSHA recordable injuries resulting from a flammable release or a toxic release in the past five years. Every incident is investigated carefully and changes are instituted to prevent such an incident from happening again.\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\r\n\r\nThe BP Cherry Point Refinery has implemented an emergency response program (ERP) to prepare for potential incidents, respond to them effectively, and recover from their impacts.  The goal of the program is to protect worker and public safety, as well as the environment.  The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post-incident cleanup and decontamination requirements.  In addition, the refinery has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment, as well as instructions that address the use of emergency response equipment.  Employees receive training in these procedures, as necessary, to perform their specific emergency response duties. \r\n\r\nThe ERP includes a set of potential incidents that are used for emergency drills, including accidental release of toxic gases (ammonia), acci"

      "SummaryText": "dental release of flammable materials resulting in a fire and explosion, and accidental spill of hazardous materials on the ground within the refinery perimeter.  \r\n\r\nThe BP Cherry Point Refinery uses an Emergency Management Organization, known as the Incident Command System (ICS), to respond to and manage incidents.  The ICS has a hierarchical (i.e., chain-of-command) structure that places the highest responsibility on the Emergency Manager, who has the overall responsibility for the emergency.  The Emergency Manager delegates direct command responsibilities to the Incident Commander, who has the highest authority during an emergency.  The Emergency Manger is a liaison between the Incident Commander, the public, and the Company.  The next level of responsibility resides on four section chiefs: Command Chief, Operations Chief, Planning Chief, and Logistics/Finance Chief.  All section chiefs receive directions from the Incident Commander during an emergency.  Each position within the organization has specific assignments and responsibilities, defined in the ERP.  The ICS is expanded or contracted to meet the needs or requirements of an emergency; as the scope and complexity of an emergency expands, so does the ICS.\r\nThe overall emergency response program for the BP Cherry Point Refinery is coordinated with the Whatcom County Local Emergency Planning Committee.  This coordination includes periodic meetings of the committee, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials, and industry representatives.  The refinery has emergency response organizations, providing a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to emergency drills that involve the emergency response organizations.\r\n\r\nThe emergency response program is updated when necessary, based on modifications made to refinery processes or other refinery facilities.\r\n\r\n\r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\n\r\nThe BP Cherry Point Refinery"
