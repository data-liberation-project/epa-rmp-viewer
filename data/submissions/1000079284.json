Airgas' Process Safety and Risk Management Program provides instructions for implementing processes that produce employee participation, RMP related deliverables, and training activities that are compliant with 40 CFR Part 68.\r\n\r\nAcetylene is the regulated substance that is managed at the Airgas USA, LLC facility in Poca, WV.   Airgas USA, LLC trucks pick up returned (empty) acetylene cylinders from customer locations and transport the returned cylinders to the facility in Poca, WV.  The full acetylene cylinders are distributed by Airgas USA, LLC to customers.\r\n\r\nAt the time this Executive Summary was written, the covered process had not been involved with an accidental release that could have lead to property damage, catastrophic consequence, injury, or death within the past 5 years.  In addition, an accidental release had not lead to a response or restoration activity for an exposure of an environmental receptor.  \r\n\r\nEmployees of the covered process (acetylene storage) will not respond to accidental releases of regulated substances.  The Poca, WV, facility has an evacuation plan."
