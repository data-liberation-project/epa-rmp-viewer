In our processes, we use the following chemicals that EPA has identified as having the potential to cause significant off-site consequences in the event of a substantial accidental release:\n\n\n\nToxics: Methyl Chloride, Phosphorus Trichloride\n\nFlammables: Dimethylamine (anhydrous), Methylamine (anhydrous)\n\n\n\nOur accidental release prevention programs and our contingency planning efforts help us to effectively manage the hazards that are posed to our employees, the public, and the environment by our use of these chemicals.\n\n\n\nKey Off-Site Consequence Analysis Scenarios\n\nEPA's RMP rule requires that we provide information about worst-case release scenarios and alternative release scenarios for our facility.  An alternate release scenario must be identified for the covered process and regulated material.  The scenario must be more"

Release scenarios considered should include, but are not limited to, the following categories:\n\n1.    Transfer hose release due to equipment or mechanical failure.\n\n2.    Process piping release due to equipment or mechanical failure.\n\n3.    Process vessel or pump release due to equipment or mechanical failure.\n\n4.    Vessel overfilling, spills, and venting through relief systems.\n\n5.    Shipping container failures leading to a spill.\n\n\n\nSelection of the alternate release scenario is mainly based on the following factors: previous accidents involving the regulated material; release scenario failure rate probability; mitigation system and facility emergency response effect and timeliness; temperature, pressure, and quantities of stored materials; and location of process inventories.  Therefore, based on a review of the five scenario categories listed above, the alternate release scenario that was selected is \"Transfer hose release due to equipment or mechanical failure\".  \n\n\n\nThe transfer hose is the weakest link in the unloading process.  Because the shut off valves located on railcars are manually operated, if an unloading hose develops a leak, then a substantial amount of material could be released before response personnel would be able to isolate the vessel.\n\n\n\nEPA's MARPLOT and ALOHA were used to determine the residential population within distance to endpoint.  \n\n\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario - Regulated Toxic Chemicals\n\n    The worst-case scenario selected is a transfer line break that releases 14,420 pounds of Methyl Chloride.  Methyl Chloride is used to produce methyl-based quaternary ammonium compounds at the facility.  This is the only storage tank for Methyl Chloride and the release is contained within a concrete dike.  This area is equipped with a deluge system and firefighting equipment.  Potential public receptors include the Village of Mapleton resident"

Assuming the released DMA results in a vapor cloud explosion, the estimated distance to 1 psi overpressure is 0.40 miles according to EPA's RMP*Comp model.\n\n\n\nAlternative Release Scenarios - Regulated Toxic Chemicals\n\nAlternate case scenarios were developed for each regulated toxic chemical.  The individual scenarios are listed below.\n\n\n\n    The alternative scenario is a 0.5-inch diameter rupture in a 2-inch railcar unloading hose that releases 11,500 pounds of Phosphorus Trichloride (PCl3) for an estimated duration of 40 minutes.  The release is contained within a concrete dike sump.  This area is equipped with a deluge system and firefighting equipment.  Active mitigation is employed.  Potential public receptors include the Village of Mapleton residents, Hollis Park District employees and patrons, Ingredion employees, Evonik employees, Lanxess employees, Caterpillar Inc. employees, Air Liquide employees, and the general "

Our management systems address each of the key features of successful prevention programs including:\n\n- Process Safety Information\n\n- Process Hazard Analysis\n\n- Training\n\n- Mechanical Integrity\n\n- Management of Change\n\n- Pre-Startup Safety Reviews\n\n- Compliance Audits\n\n- Incident Investigations\n\n- Employee Participation\n\n- Hot work Permits\n\n- Contractor Safety\n\n- Site Security\n\n\n\n    These individual elements of our prevention program all work together to assist our efforts to prevent accidental chemical releases.  Our facility management and our employees are committed to safe work procedures defined by the prevention program.  We have specific accountabilities and controls to ensure that we are meeting our own high standards for accident prevention.\n\n\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\n    We keep records for all significant accidental chemical releases that occur at our facility.  During the past five (5) years, we have not experienced an accidental release from covered processes that has resulted in either deaths, injuries, or significant property damage onsite or known deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering-in-place, property damage, or environmental damage offsite.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\n    Our emergency response program covers various federal, state, and local regulatory requirements for emergency response planning.  We have written procedures and pre-plans and we conduct training for initial incident response, emergency responder contact, regulatory agency and community notifications, maintenance of emergency response equipment, and specific response management.  Furthermore, we actively participate with the Peoria County Emergency Management Agency (PCEMA) coordinating with the Peoria County EMA community emergency response plan.\n\n\n\n    We have a trained emergency response team onsite, and we coordinate with Timber Hollis Fire Department for handling l"
