This scenario was identified during the process hazards analysis that was conducted for the facility and was based on the results of the analysis.  \nThe scenario involves the release of ammonia from a 2-inch fill line at the tank.  The process conditions for the line include an operating temperature of 00F and a pressure of 114 pounds per square inch (psi).  It was assumed that the ammonia is released through a half-open fill line.  The release from the area was assumed to occur over a 17.5-minute period based on the hazard analysis.  The release height was assumed to be at ground surface.\nThe plume potentially extends to 0.2 miles from the release point.

In these incidents the Foreman, or highest-ranking Berry employee on site, shall assume the Incident Commander duties and assign responsibilities as needed.  The Level 1 and 2 Incident Command System Organization Chart is adopted to assist in assigning duties.\nA Level 3 incident, which involves off-site implications, the highest-ranking Incident Commander-trained Berry person on site shall assume the Incident Commander post.

Failure analysis was not limited to mechanical issues, and included behavioral, administrative, and catastrophic events as part of each component evaluation.\nThe evaluation team consisted of the Facility Manager, a Lead Technician, at least one facility technician, and a corporate Solar Health and Safety member.  On a functional basis, this unified document allows for the rapid identification and evaluation of ammonia related issues, and identifies control technology and procedures to prevent or minimize a release.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM:\n\nThis Emergency Action Plan was prepared in a joint effort between Solar Asset Management Services,\noperator of the facility and Berry Petroleum Company, owner of the facility.\n\nThe Berry Cogen-42 facility Emergency Action Program is established to implement a\nhealthy and safe environment in the workplace.  It should be used to ensure that all personnel\nhave proper training  and knowledge concerning the evacuation of the facility.\n\nPrinciple objectives of the program is to establish a plan for the rapid and orderly evacuation of all personnel in the event of an emergency.  The safety of all personnel at the site is of paramount importance.  This plan is\ndesigned to enhance the effectiveness of the coordination, communication and response to an emergency.\n\nThis program applies to all Solar Asset Management Services [SAMS] employees, contractors and visitors at the Berry Cogen-42 Facility located at 25121 North Sierra Hwy., Santa Clarita, CA 91321.\n\nFACILITY DESCRIPTION:\n\nLOCATION AND SURROUNDING AREA:\n\nThe Berry Cogeneration-42 Facility is located in Los Angeles County, California, approximately two miles from the city of Newhall.

It is located on a leveled pad with a barrier (hill) between the facility and the freeway.  The site is adjacent to the Berry Petroleum Company Production Facility and also has sparsely located oil wells around the site.  The area around the facility is basically uninhabited, as the nearest home is approximately 1,600 feet from the site.  The nearest housing project is about 2,100 feet from the site.\n\n\nCOGENERATION FACILITY:\n\nThe Berry Cogeneration-42 Facility, owned by Berry Petroleum Company, was purchased in January 1999 from Arco Western Energy.  Steam and electricity are produced and sold to the local power utility company.  There are two General Electric LM2500 turbine generators, each producing 21.5 megawatts of power.\nThe cogeneration system electrical power output runs in parallel with the local utility company grid. Electrical\npower is also consumed by the Berry Oil Production facilities to supply its electrical needs.\nExhaust heat from the gas turbines is recovered in the heat recovery steam generation system..  All steam produced is delivered to the Berry Petroleum Company for injection into the oil formation for enhanced oil recovery.\nThe site is currently operated by Solar Asset Management Services and is manned 24 hours a day.  There are Six personnel ([1] Facility Manager, [1] Lead Technician-I, and [4] Technician-II personnel) assigned to the facility.\n\nANHYDROUS AMMONIA OPERATIONS:\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is stored in liquid form in a specifically design storage vessel.  Ammonia is stored at ambient temperature in the pressurized horizontal storage tank with typical quantities of 7000 to 9000 gallons.  When ambient conditions do not significantly promote the vaporization of liquid ammonia, a vaporizer is utilized to heat the liquid to its boiling point to produce vapor.  The vapor ammonia is sent to a mixin"

The largest quantity should be determined taking into account administrative controls such as procedures that could limit the quantity of a substance that can be stored in a vessel or pipeline at any time.  The worst-case release scenario is also defined by pessimistic meteorological conditions, including an atmospheric stability class F (stable atmosphere), wind speed of 1.5 meters per second (3.4 miles per hour), and an ambient air temperature of 250C (770F).  Because Facility 42 is located in a developed area, urban conditions were assumed to estimate the maximum impact.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is stored in liquid form in a 15,000-gallon tank.  Administrative controls limit the amount of ammonia in the tank to be 9,750 gallons.\n\nTo model the release, it was assumed that the entire contents of the ammonia tank were released over a ten-minute period from a one-inch diameter hole in the tank.
