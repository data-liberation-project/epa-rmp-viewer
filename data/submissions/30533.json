Three of our organic chemical manufacturing processes use regulated chemicals above the RMP applicability threshold.  The organic monomer manufacturing process contains a diked allyl alcohol bulk storage tank (RMP toxic chemical).  One of our organic peroxide manufacturing processes contains a diked 2-methyl-1-butene bulk storage tank (RMP flammable chemical), while another one of our organic peroxide manufacturing processes utilizes a refrigerated building for drum storage of isopropyl chloroformate (RMP toxic chemical).\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION and EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nSenior management within Akzo Nobel is very committed to chemical, employee, and plant safety at our facility.  Their commitment is demonstrated by:\n\n     *   maintaining a staff of safety professionals onsite to properly manage all aspects of safety;\n     *   implementation of the Chemical Manufacturing Association's Responsible Care Initiative, which\n             requires member facilities to implement several different management codes of practices that\n             address various aspects of pollution prevention and process safety management;\n     *   annual reviews by senior management to verify the implementation and execution of CMA's\n             Responsible Care Initiative; \n     *   availability of corporate health & safety professionals for consultations;\n     *   encouraging active participation in both the Local Emergency Planning Commission (LEPC) and the\n             the Channel Industry Mutual Aid (CIMA) Emergency Response Association, which is the local\n             emergency response association that would respond to an emergency at our facility; a"

The Process Safety Management Standard, which is commonly referred to as PSM, requires subject facilities to perform specific accident prevention activities.   USEPA's Risk Management Plan (RMP) also requires applicable facilities to develop an accident prevention program; RMP essentially adopted all of PSM accident prevention program requirements as RMP program requirements.  The accident prevention program requirements that Akzo Nobel has implemented include:\n\n     *   Conduct comprehensive process hazard analyses to identify potential causes of accidents\n     *   Develop and maintain detailed operating procedures for all processes\n     *   Provide comprehensive employee training on subject processes\n     *   Periodically verify, through non-destructive testing, the integrity of key process components\n     *   Develop Management of Change written procedure for reviewing proposed process changes\n     *   Conduct pre-startup reviews whenever any qualifying modification is made to the subject process\n     *   Conduct PSM and RMP compliance audits every 3 years\n     *   Conduct incident investigations whenever an incident could have resulted in a catastrophic release\n     *   Employee participation in conducting process hazards analyses\n     *   Ensuring contractors are fully trained and periodic review of their performances\n\nSeveral different management systems have been developed to ensure that chemical, employee, and plant safety and environmental protection is a top priority in everything we do.

Both management systems allow for safety and environmental reviews to be performed before any requested process change can be made at our facility.\n\nAkzo Nobel will also be undergoing a voluntary safety inspection by OSHA on June 28, 1999 to determine whether our existing safety programs meets all of OSHA's Voluntary Protection Plan (VPP) program requirements.  This is a voluntary program that Akzo Nobel has undertaken to ensure that our facility's existing safety program meets or exceeds all of OSHA's safety requirements.  Once accepted into OSHA's program, the site will undergo periodic inspections by OSHA to ensure the continuation of our safety efforts.  Volunteering for OSHA's VPP program is yet another example of how the site has made a commitment in ensuring the highest degree of chemical, employee, and plant safety.   \n\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS SUMMARY\n\nThe offsite consequences associated with both the worst case and alternate release scenarios have been removed from the Executive Summary pursuant to April 9, 2004 Federal Register.\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nAkzo Nobel Chemicals has not had any accidental releases of either allyl alcohol, 2-mehtyl-1-butene, or isopropyl chloroformate which required any of our employees to seek medical attention or resulted in any off-site impacts to be experienced.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nAkzo Nobel Chemicals is subject to various Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) emergency response program regulations.
