Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of process hazard analysis (PHA) teams.  Employees have access to all information created as part of the site accident prevention program.  Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan.  In addition, the facility has teams that address process safety and employee safety issues and that promote both process and personal safety.  The teams typically have members from various areas of the site, including operations, maintenance, engineering, and management.  Some of these teams are the Site Process Safety Committee, Site OSHA VPP Committee, and Contractor Safety Committee.\r\n\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\n\r\nThe BP Decatur Site keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  Operating areas within the site are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.\r\n\r\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/ exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs).  This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.

This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, piping and instrument drawings, etc.  This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and site changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\r\n\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis\r\n\r\nThe BP Decatur Site has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\r\n\r\nThe BP Decatur Site exclusively uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.  The site has conducted HAZOP studies since 1988.\r\n\r\nThe site also conducts Layer for Protection Analysis (LOPA) Studies in conjunction with the HAZOP studies.

All approved mitigation options being implemented in response to team findings are tracked in an electronic database until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\r\n\r\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the BP Decatur Site periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.

Entry-level standards have been set for new operators in conjunction with educational institutions.  In addition, new operators receive basic training in site operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is placed on shift with experienced personnel to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge and skills to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years.  All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\r\n\r\nMechanical Integrity\r\n\r\nThe BP Decatur Site has well-established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels and storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition.

The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and the equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready.

Our facility adheres to process safety policies, guidelines, and best practices that have been developed based on company and industry experience over the years.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\r\n\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\r\n\r\nThe BP Decatur Site is located at 1401 Finley Island Road, Decatur, Alabama 35601.  The facility is owned by BP Company North America INC.   The site manufactures paraxylene, purified terephthalic acid, and dimethyl 2,6-napthalene dicarboxylate as intermediates for the polyester industry.  In these processes, the site uses four covered flammable chemicals and no toxic chemicals in sufficient quantities to be listed. The four flammables include Ethylene, Propane, 1-3, Butadiene and Hydrogen.

The product is stored as a liquid in the double-walled, vacuum insulated tank, similar in design to a thermos bottle. The minimum tank pressure is determined by the setting of the pressure building regulator, which allows liquid to be vaporized into a gas in the pressure building coil, and then returned to re pressurize the tank. The maximum tank pressure in normal operation is determined by the setting of the economizer regulator, which opens whenever the tank builds pressure, thereby allowing the excess boiloff gas in the tank to flow into the withdrawal line to the customer. The normal design conditions, however, are for liquid to flow to the vaporizer, where it is converted to a gas by absorbing heat, most commonly from the ambient air. The gas flows to the control manifold where it is regulated to the desired pressure by means of a self-acting, spring-loaded regulator, and then finally enters the customer's supply line. This manifold also contains a self-actuating temperature control valve which is set to close if the gas temperature falls to -20\u00b0F to -40\u00b0F. This valve will automatically re-open when the temperature rises above the setpoint, and it is designed to fail closed. This manifold also includes a check valve to prevent reverse flow, pressure indicator and purge valve, shut off valves, and a bypass line around the regulator and check valve for maintenance purposes.\r\n\r\nAir Products -The general accidental release prevention program and specific prevention steps:\r\n\r\nThe facility developed prevention program elements based on the Federal EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Plan, and OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation.
