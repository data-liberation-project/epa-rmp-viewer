The process is regulated by the OSHA Process Safety Management of highly hazardous chemicals.\n\n\n\nWe use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help provide for the safety of our employees and the public, as well as protection of the environment.  This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including:\n\n\n\n* A description of our facility and use of substances required by EPA's RMP regulation and the processes involved\n\n* A summary of results from our assessment of the potential offsite consequences from accidental chemical releases\n\n* Emergency Response Programs\n\n* General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\n* A five-year accident history for accidental releases of chemicals at the Albertville Terminal that are regulated by EPA?s RMP rule.  \n\n\n\nFacility Description\n\n\n\nThe Albertville Terminal is an LPG storage facility which stores propane for transport truck loading/unloading and retail propane truck loading.

The tanks are administratively controlled to hold and not exceed 85% of their capacity.  Propane product is received by transport truck and rail car.  Rail cars have only one spot in which to unload into the system.\n\n\n\nIn our process we use the following chemicals that the EPA has identified as having the potential to cause significant offsite consequence in the event of a substantial accidental release:\n\n\n\nToxics\n\n\n\nThere are not toxic materials contained on site above the threshold limits.\n\n\n\nFlammables\n\n\n\nPropane is a finished product which is received into six storage tanks.  This material is routed from these tanks to the loading docks for wholesale distribution to propane retailers.\n\n\n\nKey Offsite Consequence Analysis Scenarios\n\n\n\nThe EPA's RMP rule requires that we provide information about the worst-case scenarios(s) and alternative release scenario(s) for our facility.  The following are brief summaries of these scenarios, including information about the key administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the exposure distances for each scenario.\n\n\n\nWorst Case Release Scenario ?

Regulated Flammable Chemicals\n\n\n\nThis simulation involves the rupture or failure of a propane storage tank resulting in a simulated vapor cloud explosion that affects the remaining five storage tanks.  The entire inventory of the tanks is simulated due to the proximity of the tanks relative to mitigation of the simulation.  This scenario assumes there would be no mitigation.

Regulated Flammable Chemicals\n\n\n\nThe alternate release scenario is a simulated rupture of the supply hose at the loading docks resulting in a ten minute release and simulated vapor cloud explosion.  This scenario assumed the pump continued to operate at a rate of approximately 255 gallons per minutes (gpm) for 10 minutes after the hose break.  The simulation calculated that 10,147 pounds of material were released in the assumed time frame.  Mitigation measures were taken into account when selecting the alternative release scenario.  These measures consisted of reviewing the use of relief valves, check valves, manual shutoff valves, automatic shutoffs, startup and operating procedures, grounding equipment, and excess flow devices.  Activation of the Emergency Shutdown Devices would isolate the source of the material and secure the facility.  All emergency response and early warning procedures to inform employees and the community would be exercised immediately if this were to occur.
