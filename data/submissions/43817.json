It is the policy of this facility to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws.  Management, and employees are committed to the prevention of accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.

There are 44 private homes and a total population of 128 people within the distance to the endpoint.\r\n\r\nThe alternative release scenario:  The alternative release scenario, based on the most likely potential incident, is a release from a transfer hose failure (1.5 hose).  Based on The Fertilizer Institute Alternate-Case Releases of Anhydrous Ammonia Table 1, assuming that the release is stopped by active/passive mitigation after 2 minutes and a wind speed of 3 meters/second, the following is a summary of results:\r\n\r\n\tRelease rate\t\t\t\t3,563 lb/min \r\n\tMaximum quantity released \t\t7,127 lb \r\n\tDistance to 200 ppm endpoint\t\t0.46 miles\r\n\r\nThere are 6 private homes and a total population of 18 people within the distance to the endpoint.\r\n\r\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps:  This facility has implemented the provisions of Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1, published by The American National Standards Institute (ANSI), and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia.
