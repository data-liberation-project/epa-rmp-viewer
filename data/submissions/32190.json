Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nWe are committed to conducting our activities with the highest regard for environmental, health, safety, and community well-being. All applicable laws and regulations are adhered to with special emphasis on environmental and safety standards.  Our comprehensive accidental release prevention program covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training.  If a release does occur, our highly trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.\n\n2.  The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nOur facility's primary activities are the manufacture of cumene, phenol and acetone.  We handle two risk management plan rule substances at our facility, propylene and propane.  We receive and store propylene and propane together as a mixture (P/P mix), so they are covered together as a flammable mixture for purposes of our risk management plan.  The propylene in the P/P mix is used to produce cumene, while the propane passes through our process and is resold.  We bring in P/P mix by tank truck, railcar, and pipeline. Propane is shipped from our facility by pipeline.\n\n3.  The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario \n\nGeorgia Gulf's worst case and alternative release scenarios do not impact any homes, schools, or hospitals.  The scenarios could, however impact our employees and our industrial neighbors. The following paragraphs provide details of the two scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario involves a catastrophic release from a storage sphere.  The sphere is a vessel used for the storage of a pressurized liquefied mixture of propylene and propane feed (P/P Mix).  The scenario involves a releas"

The sphere would have to be completely full; the 1 1/4 inch-thick steel walls of the sphere would have to fail instantaneously; all of the liquid material in the sphere would have to form a vapor cloud within 10 minutes; all of our safety systems would have to simultaneously fail; all our personnel would have to do nothing to contain or stop the release; specific weather conditions, which would tend to keep any vapor cloud confined and concentrated, would have to be present.  In the improbable event that each and every one of these conditions was to occur, the maximum distance to an endpoint of 1 psi overpressure would still not reach any homes, schools, or hospitals.  \n\nAlthough the EPA does not allow companies to consider any active safety measures when analyzing the worst case scenario, Georgia Gulf has a number of safety systems in place to prevent a release from ever occurring at the sphere.  The sphere meets strict design and construction standards.  It is constructed of 1 1/4 inch-thick steel and wrapped with a 4-inch-thick layer of insulation to help control the temperature and pressure inside the sphere. To prevent the vessel from over pressuring and releasing, the sphere has two relief valves.  These relief valves are tested every two years.  An automatic isolation valve is located on the discharge of the sphere to shut off flow if there is a rupture downstream of the valve.  Numerous instrument alarms are in place to warn of potential equipment malfunction, including multiple pump malfunction alarms and automatic shutdowns on the sphere pumps.  Remote valves are installed to isolate and limit any release from the sphere, including a check valve on the sphere fill line to prevent reverse flow.  In addition, we have a facility-wide leak detection and rep"

This program includes scheduled monitoring of pumps, valves, connectors, and other equipment using portable hydrocarbon leak detectors.  When a leak is found, it is repaired and remonitored to verify that it is leak free.\n\nGeorgia Gulf's alternative release scenario involves the failure of a two-inch diameter P/P mix railcar unloading vapor hose.  In the scenario, propylene and propane are released from an unloading hose, followed by a vapor cloud explosion.  Like the worst case scenario, the maximum distance to the endpoint of 1 psi overpressure would not reach any homes, schools, or hospitals.  \n\nGeorgia Gulf has installed safety systems to prevent a railcar unloading hose failure from ever occurring.  The stainless steel-braided hoses used at Georgia Gulf exceed the design and construction requirements for our railcar unloading conditions.  Each unloading hose is tested annually to 1.5 times the design maximum operating pressure, and the hose fittings are replaced whenever indications of visible wear are present.  Railcar grounds are used to prevent any static discharge.\n\nThere is a relief valve on every P/P mix railcar to prevent the railcar and unloading hose from over pressuring.  We have instrument alarms to warn of potential equipment malfunction and equipment shutdowns to shut off flow.  Each station is monitored via closed circuit television on a two minute loop from a continuously manned control room.  An automatic shutoff valve is located on each railcar to shut off flow if the unloading hose fails.  We have multiple remote block valves, check valves, and a control valve that can shut off flow to the railcar unloading line to isolate and limit any release.  An operator is located at all times within 300 feet of the railcars, which will ensure that the release can be manually isolated quickly, limiting the release duration to 10 minutes.\n\n4.
