The stationary source and the regulated substances handled.\r\n\r\n  The primary activity at the facility is the storage and distribution of fertilizers for sale to farmers.  \r\n  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a crop \r\n  production nutrient.  The storage and handling system consists of two storage tanks,\r\n  loading risers, associated plumbing and nurse tanks.  Access to the site is \r\n  restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel and authorized\r\n  contractors.\r\n\r\n3.
