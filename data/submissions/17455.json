Many of our employees are members of the Local Emergency Planning Committee, area volunteer fire departments, and local emergency response units.  Our facilities have written emergency preparedness plans that are updated regularly.\n\nAshland facilities typically host open houses every 3 to 5 years as an opportunity for neighbors to learn about our commitment to safety.  Ashland makes an effort to support our communities through sponsorship of local activities and participation in many local organizations.\n\nA description of your facility and the regulated substances handled:  \n\nThis facility produces maleic anhydride by the oxidation of butane and air in the presence of a catalyst.  Butane is the single regulated substance handled above the regulatory threshold quantity.  Butane is received as a raw material in bulk tank trucks at the truck unloading pad and pumped via flexible hoses into two storage tanks.  Butane is brought to the facility by rail in the event of weather conditions that would not allow delivery by truck.   \n\nFor more information, visit our web site at www.ashspec.com or contact the Plant Manager.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario:\n\nThe USEPA RMP reg"

      "SummaryText": "ulations require the worst-case release scenario to assume that the entire contents of the largest vessel are released.  This event is highly unlikely and has never occurred at our facility.  The USEPA also requires the worst-case scenario for butane to be a vapor cloud explosion of the released material.  Vapor cloud explosions are extremely rare events, even when large quantities of flammable materials are released.   Based on our analysis using USEPA-approved methods, the worst-case scenario release of butane could potentially affect offsite public receptors.  In the worst-case analysis, the administrative control of inventory was considered.\n\nThe alternative-case release scenario:\n\nThe USEPA RMP regulations require an analysis of the alternative-case release scenario.  The alternative-case release scenario represents an accidental release that is more reasonable than the worst-case, but is still highly unlikely to occur.  Based on our analysis using USEPA-approved methods, the alternative-case release scenario for butane could possibly impact offsite public receptors.  In the alternative-case analysis, the administrative control of inventory was considered and an excess flow valve was considered as an active mitigation measure.\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps:\n\nThis facility is operated in strict accordance with the USEPA prevention program requirements.  A written management system is in place with operating and maintenance procedures for the covered process.  Our management system procedures ensure rigorous training for operations employees, an effective mechanical integrity program, numerous management checks and balances, and strict attention to changes in the operations with a thorough review and examination of potential incidents that could lead to an accidental release.\n\nAshland also maintains a 24-hour corporate emergency reporting system that can speedily coordinate emergency response with top ma"
