OHLP's management philosophy goals are achieved through the implementation of the Environmental Health and Safety\r\nManagement Systems, by the personal commitments of employees and contractors, and by open communication with employees, customers, neighbors, and regulators.  This submission to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency updates the Mont Belvieu NGL Fractionation Facility Risk Management Program (RMP) to include the addition of a 3 million barrel Raw Feed underground storage well and the addition of a 3rd fractionation train (FRAC 3). The purpose of this Risk Management Plan is to provide information about operations at the facility, programs to prevent accidental chemical releases, emergency response plans in the event of an accidental release, the five-year accident history of the facility, and planned changes to improve safety at the facility.\r\n\r\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances\r\n\r\nThe Mont Belvieu Fractionation Facility receives raw feed via pipeline and  from the co-located ONEOK underground storage facility.  The raw feed is then fractionated into five purity products. These products are ethane, propane, isobutane, normal butane and natural gasoline.  The E/P Splitter receives EP Mix and splits it into purity ethane and propane.  The products are returned to the storage facility via plant piping and stored until they are delivered via pipeline to third party customers.  Ethane, propane, isobutane and normal butane as well as three flammable mixtures, natural gasoline, raw feed, andEP Mix, are the flammable substances regulated under the Risk Management Pro"

      "SummaryText": "gram (RMP) that are present at the fractionation facility.  All threshold quantities reported in the RMP are now updated to include the amounts of each of these regulated substances.  No toxic chemicals are stored at the facility in amounts greater than threshold\r\nquantity.  The facility is classified as Program Level 3 under the regulation.\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n\r\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response programs in place at the facility are part of the high standards striven for byOHLP.  These high standards include:\r\n\r\n-\tOperating in compliance with required environmental permits and regulations.\r\n\r\n-\tOperating and maintaining assets in such a manner that unintentional releases are minimized.\r\n\r\n-\tOperating and maintaining assets in such a manner that the small releases associated with normal operation and maintenance will be minimized to the extent possible.\r\n\r\n-\tCorrecting non-compliance found by regular audits of the facility.\r\n\r\nPrevention Program\r\n\r\nThe facility will operate under the strict guidelines of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Program.  Ongoing analysis of the\r\npotential hazards of the process, detailed training of employees and emphasis on safety will help to avoid any serious accidents in the future.  Part of this program also involves identifying and taking steps to avoid potential accidental chemical releases.  A few examples of the prevention features implemented at this facility include:\r\n\r\n-\tRelease of hydrocarbon vapors are interrupted by having installed automatic pilot ignition and a failure alarm on the flare.\r\n\r\n-\tFixed hydrocarbon detectors are installed at point sources within the facility to help ensure that a release is detected and terminated as soon as possible.\r\n\r\n-\tPreventive maintenance and vessel testing through the Mechanical Integrity program is conducted to  ensure failures do not occur in process equipment."

The Director for Plant Operations, or his designee, is responsible for coordinating the emergency actions.  A specific Emergency Response Plan for the facility is in place and that plan has been communicated to local officials.  The Emergency Response Program provides the essential planning\r\nand training for effectively protecting workers, the public and the environment during emergency situations.\r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\r\n\r\nCompliance with the RMP Prevention Program, coupled with the Environmental Health and Safety Management Systems, forms the framework for continuous safety improvement.  Some of the key\r\ncomponents of the safety program are:\r\n\r\n-\tThe Management of Change provisions ensure that the potential safety and health impacts of any change made to process chemicals, technology, equipment or procedures are considered.\r\n\r\n-\tThe Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) combined with a Level of Protection Analysis (LOPA) serve as the tools to ensure timely evaluation of potential hazards, thereby leading to continual improvements in safety standards.\r\n\r\n-\tThe Mechanical Int"

Specific actions that will be taken in the future to improve the level of safety at the facility include:\r\n\r\n-\tInternal and third party compliance audits to ensure that the level of safety protection at the facility is periodically evaluated for improvements.\r\n\r\n-\tAn ongoing dialogue with the Greater Baytown Area LEPC and Mutual Aid Mont Belvieu (MAMB)will ensure a constant state of readiness to respond to any potential emergencies, as well as a means to implement improvements as the need develops.\r\n\r\nAll interested citizens or community organizations are encouraged to contact the Baytown Emergency Management Coordinator or his designate for the latest information on emergency\r\nresponse for the area.  The facility plans to coordinate its response capabilities and personnel with those of the city and county on an ongoing basis."
