Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies \n\n\n\nEquity Group - Kentucky Division (Equity Group) is strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety. Our comprehensive process safety management program demonstrates this commitment. The program is designed to prevent the occurrence and minimize the consequences of a significant release of anhydrous ammonia. Our facility operates under detailed written procedures. Employees are trained to safely operate the refrigeration system and know the system's limitations. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. If such releases do occur, our emergency response team is trained to stop the release and mitigate any spilled chemical. Clinton county and surrounding counties Fire and Emergency response personal as well as local and state law enforcement are invited and attend an annual meeting to review Tier II chemicals on site.  Also, Local Fire and EMS personal are invited and participate in a HAZMAT drill conducted during the HAZMAT refresher training. \n\n\n\nThe facility's Emergency Response Plan (ERP) is reviewed annually with local emergency response personnel. A chemical spill and release plan specific to anhydrous ammonia is included in the facility's ERP. The chemical spill plan establishes specific policies and procedures to ensure the safe and timely evacuation of employees and the surrounding community. The Clinton County Volunteer Fire Department will provide assistance if needed.  \n\n\n\n2. Facility and Regulated Substances Handled \n\n\n\nEquity Group - Kentucky Division is a slaughter and poultry processing facility. Anhydrous ammonia is the only substance regulated by RMP at the facility. The ammonia at the facility is only used in the refrigeration system. \n\n\n\n3. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps \n\n\n\nOur facility has taken the necessary steps to comply"

The program is structured on the elements described by the OSHA 1910.119 Appendix C. The elements of the PSM program are employee participation, process safety information (PSI), process hazard analysis (PHAs), standard operating procedures, training, contractors, pre-startup safety review, mechanical integrity, management of change, incident investigation, emergency planning and response. Equity Group has implemented several environmental and safety programs that correspond and enhance the PSM program. Thus, PSM is one program in a comprehensive safety management system at this facility. \n\n\n\nThe elements of the PSM program are described briefly below. \n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information - detailed safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters of the system, and equipment designs and specifications. \n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis - comprehensive studies to identify hazards associated with the regulated chemical and system control methods. The methodology used to carry out these analyses is the What If-Checklist. A team of qualified personnel undertakes the studies with expertise in engineering and process operations. The studies are revalidated every five years or whenever management of changes warrants a new study. \n\n\n\nStandard Operating Procedures - written operating procedures that guide startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency operations, emergency shutdown, and normal shutdown. Information is reviewed routinely and available to every operator. \n\n\n\nTraining - Equity Group has a comprehensive training program in place for operators and refrigeration mechanics.

General awareness information is provided to every employee during orientation to comply with guidelines of OSHA's 1910.1200 Hazard communication. \n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity - The refrigeration system's maintenance program is operated from a software program. The program generates daily preventative maintenance orders that are completed by refrigeration mechanics. Inspections and process control operations are scheduled on the software program as well. Follow up reports are generated to ensure the daily work orders are followed through to completion. Any equipment deficiencies identified during maintenance/inspection checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner. \n\n\n\nManagement of Change - written procedures to manage changes in process operations, technology, equipment, procedures, and chemicals. Process operators, and mechanics and all other employees affected by a change in a process are promptly made aware of and trained to deal with the changes. \n\n\n\nPre-Startup Reviews - formal meetings conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation. \n\n\n\nCompliance Audits - conducted on a regular basis to determine compliance with the provisions of the RMP Rule. Audits are scheduled for every 3 years and corrective actions are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner. \n\n\n\nIncident Investigation - Equity Group promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.

The purpose of the plan is to protect employees from serious injury, loss of life, and minimize property loss in the event of an emergency. The plan identifies specific emergencies including, fire, severe weather, bomb threat, and hazardous chemical spills. The plan is reviewed with local emergency response personnel annually. Local personnel include members of surrounding fire departments, city police, county police, state police, hospitals, and ambulance services. Local response personnel are invited to the facility to formally review the plan and tour the facility. The chemical spill plan identifies surrounding neighbors in the event of a community evacuation.
