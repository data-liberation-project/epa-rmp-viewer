(GPRI), a wholly owned subsidiary of Georgia-Pacific Corporation, owns and operates a synthetic resin and formaldehyde manufacturing facility in Lufkin, TX.  The facility is located on E. Lufkin Avenue.  The facility consists of two plants: a resin plant that was originally constructed in 1962 and a plant that manufactures formaldehyde, which is one of the basic raw materials used to manufacture the resins.  This formaldehyde plant was constructed in 1977.  Overall, the facility employs 68 full-time employees.\n \n GPRI is committed to operating the Lufkin, Texas plant in a manner that is safe for its workers, the public, and the environment.  As part of this commitment, GPRI  has established a system to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility.  One component of this system is a risk management program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at the Lufkin Plant and that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agencys (EPA's) regulation 40 CFR part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule).  One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit a risk management plan (RMP Plan) describing the risk management program at the Lufkin Plant. This document is intended to satisfy the RMP Plan requirement of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program at the Lufkin Plant.\n \n The risk management program at the Lufkin Plant consists of the following three elements:\n \n7 a hazard assessment to help understand (a) the potential offsite consequences of hypothetical accidental releases and (b) accidents that have occurred during the last five years associated with the use of substances regulated by the RMP rule (regulated substances).\n \n7 a prevention program to help maintain and safely operate the processes containing more than a threshold quantity of a regulated substance (covered processes).\n \n7 an emergency response program"

In fact, the Lufkin Plant has a comprehensive safety program in place establishing many levels of safeguards against release of a hazardous substance and injuries and damage from a release of a hazardous substance.\n  \n GPRI limits the use of hazardous substances.  Before using a hazardous substance at the Lufkin Plant, less hazardous alternatives are considered. When a hazardous substance is used at the Lufkin Plant, GPRI considers the potential for this substance to adversely affect plant workers, the public, and the environment and takes steps to prevent any such effects.\n \n GPRI prevents releases of the hazardous substances used at the facility.  When a hazardous substance is used at the Lufkin Plant, the equipment is carefully designed, built and operated to reduce the likelihood of an accidental release. Industry and government standards are closely adhered to in the design, construction, and operation of the equipment. \n \n GPRI limits damage from a release, if such a release occurs.  GPRI trains its workers to respond to an accidental release, reducing the consequences of a release if it occurs.  In addition, GPRI works with the local fire department and with the local emergency planning committee (LEPC) to help prevent injuries and/or environmental damage if a release does occur.\n \n The safety program at the Lufkin Plant consists of a number of elements, only some of which are required by the RMP rule. This RMP Plan is primarily intended to describe those parts of the safety program at the Lufkin Plant that are required by the RMP rule.\n \n 1.1 Accidental Release Prevention and Emergen"

      "SummaryText": "cy Response Policies\n \n GPRI is committed to the safety of workers and the public, and the preservation of the environment, through the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances.  GPRI implements reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous substances.  These controls include training programs for personnel, programs to help ensure safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of processes at the Lufkin Plant; and programs to evaluate the hazards at the plant.\n \n In the event of an accidental release, the Lufkin Plant controls and contains the release in a manner that will be safe for workers and will prevent injury to the public and the environment.  GPRI provides response training to its personnel, designates an emergency response coordinator to oversee response activities, and coordinates response efforts with the local fire department.  Response activities have also been discussed with the LEPC.\n \n In order to effectively implement these policies, GPRI established a management system headed by the Plant Manager to oversee safety-related activities.\n \n 1.2 Regulated Substances\n \n The Lufkin Plant handles only formaldehyde in sufficient quantity to be covered by the RMP rule, as shown in the following list of RMP-covered Program Level 3 processes at the plant.\n \n  Regulated Substance                      Process                          Process Quantity*, lbs       RMP Threshold, lbs*\n Formaldehyde Solution (50%)    Resin Manufacturing                       96,000                                   15,000\n Formaldehyde Solution (50%)    Storage in Unpressurized Tanks     123,000                                   15,000\n \n * Process and threshold quantity is the quantity of pure chemical, not of the solution\n \n 1.3 Offsite Consequence Analysis\n \n The Lufkin Plant performed an offsite consequence analysis to estimate the potential for an accidental release of a regulated substance to affect the public or the envi"

GPRI does not expect a worst case release scenario to ever occur.  The alternative release scenarios were selected to help the LEPC improve the community emergency response plan.  An alternative release scenario represents a release that (1) might occur at a facility like the Lufkin Plant and (2) would result in the greatest potential offsite consequences if the release occurred.\n \n The main objective of performing the offsite consequence analysis is to determine the distance at which certain effects might occur to the public because of an accidental release (called the endpoint distance).  The following effects could occur at the endpoint distance.  At distances less than the endpoint distance, the effects would be greater; at distances greater than the endpoint distance, the effects would be less.\n \n When considering the release of a toxic substance, most people at the endpoint distance would be able to walk away from the exposure without any long term health consequences, although some short term consequences (e.g., strong eye or throat irritation) are possible.  Some people who are particularly susceptible to the substance released could be incapacitated.\n \n The RMP rule includes specific requirements for the worst-case and alternative release scenarios that must be reported by GPRI.  These requirements are:\n \n7 one worst case release scenario for the class of toxic substances in Program 3 processes\n \n7 one alternative release scenario for each of the toxic substances in a Program 3 process\n \n7 one worst case and one alternative release scenario for the class of flammable substances in Program 3 processes\n \n 1.3 Offsite Consequence Analysis (Cont)\n \n The following information summarizes the offsite consequence analysis performed by the Lufkin Plant:\n \n 1.3.1 Program 3 Processes-Toxic Substances - Formaldehyde Solutions\n \n The worst case "

A concrete diked area contains the released formaldehyde solution which evaporates and forms a vapor cloud.  The maximum distance to the toxic endpoint concentration based on modeling is 0.6 mile.  The U.S. Census indicates that 2,258 people live within this distance from the location of the tank; several public receptors are also located within this distance, including a US Post Office and numerous commercial businesses.\n \n The alternative case release scenario for a 50% solution of formaldehyde is the overfilling of a formaldehyde storage tank and the spillage of 100 gallons (480 lbs of pure formaldehyde) of solution into the concrete diked area.  Modeling this scenario indicates a toxic endpoint distance of 0.1 mile.  The U.S. Census indicates that 36 people live within this distance from the storage tank; several public receptors are also located within this distance.\n \n 1.3.2 Program 3 Processes-Flammable Substances\n \n There are no regulated flammable substances in quantities above the threshold quantities at the plant.  Propane is stored on-site in a 500 gallon (2200 pound) storage tank, however, this quantity is less than the threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds.\n \n 1.4 Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n \n Since 1962, the Lufkin Plant has used a prevention program to help prevent accidental releases of hazardous substances.  Beginning in 1993, the plant formalized this prevention program for the formaldehyde manufacturing and storage process to comply with the 14 elements of the OSHA process safety management (PSM) prevention program.
