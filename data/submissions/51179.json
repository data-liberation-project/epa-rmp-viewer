This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the facility's processes.  St. Mary\u00bfs policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent forseeable releases of substances.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nSt. Mary operates the Bland Lake Common Point located in San Augustine County, Texas.  This facility is a natural gas processing plant that produces liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) by Joule-Thompson separation with water removal by glycol dehydration.  Liquids removed from the gas stream are stored in a 12,000-gallon bullet tank.  These liquids are transported from the site via tanker trucks.  As evidenced in the ensuing text and based on criteria outlined in the Accidental Release Prevention Program (ARP), the Bland Lake Common Point is a Program 1 process.\n\nBland Lake Common Point was evaluated to determine if any regulated flammable or toxic substances were present in the process and if they exceeded the threshold quantity.  All equipment and vessels are considered to be connected and/or co-located; consequently, for the purposes of the ARP Program, all equipment and vessels are part of a single process.  The identification of even a single vessel exceeding threshold quantities of a regulated flammable or toxic substance would subject a process to threshold determination for offsite consequence analysis.\n\nSt. Mary identified one flammable liquid mixture and zero regulated toxic substances.  The identification of a flammable mixture which exceeds threshold quantity indicates that the Bland Lake Common Point is a covered process with a regulated substance subje"

Emergency response activities are coordinated with local fire department as required in 40 CFR 68.12(b)(3)."
