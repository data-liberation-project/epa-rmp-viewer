The design and construction of the facility comply with applicable state and industry codes.\n\n4. \tFive year accident history:\n\nDuring the past 5 years there have been no accidents or accidental releases of toxic gases that could have had off-site consequences.\n\n5. \tThe emergency response program:\n\nThe facility\u00bfs emergency response program is based upon OSHA\u00bfs HAZWOPER standard.  At this site, employees are trained to respond to releases or potential releases of hazardous materials for the purpose of protecting nearby persons, the environment, or property from the effects of the release.  All employees have been trained to OSHA\u00bfs First Responder Awareness Level and several employees have been trained to OSHA\u00bfs First Responder Operations Level.  Employees receive annual refresher training in their role in the emergency plan.  Emergency response activities have also been coordinated with the Stockton Fire Department and the Office of Emergency Services.  Periodic drills are conducted with the Stockton Fire Department to review the effectiveness of our emergency procedures.\n\n6. \tPlanned changes to improve safety:\n\nThe facility resolves recommendations from PHA\u00bfs and Incident Investigations, some of which may result in modifications to the plant design & operating procedures.  Additional changes are evaluated as our employees identify ideas via the Basic Safety Process and SCC\u00bfs Safety Teams.  Removed SO2 from site.\n\nThe Stockton CoGen facility upgraded the site security system as a result of a site Security and Vulnerability Assessment (SVA) conducted in May of 2003."

      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\n\nAir Products and Chemicals, Inc.\nStockton, California Cogeneration Facility\n\n1. \tAccidental release prevention and emergency response policies:\n\nAt this facility we produce steam and electricity.  During the manufacturing process we use anhydrous ammonia to reduce our NOx emissions, Chlorine to control micro biological levels in our cooling tower water.   Anhydrous ammonia and Chlorine in the amounts handled, are considered Acutely Hazardous Materials (AHMs) by the EPA.  It is our policy to adhere to all federal and state rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle these products combined with the safety devices  inherent in the design of the facility.  Safe work practices and training of our personnel supplement the inherent safe design of the plant.\n\nOur emergency response program is based upon OSHA\u00bfs HAZWOPER regulation (CFR 1910.120).  The emergency response plan includes procedures for the notification of the local fire authority and Hazardous Materials Unit.\n\n2. \tThe stationary source and regulated substances handled:\n\nThe primary purpose of this facility is cogeneration of steam and electricity.  We operate a circulating fluidized bed boiler to produce high pressure steam by the combustion of coal, petroleum coke, and Tire Derived Fuel.  The steam from the boiler is used to turn a turbine generator thereby creating electricity.  The steam is condensed in a condenser by cooling water.  We control the microbiological levels in the cooling water with Chlorine. \n\nNitrogen Oxides (NOx) are a by-product of combustion and are considered an atmospheric pollutant.  It is removed from our process by injecting anhydrous ammonia into our boiler.  The ammonia reacts with the NOx creating molecules of nitrogen and water vapor, naturally occurring atmospheric gases.  This process reduces the plants NOx emissions by approx. 85 % -  90 %.\n\nThe regulated substances handled at this facility are anhydrous ammonia and chlorine."
