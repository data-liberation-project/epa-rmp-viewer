Emergency Response would apply copious amounts of water to limit the impact on other chemical storage in the surrounding area.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario - Flammable Chemical\nFailure of a nipple on the propane line resulting in a release of 47,100 lbs of propane.   This is mitigated by Texas City\u00c2\u00bfs mechanical integrity program and the fact that this is in a low traffic area.  Operators rounds verify that the line and its associated nipples continue to be in good operating condition.  Emergency Response would apply copious amounts of water to limit the impact on other chemical storage in the surrounding area.\n\nAdditional information regarding each release scenario is found in the attachments describing each scenario.\n \nAccidental Release Prevention Policies\nTexas City is committed to operate and maintain its facility in a safe and environmentally friendly manner.  Texas City uses Dow Chemical\u00c2\u00bfs Global Management Systems and Emergency Response Plan to comply with applicable rules and regulations (EPA RMP and OSHA PSM) and to protect the safety of employees and public.\nTexas City designed its accident prevention program to comply with both EPA RMP and OSHA PSM.  Texas City incorporates the Dow Chemical Operating Discipline Management Systems (ODMS), which globalizes all Dow/Union Carbide facilities with the same environmental, heal"

Union Carbide Texas City Operations (Texas City) has an integrated, effective, and compliant prevention program that meets U.S. EPA Risk Management Plan (EPA RMP) and OSHA\u00c2\u00bfs Process Safety Management Program (OSHA PSM) requirements.  Key elements include process hazard analysis, written operating discipline, training and operator qualification, mechanical integrity program, management of change program, compliance audits, incident investigation and an emergency response program.\n\nTexas City is a major petrochemical production facility. The products manufactured at Texas City include: Hydrocarbons, Isopropanol, Oxo alcohols and aldehydes, organic acids, acetic esters and vinyl acetate. The regulated substances handled include: vinyl acetate, propylene, ethylene, propane, methane and 2-methylpropene.\n\nThis update is being submitted to revise covered chemical inventories and the covered processes.   Since the last submittal, the SVR process has shutdown.  It is removed from the RMP submit program.  \n\nKey Offsite Consequence Analysis \nThe worst case scenarios and alternative release scenarios for Texas City are as follow:\n\nWorst Case Scenario - Toxic Chemical\nFailure of a plant vinyl acetate storage tank releasing 250,000 pounds of vinyl acetate.  Mitigation includes design and construction codes and standards for equipment are met or exceeded as well as the ongoing  mechanical integrity program.  The process is monitored by computers and trained, qualified operators.  Foam is used by the Emergency Response Team to minimize vapor releases.  \n\nAlternative Release Scenarios - Toxic Chemical\n1) A leak develops in transfer line due to weld crack or gasket failure releasing 6,000 pounds of vinyl acetate.  Mitigation measures include piping that is welded to minimize"

The facility trains and drills with local emergency responders to enhance their skills and tactics, including coordination with these local emergency responders, in responding to a chemical release.  Critiques are held on both the drills and actual chemical releases.  \nThe emergency response program provides essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public and the environment during emergency situations.  Detailed emergency response plans are developed and coordinated with the Texas City/La Marque Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).\nFive-Year Accident History\nTexas City has not had any chemical releases resulting in any known off-site deaths, injuries, significant damage, evacuations or sheltering-in-place in the past five (5) years.  \n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\nTexas City continually strives to improve its safety-related systems.   Dow Chemical\u00c2\u00bfs ODMS requirements provides continuously improving  means of managing process hazards.  In addition, the implementation of Layers of Protection Analysis and the closure of any gaps determined in this analysis, using safety instrumented systems or other independent protection layers, will assure that all plant hazards are appropriately managed."
