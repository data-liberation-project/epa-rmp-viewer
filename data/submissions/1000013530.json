Key elements include process hazard analysis, written operating discipline, training and operator qualification, mechanical integrity program, management of change program, compliance audits, incident investigation and an emergency response program.\n\nTexas City is a major petrochemical production facility. The products manufactured at Texas City include: Hydrocarbons, Isopropanol, Oxo alcohols and aldehydes, organic acids, acetic esters and vinyl acetate. The regulated substances handled include: vinyl acetate, propylene, ethylene, propane, methane and 2-methylpropene.\n\nThis update is being submitted to revise covered chemical inventories and the covered processes.   Since the last submittal, the SVR process has shutdown.  It is removed from the RMP submit program.  \n\nKey Offsite Consequence Analysis \nThe worst case scenarios and alternative release scenarios for Texas City are as follow:\n\nWorst Case Scenario - Toxic Chemical\nFailure of a plant vinyl acetate storage tank releasing 250,000 pounds of vinyl acetate.  Mitigation includes design and construction codes and standards for equipment are met or exceeded as well as the ongoing  mechanical integrity program.  The process is monitored by computers and trained, qualified operators.  Foam is used by the Emergency Response Team to minimize vapor releases.  \n\nAlternative Release Scenarios - Toxic Chemical\n1) A leak develops in transfer line due to weld crack or gasket failure releasing 6,000 pounds of vinyl acetate.  Mitigation measures include piping that is welded to minimize"

      "SummaryText": " the number of flanges and the piping is included in the mechanical integrity program.  Foam is used by the Emergency Response Team to minimize volatilizing leaked vinyl acetate.\n\nWorst Case Scenario - Flammable Chemical\nFailure of the Propylene storage tank releasing 700,000 pounds of propylene.  The scenario is mitigated by the fact that the tanks are located in above ground earthen bunkers.  The storage tanks are in Texas CityA?s mechanical integrity program.  The storage tanks are monitored by computers and trained, qualified operators.  ??Computer controlled ??emergency block valves isolate the system in the event of tank failure.  Emergency Response would apply copious amounts of water to limit the impact on other chemical storage in the surrounding area.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario - Flammable Chemical\nFailure of a nipple on the propane line resulting in a release of 47,100 lbs of propane.   This is mitigated by Texas CityA?s mechanical integrity program and the fact that this is in a low traffic area.  Operators rounds verify that the line and its associated nipples continue to be in good operating condition.  Emergency Response would apply copious amounts of water to limit the impact on other chemical storage in the surrounding area.\n\nAdditional information regarding each release scenario is found in the attachments describing each scenario.\n \nAccidental Release Prevention Policies\nTexas City is committed to operate and maintain its facility in a safe and environmentally friendly manner.  Texas City uses Dow ChemicalA?s Global Management Systems and Emergency Response Plan to comply with applicable rules and regulations (EPA RMP and OSHA PSM) and to protect the safety of employees and public.\nTexas City designed its accident prevention program to comply with both EPA RMP and OSHA PSM.  Texas City incorporates the Dow Chemical Operating Discipline Management Systems (ODMS), which globalizes all Dow/Union Carbide facilities with the same environmental, heal"
