      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\n\nA. Description of Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nDaikin America, Inc. (Daikin) is a fluorocarbon manufacturing facility located in Decatur, Alabama.  As a result of the manufacturing process, the following regulated chemicals are present at the facility in quantities that exceed the threshold quantities specified by EPA regulations: chloroform, hydrogen fluoride (HF), ethylene, vinyl chloride and tetrafluoroethylene (TFE).  The facility has one covered process that requires the facility meet Program 3 requirements of the EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) regulation.\n\nDaikin has a joint venture with 3M, called MDA Manufacturing, Inc. (MDA).  Daikin operates the MDA manufacturing process and oversees safety, environmental and maintenance for MDA.  In an emergency involving either Daikin or MDA, Daikin personnel will be directly involved.  According to Chapter 1 of the EPA General Guidance for Risk Management Programs (July 1998), for joint ventures, \"A? the legal entity you have established to operate these processes should file the RMP.  If you consider the entity a subsidiary, you should be listed as the parent company in the RMP\".  Therefore, Daikin is submitting the RMP for the covered process, which includes the MDA operations.\n\nHF and chloroform are delivered to the facility via railcars and are offloaded to storage tanks.  In the process, HF and chloroform are used as raw materials in the production of chlorodifluoromethane (R-22) at MDA.   \n\nTFE is produced from R-22 at Daikin.  TFE is stored in storage tanks and is used as a raw material for other Daikin products.  It is transported via pipeline to MDA to manufacture hexafluoropropylene (HFP) and is also transported via pipeline to a nearby 3M facility.\n\nEthylene is delivered and stored on site in tube trailers.  Ethylene is a raw material used in the production of ethylene tetrafluoroethylene at Daikin.  \n                                                                "

Accidental Release Prevention & Emergency Response Policies of Daikin\n\nDaikin is committed to protecting facility personnel, the public and the environment from any workplace and accidental release hazards.  Appropriate responses to releases of regulated chemicals are documented in the Plant Safety Manual.  Safety, environmental protection and risk management programs are fully implemented and coordinated with community emergency responders for emergency planning and response efforts.\n\n \nC. Release Scenario Discussion\n\nIn accordance with the requirements of the EPA RMP regulations each owner or operator of a stationary source is required to perform the following offsite consequence analyses.  Daikin has performed this analysis as required.  The summary of this analysis is not required to be included with the executirve summary.\n\nD. Five-year Accident History\n\nUnder the EPA RMP regulations, an accidental release is defined as a release of a regulated substance that \"resulted in deaths, injuries or significant property damage on-site, or known off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\"  \n\nDaikin has not had any accidents within the past five years that resulted in deaths, injuries or significant property damage on-site, or known off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\nE. Management Program\n\nDaikin has a management program in place that assigns overall responsibility for the development and implementation of the Risk Management Program (RMProgram) to a qualified individual or position of responsibility.  It clearly delineates accountability and responsibilities for any elements where responsibilities are delegated.\n\nF.

The PHA was performed using What-If/ Checklist and Hazard and Operability Study (HAZOP) methods.  The PHA identified the potential hazards associated with the regulated substances in the covered process; causes of potential accidental release scenarios; safeguards used to prevent accidental releases; and methods used to detect, monitor or control accidental releases.

Emergency Response Program\n\nDaikin has an emergency response program that includes an emergency action plan addressing all EPA RMP regulated substances present at the facility.  The emergency action plan includes:\n\nA? Procedures for informing the Decatur/Morgan County LEPC and the community about any accidental releases;\nA? Documentation of first-aid and emergency medical treatment necessary to treat accidental exposures; and\nA? Procedures for emergency response after and accidental release of a regulated substance.\nThe emergency action plan is reviewed annually to reflect changes at the facility and ensure that employees are informed of the changes.  The emergency response program includes procedures for the use of on-site emergency response equipment and for its inspection, testing and maintenance.  Employees are trained periodically on emergency response procedures.  \n\nH. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nIn an effort to improve safety and to reduce the risk of accidental releases, changes to the RMProgram and the facility will be implemented as identified.  These improvements may be identified either as risk reduction measures during the PHA or as a result of an improved RMProgram and the dedication to an inherently safer process."
