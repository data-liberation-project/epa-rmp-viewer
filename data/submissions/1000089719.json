The facility receives, stores, and transfers a wide variety of bulk liquid materials including food grade oils, fuels, solvents, and industrial chemicals.  Bulk products are stored in aboveground storage tanks surrounded by secondary containment sized to contain a complete failure of the largest tank and rainfall associated with the 25 year, 24 hour storm event within the containment area.\n\n\n\nREGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED \n\n\n\nStolthaven handles more than the threshold quantities of Toluene 2,4-diisocyanate (TQ - 10,000 pounds), Toluene 2,6-diisoycyanate (TQ - 10,000 pounds), Allyl Alcohol (15,000 pounds) and Acrylonitrile (TQ - 20,000 pounds). Stolthaven is regulated under the Program 2 requirements of 40 CFR 68.10.\n\n\n\n\n\nACCICENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n\n\nStolthaven New Orleans, LLC is committed to operating in a safe and compliant manner. Employees involved in operating the Toluene diisocyanate (mixed isomers), Allyl Alcohol, and Acrylonitrile handling at the facility are trained to identify and understand the hazards posed during the storage and transfer process.  Training includes the review of information pertaining to the hazards of Toluene diisocyanate (mixed isomers), Allyl Alcohol, and Acrylonitrile as well as process technology, process equipment, and emergency response procedures. The facility maintains written process safety information to enable employees involved in handling Toluene diisocyanate (mixed isomers), Allyl Alcohol, and Acrylonitrile to identify and understand the hazards posed by these processes.  Written training information includes the physical properties of Toluene diisocyanate (mixed isomers), Allyl Alcohol, and Acrylonitrile as well as the health risks associated with chemical exposures, and safety data sheets.

SAFETY INFORMATION\n\nStolthaven maintains a variety of technical documents that are used to ensure safe operation of the process. Process Safety Information includes information pertaining to hazards of the highly hazardous chemicals in the process,  technology of the process,  and equipment in the process. Examples of Process Safety Information include but are not limited to safety data sheets and piping and instrumentation diagrams. Process Safety Information is available electronically on the Stolthaven internal server to ensure employee accessibility. This information informs employees of the hazards, safety precautions, and design related limits for the processes.\n\n\n\n2. HAZARD REVIEW\n\nStolthaven has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\n\n\nThe purpose of a PHA is to perform a systematic review of existing and/or proposed processes to identify, evaluate, and control process hazards.\n\n\n\nStolthaven uses one or more of the following PHA methods, as appropriate, to determine and evaluate the hazards of the process being analyzed:\n\n\n\n-What if\n\n-What If/Checklist\n\n-Hazard and Operability study (HAZOP)\n\n-Failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA)\n\n-Fault tree analysis or\n\n-An appropriate equivalent methodology.\n\n\n\nThe PHA "

The team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as prevention and mitigation measures currently in place and makes recommendations for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures as necessary to reduce risks to as low as reasonably practicable. Recommendations are reviewed by the Stolthaven Management Team and after approval, corrective actions are assigned and distributed to impacted personnel for follow-up.  \n\n\n\nAction items are tracked to closure to ensure that all follow-up items are completed in a timely manner.  Completed items are documented, and a copy of this document is placed in the PHA.  PHAs are revalidated at least every five years.  The revalidation includes a review of the changes and incidents that have taken place in the process since the last PHA and includes recommendations for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures. \n\n\n\n3. OPERATING PROCEDURES\n\nWritten operating procedures have been developed for the process areas, which address initial start-up, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations,  normal shutdown and start-up following a turnaround, or after an emergency shutdown. These operating procedures are stored electronically on an internal server for employee access and are periodically reviewed and revised. \n\n\n\n4. TRAINING\n\nStolthaven's training program includes formal on-boarding, job-specific training, compliance training, and safety training. Each employee involved in operating a process is trained in an overview of the process and in the operating procedures developed for that process. The Safety Manager or their designee is responsible for scheduling and coordinating the following training for RMP affected employees\n\n\n\n5. MAINTENANCE \n\nMaintenance includes all activities required to ensure proper design, construction, and ongoing integrity and reliability of equipment in order to pr"

Stolthaven has several written programs in place that detail well-established practices and procedures for the inspection, testing, monitoring, and maintenance of process equipment. Training is routinely conducted on these practices and procedures are periodically reviewed and updated.  \n\n\n\n6. COMPLIANCE AUDITS\n\nThe Stolthaven RMP program is audited every three years and includes verification that the procedures and practices that have been developed to comply with the RMP Prevention Program are adequate and being followed.   Compliance audits are conducted by at least one person knowledgeable in the process, and this person is impartial toward the facility or area being audited. The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to Stolthaven Management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked to closure.  The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are kept on the internal server.\n\n\n\n7. INCIDENT INVESTIGATION\n\nAn incident investigation must be conducted for every incident that resulted in or could reasonably have resulted in the catastrophic release of a regulated substance in a covered process. All incidents are reported and investigated according to the Incident Investigation Procedure. Results of the investigation and lessons learned are then shared with appropriate personnel to prevent future recurrence. Any corrective actions resulting from the incident investigation are tracked to closure.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN\n\n\n\nStolthaven is a responding facility and has a robust Integrated Contingency Plan, which outlines the coordination with local agencies in the event of spill or release. While the facility has not had an incident defined by the RMP Rule for the covered processes , all responding personnel have been trained and demonstrate competency that is appropriate to their level of activity in accor"
