      "SummaryText": "Refinery Risk Management Plan: Executive Summary\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Response Policies\n\nThe CITGO Petroleum Corporation Lemont Refinery believes that Safety, Environmental Stewardship, and being a good corporate neighbor are core business values.  To demonstrate these values substantial resources have been invested into the refinery in accident prevention.  It is our policy to include accident prevention in every part of our business, design, operations, and maintenance systems.  However, if a release should occur, substantial resources (trained response personnel and equipment) will respond to control and contain the release.\n\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nThe CITGO Petroleum Corporation Lemont Refinery operates a variety of processes to produce petroleum products from raw crude oil.  The refinery has several regulated flammable products, such as propane, butane, etc.  In addition, the refinery uses Hydrogen Fluoride and Ammonia in processes to produce consumer hydrocarbon products.\n\nHazard Assessment Results\n\nThe Worst-Case Release (WCS) Scenario for toxic substances in the refinery is assumed to be the rupture of one of the Rapid Deinventory (RADI) System Drums, which contains Hydrogen Fluoride.  Up to 272,000 lb. of HF is transferred to each RADI drum during emergencies and during maintenance turnaround (approximately 30 days every 4 years).  Although numerous controls to prevent such release and manage their consequences exist, no credit for administrative controls or mitigation measures were taken into account in evaluation of this scenario.  The maximum distance to the level of concern of 30 PPM was determined. EPA's Offsite Guidance Analysis Document was used to calculate the distance.\n\nThe Worst-Case Release (WCS) Scenario for flammable substances in the refinery is assumed to be the rupture of one of the Isobutane Storage Spheres.  The sphere contains 2,800,000 lbs. of Propylene/Butlylene. Although numerous"

The maximum distance to the level of concern of 1 psi for this WCS was calculated. EPA's Offsite Guidance Analysis Document was used to calculate the distance.\n\nThe alternate release scenario (ARS) for HF assumes that a line is sheered from the Acid Settler Rerun line.  After release, HF Detection would immediately detect and alarm to the unit operators.  It is assumed that for this size of a release, it would take 1.5 minutes for the operators to react, start the water curtains and water cannons, and for them to become fully operational. After the water curtain was activated and the water cannons were trained in on the leak, the HF release would be assumed to be mitigated. After 5 minutes all HF would be transferred to the RADI system. At this time, the emergency would effectively be over. The maximum distance to the level of concern of 30 PPM for this ARS was calculated. \n                                                                                                                                                                            The ARS for Ammonia assumes the release of ammonia from a hole/tear/connection leak in the loading hose.  Operations personnel at the ammonia tank would call a release and summons the fire brigade. A fire brigade member in SCBA would isolate the emergency isolation valve on tank discharge line.   The total time to mitigate these types of events is estimated to be between 10-20 minutes.

During this event, the released vapors could travel offsite and a flash fire could occur.  The resulting radiant heat exposure area of 5 KW/M2 was calculated.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in pace. The Lemont Refinery is designed to be safe as well as operate safely. Our Accident Prevention Program is a structured program, emphasizing management controls. The Program contains different elements, which are highly structured and are purposefully redundant.  They are intended to prevent releases and/or minimize the consequences of a release should one occur.\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nThe Refinery has a written plan to encourage employee participation in its prevention program.  All plant employees are to have their ideas and suggestions considered.  Employees give input into the program in many different ways; some of these include: Process Hazard Analysis participation, Member of Accident Investigations, writing and reviewing Operating Procedures, developing Unit Specific Training requirements, Safe Practice Standard Committee Membership, etc.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nThe foundation for safe plant operations is the knowledge of how it is designed, and how it should operate.  This knowledge must provide for identifying and understanding the hazards of the chemicals and processes of the plant.  It is required that this knowledge be documented. Process Safety Information comprises three categories:\n7 Hazards of materials\n7 Technical information\n7 Equipment design information\nThis information is made av"
