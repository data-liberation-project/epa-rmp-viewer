Emergency evacuation of the community, if necessary, would be coordinated by the Levittown Fire Dept.  The Levittown Fire Dept. is aware of the potential hazards at our facility, our emergency response plan and their role in responding to emergencies.  We do have an Emergency Action Plan, Risk Management Plan and Process Safety Management Plan and our employees are trained on each.  This facility undergoes annual safety training with our staff."
