Chemical specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS).\r\n\r\nWynnewood also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and\r\nconstruction of process equipment at the refinery. This information includes, but is not limited to, materials of construction, design pressure ratings, temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment. This information in combination with written procedures and trained personnel provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and refinery changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\r\nThe refinery has a comprehensive program to ensure that hazards associated with the processes are identified and controlled. Within this program, the process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that  adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.  \r\n\r\nWynnewood primarily uses the hazard and operability analysis (HAZOP) and What-if/Checklist techniques to\r\nperform these evaluations. The analyses are conducted using a team of refinery personnel who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise, and may include third parties. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures. The team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are needed. Any identified risks are promptly addressed.
