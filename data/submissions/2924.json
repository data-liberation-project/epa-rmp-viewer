      "SummaryText": "The South Meridian Water Treatment Plant is located south east of downtown Meridian.  It is a Class A surface water capable treatment plant.  This site stores less than 20,000 pounds of chlorine in a three sided brick constructed building.  The building is equipped with chlorine leak detection system that gives visual and audio warning at the detection of 1PPM chlorine gas released into the structure.  This building is located north of the main entrance gate.  The Meridian Fire Department (Class 4) and the Lauderdale County Emergency Management Agency are equipped to respond to chemical emergencies.  This facility has eleven full-time employees.  This plant has an operator on duty 24 hours a day seven days a week.\n\nA new chlorine system was installed in 1998 using Bailey Controls equipment.  No changes to this system is scheduled in the near future.\n\nWe have had no accidental releases of chlorine in the past five years.  This can be largely contributed to practice safe handling and hook up of tanks.\n\nOur worst case scenario involves off loading the delivery truck and dropping a one ton cylinder.  In the urban setting of Meridian, we would have to evacuate schools, hospitals, residents, prisons, recreation areas and major industrial areas.  The release rate in this scenario would be 200 pounds/minute for ten minutes."
