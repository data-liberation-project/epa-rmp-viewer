      "SummaryText": "try.  The plant's two main processes are emulsion s and wet-strength resins.  The resins produced prevent wetting and penetration of the pulp fibers and are used in a variety of products from writing paper to food packaging.  The wet-strength resins are used in paper tissue and towels, so that they will not come apart easily when they get wet. \n\n\n\nEpichlorohydrin is a raw material for the Kymene process and is consumed in a chemical reaction to make the wet-strength resin.  The plant receives epichlorohydrin in tank trucks and railroad tank cars and stores the material in a gallon storage tank that holds a maximum of 206,000 pounds.  The storage tank is provided with a containment dike to minimize the adverse impacts from any leaks or spills.  Spill containment capability is also provided for the area where tank trucks are unloaded.\n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release and Accident Prevention Program:\n\n\n\nThe Chicopee plant is subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management standard (29 CFR 1910.119) and has a complete process safety management system in place.  This includes the use of process hazards analysis to identify and address potential hazards, management of change procedures to control modifications, mechanical integrity procedures for minimizing mechanical failures, detailed operating procedures for process control, and operator training for the personnel involved in the process.\n\n\n\nFive Year Accident History:\n\n\n\nThere was one incident involving epichlorohydrin which occurred on 3/10/2015 where a tank truck of caustic was brought in that was labeled and placarded as epichlorohydrin.  The Chicopee Plant unloader caught the issue between the paper work and truck labeling and placarding which prevented the caustic from being pumped into the epichlorohydrin storage tank.  The resulting mixture could have resulted in an exothermic reaction causing a release of the mixed materials.  Corrective actions were implemented at the site and information was shared with the suppl"

There have not been any other incidents in the reporting period that involved epichlorohydrin.      \n\n\n\nThere have been no injuries on-site or off-site over the past 5-years as a result of reported incidents.  There have been no environmental impacts on-site or off-site over the past 5-years as a result of reported incidents. \n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program:\n\n\n\nThe Chicopee Plant has written emergency response plans and coordinates emergency response matters with the Chicopee Fire Department and the District Hazmat Team.  The plant provides ongoing emergency response training for all plant employees.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:\n\n\n\nThe site conducted a PHA Revalidation on 5/20/2019 and came up with the following recommendations;\n\n\n\n1. Line Labeling at the Reactors - Consider reviewing the labeling, particularly for the lines around the reactors, from the perspective of a new employee and look at replacing damaged labels and making sure all \n\n   lines into the reactors are labeled.\n\n\n\n2. DETA Rail Car Dry Disconnects - If the supplier cannot supply rail cars of DETA equipped with the dry disconnects, consider eliminating the attachment of a dry disconnect as this makes rail car connection more \n\n   difficult without adding significantly to the safety of the operation in terms of operator exposure.\n\n\n\n3. Work Instruction Reviews - It is important from a compliance standpoint to insure that work instructions for the process are reviewed annually.  WI-065-0214-064 and WI-065-0214-065 were more than a month \n\n   overdue for the review as indicated on the WI.  \n\n\n\n4. P&ID Updating - Aside from the 5000 gallon reactor P&ID, the other process drawings have not been updated in at least 6 years although red line changes have occured. \n\n\n\nSite Security:\n\n\n\nFrom a physical security standpoint the site has added \"No Trespassing\" signage to the main gate and plant fenceline.
