      "SummaryText": "Lisbon Gas Plant Risk Management Plan: Executive Summary\r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICIES \r\n\r\nThe Lisbon Gas Plant has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, gas plant trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release. \r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES \r\n\r\nThe Lisbon Gas Plant, located in the Lisbon Valley Industrial Area, 35 miles south of Moab (San Juan County), Utah, operates a process to produce petroleum products (e.g., natural gas, propane, butane, crude oil, condensate) from natural gas. The Lisbon Gas Plant has several regulated flammables, such as propane and butane. The Lisbon Gas Plant does not use and/or process any regulated toxic substances above threshold quantities. \r\n\r\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS RESULTS \r\n\r\nThe worst-case scenario (WCS) associated with a release of flammable substances in the Program Level 3 process at the gas plant is a vapor cloud explosion (VCE) involving the full inventory of the largest storage tank containing propane. A written procedure is in place to limit the storage inventory to 300,000 lbs. (80% of the maximum tank capacity); therefore, the reduced inventory is assumed to release and ignite, resulting in a VCE. The maximum distance to the l-psi endpoint for this WCS is 0.50 mile, resulting in offsite impact. Although we have numerous controls to prevent such releases and to manage their consequences, no credit for passive mitigation measures was taken into account in evaluating this WCS. \r\n\r\nThe alternative release scenario (ARS) for flammable substances at the gas plant is a vapor cloud explosion"

The maximum distance to the 1-psi endpoint for this event is 0.4 mile, resulting in offsite impact. This event was selected as being a practical scenario for use in emergency planning and response. \r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM \r\n\r\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the plant. Because the process at the gas plant that is regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) risk management program (RMP) regulation is also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) process safety management (PSM) standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEmployee Participation \r\n\r\nThe Lisbon Gas Plant encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention. Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team. Employees have access to all information created as part of the gas plant accident prevention program. Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the gas plant and addresses each accident prevention program element. In addition, the gas plant has a number of initiatives under way that address process safety and employee safety issues. These initiatives include forming teams to promote both process and personal safety. The teams typically have members from various areas of the plant, including operations, maintenance, engineering, and plant management.\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information \r\n\r\nThe Lisbon Gas Plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation o"

These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information. Specific departments within the gas plant are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information. A table summarizing the reference documents and their location is readily available as part of the written employee participation plan to help employees locate any necessary process safety information. \r\n\r\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/ exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs) .This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals. For specific process areas, the gas plant has documented safety- related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) in a Key Process Parameter Document. The gas plant ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems). \r\n\r\nThe gas plant also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment. This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment. This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised. \r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\r\n\r\nThe Lisbon Gas Plant has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the process are identifi"

Within this program, the process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards. \r\n\r\nThe Lisbon Gas Plant primarily uses the hazard and operability study (HAZOP) and whatif/checklist analysis techniques to perform these evaluations. HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques. The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary. \r\n\r\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to local management for resolution. Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team. This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention. All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed. The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained. \r\n\r\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the plant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results. These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating. The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained. Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained. \r\n\r\nOperating Procedures \r\n\r\nThe Lisbon Gas Plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process opera"

These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate. The procedures are kept current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process. \r\n\r\nIn addition, the Lisbon Gas Plant maintains a Key Process Parameter Document that provides guidance on how to respond to upper or lower limit exceedances for specific process or equipment parameters. This information, along with written operating procedures, readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks. \r\n\r\nTraining \r\n\r\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the Lisbon Gas Plant has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process. New employees receive basic training in gas plant operations if they are not already familiar with such operations. After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process- specific duties and tasks. After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently. In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level. This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years. All training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training. \r\n\r\nContractors \r\n\r\nThe Lisbon Gas Plant uses contractors to supplement its wo"

Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the gas plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform gas plant personnel of any hazards that they find during their work. This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work. In addition, the Lisbon Gas Plant evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor. Gas plant personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations. \r\n\r\nPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs) \r\n\r\nThe Lisbon Gas Plant conducts a PSSR for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information. The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service. This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready. The PSSR review team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness. A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented. \r\n\r\nMechanical Integrity \r\n\r\nThe Lisbon Gas Plant has well-established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps"

The basic aspects of this program include: (1) conducting training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting identified deficiencies, and (5) applying quality assurance measures. In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process. \r\n\r\nMaintenance personnel receive training on (1) an overview of the process, (2) safety and health hazards, (3) applicable maintenance procedures, (4) emergency response plans, and (5) applicable safe work practices to help ensure that they can perform their jobs in a safe manner. Written procedures help ensure that work is performed in a consistent manner and provide a basis for training. Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels) .If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service (if possible), or a management of change team will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment. \r\nAnother integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance. The Lisbon Gas Plant incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs. This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made. \r\n\r\nSafe Work Practices \r\n\r\nThe Lisbon Gas Plant has long-standing safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety. Examples of these include (I) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous substanc"

These procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely. \r\n\r\nManagement of Change \r\n\r\nThe Lisbon Gas Plant has a comprehensive system to manage changes to the covered processes. This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented. Changes are reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change. Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures, are updated to incorporate these changes. In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on the change. \r\n\r\nIncident Investigation \r\n\r\nThe Lisbon Gas Plant promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury. The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident. The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to gas plant management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are re"

Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years so that the reports can be reviewed during future PHAs and PHA revalidations. \r\n\r\nCompliance Audits \r\n\r\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, the Lisbon Gas Plant periodically conducts an audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented. Compliance audits are conducted at least every 3 years. Contract personnel from consulting firms who are knowledgeable in the audit process will participate as audit team members. The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to gas plant management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are retained. \r\n\r\nCHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS \r\n\r\nThe process at the Lisbon Gas Plant has hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation. The following is a description of existing safety features applicable to prevention of accidental releases of regulated substances in the facility. \r\n\r\nUniversal Prevention Activities \r\n\r\nThe accident prevention program summarized previously is applied to the RMP- covered process at the Lisbon Gas Plant. Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human errors. \r\n\r\nSpecialized Safety Features \r\n\r\nThe Lisbon Gas Plant has safety features on many units to help (1) contain/control a release, (2) quickly detect a release, and (3) reduce the consequences of (mitigate) a release.  The following types of safety features are used in the covered process: \r\n\r\nRelease Detection \r\n-\tHydrocarbon & atmospheric detectors with alarms \r\nRelease Containment/Control \r\n-\tProcess reli"
