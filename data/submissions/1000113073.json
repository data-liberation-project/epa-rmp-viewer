      "SummaryText": "Lion Elastomers LP Port Neches Plant is a Styrene Butadiene Rubber manufacturing facility employing approximately 225 people. The plant was constructed in 1943 and is a producer of synthetic rubber for the manufacturing of automobile tires, shoe soles and a wide variety of rubber products. The plant follows strict  procedures for managing hazardous materials to minimize or totally eliminate releases. A trained fire brigade is maintained to respond to emergencies.  \r\n\r\nThe facility receives butadiene by pipline. Feedstocks are combined in reactors to produce latex. Resulting latex is coagulated, washed and dewatered. The rubber is then broken into small pieces and dried prior to packaging. \r\n\r\nThe only material managed in the plant at quantities above the RMP threshold is 1,3-Butadiene.  Butadiene is a flammable material and is a primary ingredient in rubber.  Approximately 1,000,000 lbs of butadiene is stored or processed on site in six reactor units, two recovery units and a tank farm. \r\n\r\nTo prevent releases the plant has implemented numerous measures in accordance with process safety management standards, including the following: Operator training based on thorough procedures, maintining up to date process safety information, mechanical integrity testing of equipment in butadiene service, conducting process hazards analysis and follow through with recommendations, managing changes in the proces so that procedures, training and PSI are all updated and conducting compliance audits and incident investigations.   \r\n                                                                                               \r\nNo accidents meeting the criteria of RMP have been recorded in the accident history."
