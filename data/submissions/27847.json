      "SummaryText": "SUMCO USA is a division of Sumitomo Mitsubishi Silicon Group and is a full service supplier of electronic grade polished and epitaxial silicon wafers to the semiconductor industry.  MSA has two facilities in Salem: the North Campus and the South Campus.  The SUMCO USA - North Campus has three processes within the campus boundary that each use a chemical subject to the RMP regulation - trichlorosilane (TCS) for the epi process (CVD), anhydrous hydrogen chloride (HCl) for the epi process (CVD reactor etching), and anhydrous ammonia (NH3) for wet cleaning of wafers.  SUMCO USA owns the TCS and NH3 systems, however the HCl system is owned, operated, and maintained by Air Products.  SUMCO USA received permission from EPA Region 10 to complete the RMP submittal for all covered process systems onsite.\n\nPursuant to the Accidental Release Risk Management Planning regulations (40 CFR 68) and the Process Safety Management (PSM) standard, SUMCO USA has developed a comprehensive PSM written program to protect workers and the surrounding community from exposure to the hazardous chemicals onsite.  The facility completed a series of process hazards analyses for each hazardous chemical process using the Hazards and Operability (HAZOP) methodology.  The PHAs were completed using technical and operations staff from the SUMCO USA facility (including contract employees from Air Products responsible for the design, operation, and maintenance) as well as experienced facilitators from outside engineering firms.  As a result of the HAZOPs, numerous safeguards were implemented to enhance chemical and process safety onsite.\n\nSUMCO USA's implementation of the PSM program includes employee education in the hazards of the covered chemicals and measures that can be used to reduce employee and community exposure to accidental releases of these chemicals. The plans include preventive maintenance programs (mechanical integrity) for the TCS, HCl, and NH3 systems, and a program for both pre-startup sa"

The program also includes specific requirements for safe work practices (such as safe approaches to welding and similar hot work) and safety requirements for contractors who may be hired to work on the systems. SUMCO USA also periodically audits their chemical system suppliers' systems to ensure they meet their requirements with respect to Process Safety Management.\n\nLastly, the PSM written program incorporates the SUMCO USA - North Campus' emergency response plan and places special emphasis on handling accidental releases of hazardous chemicals and coordination of emergency response with local fire departments and other emergency response organizations.\n\nAs part of the RMP requirements, SUMCO USA undertook a review of the potential offsite consequences of the accidental releases of the largest vessels in each of the TCS, HCl, and NH3 processes at the North Campus.  Although such releases are highly unlikely, the regulation requires this review.  The following is a description of the results:\n\nFlammable Materials - Trichlorosilane Process\nSUMCO USA's analysis indicates that the worst-case release for the TCS process would involve the release of the entire contents of the outdoor storage tank containing liquid TCS.  This resulting release would create the potential to affect small local businesses and residences located in close proximity to the storage tank.\n\nSUMCO USA has analyzed incidents occurring at other semiconductor facilities, past operating experience, and the results of the internal process hazards analysis (PHA), to determine an alternative case.  For the North Campus TCS system, this release is assumed to be a disconnection of the transfer line from the supplier's delivery tank to the storage tank onsite. In an attempt to establish an alternate release with a radius of affect extending beyond the facility fence line, SUMCO USA assumed a conservative release duration of 60 minutes, which disr"

According to the US Census data, such a scenario would create the potential to affect two persons offsite.\n\nToxic Materials - Ammonia and Hydrogen Chloride Processes\nSUMCO USA stores two regulated toxic chemicals onsite - anhydrous hydrogen chloride in tube trailers and anhydrous ammonia in a pressure vessel. An analysis of the worst-case scenario was completed for both chemicals, both of which assumed the release of the entire contents of the largest vessel in ten minutes.  The worst case scenario for HCl was assumed to be the release of the entire contents of one of the tubes on the tube trailer, and resulted in a potential exposure area reaching offsite receptors.  The worst case for NH3 assumed the release of the entire contents of the storage vessel (taking into consideration the 85% level control on the tank) and resulted in a greater radius of affect than that of the HCl system.  As only the worst case with the largest potential impact is reported, the ammonia release results are included in the submission document. \n\nIn determining the alternate case scenario for HCL, SUMCO USA analyzed incidents occurring at other semiconductor facilities and the results of the internal process hazards analysis (PHA).  SUMCO USA chose a conservative alternate release scenario for the HCl system which assumes a shear of the HCl delivery line from the tube trailer manifold resulting in a release with the potential to affect offsite receptors including residences and businesses.  A more likely scenario for the HCl system would be a release through a relief valve; this was not chosen as it would not be likely to reach an offsite receptor as the relief valves are routed directly to a scrubber system onsite.  The alternate scenario chosen for the NH3 system assumes a leak through a hole in the storage vessel.  Such a release would"
