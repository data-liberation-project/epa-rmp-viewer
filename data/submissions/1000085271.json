The primary purpose of the facility is to process potato into food products such as french fries for distribution to retailers and restaurants. \n\n\n\nAmmonia is classified by EPA as a toxic chemical and it is necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling it to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the health threat to our own workers, and reduce the threat to nearby members of the community.  It is our policy to adhere to all Federal and state rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon a combination of the manner in which we handle ammonia, the safety devices inherent in the design of this facility, the safe handling procedures that we use, and the training of our personnel.\n\n\n\nWe have a written Process Safety Management (PSM) plan in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.119. A crucial component of this plan is the Emergency Response Plan, developed in compliance with the Emergency Response provisions of 29 CFR 1910.120.\n\n\n\n1.10 Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nAn accidental release prevention program has been in place since the start up of the existing facility in 1996. The facility was constructed using the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) guidelines, and is in compliance with state codes.  \n\n\n\nAll of our ammonia refrigeration operators are trained using on the job training and a formal training program.  This program consists of having an effective preventative maintenance program and comprehensive employee training to insure adequate response to equipment integrity.  \n\n\n\nThe process has numerous safeguards including:  \n\n-Ammonia is not corrosive in this service.    \n\n-Most of the lines are elevated to minimize potential damage from fork lifts.  \n\n-The Plant has an overall safety program that includes employee awareness and trai"

A team with expertise in engineering, operations, maintenance, and safety evaluated the existing refrigeration system in depth and developed recommendations to improve the safety and operability of the system.  The PHA addressed:  (1) process hazards; (2) previous incidents; (3) engineering and administrative controls applicable to the hazards; (4) the consequence of control failure; (5) facility siting; (6) human factors; and (7) a qualitative evaluation of possible safety and health effects of control system failures.  \n\n\n\n\n\n1.20 Facility Description And Substances Handled\n\n\n\nThe regulated substance handled at the facility is anhydrous ammonia. Anhydrous ammonia is used to refrigerate areas of the facility where food products are processed and/or stored. The refrigeration equipment compresses, condenses, and evaporates ammonia in a closed loop system to remove heat from areas within the facility. \n\n\n\n\n\n1.30 The worst-case release scenario(s) and the alternative release scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario.\n\n\n\nRelease scenarios were modeled using RMP*Comp (Version 2.01), a software program developed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and EPA. Offsite receptors were defined using ESRI ArcMap 10.1 in conjunction with Google Maps. This system estimates residential population within the circle defined by the endpoint of the worst-case and alternative release scenarios. In addition, it lists whether certain types of public receptors and environmental receptors are within the circles.\n\n\n\n\n\n1.40 General Accidental Release Prevention Program And Chemical-specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nCavendish Farms complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes"

The design and construction of this facility was in accordance with published standards, tests or recommended methods of trade, industry or governmental organizations.\n\n\n\nCavendish Farms' written PSM plan incorporates many policies and procedures to ensure safe operation and maintenance of this facility. Plan elements essential to safe operation of the refrigeration system include employee participation, process hazard information, process hazard analysis, operating procedures, training, contractor safety, pre-startup safety review, mechanical integrity, management of change, hot-work permits, incident investigation, emergency response and planning, and compliance audits. This plan will be reviewed periodically and updated as necessary. \n\n\n\nWritten Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) were prepared to provide the basis for proper and safe operation of the ammonia refrigeration system.  The SOPs include procedures for normal operations, startup, shutdown, emergency operations, and emergency shutdown.  \n\n\n\nFor projects, a management of change procedure and a pre-startup safety review are in place to ensure that system changes or expansions are safe and that the changes are consistent with the engineering design and in condition to be operated prior to startup.  \n\n\n\nContractors that are used to work on, or adjacent to, the refrigeration system are \"pre-qualified\" based upon their knowledge of ammonia refrigeration, understanding of applicable codes and standards, and their demonstrated ability to work safely.  Each of these contractors is evaluated from a safety perspective.  \n\n\n\nThe Plant has a program for replacement of all Safety Relief Valves on a 5 year interval as recommended by IIAR.\n\n\n\n\n\n1.50 Five-Year Accident History\n\n\n\nThere has been no significant release of ammonia at Cavendish Farms in the past five years that has resulted in death, injury, or significant property damage on site or off-site death, injury, evacuation, sheltering in place,"
