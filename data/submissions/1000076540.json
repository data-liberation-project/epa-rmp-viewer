This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention (e.g., training of personnel, considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the facility, etc.).  Our approach is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances as well as other substances.  If a release does occur, our trained personnel will take steps to control and contain it, until local emergency organizations arrive.  Additional details are included in the other sections of this plan.\n\n\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances  \n\n\n\nThe King Ranch Gas Plant, located about 14 miles southwest of Kingsville, TX, consists of one Program Level 3 process that utilizes several operations (e.g., separation, dehydration, compression, refrigeration) to produce petroleum products (e.g., natural gas liquid mixture, methane) from a naturally occurring hydrocarbon gas mixture.  \n\n\n\nThis plant could contain regulated flammables, but no regulated toxic inventories, in excess of threshold quantities established in the regulation.  Transportation into the facility is handled via pipelines and out of the facility via pipelines and trucking.  This plant is surrounded by unoccupied ranch land.\n\n\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis Results \n\n\n\nIn accordance with special security guidance provided by the USEPA, data addressing the facility's Offsite Consequence Analyses (Worst Case Scenarios and Alternate Release Scenarios) are not detailed in this section.  Refer to Data Element Sections 4 and 5 of this plan.\n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\n\n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at this facility.

This summary addresses each of the EPA RMP elements and describes the management systems in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\n\n\nThis plant provides for and encourages employees to participate in process safety management and accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation include plant employees compiling and updating technical information and drawings, participating in Process Hazard Analysis (PHA), initiating a Management of Change (MOC), participating in Pre-Startup Safety Reviews (PSSR),and participating in incident investigations.  Employees have access to information related to the accident prevention program.  Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are detailed in an Employee Participation Plan that is maintained at this plant and addresses each program element.  In addition, this plant has other initiatives that address process and employee safety issues (e.g., hazard reporting/resolution process and numerous safety meetings [daily, monthly, pre-job], etc.).\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information (PSI)\n\n\n\nThis plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the process.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, safe operating limits for key process parameters, specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  The Plant's PSM Coordinator is responsible for ensuring plant personnel maintain and update accurate PSI.\n\n\n\nChemical-specific information (including exposure hazards, emergency response, and exposure treatment considerations) is provided in material safety data sheets.  For specific process areas, this plant has documented safety-related operating limits for process parameters (e.g., temperature, pressure, level) in the operating procedures"

This plant ensures processes are maintained within these limits using process controls/monitoring equipment, trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems, pressure relief valves).\n\n\n\nThis plant also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of the process equipment.  This information includes the materials of construction, design pressure, temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment.  This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for inspection/maintenance activities and the evaluation of proposed process or facility changes.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\n\n\nThis plant has a comprehensive program to help ensure hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\n\n\nIn the most recent PHA cycle, the plant utilized a PHA delta revalidation process, an industry-accepted hazard evaluation technique for RMP and PSM-covered processes.  The analyses are conducted using a team of facility operations/maintenance personnel, facility engineers, and technical consultants (as necessary).  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the processes as well as the accident prevention and mitigation measures.  \n\n\n\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to management to coordinate further evaluation and resolution.  This process involves field level business teams, which include engineering, operations personnel, and management.  Operations personnel are also involved in the evaluation of resolution options.  Implementation of the resolutions is prioritized for accomplishment based on relative risk.  Resolution plans are tracked until completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\n\n\nTo help ensure the process controls an"

Similarly, the team's findings are forwarded to management to coordinate further evaluation and resolution, and the final resolution of findings are documented and retained.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\n\n\nThe King Ranch Gas Plant maintains written procedures that address the various modes of process operations (e.g., startup, normal, temporary, emergency shutdown, normal shutdown) and provide guidance on how to respond to upper/lower limit exceedances for specific equipment or process parameters.  Procedures are readily available to operators and other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.  These procedures provide a consistent basis for training new operators and are annually reviewed and validated.  The Operating Procedures are revalidated annually and endorsed by the plant's Operations Manager for accuracy verification.  Revisions to Operating Procedures are made through the Management of Change (MOC) process.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\n\n\nNew employees receive basic training in facility operations (e.g., process overview, applicable procedure reviews, etc.).  New operators are then paired with experienced operators to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After the new operators demonstrate (e.g., written tests, hands-on skills demonstration) that they have adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they are certified and allowed to work independently.  In addition, personnel who operate process equipment receive refresher training at least every 3 years on the applicable procedures to help ensure their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This training and the means used to verify that the employee understood the training is documented.\n\n\n\nContractors\n\n\n\nThis plant uses c"

Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, procedures are in place to help ensure contractors: perform their work in a safe manner, have the appropriate knowledge and skills, are aware of the hazards in the workplace, understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, understand and follow safety rules, and inform plant personnel of any hazards they find during their work.  This is accomplished by providing contractors an orientation prior to working in this plant which includes: a process overview, information about safety and health hazards, applicable emergency action plan provisions, and information on safe work practices.  Also, a job safety analysis (JSA) is reviewed/updated or developed by the contractors (with facility personnel assistance as needed) prior to maintenance/construction tasks.\n\n\n\nPlant personnel routinely monitor contractor job performance to help ensure they are fulfilling their safety obligations.  Contractor safety programs and performance are evaluated during the initial selection process, and the plant supervisor conducts periodic evaluations of safety performance.\n\n\n\nPre-Startup Safety Reviews (PSSR)\n\n\n\nThis plant conducts PSSRs for facility modifications that require significant changes in the process safety information.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides an additional check to make sure that construction is in accordance with the design specifications and supporting systems are operationally ready.  A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality function by verifying that the requirements of this accident prevention program are properly implemented.  \n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity (MI)\n\n\n\nThe King Ranch Gas Plant has well-established practices and "
