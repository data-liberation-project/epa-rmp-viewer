A Safety and Risk Manager has been assigned to ensure that safe practices are followed in the specification and operation of systems involving hazardous chemicals.  This site has developed and trained an Emergency Response Team to ensure rapid and appropriate response to ammonia emergencies.  The site has specific and written evacuation, reporting, and response procedures in place to protect BC Systems employees, the public, and the environment in the event of an ammonia release. Due to the seasonality of this operation, the Yuma, Arizona facility is operational for six months out of the year - from November to April.  During the on-season months, there are five portable ammonia refrigeration systems on site and operational, containing a total volume of 20,577 lbs of ammonia.  There is an additional 3000 lbs of ammonia stored in a nurse tank.  During the off-months (May through October) three of the refrigeration units are transported to an alternate location and the total quantity of ammonia (23,577 lbs) is stored in nurse tanks.  One unit remains at Yuma full time, but this is considered portable due to its configuration.  The anhydrous ammonia refrigeration units are used for room cooling and process water chilling.  This system is depicted on the block flow diagram in Figure 5-1.  This ammonia refrigeration system is the only process at this site to which the RMP requirements are applicable.\n1.2.\tStationary Source and Regulated Substance\nThe BC Systems plant covered by this RMP is located at 6581 East Cattle Drive, Yuma, Arizona. The facility receives lettuce and other produce to be processed, packaged for consumer use in various salad mixes, set for short-term storage, and transported and distributed from this site.\nThe regulated substance is anhydrous ammonia.

The motor on the compressor suddenly seized, causing a sudden vibration that led to a failure of the A\u00c2\u00beA\u00c2\u00bf oil return line at the threaded fittings.  The failure led to the release.  During the incident,"
