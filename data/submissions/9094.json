      "SummaryText": "     At Shickley Grain Company, Inc., we do everything we can to make our business as safe as possible for our employees and the community surrounding us. We handle one controlled substance here at Shickley Grain Co.: anhydrous ammonia. Shickley Grain Co. is a small country grain elevator that stores and purchases grain from area farmers and sells it to the best market(feedlots, processing facilities, or terminal elevators).  We also sell anhydrous ammonia to farmers to be used as fertilizer.   Our anhydrous ammonia storage facility is located on the extreme northwest edge of Shickley, over one quarter of a mile from the residential area of town.  At this location, we have two 30,000 gallon storage tanks and approximately sixty 1000 gallon nurse tanks which the farmers use to transport the anhydrous ammonia to their fields.   This location was chosen to keep the hazardous product(anhydrous ammonia) as far as possible from the general public.\n     In a worst-case scenario, one of the 30,000 gallon storage tanks could leak out and the escaping gas could endanger the community of Shickley and anyone within 3.7 miles of the facility.  To reduce the chance of something like this happening, excess flow valves are utilized so that in the scenario that a leak would occur, the excess flow valve should limit the amount that could escape.\n     We have had no accidents in the past five years.  To try and prevent accidents, our employees our trained on the safe handling of anhydrous ammonia and what to do if an accident would occur.   These training methods are reviewed twice a year(once prior to the fall fertilizer season and once prior to the spring fertilizer season).  Also, we coordinate our emergency response plan with the Fillmore County LEPC and the Shickley Volunteer Fire Department."
