      "SummaryText": "\nSid Richardson Energy Services Co.\n\nKeystone Gas Plant\n\nExecutive Summary RMP\n\n\n\nSid Richardson Energy Services Co. is a privately held company that has been in \n\nthe gas processing business for more than 50 years.  We operate natural gas \n\nprocessing plants in West Texas and Southeast New Mexico.  The Keystone gas \n\nplant has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety.  This \n\ncommitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, \n\nsuch as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, \n\noperation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement \n\nreasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  \n\nHowever, if a release does occur, trained gas plant personnel will respond to \n\ncontrol and contain the release.  \n\n\n\nThis facility gathers field natural gas for processing.  The facility and system \n\nof pipelines is jurisdictional to the Environmental Protection Agency, Texas \n\nNatural Resources Conservation Commission, Texas Railroad Commission, the \n\nOccupational Safety and Health Administration, and the United States Department \n\nof Transportation.  This facility is covered by OSHA PSM standard.  Any agency \n\nconducting facility inspections, report findings to Sid Richardson Energy \n\nServices Co. corporate management.\n\n\n\nThe Keystone gas plant is located northeast of Kermit Texas in Winkler County.  \n\nThe plant operates a variety of processes to separate raw natural gas into \n\nmethane gas and natural gas liquid, with condensate and compression liquids as \n\nby-products.\n\n\n\nSeveral regulated flammables occur as various mixtures in the natural gas stream \n\nbeing processed and in the produced liquids.  These are methane, ethane, butane, \n\npropane, and pentane.  These mixtures meet the NFPA 4 flammability criteria, and \n\nthe mixtures are present in amounts above the threshold quantity.  Propylene and \n\nmethyl alcohol, also regulated flammables, are purchased for use in th"

The quantity on hand of each of these toxics is less than the \n\nthreshold quantity, so they are not covered processes under the RMP.  However, \n\nboth of these toxics are addressed in our existing emergency action plan.  In \n\naddition, the hydrogen sulfide gas is covered under Texas Statewide Rule 36, \n\nthat deals with the protection of the general public. This facility does not \n\nhave a threshold planning quantity of any toxic; therefore, a worst-case \n\nscenario (WCS) for a toxic release was not evaluated.  \n\n\n\nThe Keystone gas plant has an excellent record in preventing accidental \n\nreleases.  Over the past five years there have been no releases that resulted \n\nin, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, toxic gas accident, \n\nmajor property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury at this facility.\n\n\n\nCovered processes involving regulated flammable substances are all Program Level \n\n1.  There are no public or environmental receptors within any endpoint.  \n\nAlthough Program Level 1 limits scenarios to overpressure resulting from a VCE \n\ninvolving the entire vessel contents, it should be noted that the farthest \n\noverpressure endpoint of 0.60 mile is unrealistically high, in that this is an \n\natmospheric storage vessel with hydrocarbon liquid at ambient temperature.  A \n\nrealistic scenario would be a pool fire for the contents of this vessel, which \n\nwould yield an endpoint of 0.39 mile rather that the 0.60 mile, which results \n\nfrom a VCE.\n\n\n\nThe Keystone gas plant has an excellent record in preventing accidental \n\nreleases.

This provides a means of \n\nnotifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick \n\nresponse to an incident.  Our facility has 34 full time employees and operates \n\n24 hours/day and 365 days/year.\n\n\n\nThe emergency response program for the Keystone gas plant is coordinated with \n\nthe Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) for Winkler County.  \n\n\n\n"
