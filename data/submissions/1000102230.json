      "SummaryText": "RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nPatriot Renewable Fuels, LLC\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICIES:\nPatriot Renewable Fuels, LLC (CHS Annawan) has an ongoing commitment to the health and safety of onsite employees and the surrounding community. This commitment is demonstrated in the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training for the proper operation and maintenance of plant equipment and preventative maintenance programs.\n\nCHS Annawan has emergency response policies in place that are addressed in the facility's Health and Safety Plan; Industrial Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan; Spill Prevention, Controls, and Countermeasures Plan; and Emergency Action Plan. Most of the listed Plans require a minimum of annual training in order to keep employees educated on emergency response procedures in place at the facility. All new employees are required to undergo training on emergency response procedures prior to initiating responsibilities onsite.\n\nCHS Annawan\u0092s policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, plant personnel will respond to contain the release as necessary.\n\nThe primary emergency coordinator for CHS Annawan is Adam Childs, Plant Operations Director. His work and 24-hour emergency response telephone numbers are provided in the Registration Section of this document. The following individuals (with associated work and 24-hour emergency response telephone numbers) are below:\n\nKaren Camden, EHS Coordinator \nWork:\t(309) 935-5700\n24-Hour: (309) 312-1806\n\nLogan Van Rheenen Production Manager \nWork:(309) 935- 5700\n24-Hour: (815) 910-7221\n\nDESCRIPTION OF STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES:\nCHS Annawan\u0091s ethanol plant is located in Annawan, Henry County, Illinois. The facility operates 24 hours per day, 7 days per week for the purpose of manufacturing fuel grade ethanol from corn. The regulated substances under the RMP prog"

The worst-case scenario used is a release of the entire contents of the storage vessel, creating a vapor cloud. A determination spreadsheet is included as part of backup documentation onsite detailing the conversion from gallons to pounds of ammonia. RMP Comp was used to determine the worst-case distance to endpoint; the model results were 5.1 miles radius and are also included as part of the backup documentation maintained onsite. The ammonia tank sits on a concrete pad, passive mitigation was not included as part of this scenario. Population data was obtained using Circular Area Profiling Software (CAPS) which incorporates 2010 U.S. Census Data. Public receptor information (i.e., schools, hospitals, etc.) was obtained using Google Earth. Graddett Ditch, Hennepin Canal, Elm Island Ditch, Mineral Marsh Ditch, Kuhn Ditch No 2, Kuhn Ditch No 1, Bureau County Ditch, Goose Pond Ditch, Hickory Creek, Mud Creek, King Creek, Coal Creek, Lawson Creek, Dow Lateral, Broadbent Lateral, Shabbona Special Ditch, and Mineral Marsh Nature Preserve are located within the worst-case distance to endpoint for ammonia.\n\n2.\tFlammable Mixture (Denaturant): The flammable mixture stored onsite is natural gasoline, typically referred to as denaturant. Natural gasoline is used onsite to denature ethanol prior to shipment offsite. Denaturant is stored in an aboveground steel tank in the facility tank farm. The tank is located in a diked containment structure that contains an impermeable liner with gravel overlay. A worst case SDS was used to determine RMP applicability. The worst-case scenario used is the release of the entire contents of the denaturant tank, causing a vapor cloud explosion. RMP Comp was used to determine the worst-case d"

Population data was obtained using Circular Area Profiling Software (CAPS) which incorporates 2010 U.S. Census Data. Public receptor information (i.e., schools, hospitals, etc.) was obtained using Google Earth as well as the facility's knowledge of nearby residences. The Hennepin Canal and Graddett Ditch are located with the worst-case distance to endpoint for denaturant.\n\nAlternative Scenario:\n1.\tAnhydrous Ammonia: The alternative scenario used for anhydrous ammonia is a release due to a rupture disk/relief valve failure from the ammonia piping system. This scenario is considered the most likely cause of an ammonia release onsite. The alternative duration is assumed to be 30 minutes with an atmospheric stability of D and a wind speed of 3.0 m/sec. The facility control room is manned 24 hours/day and would be alerted of the relief valve failure at the ammonia tank within minutes. The emergency shutdown system installed at the facility has been considered in this scenario as active mitigation. RMP Comp was used to determine the alternative distance to endpoint; the model results were 0.3 miles and are also included as part of the backup documentation maintained onsite. Population data was obtained using Circular Area Profiling Software (CAPS) which incorporates 2010 U.S. Census Data. Public receptor information (i.e. schools, hospitals, etc.) was obtained using Google Earth as well as the facility's knowledge of nearby residences. No environmental receptors are affected by an alternative release of anhydrous ammonia.\n\n2.\tFlammable Mixture (Denaturant): The alternative scenario used for the flammable mixture is the release of natural gasoline due to a tanker truck loadout spill, causing a vapor cloud fire. The endpoint used was an over pressurization of 1 PSI, a worst-case option. Denaturant deliveries at the facility typically occur duri"

      "SummaryText": "ng normal business hours with a facility staff member overseeing loadout operations - therefore a release at the loadout area could be ceased within minutes by manual overrides. Additional functionality is that the driver is holding a Deadman switch which keeps an offloading valve open. The loadout area also has a catchment basin with underground piping to secondary containment of the tank farm. For this scenario, passive and active mitigation was not considered, as the mitigation strategies currently in place would not contain a vapor cloud fire. RMP Comp was used to determine the alternative distance to end point; the model results were <0.1 miles and are also included as part of the backup documentation maintained onsite. Population data was obtained using Circular Area Profiling Software (CAPS) which incorporates 2010 U.S. Census Data. Public receptor information (i.e., schools, hospitals, etc.) was obtained using Google Earth as well as the facility's knowledge of nearby residences. The population was estimated using a 0.2-mile distance to endpoint as CAPS did not have data for 0.1 miles. No environmental receptors are affected by an alternative release of denaturant.\n\nThe CHS Annawan facility qualifies as a Program 3 for anhydrous ammonia, the facility includes the flammable mixture as a Program 3 for RMP/PSM purposes for consistency throughout the facility.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS:\nPlease review the first section of this Executive Summary for the general accidental release prevention program information.\n\nCHS Annawan's maintenance department performs regular preventative maintenance inspections, as required by the manufacturer's recommendations and/or State and Federal regulations. Monthly visual inspections are performed, and quarterly leak detection monitoring is performed, and reports filed per IEPA requirements.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\nThere have been no reportable accidents associated wit"
