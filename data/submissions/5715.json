In this way, we promote overall plant, worker, and public safety.  These programs enable our facility to minimize the occurance and consequences of significant releases of toxic substances, as well as fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents.  Overall, these programs prevent accidental fatalities, injuries and illnesses and avoid physical property damage.\n\nOur safety programs are applied to any activity involving hazardous chemicals including any use, storage, handling, or the on-site movement of such chemicals.  Any group of vessels which are interconnected and seperate vessels which are located such that a hazardous chemical could be involved in a potential release shall be considered a single process.\n\nOur safety programs minimize accidents because they focus on the rules, procedures and practices that govern individual processes, activities, or equipment.  These programs are detailed and improved as necessary.  They are also communicated to and accepted by all employees at the facility.\n\nDescription\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration process at the facility consists of various pumps, compressors, and condensors that are used to change the state of ammonia from a gas to a liquid in three closed systems.  The system operation is very similiar to the operation of a household refrigerator.  The total ammonia inventory on site includes 58,000 pounds.  The liquified ammonia is used in the freezing of corn, lima beans, carrots, celery, and other vegetables received at thi"

      "SummaryText": "s facility.  The ammonia is also used to cool packaging rooms and maintain temperature in frozen warehouses.\n\nWorst-Case Scenario(s)\n\nFailure of an engine room containing 23,000 pounds of ammonia with the receiver quantity limited to 23,000 pounds of the vessel capacity by facility procedures resulting in a one-minute release.  Under worst-case weather conditions, ammonia could travel 2.9 miles before dispersing enough to no longer pose a hazard to the public or the environment.  This scenerio is unlikely for the following reasons:  worst-case weather conditions are uncommon; industry standards for the manufacture and quality control of pressure vessels; ammonia is not corrosive in this service; pressure safety valves limit operating pressure in this vessel; the accident prevention program in place at the facility including the mechanical integrity program for regular maintenance, inspection and testing, and replacement of equipment, as necessary; installed ammonia sensors in the system to warn of leaks; alarms are in place to warn operating personnel of process upsets; and the emergency response plan and equipment in place at the facility.\n\nAlternative Release Scenerio(s)\n\nFailure of a 1/4 inch diameter pipe would result in the release of approximately 6000 pounds of ammonia over a time period of 60 minutes.  Under common weather conditions, ammonia could travel 0.2 miles before dispersing enough to no longer pose a hazard to the public or environment.  The 1/4 inch pipe was chosen because it is used to temporarily bleed off a pump so that maintenance activities can be conducted.  This scenario is unlikely due to the following reasons:  the pump is isolated with valves in the closed position and only a few pounds of ammonia would be released; the valves to the pump would have to fail completely;  the facility has an accident prevention program in place including operational procedures that includes having personnel present at all times during maintenance of a pump;"

The key prevention steps at the facility consist of the following:\n\n- Process Safety Information\n- Process Hazard Analysis\n- Standard Operating Procedures\n- Training\n- Mechanical Integrity Program\n- Management of Change\n- Prestartup Safety Review\n- Compliance Audits\n- Incident Information\n- Employee Participation\n- Hot Work Permit\n- Contractor Qualifiactions\n\nFive year Accident History\n\nOn April 16, 1999, an ammonia release of 90 pounds resulted in an outside contractor being taken to a doctor for observation.  He was treated and released immediately.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nThe Darien emergency response program is based on the OSHA requirements for Emergency Action Plans (29 CFR 1910.38 and 1910.119) and HAZWOPER (29 CFR 1910.120).  We have trained employees for emergency response and maintain a written emergency response plan.  This plan is coordinated with the Walworth County Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and the Darien Fire Dept."
