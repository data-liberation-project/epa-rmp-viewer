The process that is\n      covered by this Risk Management Program (RMP) is a secondary function at the facility. \n      This is a process for storage of water and hydrocarbon liquids (liquid product) which are\n      stripped from the natural gas, and stored at 20 psig in a 15,000 gallon storage tank until it\n      is shipped.  Prior to shipping the liquid product is transferred to an 8,000 gallon tank to\n      facilitate tranfer to a tank truck at atmospheric conditions.  During the winter, water which\n      settles to the bottom of the 15,000 gallon tank is transferred to the 8,000 gallon tank to\n      avoid freeze ups.  A closed glycol loop passes through this tank to supply waste heat from\n      the compressor engine cooling system.  The other process, which is the primary process at\n      this facility, is a natural gas compression process which is not covered by this RMP.\n    \n      In this other process natural gas is withdrawn from the gathering system, compressed and\n      delivered to a high pressure transmission system.  The natural gas is compressed in three\n      stages, and it is cooled between the first and second stages and after the final stage. \n      Liquids that are formed due to compression and cooling are temporarily stored in drip pots. \n      During each shift operators manually open valves for a few minutes to drain the pots and\n      blow the liquid product into the storage system.\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n3)  Regulated Substances:\n  \n    The liquid product is a flammable liquid, and consists of an approximate a mixture of:\n    \n          I)    Water\n          ii)   Butane\n          iii)  Iso-Butane\n          iv)  Pentane\n          v)   Other organics\n\n      Since the analytical composition of this liquid product varies depending on the gas mixture\n      extracted from the production field, analytical analysis was performed to determine a\n      general composition for"

In\n      review of the OSA Document, it was determined to use an atmospheric over-pressure of\n      1.0 pounds per square inch as the end-point for the release.  This end-point was chosen as\n      the threshold because of the potential for serious injury to people as a result of property\n      damage caused by the explosion, glass from shattered windows or falling debris.\n\n5)  Alternative Release Scenario:\n\n     This alternate scenario is a release of a quantity of the regulated substance from a vessel or\n     process line failure which is more likely to occur than the worst-case scenario. This release\n     is assumed to result in a vapor cloud containing the total quantity of the substance between\n     the Upper and Lower flammability limits which explodes and impacts offsite receptors.\n    \n     The alternative scenario was based on the release of the actual maximum contents of the\n     liquid product"

In the\n      unlikely event that the liquid product storage tank was overfilled and flowed into the\n      compressor system, the compressors would shut down and alarms would automatically\n      activate. \n    \n      The main liquid product storage tank which has a maximum capacity of 15,000 gallons is\n      never filled to full capacity. The standard operational procedure for this site is that the\n      liquid product storage tanks will only be filled to sixty (60) percent of  total volume which\n      is approximately 9,000 gallons.  Approximately one 2,100 gallon truckload per month of\n      the liquid product is shipped when the facility is in full operation.  The transport company,\n      Heath Oil, has specific loading/unloading procedures which are used by the tank truck\n      driver to prevent spill.\n    \n      There is minimal motor vehicle exposure to the liquid product storage tank.
