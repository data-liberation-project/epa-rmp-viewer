The plant consists of inlet gas compression, separation and filtration, 10,000 BPD stabilizer, 100 GPM amine treatment unit, 100MMSCFD cryogenic processing unit, overhead compression, residue compression, and, including all associated utilities and ancillary systems. Condensate recovered from inlet gas is stored in six 400-barrel tanks in a concrete-diked containment area and loaded into tanker trucks for shipment. NGL from the cryogenic unit and natural gas from residue compression are sent offsite via pipeline without intermediate storageThe facility is classified as a Program Level 3 facility under the regulation. The worst case scenario (described in the RMP submittal) is the loss of the entire contents of the largest vessel, with a subsequent vapor cloud explosion. An alternative release is the loss of NGL due to a hose break during loading. There are numerous safety devices to prevent such events from occurring at the facility. We have discussed these potential hydrocarbon releases with our employees and with local emergency response officials in Kingfisher County, thereby further reducing the possibility of any impact on the public. The following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the Chisholm Gas Processing Plant (Chisholm). Because the processes at the plant regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) Risk Management Program (RMP) are also subject to the OSHA PSM, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\n\n\nActive employee participation and involvement in the development and implementation of the company's PSM program is an important step toward achieving the objective to prevent or minimize the consequences of catastrophic releases of"

Employee involvement will help to ensure that all perspectives regarding PSM are considered, and that the best ideas are implemented. Open communications are encouraged between supervisors and employees regarding all safety and health issues. Enlink Midstream strongly promotes employee involvement in safety issues through existing programs. These programs include regularly scheduled safety meetings, tail gate safety meetings, Hazard Communications, and other training programs (emergency response training, first aid, etc.).\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information \n\n\n\nComplete and accurate written process safety information (PSI) concerning process chemicals, process technology, and process equipment is essential to an effective PSM and RMP program and to completing and maintaining a process hazard analysis (PHA). The PSI will be useful to the operators, the team performing the PHA, those in charge or training, contractors, those conducting pre-startup safety reviews, and those in charge of updating the emergency response plan. Process safety information is readily available to all employees. The Chisholm Plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the process. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information. Chemical specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in Safety Data Sheets (SDS's).\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\n\n\nEnlink Midstream has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the process are identified and controlled. Within this program, each process is systematically\n\nexamined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.

The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary. The PHA team findings are forwarded to local and corporate management for resolution. Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team. This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention. The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained. To help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the Chisholm Gas Plant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results. These periodic reviews are conducted when major changes occur at the facility, or at minimum every five years. The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained. Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\n\n\nThe Chisholm Plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations for Chisholm, such as startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, normal shutdown, and initial startup of a new process. These procedures provide guidance for experienced operators and also provide the basis for training new operators. Operating procedures are periodically reviewed and annual reviewed by management as current and accurate. The review "

New employees receive basic training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level. This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years. All of this training is documented for each operator including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\n\n\nContractors\n\n\n\nThe Chisholm Gas Plant uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities. Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform facility personnel of any hazards that they find during their work. This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work. In addition, Enlink Midstream has programs in place to evaluate contractor safety programs and performance. Facility personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\n\n\nPre Startup Safety Review (PSSR)\n\n\n\nThe Chisholm Plant conducts a PSSR for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information.
