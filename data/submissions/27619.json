The plant manufactures fresh pork and processed meats that provide consumers with high-quality meat products. This facility is subject to the Environmental Protection Agency's Risk Management Program rules under the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990.\r\n\r\nThe Risk Management Program rules require facilities handling threshold amounts of certain chemical substances to submit Risk Management Plans for the prevention of accidental releases of these substances.  The plan submission to include hazard assessments defining possible off-site impacts of certain regulated substance release scenarios, a five-year accident history, description of the facilities accidental release prevention program, and an emergency response program. \r\n\r\nThe following is the Executive Summary of the Risk Management Plan for Farmland Foods, Inc., Denison, IA.\r\n\r\nFacility Snapshot\r\nThis facility, which was constructed in the late 1950's, was owned and operated by Crawford County Packing Company prior to Farmland's acquisition of the plant in 1959.  The plant produces over 600 million pounds of product annually.\r\n\r\nImpact on the community\r\n* Farmland employs 1,400 area residents at a combined annual salary of approximately $54 million. \r\n* The facility paid more than $221 million for materials, live hogs and utilities, including electricity, natural gas, water, and wastewater treatment from the local area.\r\n\r\nEmployee snapshot\r\nFarmland employees are involved in community activities.  The facility supports United Way, Kidde Kampus and other community support organizations.  Employees are active in many other community organizations, such as Community Chest and Blue Jeans for Babies annual fund-raising drives.

For this facility, one regulated toxic substance is included, anhydrous ammonia.  \r\n\r\nThe Risk Management rule requires that the largest amount in a single vessel be considered the release quantity for the worst-case event, unless smaller quantities handled at different conditions result in a greater distance to the regulated endpoint of consideration.  This is a requirement of the rule regardless of whether the event is likely, or, could even reasonably occur.   It should be emphasized that the possibility of such an event as described by the worst-case scenario is extremely low. \r\nAlternate scenarios, for each regulated toxic, which are more likely events, must also be presented.  More likely release events tend to concentrate in areas such as failure of smaller valves, lines, and hoses.  Significantly lower quantities are involved and operator intervention would tend to mitigate and limit the consequences of such failures.\r\n\r\nWorst-Case Toxic Release - Ammonia\r\nThe largest vessel, located outdoors, has a maximum capacity of 28,148 pounds.  The worst-case scenario assumes that this entire amount would release in 10 minutes, as a result of a catastrophic failure of the tank.  The worst-case scenario would reach offsite endpoints, including public and environmental receptors.\r\n\r\nAlternate Release Toxics - Ammonia\r\nThis alternate release scenario consists of a pipe leak, which discharges 1,300 pounds of ammonia in 20 minutes prior to the operator stopping the leak.  \r\n\r\nPrevention Program\r\nThe ammonia refrigeration process at this plant is subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management rule, 29 CFR 1910.119.  Therefore, under the EPA Risk Management Rule, this is a Program Level 3 process.  The OSHA"

The Denison plant has an excellent five-year accident record with no qualifying accidental releases.\r\n \r\nPlanned Changes for Safety Improvements\r\nSafety improvements are a continual and ongoing process at the plant, facilitated by the EPA Prevention Program/OSHA Process Safety Management Program.
