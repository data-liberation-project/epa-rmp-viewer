ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\r\n\r\nWe at the Seneca Foods Facility in Modesto, California are strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety.  This commitment is an inherent part of our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, emergency shut downs, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  If such a release does occur, our trained personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of an incidental release.  We also notify and coordinate response efforts with Consolidated Fire providing emergency response expertise.\r\n\r\n\r\n2.  STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\r\n\r\nThe Seneca FoodsA\u00bf Modesto facility is a seasonal fruit canning plant.  We process canned stone fruit, and fruit cocktail.  Ammonia is refrigerant used to process and store these fruits.  We have approximately 42,500 pounds of ammonia on site to handle processing and cold storage.\r\n\r\n\r\n3.  WORST CASE RELEASE AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS\r\n\r\nWe utilized [ALOHA(R)] and RMP Comp for the worst case release and alternative scenarios of the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility.  \r\n\r\n\r\n4.  GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\r\n\r\nOur facility has taken all necessary steps to comply with the EPA's accidental release prevention requirements as set forth in 40 CFR part 68, and Cal EPAA\u00bfs Accidental release prevention requirements as set forth in 19 CCR Div2 Chapter 4.5.
