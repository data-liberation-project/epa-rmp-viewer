Dodge, Iowa\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nFOR \nTHE RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN (RMPlan)\n\n\nIntroduction and Policies\n\nKoch Nitrogen Company (KNC) is committed to managing all operations in a manner that protects the environment and the health and safety of employees, customers, contractors and the public while fully complying with applicable laws and regulations.  KNC\u00bfs management philosophy goals are achieved through the implementation of the Environmental Health and Safety Management Systems, by the personal commitments of employees and contractors, and by open communication with employees, customers, neighbors, and regulators. \n\nThe purpose of this Risk Management Plan (RMPlan) is to provide information about operations at the facility, programs to prevent accidental chemical releases, emergency response plans in the event of an accidental release, the five-year accident history of the facility, and planned changes to improve safety at the plant.\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nThe Ft. Dodge Nitrogen Plant is one of several facilities owned and operated by KNC that supply anhydrous ammonia to the Midwest farming area where it is used primarily as a fertilizer.  At the facility, anhydrous ammonia and urea-ammonium nitrate (UAN) are produced and loaded on truck and railcar for distribution.  \n\nThe manufacturing portion of the facility consists of an ammonia unit and a UAN unit.  The ammonia unit uses natural gas, air, and water to produce ammonia.  UAN solution is produced by manufacturing urea in liquid form and combining it with liquid ammonium nitrate, which is made by neutralizing nitric acid with ammonia.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia and chlorine (used in the cooling tower) are the only toxic substances regulated under the Risk Management Program (RMP) that are present at the Ft. Dodge Nitrogen Plant in amounts above threshold quantity.  An RMP-regulated flammable mixture consisting of methane, ethane and hydrogen is found"

      "SummaryText": "in the ammonia production process in amounts greater than threshold quantity.  The facility is regulated under the Program Level 3 requirements.\n\nHydrochloric acid, nitric acid, and urea ammonium nitrate are stored at the facility.  These substances are not subject to RMP reporting for reasons discussed below.  Hydrochloric and nitric acid are below the minimum concentration necessary to be considered an RMP substance.  According to 40 CFR 68.130 Table 1, nitric acid must be at a concentration of 80%, or greater; and hydrochloric acid must be at a concentration of 37%, or greater, to be considered an RMP substance.  Urea ammonium nitrate is a mixture that does not contain RMP-regulated chemicals in concentrations greater than 1%, making this product exempt according to 40 CFR 68.115(b)(1).  Although these substances are not subject to RMP reporting, the Ft. Dodge Nitrogen Plant handles them in a safe manner.\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n  \nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response programs in place at the facility are part of the high standards striven for by KNC.  These high standards include:\n\n\u00b7Operating in compliance with required environmental permits and regulations.\n\u00b7Operating and maintaining assets in such a manner that any unintentional releases are minimized.\n\u00b7Operating and maintaining assets in such a manner that the small releases associated with normal operation and maintenance will be minimized to the extent possible.\n\u00b7Correcting non-compliance found by regular audits of the facility.\n\n\nPrevention Program\n\nThe Ft. Dodge Nitrogen Plant is operating under the guidelines of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Program.  Ongoing analysis of the potential hazards of the process, detailed training of employees, and emphasis on safety has helped avoid any serious chemical accidents over the last 5 years.  Part of this program has also involved identifying and"

Dodge Nitrogen Plant with the Webster County LEPC and the Webster County Sheriff Department.  As appropriate, also involved in emergency response for the facility would be Trinity Regional Hospital, the Iowa Highway Patrol, Cornbelt Power and Northern Natural Gas.  The Ft. Dodge Plant Manager is responsible for coordinating the emergency actions.  A specific Emergency Response Plan for the facility is in place, and that plan has been coordinated with local officials, along with evacuation procedures, regular drilling, and training.  The Emergency Response Program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nCompliance with the RMP Prevention Program, coupled with the Environmental Health and Safety Management Systems, forms the framework for continuous safety improvement.  Some of the key components of the safety program are:\n\n\u00b7The Management of Change provisions ensure that the potential safety and health impacts of any change made to process chemicals, technology, equipment or procedures are considered.\n\u00b7The Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) provisions serve as a tool to ensure timely evaluation of potential hazards, thereby leading to continual improvements in safety standards.\n\u00b7The Mechanical Integrity provisions ensure that process equipment and instrumentation are designed, constructed, installed and maintained to minimize the risk of hazardous releases, thereby serving as an integral part of the safety program.\n\nSpecific actions that will be taken in the future to improve the level of safety at the facility include:\n\n\u00b7Internal and third party compliance audits will ensure that the level of s"

A few examples of accident prevention features implemented at this facility include:\n\n\u00b7Minimizing the possibility of interrupting the combustion of ammonia vapors in the flare by having a continuous pilot in the flare.  \n\u00b7Minimizing the possibility of an interruption in power supply to the process control system by having a backup UPS in place.\n\u00b7Installing chlorine detectors at the chlorine use area to help ensure that a chlorine release is detected and terminated as soon as possible.\n\u00b7Installing \u00bfsmart hoses\u00bf in the loading area that seal off in the event of a hose rupture.\n\u00b7Requiring personnel protective equipment at all loading areas and supply emergency air equipment in the control rooms.\n\u00b7Manning the facility 24 hours a day to monitor all loading operations.\n\u00b7Providing emergency shutdown buttons at the truck loading area that can be activated by KNC personnel or the truck driver in case of an ammonia release.\n\u00b7Requiring a brake lock system that prevents truck drivers from driving away before the loading hose is properly disconnected.\n\u00b7Level indications are in place on storage tanks and bullets to help prevent overfilling.\n\u00b7Providing a fire water system to help with vapor control in the event of an ammonia or chlorine release.\n\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nThe Ft. Dodge Nitrogen Plant has had one incident occur during the last five years that is reportable in the five-year accident history maintained under the RMP regulations.  In November 2003, a truck driver was loading ammonia when he inadvertently bumped the valve on the outboard end of the hose, which released ammonia vapor in his face and upper chest.  The driver showered off and was taken to the hospital by ambulance.  He received medical treatment and was released from the hospital the next day.  As a result of this incident, installation of longer nipples on the ends of all loading lines were installed, alignment adjustments were made to the"
