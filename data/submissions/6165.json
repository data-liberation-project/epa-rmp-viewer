Information includes information pertaining to \nthe hazards of ammonia, process technology, process \nequipment, and emergency response procedures.\n\nThe stationary source is the Battle Creek Farmers Cooperative - \nBloomfield, NE anhydrous ammonia storage facility.  The \nlargest ammonia process group (e.g., largest storage tank or group of \ninterconnected tanks) has a storage capacity of 15,000 water gallons \n(70,000 pounds).  The total ammonia stationary storage capacity is \n126,000 pounds.  The facility also stores numerous smaller \ntransportable tanks (nurse tanks) that are actually used in the \nfertilizer application process.  \n\nThe facility is required to complete one worst-case release scenario \nper hazardous substance handled [68.165(a)(2)] to determine program \napplicability.  Battle Creek Co-op has chosen to use the DEGADIS+ \nrelease model to determine offsite impacts.\n\n\nFor this facility, a worst-case release would occur in the event that \nthe largest ammonia storage tank would rupture and the \nentire contents would be released to the atmosphere in 10 minutes.  The \nworst-case scenario requires a ground-level release height (0 feet).  \nAmmonia release rate for use of DEGADIS+ is presented below:\n\n\nSample Ammonia Endpoint Calculation\n\nGiven:       Storage Tank Capacity is 15,000 water gallons\n             ANSI K61.1 filling density = 56 % (of water wt.)\n\nRelease Rate = Tank Capacity / 10 minutes\n             =(15,000 gal * 8.345 lb/gal water)*(0.56)  / 10 min \n            = (125,175 lb)*(0.56) / 10 min\n            = 70,000 (rounded) / 10 min\n            = 7,000 lb/min \n\nResults of Worst-Case Ammonia Release Scenario\n\nInput of the preceding data into the DEGADIS+ release model, the \nresults indicate a worst-case impact of  1.6 (rounded) miles for the \nfacility.

The rule defines the toxic endpoint of anhydrous \nammonia to be 0.14 mg/L.\n\nThe residential population within a 1.6 mile radius of the facility is \n1,300 (rounded) based on the 1990 US Census data. \n\nThe facility is required to complete one alternate release scenario per \nregulated chemical per 40 CFR Part 68.165(a)(2).  The alternative \nrelease scenario considered is in accordance with the guidelines \nprovided in 40 CFR 68.22 and 68.28.\n\nThe alternative scenarios chosen for this facility involves a release \nbecause of a sudden split in the hose during transfer.  While this \nscenario is still unlikely because the transfer hoses used have \nmultiple layers of rubber and a layer of braided stainless steel wire \nunderneath the outer sheath (to prevent abrasions, cuts, and splits) it \nis more likely than the worst-case as required by 40 CFR 68.28(b)(i).  \nThis scenario is also the\nmost likely to occur, since overfilling is prevented by a return vapor \nline to the tank truck making the delivery.  The transfer hose rupture \narea is assumed at 0.5 square inches.  Because personnel are always \npresent at the facility during transfer, Battle Creek Co-op personnel \nwill respond within 10 minutes.  Release rate was calculated using the \nOCAG tank release equation (Section 8.1.1).  \n\nResults of Ammonia Alternative Release Scenario\n\nThere are 75 people located within 0.23 miles from the facility.  Thus, \nthis alternative release scenario satisfies the conditions of '68.28. \n\nThe facility maintains written process safety information to enable \nemployees involved in handling ammonia to identify and \nunderstand the hazards posed by this process.  Written information \nincludes physical properties of ammonia, health risks \nassociated with ammonia exposure, and material safety data \nsheets.  In addition, the facility has conducted and/or implemented the \nfollowing:\n          \n             hazards review\n             standard operating procedures\n          "
