This program is implemented in California as the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program. \n             \n1.2  \tGeneral Description of the Facility and Regulated Substance \n\nInternational Rectifier (IR) is a semiconductor manufacturing company, providing design, development, manufacturing and testing of semiconductor devices.  The facility is located on the east and west sides of Kansas Street between Franklin Street and Holly Avenue.  The entire site comprises about 11 acres.  Residential areas fronting on Holly Avenue lie immediately to the north, and eastern border of IR comprises general commercial establishments and corporate multi-story buildings adjoining Sepulveda Blvd.  There are mixed residential and industrial facilities to the west of IR. \n\nIR uses anhydrous ammonia in two wastewater treatment systems.  The amount of anhydrous ammonia used exceeds the threshold limits established in the federal RMP and CalARP programs.  Therefore, a RMP is required.  The process is subject to RMP Program Level 2.\n\n1.3  \tSummary of the Five- Year Accident History \n\nThere have been no accidental releases from the ammonia usage operation at International Rectifier in the past five years that have resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known off site deaths, injuries, and evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage (Statute: 40 CFR 68.42). \n\n1.4  \tSummary of Prevention Program\n\nThe ammonia usage and handling operation at International Rectifier Products is covered by an accidental release prevention program which includes the following: \n\n\u00b7\tRigorous monitoring prog"
