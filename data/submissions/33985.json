Also involved in emergency response for the facility would be the Clay County Sheriff and, as appropriate, Merit Care Hospital in Fargo, Innovis Health in Fargo, the Red River Valley Coop Power Association, the Local Emergency Planning Committee, and the Minnesota State Highway Patrol.

The Emergency Response Program provides the essential planning for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nCompliance with the RMP Prevention Program, coupled with the Environmental Health and Safety Management Systems, forms the framework for continuous safety improvement.

KNC\u00bfs management philosophy goals are achieved through the implementation of the Environmental Health and Safety Management Systems, by the personal commitments of employees and contractors, and by open communication with employees, customers, neighbors, and regulators. \n\nThe purpose of this Risk Management Plan is to provide information about operations at the terminal, programs to prevent accidental chemical releases, emergency response plans in the event an accidental release should occur, the five-year accident history of the terminal and planned changes to improve safety at the terminal.\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance\n\nThe Barnesville Terminal is one of many facilities owned and operated by KNC that supply anhydrous ammonia to the Midwest farming area where it is used primarily as a fertilizer.  At the terminal, anhydrous ammonia is delivered by railcar and stored until it is loaded on trucks for distribution.  \n\nAnhydrous ammonia is the only toxic substance regulated under the Risk Management Program (RMP) that is present at the Barnesville Terminal in amounts above threshold quantity.  Propane is stored at the facility; however, it is used strictly as a fuel and as such is exempt from RMP reporting.  The terminal is classified as Program Level 3 under the regulation. \n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response programs in place at the facility are part of the high standards striven for by KNC.  These high standards include:\n\n\u00b7Operating in compliance with required environmen"

Ongoing analysis of the potential hazards of the process, detailed training of employees, and emphasis on safety has helped avoid any serious chemical release accidents over the last 5 years.  Part of this program has also involved identifying and taking steps to avoid potential accidental chemical releases.  A few examples of the prevention features implemented at this facility include:\n\n\u00b7Minimizing the possibility that flare combustion of ammonia vapors would be interrupted by having continuous pilots. \n\u00b7Minimizing the possibility of an interruption in power supply to the flare system by having a backup power generator.\n\u00b7Minimizing the possibility of an interruption in power supply to the facility by having a connection to a secondary power grid.\n\u00b7Providing emergency shutdown buttons at the truck loading area that can be activated by KNC personnel or the truck driver in case of an ammonia release.\n\u00b7Preventive maintenance and testing of vessels through the Mechanical Integrity program helps to ensure that structural failures do not occur in process equipment.\n\u00b7Requiring trucks to have a brake interlock system that helps prevent a truck driver from driving away before the loading arm is properly disconnected.\n\u00b7Providing annual truck loading training to ensure driver safety.\n\u00b7Minimizing the possibility of an overfill by manually unloading railcars and controlling the amount delivered to the hot bullet.\n\u00b7Ammonia detectors in the unlo"
