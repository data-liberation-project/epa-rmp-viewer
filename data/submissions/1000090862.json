This commitment is demonstrated in the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel as well as considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the facility.\r\n\r\nCORN, LP's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, plant personnel will implement emergency actions to contain the release as necessary.  The facility will coordinate with the Goldfield Fire Department for response to a release.\r\n\r\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances:\r\n\r\nCORN, LP ethanol plant is located in Goldfield, Wright County, Iowa.\r\n\r\nThe facility operates 24 hours per day, 7 days per week for the purpose of manufacturing fuel grade ethanol from corn.  The regulated substance under the RMP program is Denaturant (also known as natural gasoline which is a flammable mixture). CORN, LP has determined that the radius of impact from a worst-case release of denaturant would be about 0.5 miles; due to the amount of denaturant stored on site. The ammonia process previously included in the RMP plan has reduced the chemical amounts below thresholds for RMP applicability. The process has been taken out of service and the facility has no plans to restart the process.  \r\n\r\nOff-site Consequence Analysis Results:\r\n\r\nRMP*Comp was used to determine offsite consequences of release scenarios at the facility. The worst-case scenario at the facility includes the release all 963,600 pounds of denaturant consisting of 313,170 pounds of reportable chemicals causing a vapor cloud explosion. The worst-case vapor cloud endpoint is approximately 0.5 miles from the center of the plant.  Residence homes and other public receptors are located within this 0.5 mile radius.

The alternative case vapor cloud endpoint is approximately 0.2 miles from the facility. The population determined to be affected by this release includes 0 people based on 2010 census data using MARPLOT 5.1.1..\r\n\r\nAlthough CORN, LP has numerous controls in place to prevent such a release and to manage potential consequences, no credit for administrative controls or passive mitigation measures were taken into account in evaluating this scenario.\r\n\r\nThe facility qualifies as a Program 3 due to the close proximity of public receptors, and therefore, Program Safety Management has been completed for this facility.\r\n\r\nFive Year Accident History:\r\n\r\nThere have been no accidents since the establishment of CORN, LP.\r\n\r\nEmergency Action Plan Information:\r\n\r\nCORN, LP ethanol plant has several safety programs in place at the facility that incorporate emergency actions, including an emergency action plan.  An SPCC has been prepared and implemented in accordance with applicable regulatory standards and timeframes.\r\n\r\nPlanned changes to improve safety:\r\nThe facility also conducts employee training as part of facility activities.  CORN, LP's corporate policy places the utmost importance on worker, public and environmental safety, which is reflected in facility plans and training activities."
