This facility complies with OSHA 1910.111 standard requirements. It is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state and local laws and regulations. If an emergency does occur, it is our policy to notify the Bradner Fire Department and request that they respond. We are prepared to work with the Bradner Fire Department, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n\n\nFacility Description and Regulated Substances:\n\n  This facility is a branch location of Luckey Farmers, Inc. We are a farmer-owned cooperative serving our member-customers by providing goods and services to assist them in producing agricultural products. One such product sold to producers is anhydrous ammonia, which is used as a crop production nutrient. The primary function of this facility is storage and distribution of anhydrous ammonia. On site is a 30,000 gallon storage tank containing a maximum capacity of 135,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia and associated delivery tank-wagons and application equipment.\n\n\n\nWorst-Case Scenario:\n\nNot Applicable - EPA removed this requirement due to security concerns.\n\n\n\nAlternative Release Scenario:\n\n  The alternative release scenario based on the most likely incident is a break in a transfer hose from the storage tank to a delivery tank-wagon. In this scenario, 4,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia would be released, resulting in an impact zone endpoint distance of .92 mile Within this impact zone are private dwellings with a population of 59,and an important highway (U.S. Route 6).\n\n\n\nAccident Release Prevention Program:\n\n  This facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K61.1\" published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc. and"

We have provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III. Awritten emergency response program, in accordance with OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.120, including pre-emergency and employee training is in place. In the event an emergency does occur, it is our policy to notify the Bradner Fire Department and request that they respond. We have discusses this with the fire department and a member of the fire department has inspected this facility.\n\n\n\nPlanned Safety Changes:\n\n  Safety improvement is an on-going process. Periodic evaluations are performed to review the preservation of safe conditions. Corrective actions are made if the evaluations warrant it. There are no additional anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
