The program includes engineering, education, waste water, and storm water management.\n\n\n\n2. Emergency Response Program: The Green Bay (East River) facility has developed an OSHA hazardous substance emergency action plan. The plan outlines specific procedures for evacuations, incident alarms and alerting. Depending upon a given situation, the Fire Department will be called to provide emergency responders and equipment. The Fire Department will be called for all fire related emergencies. The facility has communicated the hazard of ammonia with the local fire department and LEPC. The incident commander has ultimate control of implementation of the emergency response plan.\n\n\n\n3. Stationary Source and Regulated Substance: Green Bay (East River) is a food processing plant located at 800 University Avenue, Green Bay, WI. The building houses a processing plant used for processing, freezing, and packaging. The processed products require refrigeration for processing and storage. Anhydrous ammonia is the primary refrigerant used. \n\n\n\n4. Worst Case and Alternative Release Scenarios: RMP*Comp was used to calculate the worst case and alternative release scenarios for the process.\n\n\n\n5. Five Year Accident History: There have been no reportable accidents; however, the facility maintains records of all incident investigation reports regardless of ammonia quantity released into the atmosphere.\n\n\n\n6. Planned changes to improve safety: Based on the Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) for ammonia, lists of action items were developed. The status of these action items will be monitored to ensure that implementation of the safety improvements is accomplished. Safety training is conducted for all team members at this facility, in addition PSM meetings are held to review safety and PSM program elements. Refer to the Process Safety"
