This facility is owned by the City of Centralia and operated by a total of nine (9) employees. The Risk Management Plan will be the responsibility of the Water Superintendent Van Goforth. The Centralia Water Treatment Plant uses various chemicals including chlorine to treat raw water in order to provide safe drinking water for the City of Centralia. Chlorine is the only regulated substance handled or  stored at the WTP which is over the RMP threshold limit. The maximum amount of chorine kept on-site at this facility is 10,000 pounds.\n\nChemical safety is a concern of the Centralia Water Treatment Plant. Operators at this facility are skilled in the handling of hazardous chemicals and are aware of the consequences of an accidental release. The facility has coordinated with the Centralia Fire Department to implement an Emergency Response Plan. In the event of an accidental release of chlorine, Freeman Environmental Services is responsible for the repair of the leak. The Fire Department has the repair kits for 1-ton chlorine containers in their possesion and will provide them to the repair team.\n\nThe Centralia Water Treatment Plant has not had and accidental release of chlorine within the past five years. This lack of accidental releases is probably due to the fact that skilled operators complete an ongoing inspection of the chlorination process and maintenance is performed on a regular as-needed basis.\n\nA worst case scenario has been developed for the Centralia Water Treatment Plant using EPA and AWWA guidance. The worst case scenario models the total 2,000 pound release of chlorine gas from a 1-ton chlorine container resulting from catastrophic failure due to corrosion, impact, or construction defects. This catastrophic and very unlikely release results in a distance to endpoint of 2.6 miles considering the urban topography of the site. The"

      "SummaryText": " 2.6 mile radius encompasses a residential population of approximately 17,000 people. Public receptors within the distance include schools, hospitals, residences, recreation areas, and commercial/industrial areas. Environmental receptors include the Centralia Reservoir and Centralia Foundation Park. An enclosure could be considered as a passive mitigation system in use at the facility, but was not used in the modeling of the worst case scenario or alternate release scenario.\n\nAn alternate release scenario has also been developed for the Centralia Water Treatment Plant using EPA and AWWA guidance. This scenario is a more likely release than the worst case scenario. The alternate release scenario models a 317 pound chlorine gas release resulting from a tubing failure, bad connection, or valve failure. This release results in a distance to endpoint of 0.48 miles considering the urban topography of the water treatment plant. The distance includes an affected residential population of approximately 700 people. The public receptors within the distance includes schools, residences, City Hall, and many churches. Environmental receptors within the distance to endpoint includes part of Crooked Creek. No active mitigation systems are in use at this facility.\n\nThe accidental release prevention program for the Centralia Water Treatment Plant includes daily inspections of systems in the plant including the complete chlorination system. This ongoing inspection conducted by skilled operators results in maintenance being performed on an as-needed basis. These inspections and maintenance operations help to prevent the risk of accidental release due to equipment failure. The facility is equipped with two chlorine leak detectors, one located in the chlorine feed room and one located in the chlorine storage area. These sensors trigger an audible and visible alarm within the WTP when a chlorine leak is detected. The operators are trained in the use of SCBA's and use this eqipment and wor"

The plan is designed to effectively and adequately respond to a chlorine release in order to minimize injuries and damage to the WTP and surrounding community. The plan is also used to provide guidance to offsite responders such as the Centralia fire and Police Departments. The plan includes steps to be taken in the event of an accidental release and responsibility of WTP operators and emergency responders. The Centralia Fire Department has the responsibility of contacting the repair team and have the necessary repair kits in their possession. The plan also contains procedures for shelter or evacuation of affected residences and other public receptors. Also included in the Emergency Response Plan are training and release drill procedures.\n\nIn conclusion, the Centralia Water Treatment Plant is committed to the safe handling of chlorine in order to provide the City of Centralia, IL with safe drinking water as well as reducing the risk of an accidental release. However, in the event of an accidental release, the Centralia Water Treatment Plant has developed an Emergency Response Plan designed to lessen the impact of the release on the surrounding community by providing an adequate and effective response by WTP operators along with local emergency  response personnel."
