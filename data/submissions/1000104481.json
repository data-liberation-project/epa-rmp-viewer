Five-year Accident History\nThe facility has not experienced any reportable accidents in the past 5 years.\n\n5.  Emergency Response Program\nTremco Corsicana has a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous material, which is in place to protect workers and public safety, and the environment.  The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas.  Employees receive training in emergency procedures.  To ensure proper functioning, emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced.  In addition, the plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within processes that would require a modified emergency response.  The emergency plan has been coordinated with and verified by the Navarro County the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).\n\nAt all times there must be at least one employee either on the facility premises or on-call (i.e. available to respond to an emergency by reaching the facility within a short period of time) with the responsibility for coordination of all emergency response measures.  This emergency coordinator will be thoroughly familiar with all aspects of the facility's emergency response plan, all operations and activities at the facility, the location and characteristics of material/waste handled, the location of all records within the facility, and the facility layout."

In addition, our employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP rule, including information resulting from process hazard analyses in particular.\n\nHot Work Permit\nTremco Corsicana will issue a hot work permit for hot work operations conducted on or near a covered process.   Permit shall document that the fire prevention and protection requirements have been implemented prior to beginning the hot work operations; it shall indicate the date(s) authorized for hot work; and identify the object on which hot work is to be performed.  The permit will be kept on file until completion of the hot work operations.\n\nContractors\nTremco Corsicana hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities.  Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is carried out.  Before any contractors are allowed to work at Tremco Corsicana, they undergo an orientation conducted by the PSM team.  During this orientation contractors are made aware of the known potential hazards related to the contractor's work, the hazards of regulated substances within  Tremco Corsicana, the safe work procedures insisted on by Tremco Corsicana, and familiarized with the Hot Work Permit Policy and the Lock Out/Tag Out procedures used at Tremco Corsicana.

These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction and equipment is in accordance with design specifications, and safety, operating, maintenance, and emergency procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits\nTremco Corsicana conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented.  These audits are carried out by at least one person knowledgeable in the process and are conducted at least every 3 years.  Audit findings are documented in a report.  Any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner and are also documented.  The facility will maintain the two most recent compliance audit reports.\n\nIncident Investigation\nTremco Corsicana promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  An incident investigation will be initiated as promptly as possible, but not later than 48 hours after the incident, and will involve at least one person knowledgeable of the process involved.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.

Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nThe Tremco Corsicana Plant (Corsicana), has always had a strong commitment to its employees to provide a safe working environment. This policy is consistent with both the spirit and the intent of our commitment.  The safety of employees, company operations, and the public are management's most important complete compliance with all safety regulations and safety policies.\n\nEvery attempt will be made to reduce the possibility of accident occurrence by all levels of management. Tremco Corsicana believes that safety, like quality and housekeeping, can be controlled by motivated supervision.  Therefore, preventable lost time accidents will have an impact on a supervisor's annual salary review, including any bonuses and incentive plans.  Unreported accidents will be considered falsification of company records and will result in immediate discharge.  Lost time accident free locations will be eligible for annual awards.\n\n2.  The Station Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nTremco Corsicana operates a specialty chemical plant and manufactures fatty amines and nitrile intermediates.  The principal products are emulsifiers, corrosion inhibitors, de-emulsifiers, and surfactants.\n\nWe have nine regulated substances present at our facility as raw materials for processes, which include dimethylamine (DMA), acrylonitrile, anhydrous ammonia, hydrogen, formaldehyde, methyl chloride (MeCl), epichlorohydrin, trimethylamine (TMA), and hydrochloric acid (HCl).  Acrylonitrile, anhydrous ammonia, formaldehyde, epichlorohydrin, methyl chloride, and hydrochloric acid are regulated as toxic chemicals and trimethylamine, hydrogen, and dimethylamine are regulated as flammable chemicals.
