We are committed to operating and maintaining all of our processes in a safe and responsible manner, as demonstrated by the resources we invest to prevent accidents. As a member of the American Chemistry Council (ACC), we adhere to the principles of Responsible Care. In addition to ensuring that our employees have the best possible training in the operation of our processes, we demand that safety be the first priority in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes. Our process equipment is designed, constructed and maintained using sound engineering practices and conforms to applicable industry codes and standards, including those of the Chlorine Institute, for equipment used in manufacturing and handling chlorine. We have implemented maintenance and inspection programs designed to ensure site integrity.\n\nOur policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. Examples of such controls include: 1) installation of pressure safety valves to prevent rupture of vessels"

Mitigation measures include installation of isolation valves, excess flow valves that limit the amount of chemical released, fire suppression systems in areas where flammable chemicals are present, fire fighting equipment in all process areas, fully implemented emergency response plans, appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) in control rooms, and an alarm system for early notification of a release. If a release occurs, we will use a dispersion model, Systematic Approach For Emergency Response (SAFER) system, and meteorological data from our weather tower to predict the plume direction and size, downwind ground level chemical concentrations, and the estimated time at which the plume will reach offsite areas. For significant releases this information will be communicated to 911 in case any actions need to be taken by emergency response agencies. In addition, our Community Alert Network (CAN) system provides us the means to alert over 950 residents within a 25-square mile area around the plant in case of a release that may impact offsite areas. The 25 square mile area is broken into 8 different zones. The system has the flexibility to alert all of the contacts at once or alert targeted zones based on real time meteorological data.\n\n2.0 STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe Vulcan-Wichita plant is primarily involved in manufacturing various inorganic and chlorinated organic chemicals.

As a part of this manufacturing process, we use and produce several substances that are covered by the risk management program (RMP) rule (40 CFR 68). All of the covered processes fall under the RMP Program Level 3 category.\n\nVulcan's products serve a multitude of vital needs throughout American and global economies, playing a role in nearly every modern industry and in thousands of products that consumers use every day. \n\nBesides process equipment, the plant has a number of tanks for storage of raw materials and products, rail car and truck loading/unloading facilities, a laboratory, and a research and development facility. Because we handle large quantities of chemicals, we use a combination of good design practices, an accidental release prevention program, and an emergency response program to ensure the safety of our employees, the public, and the environment. Information on these programs is provided in other sections of this executive summary. We are committed to operating our facility in a safe and responsible manner.\n\n3.0 KEY OFFSITE CONSEQUENCE REVIEW\n\nEPA's RMP rule (40 CFR 68) requires that we provide information about two types of offsite consequence analysis scenarios: worst-case scenarios and alternative release scenarios. There are strict requirements for choosing and modeling worst-case release scenarios; as a result, these scenarios are often exceedingly conservative. The purpose of the alternative release scenarios is to provide emergency planners with more information about the chemicals we handle and about their relative hazards. The alternative release scenarios are more realistic than worst-case release scenarios but are still unlikely to happen.  The software program RMP Comp and the look up tables from Risk Management Program Guidance for Offsite Consequence Analysis provided by EPA were used to model the worst-case and alternative release scenarios. \n\nInformation on the number and type of public and environm"

Information on environmental receptors was obtained from USGS topographic maps, aerial photos and plant maps.\n\n4.0 GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nWe take a systematic, proactive approach to preventing accidental releases of hazardous chemicals. We are in compliance with OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) rule and this RMP rule. Our management system addresses each of the key features of a successful prevention program, as described below in Sections 4.1 through 4.12.\n\n4.1 Process Safety Information\n\nThe Vulcan-Wichita plant maintains a variety of technical documents that describe the chemicals and processes at our facility. These documents are kept up to date and are available to all employees and address important process parameters such as 1) operating limits for the equipment, 2) design basis and configuration of the equipment, and 3) physical properties and hazards of the chemicals used in our processes. Plant personnel rely on these documents to perform their job functions properly, consistently and in a safe manner.\n\nChemical information is usually documented in material safety data sheets (MSDSs). MSDSs contain information concerning both the physical properties and the hazards associated with each chemical. This information typically includes: 1) toxicity information; 2) physical data; 3) reactivity and corrosivity data; 4) thermal and chemical stability data; and 5) hazards of mixing substances together. MSDSs are available to all employees, as well as the emergency responders in our community.\n\nImportant process parameters are also documented and maintained.

Each process is examined in detail to ensure that all hazards are identified and that appropriate controls are in place to manage those hazards. Our hazard assessments focus on preventing incidents, accidents, and injuries to plant personnel and community, and on preventing adverse impacts to the environment.\n\nA hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis is typically used for our process hazard analyses. A team comprising personnel with engineering, process and operations experience systematically examines each hazard in each section of the process including looking at previous incidents with catastrophic potential, and identifies potential causes and a range of possible consequences, including possible health and safety effects. The team then compares the hazard to the existing set of engineering and administrative prevention and mitigation measures designed to contain that hazard, making further recommendations when deemed necessary. These recommendations are resolved by management and are tracked until they are implemented.\n\nWe update and revalidate each process hazard analysis every five years. The results and findings from these revalidation studies are documented and retained, and recommendations are tracked until completion.\n\n4.3 Operating Procedures\n\nOur engineers, operators, and supervisors work together to develop and maintain technically accurate operating procedures that provide clear instructions to our operators to ensure the safe operation of our facility.

Operating procedures are used as a reference by experienced employees and provide a consistent basis for training new employees. In addition to describing the steps for safely conducting operations, the procedures also contain valuable information about safe upper and lower limits for operating parameters such as temperature, pressure, flows and compositions, consequences of deviating from the safe limits, applicable safety and health information, procedures for preparing equipment for maintenance, and list safety systems such as pressure relief devices, rupture discs, scrubbers, and fire protection systems. Operating procedures are annually certified as accurate to ensure that they are updated following process changes.\n\n4.4 Training\n\nThe Vulcan-Wichita plant trains workers to safely and effectively perform their tasks. Both classroom and on-the-job training is provided. Employees who are new to a process are given basic training that includes: 1) a general overview of the process; 2) the properties of the substances used in the process and their associated safety and health hazards; 3) safe work practices; and 4) a detailed review of the operating procedures for that process. Once they have demonstrated their understanding of this initial training, they are paired with an experienced operator to learn their specific job functions and tasks. After they demonstrate their competence in performing these tasks, they are allowed to work independently.\n\nThrough oral reviews, written tests, and on-the-job demonstration, we ensure that our employees understand the training given to them.

Preventive and predictive maintenance practices keep equipment in good working condition and warn operators and maintenance personnel of problems, allowing proactive repairs to be completed. Preventive measures taken include proper materials of construction (e.g., to prevent corrosion, much of the piping in certain sections of our plant is monel, Teflon-lined or fiberglass rather than carbon steel), use of sealess or double-seal pumps in organic chemical service, and use of water treatment chemicals that will minimize corrosion of process equipment such as heat exchangers.\n\nPredictive maintenance technologies employed include vibration analysis, thermography, ultrasonic and oil analysis. Vibration analysis is used for early detection of bearing problems on pumps, compressors, fans and motors. Thermography is used to locate problems on electrical equipment. Ultrasonic technology uses sound waves to determine the thickness of tank walls and piping. Oil analysis is a chemical evaluation of oil samples that helps determine the condition of mechanical and electrical equipment. Our inspection and testing program helps identify equipment damage or deterioration before the equipment fails. When a deficiency is found, maintenance personnel correct the problem and try to identify the root causes of the deficiency so that future problems are avoided.\n\nOur quality assurance system ensures that new or replacement equipment meets the strict design standards required for service in our facility.

Except for replacements-in-kind (e.g., replacing a valve with an identical valve), all changes are subjected to a hazard analysis to ensure that 1) new hazards are not inadvertently introduced into the system, 2) safety consequences resulting from the change are addressed, 3) operators in the process are notified of the change and made aware of possible repercussions, and 4) all training material, process safety information, and operating procedures are updated. The management of change system applies to changes in the chemicals used, process equipment, technology, procedures, and other facility changes.\n\n4.7 Pre-Startup Review\n\nThe Vulcan-Wichita plant performs a pre-startup safety review for all new facilities or whenever a change at an existing facility occurs that requires updating the process safety information. This review ensures that safety features, procedures, personnel, and the equipment are prepared for service before the process is restarted. A pre-startup review will generally include field verification of new construction and also serves a quality assurance function by verifying that accident prevention measures are implemented correctly. Generally, a pre-startup review will ensure that 1) construction and equipment are consistent with design standards, 2) adequate operating, safety, emergency and maintenance procedures are in place, 3) training for all affected employees is complete, and 4) process hazard analysis recommendations have been addressed and actions required for start-up have been completed.\n\n4.8 Incident Investigation\n\nThe Vulcan-Wichita plant investigates each incident that resulted in, or could have resulted in, serious injury to employees, the public, or the environment.

Corrective actions resulting from an incident investigation are tracked until they are resolved. Some examples of changes made as a result of incident investigations include limiting inventory of hazardous chemicals in storage tanks, developing new procedures or revising old ones, changing equipment construction material so it is compatible with process chemistry, expanding our reliability group's efforts under the mechanical integrity program, automation of a process using Distributed Control System (DCS) to allow safe shutdown of a process, requiring operators to perform additional monitoring and to document details of product transfers to tanks, use of nitrogen pad in tanks storing flammable materials, and additional training of operators.\n\n4.9 Employee Participation\n\nThe Vulcan-Wichita plant encourages employees to be involved in every aspect of process safety management and accident prevention. Employees are routinely asked to participate in process hazard analyses, incident investigations, management of change hazard analyses, and all other aspects of the prevention program. Employees have access to all information developed as part of the prevention program, and are specifically informed of any changes that occur in their process areas. The various ways employees are involved in the prevention program are documented in a written plan.\n\n4.10 Safe Work Practices\n\nThe Vulcan-Wichita plant has established safe work practices that ensure the safety of our employees and that of our contractors. Examples of these procedures include: 1) a hot work permit that is designed to control spark- or flame-producing activities; 2) a permit and procedure to control confined space entry; 3) a lockout/tagout procedure for isolating energy sources during maintenance; and 4) procedures for preparing equipment for maintenance.

All contractors are evaluated to ensure that they are well trained and are able to perform their job function in a safe manner. A contractor's safety record and performance are reviewed during the selection process.\n\nOnce a contractor is selected, the Vulcan-Wichita plant provides training and procedures to ensure that contractor employees 1) perform their work in a safe manner, 2) are aware of the hazards associated with the area in which they will be working, 3) understand the emergency response procedures, and 4) report any hazards they find during their work. Our personnel periodically monitor contractor activities to ensure they are performing their work in a safe manner.\n\n4.12 Compliance Audits\n\nA compliance audit is performed periodically to help ensure that the prevention program activities at our facility are adequate and that safety issues are addressed effectively. Audits are performed by a team that is knowledgeable in our processes, but is independent of our facility, to ensure a thorough and complete evaluation. The audit team systematically evaluates each aspect of the prevention program, ensuring both compliance with the RMP rule and effective hazard prevention. The results of audits are documented, and recommendations are tracked until they are resolved. Compliance audits are conducted at least every three years.  In addition we conduct weekly internal compliance audits. These are scheduled so that every area of the facility is audited four times per year.\n\n5.0 CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe prevention program described previously ensures the safe operation of our facility by providing our employees with a system they can use to safely perform their job functions.

These features may contain or control a release, detect a release, or reduce the consequences of a release. They may also prevent a release by providing strict design standards for process equipment. The following types of safety features are used in various processes in our facility.\n\n5.1 Release Detection\n\na) Releases are detected quickly because at least one operator is present at each plant at all times and operators inspect their plants on a routine schedule\nb) There is video surveillance of the loading/unloading areas\nc) Procedures require that a Vulcan-Wichita plant employee be present during loading and unloading operations\nd) Hand-held monitoring equipment such as draeger tubes are used as needed for release detection\n\n5.2 Release Containment and Control\n\na) Breather valves on storage tanks discharge to a thermal oxidizer to capture and incinerate material released\nb) Some pressure relief valves discharge to scrubbers where the stream is neutralized before venting to the atmosphere\nc) Valves are used to permit isolation of a process where a release has occurred\nd) Excess flow valves or check valves are used on chlorine lines, methyl chloride lines, and in certain tanks to limit the amount of material released\ne) There is an shutoff system on in-plant chlorine transfer pipeline limits the amount released in case of a pipe rupture\nf) There are automated shutdown systems for some process parameters (e.g., high level, high or low pressure, high temperature)\ng) Manual shutdown systems are located in control rooms\nh) Diked areas are designed to contain a spill\ni) Pressure relief valves and rupture disks are designed to discharge safely to the atmosphere.

      "SummaryText": "valves upstream and downstream of rupture discs close automatically within a few seconds, minimizing releases.                                                 j) Corrosion probes are installed in vessels containing corrosive materials. These probes provide online corrosion monitoring information used to schedule maintenance activities on a vessel, preventing vessel failure.\n5.3 Release Mitigation\n\na) There is automatic fire suppression equipment at plant areas where flammable materials are stored or manufactured and at cooling towers. Fire extinguishers are located within easy reach of all plant areas.\nb) There are trained emergency response personnel\nc) Spill control equipment is maintained onsite for containment and cleanup of spills\nd) PPE (such as protective clothing, self-contained breathing apparatus) is kept in all control rooms. In addition, all personnel are issued PPE they need to do their job safely\n\n6.0 FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nOur five-year accident history shows continued improvement in safe operations at our facility. The number of accidental chemical releases has been decreasing over the last five years, from 6 CERCLA reportable quantity (RQ) releases in 1999, of RMP regulated chemicals from RMP regulated processes, to 3 in 2003. Our OSHA 200 log recordable injuries have also decreased from 9 in 1999 to 3 in 2003. \n\nOne chemical release over the past 5 years has met the RMP criteria for reporting accidental releases. This chemical release did not result in injuries, deaths, significant property damage, or environmental damage on or off of the plant site. However neighboring residences were asked to shelter in place as a precaution.  On December 12, 2000 a process reactor over pressured and the rupture disk relieved resulting in a release to the atmosphere.  As a precaution, the Community Alert Network (CAN) was sounded for 3 of our 8 zones asking contacts to shelter in place making this an RMP reportable incident. This message was sent to 92 conta"

      "SummaryText": "cts out of a group of over 950 contacts, based on real time meteorological data. Because contacts were asked to shelter in place during a chemical release of an RMP covered chemical from a RMP covered process, this chemical release is required to be included in the 5-year accident history.   \n\n7.0 EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe Vulcan-Wichita plant maintains a written emergency response plan that is designed to protect employees, the public, and the environment. The procedures include all aspects of emergency response, including proper first-aid and other medical procedures, the use of emergency equipment, the use of PPE, evacuation plans, accountability procedures, responsibilities of onsite personnel, and community emergency response notification procedures.\n\nProcedures for maintaining emergency response equipment are also contained in the emergency response plan. Employees receive periodic training in the duties they are expected to perform during an emergency. Affected employees are notified of any change in the emergency response plan.\n\nThe emergency response plan is coordinated with local emergency responders so that they are aware of the hazards of our processes. We conduct annual Community Awareness and Emergency Response (CAER) and table top drills with the fire department, emergency medical services, 911, county disaster management and the sheriff department. We have annual orientation sessions for new members of these outside response agencies. We also actively participate in the local emergency planning commission (LEPC) meetings. Communication channels with local responders are kept open 24-hours per day. This coordination and communication ensures that the public is quickly notified, if necessary, and that action is promptly taken to minimize the consequences of a release. As indicated in Section 1.0, our SAFER and CAN systems allow us to quickly identify if residents and industrial complexes surrounding the plant will be impacted by a release, and to"

Suggestions for improving safety are regularly addressed through process hazard analysis, management of change procedures, incident investigations and employee suggestions. The following changes have been completed or are ongoing processes:\n\na) Additional alarms have been added on operator screens to alert an operator of upset conditions.\nb) Upgrades to scrubber systems for neutralizing released chemicals and addition of online detectors on scrubber stacks have been installed.\nc) Specific safety and chemical release prevention topics are covered in monthly safety meetings to raise employee awareness. Topics are selected after reviewing safety and release incident investigation recommendations or employee suggestions. \n\nd) Rail Car Release Minimization Project. This project will provide the means to reduce chemicals released during a potential rail car loading / unloading incident.\n9.0 Security\nVulcan is in compliance with the American Chemistry Council's Responsible Care Security Code.  A security vulnerability analysis has been conducted and Vulcan has implemented comprehensive security procedures and improvements.  A transportation security plan has also been implemented including employee training."
