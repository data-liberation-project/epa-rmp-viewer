It is the policy of C & M Properties to adhere to all applicable federal and state safety and environmental regulations.\r\n\r\nC & M Properties emergency response policy involves the preparation of response plans and training of employees. C & M Properties has trained its refrigeration personnel in hazardous materials response (24 hours).  This training includes emphasis on anhydrous ammonia, in addition to other requirements set forth in 29 CFR 1910.120(q) and WAC 296-62, Part P (HAZWOPER).\r\n\r\nAt C & M Properties, anhydrous ammonia is used on-site. Ammonia is considered hazardous by EPA and is listed on the Extremely Hazardous Substance (EHS) list.  Chemical properties of ammonia make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling ammonia in order to:\r\n* Prevent unnecessary human exposure\r\n* Reduce the threat to our personnel\r\n* Reduce the threat to the community\r\n\r\nB.    Facility and Regulated Substance Handled\r\n\r\nC & M Properties is a fruit packing and cold storage facility, located at 201 S. Union East Wenatchee, WA.  The facility is located in Douglas County.\r\n\r\nThe regulated substance used at C & M Properties is anhydrous ammonia (CAS# 7664-41-7). The use of anhydrous ammonia is as a refrigerant.\r\n\r\nThere are 17,500 pounds of anhydrous ammonia in the refrigeration system.  C & M Properties's prior RMP Report indicated 14,500 pounds were in the system, which was a clerical error.  The facility has always had 17,500 pounds of anhydrous ammonia in the refr"
