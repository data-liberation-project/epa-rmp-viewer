Our plan considers all federal, state and local regulatory requirements for emergency response planning.  The plan is designed to respond to a release of a regulated substance and provide first aid and medical treatment for exposures.  It also contains plans for evacuation, accounting for personnel after the evacuation, and notification of local emergency response agencies.  We have coordinated our emergency response activities with the Hockley County, Texas emergency response agencies.  In the event of fire, explosion, or release of the regulated substance from the process, entry within the distance to the specified endpoints may pose a danger to the public emergency responders.  Therefore, public emergency responders should not enter this area except as arranged with the emergency contact indicated in the RMP Plan.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\r\n\r\n1.  We will continue to develop and utilize a root cause failure methodology in analyzing MCRP incidents.\r\n2.  We will continue to develop and share management practice involving operations and maintenance activities between Occidental Plants.\r\n3.  We will review our active process safety management program from time to time for appropriate improvements to the program.\r\n\r\n\r\nCertification\r\n\r\nBased on the criteria in 40 CFR 68.10, the distance to the specific endpoint for the worst-case accidental release scenario for the pentane inventory is less than the distance to the nearest public receptor.\r\n\r\nWithin the past five years the MCRP process has had no accidental release that caused off-site impacts provided in 40 CFR 68.10 (b)(1).

Mallet CO2 Recovery Plant (MCRP) is committed to operating and maintaining all of our processes (especially regarding the use of hazardous substances) in a safe and responsible manner.  We use a combination of accidental release safeguards and programs, along with emergency response programs to address the safety of our employees and the public and to protect the environment.  Our policy is to integrate process controls and administrative procedures that are designed to prevent the release of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, MCRP personnel are trained through an emergency action plan to control and contain the release.  This document provides a brief overview of the risk management activities we have designed and implemented.\r\n\r\n\r\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substance Handled\r\n\r\nThe primary purpose of the Mallet CO2 Recovery Plant is to provide high purity CO2 for injection into oil formations, thus enhancing oil recovery.  The plant includes facilities for compressing, sweetening, treating, dehydrating and separating the gas, then compressing it to the required injection pressure.  By-product streams that result from these processing facilities include LPG product for sales, residue gas and acid gas that is routed to the Slaughter Gas Plant.  Out evaluation of the regulated substances involved in the Mallet CO2 Recovery Plant process resulted in our classifying this as a Program Level 1 process with the M-1 Pentane Inventory being the source of our worst-case scenario.\r\n\r\n\r\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program\r\n\r\nMCRP qualifies as a Program Level 1 facility and is not required to have a specific prevention program.  However, we do have an active PSM program, which incorporates accidental release prevention.\r\n\r\n\r\nFive-Year Accident History\r\n\r\nReview of the MCRP incident records of the past five years; found that MCRP has not experienced an"
