Milk, cream, and additives arrive in bulk.  The milk is fermented into various cheeses, processed, cooled, and packaged. After packaging, the product is stored in our refrigerated warehouse until it is shipped to the customer or to other Great Lakes Cheese facilities for further processing (slicing/shredding.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policy\n\n\n\nEmpire Cheese is committed to maintaining a safe manufacturing operation for our employees and the surrounding community.  The refrigeration system was constructed under permit from local authorities. Additionally, Empire Cheese adheres, where appropriate, to industry-consensus codes and standards, including the ASHRAE Safety Code for Refrigeration and the IIAR-2 Standard of the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration.  This facility also complies with OSHA's Process Safety Management Standard (PSM).\n\n\n\nStationary Sources and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nTo ensure the quality of our final products, refrigeration is necessary to maintain the low temperatures required for the food processing and storage areas of the plant.  Anhydrous ammonia, the regulated substance, is the refrigerant in the cooling system.  It was chosen because it is an environmentally friendly, energy-efficient refrigerant.  (It is commonly used in industrial applications.)  Anhydrous ammonia is considered a hazardous material due to its moderate toxicity and slight flammability.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\n\n\nThis Risk Management Plan includes a worst-case scenario and an alternative scenario, as required by law.  The areas of impact were determined using RMP*Comp, and the scenarios were evaluated in accordance with guidance provided by the EPA for Anhydrous Ammonia Refrigeration Systems.\n\n\n\nThis site follows all applicable elements of Pro"

Adherence to the PSM standard significantly reduces the risk of incidents related to the refrigeration system.  \n\n\n\n\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\n\n\nThere were no reportable accidents in the last five years.\n\n\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\n\n\nEmpire Cheese developed and implemented an Emergency Response Plan.  Empire relies upon the efforts of community emergency response personnel to respond to any serious incident at the facility.  We support the efforts of the Cuba Fire Department and other Alleghany County emergency organizations by providing information and technical assistance.  In addition, several members of the responding organizations are also employees at Empire Cheese.\n\n\n\n\n\nContinuing Efforts to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nAs a part of the Process Safety Management program, Empire Cheese systematically looks for possible process or system changes to reduce risk.  As changes are made or as process hazards analysis studies are updated, safety issues and improvements are identified and addressed, where appropriate. "
