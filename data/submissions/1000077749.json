      "SummaryText": "White River Municipal Water District (MWD) (District) operates a Water Treatment Plant (WTP) which is located at 2880 FM 2794, in Crosby County, Texas near Spur. The WTP provides potable water to the cities of Crosbyton, Post, Ralls, and Spur, as well as to Rio Blanco Estates subdivision. Chlorine gas is used in the disinfection process at the White River MWD WTP.  Up to 8,000 pounds of chlorine may be stored at the White River MWD WTP.  Because the stored quantity of chlorine onsite exceeds the threshold quantity (?68.130; Table 1), White River MWD developed this Risk Management Plan (RMP).  The White River MWD WTP is subject to Program 2 RMP requirements (?68.12(c)).  A Management System overseen by the White River MWD Plant Superintendent is implemented to ensure that the RMP and associated Prevention Program are implemented correctly and maintained up-to-date. The District's accidental release prevention and emergency response policies include commitments to safety and to implementation of safe procedures to ensure accidental releases of chlorine gas are prevented.\n\n\n\nThe accidental release prevention program (Prevention Program) includes required elements of 40 CFR Part 68 such as safety information, hazard review, operating procedures, training, maintenance, compliance audits, and incident investigation.  Detailed documentation of each element of the Prevention Program is contained within the text of the RMP. Operator training is key to the effectiveness of the Prevention Program. The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) licensing program for water operators is used as a training tool, along with site-specific RMP training.  TCEQ licensing testing and on-site observation and demonstration are used to evaluate comprehension of all training materials.  Written operating procedures are used in conjunction with on-the-job training to ensure that certified WTP operators are proficient in performing their duties before being allowed to work with chlorine"

      "SummaryText": " storage and feed systems.  Certified WTP operators conduct daily inspections and any problems with the chlorine systems are corrected and documented. In addition, the certified WTP operators ensure that the equipment used in the disinfection process is maintained according to the manufacturers' recommendations (?68.56(a)). Because of these efforts, the WTP has not had a chlorine release that resulted in an injury, either on-site or off-site, within the previous five (5) years (?68.42(a)).  As part of the Program, the White River MWD will periodically perform compliance audits, hazard reviews and incident investigations, according to a predetermined schedule described in the RMP and as needs dictate.  These compliance audits and hazard reviews document any planned changes to improve safety (?68.50 & ?68.58).\n\n\n\nThe White River MWD WTP complies with the emergency response regulations per Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) 29 CFR ?1910.38, as well as with applicable fire codes and the standards set forth by the Chlorine Institute. The White River MWD WTP is a non-responding facility for emergency response. The White River MWD WTP is included in the Crosby County Local Emergency Planning Committee's (LEPC) regional Emergency Response Plan. Coordination activities are conducted in accordance with ?68.93 with the LEPC and the first responders [the City of Crosbyton Volunteer Fire Department (VFD)] at least annually, and more frequently if necessary. WTP operators are trained to contact the City of Crosbyton VFD via 9-1-1 in the event of a release.  The City of Crosbyton VFD will serve as the first responder and coordinate the emergency response according to the regional Emergency Response Plan, including the evacuation of surrounding residents when required (?68.90(b)).\n\n"
