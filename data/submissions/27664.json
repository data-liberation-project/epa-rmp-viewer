      "SummaryText": "GABE LOGSDON & SONS, INC.\nWayland & Gregory Landing, Missouri\n\nLocation 1 -\tGabe Logsdon & Sons, Inc. (Logsdon Elevator) operates a 12,000 gallon Anhydrous Ammonia storage tank at its Gregory Landing Grain Elevator in extreme Northeast Missouri.  The exact location is 8 miles south of Wayland, Missouri on Highway 61, then 4 miles east on Route F.  The tank is about 1/4 mile south of the main elevator.\n\nHazard 2 -\tAnhydrous Ammonia (NH3) is stored under pressure as a liquid.  When released, it vaporizes into a non-flammable, colorless gas with a strong pungent penetrating odor.  Ammonia is a severe irritant of the eyes, respiratory tract and skin.  Areas exposed to ammonia gas should be evacuated immediately.\n\nProcess 3 -\tThis storage tank is operated in the spring to supply local farmers with ammonia.  Typically, we receive one trailer truck load at a time (approximately 20 tons) into the storage tank.  Then transfer it into tank wagons.  We try to have our tank empty when planting season is over.\n\nPrevention 4 -\tBefore each ammonia season, we do a safety check of the storage tank, pipes, valves and pump.  We check the hoses and valves on each of the 12 tank wagons.  We also check our supply of safety equipment so we can give each farmer safety gloves and goggles when they pick up a tank wagon.  All needed parts and supplies are replaced with approved equipment.  Our storage tank is equipped with excess flow valves and check valves that shut off automatically in case of accidental release, and pressure relief valves to prevent excess pressure.  This tank is kept locked at all times.  Our employees are trained to transfer the ammonia safely.\n\nWorst Case 5 -\tOur worst case scenario would be for our tank to be filled to capacity, about 2\u00bd trailer truck loads (approximately 50 tons) and have the tank fail to release all contents.  In this case, all efforts should be to evacuate all persons within a 4\u00bd mile radius of the tank, especially in the down wind direction.  Most"

      "SummaryText": "residences in this area are located along Highway 61, 3\u00bd to 4 miles to the west.  The closest person by far is one resident located \u00bd  mile to the north.  The Mississippi River is located over a levee east of the tank, so that area should be checked for boaters.\n\nResponders 6 -\tOur employees have written instructions to notify the local emergency responders and then to leave the area removing any persons they find with them.  They would help seal the area.\n\n\t\t\tClark County Sheriff's Office\t\t660/727-2911\n\t\t\tWayland Fire Department\t\t\t660/754-6650\n\t\t\tClark County LEPC\t\t\t\t660/465-7281\n\t\t\tU.S. Lock & Dam #20 at Canton\t\t573/288-3320\n\nSmaller Release 7 - Any release, smaller than the worst case, would only affect the people at the \t\televator, people passing by or possibly the one resident living \u00bd mile to the north.  Our employees have been instructed to leave the area and keep people from coming back into it.  They will also notify the local responders of the problem.  \n\nAccidents 8 -\tWe have not had any accident in the last five years.\n\nPlanning 9 -\tWe need continuous communication to employees and customers about the hazards of ammonia, and to see that all equipment is maintained to be safe.  We need to be aware of improved safety equipment or procedures as provided by local emergency personnel or through the ammonia industry.\n\nPolicy 10 -\tOur ammonia storage tank is located in a remote area, and usually is being operated by one person.  In the event of an accident release, unless the operator understands the problem and can safely stop the spill, the safest procedure would be to leave the area until there is time to access the problem and obtain the proper safety equipment and personnel to do the repair."
