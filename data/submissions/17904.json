      "SummaryText": "A.  Howard Bend Water Treatment Plant\nThe Water Division is a branch of the City of St. Louis Department of Public Utilities.  We have proudly invested in and served the greater St. Louis Metropolitan area since 1835.  The Water Division's Howard Bend Water Treatment Plant has been providing safe, clean drinking water to city customers since 1929.  Additionally, the Howard Bend Plant also wholesales high quality water to a number of surrounding water utilities in the counties of St. Louis and St. Charles.  The plant is located off of Olive Boulevard in the Missouri River Valley in Chesterfield, Missouri.\n\nB.  Chlorine\nAt the Howard Bend Water Treatment Plant, we have always used chlorine as a part of the treatment process that provides our community with safe drinking water.  Chlorine is the most widely used disinfectant.  It has been safely used to disinfect drinking water for nearly 100 years.  Water supply disinfectant has virtually eliminated incidences of waterborne diseases such as cholera, typhoid and dysentery and is credited with increasing American's life expectancies by more than 50 percent.\n\n Chlorine is a greenish-yellow gas with a pungent, irritating odor similar to bleach and is toxic in certain concentrations.   Chlorine exists as a gas at ambient temperature and pressure, but is liquified when kept in our process equipment.  The chlorine we use is transported to the plant by rail in a Department of Transportation (DOT)- approved heavy-wall steel 55 ton railroad tank car.  The railcar is securely parked outdoors at our facility in accordance with DOT regulations and connected to our process equipment.\n\nC.  Environmental, Health and Safety Policy\nWe have long understood the hazards of handling chlorine, which is not handled properly, can pose a risk to the community.  It is  the Water Division's policy to conduct our business in accordance with all applicable environmental, health and safety laws and regulations and to promote a healthful, safe and pr"

The Howard Bend Plant complies with this regulation, as well as others, to ensure that the risks involved in handling, use and storage of chlorine and other potentially hazardous chemicals are minimized.\n\nD.  Risk Managment Plan\nWe recognize  there are risks associated with handling and using chlorine.  We have been, and will continue efforts to improve the safety of our plant.  The water Division has conducted hazard reviews and has implemented an accidental release prevention program which integrates technologies, procedures and management practices.  Additionally, the Howard Bend Plant has trained employees for emergency response and maintains an Emergency Response Plan which has been supplied to the St. Louis County Hazmat Team.  These programs enable the Howard Bend Plant to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences of hazardous releases of chlorine.\n\nE.  Offsite Coonsequence Analysis\nUnder the RMP rule, the Howard Bend Water Plant is required to conduct and document an offsite consequence analysis, which includes consideration of two chlorine release scenarios, identified as a \"worst-case release scenario\" and an \"alternative release scenario\".  The first scenario is defined by EPA as the \"maximum quantity in the largest vessel...released as a gas over 10 minutes\" during worst-case weather conditions (no wind, low humdity), due to an unspecified failure.  This worst-case Scenario assumes that all safety systems fail and that there is no emergency response.  The alternative release scenario is a different, more realistic sceraio, which depicts a failure defined by the facility.  In the alternative release scenario, facilities are allowed to include active mitigation systems in calculating the distance that an accidental release of this type could pose as a hazard to the public or the environment.\n\nThe offsite conseque"

To determine the distance over which releases could pose a hazard to the public or the environment, the EPA has established endpoint exposure concentrations.  The endpoint for chlorine is based on the American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA) Emergency Response Planning Guidline (ERPG)-2.  This value represents the \"maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects or symptoms which could impair an individual's ability to take protective action\".  The chlorine toxic endpoint used in offsite consequence analysis is 3 parts per million (0.0087 milligrams/liter)  The population potentially effected is defined as the population within a circle that has as its center the point of release, and its radius equals the distance to the toxic endpoint.  The offsite consequence analysis for the Howard Bend Water Treatment Plant was conducted using EPA's RMP*Comp v. 1.06 atmospheric modeling software.\n\nWorst Case Release Scenario\nFor the Howard Bend Water Treatment Plant, the worst-case release woud be the instantaneous failure of a 55-ton chlorine railroad tank car wall causing a total release of the contents of a full tank car in 10 minutes under worst-case weather conditions.  This scenario also assumes a complete failure of all safety controls and no emergency response.  This would result in the release of 110,000 pounds of chlorine.\n\nThe hypothetical worst-case scenario is intended to define the full potential for offsite iimpacts from an accidental chemical release.  Defining that potential is valuable however, the worst-case scenario is extremely unlikely to occur, and therefore is presented only due to "

It is unlikely to occur because of all of the layers of protection in place to prevent or minimize a large release:\n- The chlorine process equipment is designed and operated to minimize accidental releases.\n- The process is monitored continuously and the plant is manned 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.\n- Plant operating personnel are State-licensed, trained and qualified to operate the chlorine process equipment safely.\n- Approved operating and maintenance procedures are implemented and maintained.\n- Early-warning, highly sensitive leak detection equipment monitors the process equipment.\n- Emergency response plans and equipment are in place at the plant.\n- Emergency notification systems are in place.\n\nIt is also important to note that, in the extremely unlikely event that a worst-case release would occur, only the population within an elliptical plume extending downwind of the release point is potentially affected.  This plume area, or footprint, is approximately one-twentieth of the area of the full circle.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario\nRMP regulations require that a scenario which is a more realistic scenario than the worst-case release be selected as the alternative release. The scenario selected involves the failure ofhte 3/8 inch tubing that transfers chlorine from the storage tank car to the water chlorination system.  In this scenario, the amount of chlorine released is 8,430 pounds at an average rate over 30 minutes (the duration of the release) of 281 lb/min.  Active mitigation systems considered are the actuation of a chlorine detector and execution of emergency response procedures.\n\nF.

No injuries, property or environmental damage resulted from the release; however, during the emergency response, the Howard Bend Plant and a neighboring plant were evacuated as a precautionary measure.  This efficient and effective response is a testament to the quality of our emergency response plans and the competence of our highly trained employees.  Improved piping maintenance and inspection procedures are in place to minimize chances of a similar failure.\n\nI.  Planned Changes to Improve Safety\nCurrently, the City of St. Louis Water Division is undergoing a multimillion dollar construction project at the Howard Bend Water Treatment Plant that will reduce the quantity of chlorine stored onsite and provide additional layers of protection to the chlorine process.  Once the new state-of-the-art facility is on-line, the plant will receive chlorine only in one ton cylinders.  All chlorine cylinders will be stored inside a containment building with emergency scrubber equipment, automatic fire protection equipment, an emergency power supply, gas detection equipment and alarms, liquid tight floors and secondary containment provisions.  In preparation for this process change, new standard operating and maintenance procedures are being drafted, emergency response plans are being revised and plant personnel are undergoing extensive training.  The new chlorine facility is scheduled to be on-line by February 2000.  The new protection measures will further reduce the RMP worst-case and alternate case scenario distances to endpoint."
