We at the Baxter Water Treatment Plant (Baxter WTP) use chemicals too.  For example, we use chlorine to disinfect our water to provide safe drinking water for human consumption.  Storing large quantities of chlorine can be a hazard.  We take our safety obligations in storing and using chlorine as seriously as we do providing the public safe, disinfected drinking water.  The following document describes what could happen if there were to be an accident, the steps we take everyday to ensure a safely operating plant, and what to do in event of an emergency.  \n\nAccidental Release Prevention and  Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe Philadelphia Water Department (PWD) and Baxter WTP accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates proven technology, trains staff on operation and maintenance practices, and uses tested management system practices.  All applicable procedures of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Prevention Program are adhered to, including key elements such as training, systems management, and emergency response procedures.  \n\nThis document complies with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) Risk Management Program, under Section 112 (r) of the Clean Air Act (CAA) Amendments of 1990, 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 68. The Baxter WTP has a chlorination system that uses chlorine gas fed from rail cars. This document summarizes our existing health and safety programs, our internal management response team, policies, procedures, and on-going actions that are designed to prevent or minimize impacts of accidental releases of chlorine to the environment. The Baxter WTP has prepared a detailed and comprehensive emergency response plan to handle any potential accidental releases that is designed to safeguard both on- and off-site peopl"

      "SummaryText": "e. To date, we have had an excellent record in preventing accidents from occurring. The Baxter WTP chlorine facility is equipped with a chlorine emergency scrubber system designed to contain and neutralize accidental releases and safeguard plant employees and as well as the general public.  \n\nGeneral Facility and Regulated Substances Information\n\nThe Baxter WTP, operating since 1959, is located at 9001 State Road in the City of Philadelphia. The plant is located on property between the Delaware River and State Road in the northeastern section of Philadelphia.  Surface water taken from the Delaware River is treated and disinfected at the Baxter WTP to EPA standards and sent to the public for human consumption. This water treatment process includes preliminary screening, coagulation and sedimentation, filtration, and chlorination before final distribution to the public. The Baxter WTP produces up to 282 million gallons per day (MGD) of potable water, with an average flow of between 165 to 175 MGD.\n\nThe facility currently stores chlorine, which is a regulated toxic substance under 40 CFR Part 68 - RMP.  The Plant's chlorine storage exceeds the listed threshold quantity of 2,500 pounds in the RMP Regulations. \n\nLiquid chlorine is brought to the plant via rail lines that enter the property. Chlorine leak detector monitors continuously checks for leaks in the bulk storage areas and in the chlorination rooms. Other indicators include chlorine feed and evaporator alarms. These alarms are annunciated at the central and local control panels at the plant in the main control building. In the case of a leak, the storage area has an audible alarm and red flashing warning light on top of the building.  In addition, an evaporator shut-off and pressure reducing valve is designed to close if low evaporator gas temperature is detected; thus preventing liquid chlorine from reaching the gas piping system.  These valves also reduce pressure and allow for quicker liquefaction to occur.  A"

Both buildings are equipped with an automatic operated ventilation system that operates when the chlorine leak detector detects 5 ppm of chlorine in the room. Room air is vented to a scrubber that neutralizes the gases.  Emergency showers and eye wash stations are provided at each building.  The main control building has Self-Contained Breathing Apparatus (SCBAs) available.   \n\nThe Baxter WTP is controlled at State Road by a gate that is only open during normal working hours.  Visitors and contractors must check-in at the administration building and be approved by Baxter WTP staff prior to entry into the facility.  The plant is manned 24-hours a day, year round, and alarms notify staff of any problems or situations that require follow-up investigations at all times.      \n\nFive-year Accident History Summary\n\nNo chlorine releases that could have caused safety or health hazards to any individuals at off-site locations (no deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place) occurred at Baxter WTP during the last five years. Some minor, incidental releases may have occurred over this period, but they were quickly handled by staff, were neutralized by the existing scrubber, or posed no safety or health hazards. \n\nThere was a single release on-site during the past 5-years that affected a single employee in the 90-ton railcar area at the plant near a packing gland.  The employee affected received minor medical treatment and returned to work the next day.  There was no other damage resulting from this small incidental release. \n\nSummary of the Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-specific Prevention Steps \n\nBaxter WTP is in compliance with Federal Risk Management Planning (RMP) requirements.

The team consisted of process operating and maintenance experts and process design engineers.  The HA technique used was the \"What-If\" scenario and process checklist procedure, per acceptable approach guidance from EPA. The HA was lead by knowledgeable persons on the type of process being reviewed.  This review will be updated again within a five-year period, or whenever there is major change in the process.  A list of actions to resolve any found significant hazard review findings was prepared, and staff has traced and resolved items on this list.  In 2004, the HA was reviewed and found to be applicable since there have been no major process changes.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nBaxter WTP maintains up-to-date, accurate, written operating procedures that give clear instructions for the chlorine process. Baxter WTP ensures effective operating practices by combining them with operating and maintenance training programs.  Standard operating procedures (SOPs) provide system descriptions, specifications, equipment inspection requirements, and operating procedures for the chlorine system.  Procedures include startup, shutdown, and normal, alternate, and emergency operation.  Also included are maintenance and troubleshooting procedures, including consequences of deviation and the steps to avoid and correct deviations.
