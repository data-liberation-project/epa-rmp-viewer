FMC employees receive regular training in the areas of operations and safety to minimize the potential of a release due to human error.\n\nThis facility is an approximately 8 acre complex located on the east edge of the town of Kewanna.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, transferred and stored, and distributed as a fertilizer material to our farmer customers.  The maximum quantity stored at any time is 203,000 lbs. or 39,100 gallons total of 5 tanks.  The largest 2 tanks are 12,000 gallons apiece with a capacity of approximately 53,000 lbs.  or 10,200 gallons each.  \n\nThe worst case release scenario would be to have all the ammonia from one of the largest tanks released from the tank and reaching a toxic endpoint of 200 ppm at .65 miles from the tank.  The town of Kewanna lies within the distance to the endpoint therefore a release would have a significant impact on the town.  \n\nAs an alternative release scenario in the event of equipment failure, the amount released before mitigation would reach a toxic endpoint of 200 ppm at .56 miles from the tank.  Approximately 75% of the town of Kewanna falls within this distance and would be impacted due to a release.\n\nFMC has instituted procedures for storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia as required by OSHA and the Indiana State Chemist into the plan.\n\nThere has not been a release resulting in any of the criteria stated in 40 CFR 68.48 in the last 5 years.\n\nThe Emergency Response Plan is in place and all current personnel have been trained in the procedures.  All new hires will receive this training.  All emergency response agencies have received training in the hazards associated with anhydrous ammonia release response.\n\nIt is the policy of FMC to remain proactive in the area of accident prevention and minimization of loss in the event of a release.  We will continue to conduct"
