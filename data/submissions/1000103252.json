Facility Policy: The owners, management and employees of Ricketts Farm Service are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia by utilization of proper equipment, regular inspections and maintenance, and training of all persons that work with the material.  Should an accidental release occur, the facility has coordinated with the local fire department so they can plan for response to any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information:  The primary activity at the facility is the storage of anhydrous ammonia for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient.\n\n3. The worst-case release scenario is not listed in the executive summary for security reasons. The alternate-case release scenario is not listed in the executive summary for security reasons.\n\n4. Accidental Release Program:  Ricketts Farm Service complies with Missouri Laws 266.355 \u2013 Anhydrous ammonia, rules and standards for equipment and handling.  These regulations administered by the Department of Agriculture are consistent with ANSI K61.1-1999 and OSHA 29 CFR 1910.111 regarding the storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia.\n\n5. Five-Year Accident History: There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia\nfor the covered process in the past five years that has resulted in onsite or offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering-in-place, property or environmental damage.\n\n6. Emergency Response Program: Ricketts Farm Service has a written emergency action plan in\naccordance with OSHA Standard 29 CFR 1910.38 and provides state and local authorities the\nemergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III of EPCRA.
