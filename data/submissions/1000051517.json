Delaware River Plant, we are committed to operating and maintaining all of our processes in a safe and responsible manner. We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public as well as protection of the environment. This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that have been designed and implemented, including;\r\n-A description of our facility and use of substances regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Risk Management Plan (RMP) regulation.\r\n\r\n-An overview of our accidental release prevention programs.\r\n\r\n-A fire-year history of accidental releases of chemicals regulated by EPA's RMP.  We have had no accedental releases that meet the criteria to be listed in this report in the last five years.\r\n\r\n-An overview of our emergency response program.\r\n\r\n-An overview of improvements at the facility to help prevent accidental chemical releases from occurring and adversely affecting our employees, the public and the environment.\r\n\r\n-The certifications that EPA's RMP rule requires us to provide.\r\n\r\n-The detailed information (called data elements) about our risk management program.\r\n\r\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\r\nThe Delaware River Plant uses a variety of materials and processing operations to produce:\r\n-Benzyl chloride, which is used as an intermediate to produce a variety of end-products, including plasticizers, perfumes, biocides and flavorings.\r\n\r\n-Plasticizers, which are used to produce vinyl flooring, wire coating, caulk and other soft vinyl end products.\r\n\r\n-Dibutyl phenyl phosphate (DBPP) which is used to make hydraulic fluids for use in aviation control systems. \r\n\r\n-Muriatic Acid which is 32% Hydrochloric Acid.

The anhydrous hydrochloric acid is produced at less than 5,000 pounds per hour in the Benzyl Chloride Process and less than 3,000 pounds per hour in the Phosphate Esters Process.  The gas is absorbed into solution with water and is not stored in the anhydrous state.  There is typically not more than 150 pounds of anhydrous hydrochloric acid in the piping leading to the absorbers.  Therefore, the EPA RMP threshold of having more than 5,000 pounds of anhydrous hydrochloric acid on site instantaneously is not met.  The New Jersey Toxic Catastrophe Prevention Act hydrochloric acid threshold of 2,000 pounds of anhydrous hydrochloric acid on site produced within one hour is met.\r\n\r\nOur plant operates 24 hours, (7) days a week, year-round, except for planned or unplanned downtime for maintenance or inventory control. Our plant has operated safely since its initial startup in 1961 without a major incident affecting our community.\r\n\r\nIn our processes we use the following chemicals that EPA has identified as having the potential to cause significant offsite consequences in the event of a substantial accidental release. Our accidental release prevention programs and our contingency planning efforts help us effectively manage the hazards that are posed to our employees, the public and the environment by our use of these chemicals.\r\n\r\nToxics\r\n\r\nOur facility uses two RMP-regulated chemicals, chlorine and phosphorous oxychloide, to produce our products.\r\n\r\nChlorine, which is purchased, is used at our site to produce benzyl chloride and is stored in and distributed from railroad tank cars. Chlorine is a gas at normal pressure and temperature, but is stored as a liquid under pressure in the tank cars. It is unloaded directly from the tank car into a steam-heated vaporizer, where it is heated to vaporize the liquid chlorine for use.\r\n\r\nPhosphorus Oxichloride is purchased and used at our site to produce phos"
