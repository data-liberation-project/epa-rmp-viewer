This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n\n2.\tThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activity is the operation of a Natural Gas Processing Plant for the production of Natural Gas Liquids.  We have seven regulated substances present at our facility.  These substances include Methane, Ethane, Propane, Isobutane [Propane, 2-methyl], Butane, Isopentane  [Butane, 2-methyl-], and Pentane.  These regulated substances are components of the inlet gas, the NGL product, and the residue natural gas.\n\nThe maximum inventory of the regulated substances at our facility is:\n\nMethane\t\t\t\t  11,000 lb\nEthane\t\t\t\t  41,000 lb\nPropane\t\t\t\t240,000 lb\nIsobutane [Propane, 2-methyl]\t  \t  28,000 lb\nButane\t\t\t\t  38,000 lb\nIsopentane  [Butane, 2-methyl-]\t  52,000 lb\nPentane\t\t\t\t  28,000 lb\n\n3.\tThe Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\nTo evaluate the worst case and alternative release scenarios, we have used the EPA's Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance Reference Tables or Equations.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 3 flammable substances involves a catastrophic release from the Gas Plant and Associated Operations.  In this scenario, 187,574 pounds of a flammable mixture containing Ethane, Pro"

It is assumed that the entire quantity is released as a vapor, which finds an ignition source, with 10 percent of the released quantity participating in a vapor cloud explosion.  Under worst case weather conditions, the maximum distance of 0.46 miles is obtained corresponding to an endpoint of 1 psi overpressure.\n\nThe alternative release scenario submitted for Program 3 flammable substances involves a release from the Gas Plant and Associated Operations.  The release is assumed to result in a Vapor Cloud Explosion.  The scenario involves the release of 187,574 pounds of a flammable mixture containing Ethane, Propane, Isobutane [Propane, 2-methyl], Butane, Isopentane  [Butane, 2-methyl-], and Pentane in  minutes.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the flammable endpoint of 1 psi overpressure is 0.31 miles.\n\n4.\tThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under EPA's RMP (Risk Management Plan) regulations (40 CFR Part 68).  The Fairway Gas Plant is subject to OSHA's PSM (Process Safety Management) regulations (29 CFR 1910.119).  We also have an air operating permit under Title V of the Clean Air Act.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nThe Fairway Gas Plant maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses is the \"What If\" method.  The stud"

Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.  The most recent PHA Update was performed on November 13, 1998.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, the Fairway Gas Plant maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nTraining\nThe Fairway Gas Plant has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Refresher training is provided at least once every three years, and more frequently as needed.\n\n\nMechanical Integrity\nThe Fairway Gas Plant carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  The most recent review/revision of maintenance procedures was performed on November 13, 1998.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nManagement of Change\nWritten procedures are in place at the Fairway Gas Plant to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures.
