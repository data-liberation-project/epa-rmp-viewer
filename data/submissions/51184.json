On-Cor Frozen Foods uses Anhydrous Ammonia as a refrigerant at this facility to provide cooling for the production and storage areas. The On-Cor Frozen Foods refrigeration system is a closed loop system with normal operating pressures that range between a low side of 0 psi to a high side of 185 psi. The ammonia system maximum intended inventory is 5,800 pounds.\n\nWorst-case Release Scenario for a Toxic Release\nThe On-Cor Frozen Foods worst-case release is the catastrophic failure of the High Pressure Receiver in the ammonia system. The maximum capacity of the High Pressure Receiver is 5,800 pounds. The normal operating level in the HPR is 2,320 pounds, so the worst-case release scenario takes in account the possibility the vessel would be 80% full holding 4,640 pounds. In calculating the area affected by this failure, the engine room enclosure, where the HPR is located, will provide passive mitigation, there by reducing the toxic endpoint of the release. The engine room has a continuous air ventilation system. This allows for continuous air changes in the engine room. Using the RMP Comp program downloaded from the EPA Home Page the calculated toxic endpoint was 0.30 miles down wind. Based on the census data provided the population within the radius of the toxic endpoint is 2,100, with residential housing, retail and light industrial businesses areas. There are no hospitals located within the area.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario for a Toxic Release\nThe alternative toxic release scenario was also determined by using the EPA's RMP Guidance. The alternative release was a pressure relief valve function or failure was the most likely cause of an ammonia release. Using the tables provided a pressure relief valve release of 10 minutes releasing 58lbs/mn from the High Pressure Receiver. The toxic endpoint for the release would be .10 miles down"

The facility has also established annual retraining for all personnel that are on the HAZMAT Team as well as periodic spill drills and plant wide evacuation drills to assure all employees are prepared in the event of an ammonia release. On-Cor Frozen Foods will also coordinated efforts with the Chicago Fire Department to establish a joint response program. The On-Cor Frozen Foods established plans and procedures are periodically reviewed and at least annually to assure that they are current and up to date.\n\nEmergency Response Program:\nOn-Cor Frozen Foods has trained personnel that are the refrigeration operators to assure they can perform their responsibilities and procedures safely. The refrigeration operators receive training on the ammonia system when there is a change in the system and at minimum of every three years. On-Cor Frozen Foods has also trained personnel in the Hazardous Waste Operation and Emergency Response Program, OSHA 29 CFR 1910. 120 HAZWAOPER. The trained personnel have been trained at the level of the Technician Level Responder and also the Incident Commander on scene. The trained personnel will assess each release situation and determine by the risk assessment the appropriate emergency response to initiate. This could be by simply tightening a packing nut or a flange bolt or initiating a system shut down. On-Cor Frozen Foods has established a written operating procedure for the ammonia system and has included in the procedure the Emergency Shutdown and Isolation in the event of a release.

The in-house HAZMAT Team will coordinate their efforts with the outside Emergency Services to assure safety for all personnel.\n\nFive Year Accident History:\nIncident Investigation Report\n\nThe Ammonia release on August 14, 2007 at On-Cor Frozen Foods, LLC came from the FES Dual Package Screw Compressor built in 1983. This FES Compressor uses SOC cooling (Screw Oil Cooling) to maintain  the oil temperature for normal operation. On-Cor Frozen Foods, LLC runs one shift of production, one shift for sanitation and do not run a third shift. During the sanitation shift operation the ammonia system is shutdown for production and is put on standby. At the end of the production run for that day the FES Compressor was unloaded and put on standby until the next days operations. During this shutdown period the liquid solenoid valve on the SOC cooling line failed to hold close. This allowed liquid ammonia to leak pass the solenoid valve and enter into the screw housing  above the oil separator. The liquid ammonia passed through the screw housing that was not running and enter into the oil separator. In the oil separator there is a oil heater to maintain oil temperature for startup. This higher temperature caused the liquid ammonia to gas off in the oil separator. This unit has a motorized check valve on the discharge side (outlet) of the oil separator. When the unit is shutdown for standby this motorized check valve closes per design. This is so condensed liquid in the discharge header can not back flow into the oil separator. This motorized check valve opens up when the compressor restarts. The fact that this compressor was not running at the time the liquid ammonia gassing off in the oil separator was trapped due to the motorized check valve closed. This created an over pressure in the oil separator. The oil separator is protected by a dual relief valve assembly and each relief valve is rated at 250 psig."

So when the over pressure in the oil separator occurred the 250 lbs relief valve lifted per its design and relief the over pressure in  the oil separator. This prevented a major rupture of the oil separator. However this did release ammonia gas to the atmosphere. The On-Cor Frozen Foods, LLC personnel were contacted that there was a ammonia incident at the plant and plant personnel responded to the scene. Once they arrived at the facility the Chicago Fire Department was already on location and in control of the incident. The Fire department denied plant personnel entry into the facility due to the fact they had taken control of the scene. After a short period of time the fire department gave the all clear and allowed plant personnel to enter into the facility. The service person from Dual Temp and Larry Wilson from On-Cor proceeded to investigate the leak and find the root cause..\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps:\nThe On-Cor Frozen Foods, located at 1227 W.
