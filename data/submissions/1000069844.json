      "SummaryText": "Brenntag Southwest has a warehouse located in Manor, TX where chlorine in 150 lb. and 2,000 lb. containers.  The Manor site does not use or process chlorine, but only warehouses the material.\r\n\r\nFull containers are received from suppliers and stored until needed by customers.  When full containers are dropped off with customers, empties are picked up and returned to the Manor site.  Empty containers are returned to the chlorine company when they deliver full containers.\r\n\r\nThe Manor facility follows regulations established by DOT, DHS (Department of Homeland Security), OSHA and EPA that govern the safe handling, storage, and transportation of chlorine containers.  The facility is subject to the requirements of the EPA RMP program, but is exempt from the requirements of the OSHA PSM program due to its status as a retail facility.\r\n\r\nThe Manor facility has established operating procedures and maintenance programs and has performed hazard reviews according to both the RMP rules and industry-standard practices; specifically the practices noted in Chlorine Institute pamphlets 1, 91 and other publications.  These help Brenntag Southwest minimize the likelihood of releases.\r\n\r\nBrenntag Southwest has developed an emergency response plan that details the steps that the Manor facility will take in the event of a chemical release, including the roles of internal and external responders.  Brenntag Southwest also has developed methods for identifying small releases before they become problematic, including daily inspections of all stored chlorine containers and ambient chlorine monitoring systems. The monitoring system sensors are set to identify chlorine gas in a concentration of 1 ppm (part per million). At that level, the sensors would trigger an audible alarm on site and automatically dial the cell phone of the site's Operations Manager.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe facility has been in operation since May 2008 and has not had any releases of chlorine in the past."
