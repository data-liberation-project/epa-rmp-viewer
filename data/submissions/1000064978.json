EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\r\n\r\n1.1 STATIONARY SOURCE DESCRIPTION\r\nThe Cape Cod Ice East Providence facility utilizes anhydrous ammonia refrigeration to manufacture ice that is distributed throughout Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, and parts of New Hampshire.  The facility also stores cranberries during the winter months.\r\n \r\nCape Cod Ice's facility is located at 1 Noyes Avenue, East Providence, Rhode Island (East Providence facility). The refrigeration system is located throughout the warehouse building of the East Providence facility with the piping located on the roof.\r\n\r\n1.2 ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\r\nCape Cod Ice relies on written procedures and training to minimize accidental releases.  Every employee must complete awareness training and operating and maintenance training for their particular duties and responsibilities prior to working on any assignment. If any processes change, employees are retrained in the new process before working on an assignment.\r\n\r\nContractors are required to be properly trained in the safety programs before doing any work at\r\nthe facility.\r\n\r\nAll employees who operate, service, or maintain the ammonia refrigeration systems are trained to understand the safety and health hazards of the refrigerant and the refrigeration system at the facility. This knowledge is necessary for the protection of the individual, the other employees, and the community. All involved employees are trained in the following general topics:\r\n\r\nUnderstanding how to read SDS forms,\r\nKnowing and understanding first aid for ammonia exposure,\r\nLocation and use of emergency equipment (eyewash, showers, and PPE),\r\nRoutine refrigeration system operation,\r\nEmergency refrigeration system operation,\r\nEmergency and normal refrigeration safety procedures, and\r\nIndividual's role in the emergency response plan.\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Policy\r\n\r\nIn the event of an emergency, Cape Cod Ice personnel are expected to cooperate with fellow employe"

Cape Cod Ice employees are\r\ntrained in emergency response for defensive measures only and rely on outside agencies to provide support\r\nin responding to an emergency. Outside support is required for both fire response and response to an ammonia\r\nrelease.\r\n\r\nIf an emergency situation develops at the facility:\r\n\r\nImmediately report the problem to your supervisor, either by word of mouth or by phone. The supervisor is\r\nresponsible for contacting the Primary Emergency Response Coordinator. If a supervisor is not available or if\r\nthe situation requires immediate and obvious action, pull the Fire Alarm. Then contact the Primary\r\nEmergency Response Coordinator Bill Wooten immediately (401-330-6829). \r\n\r\nIf you are able to report the problem to your supervisor, then your supervisor will contact the Primary\r\nEmergency Response Coordinator immediately (401-330-6829).\r\n\r\nThe Primary Emergency Response Coordinator will notify the E.

The threshold limit for anhydrous ammonia is 10,000 lbs. Currently, the facility contains in its system an estimated 20,550 lbs. of anhydrous ammonia.\r\n\r\n1.4 ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION STEPS\r\nThe EPA's RMP prevention program includes the requirements of the OSHA PSM standards. Cape Cod Ice\r\ncurrently has a Process Safety Management (PSM) program in place at the facility. The objective\r\nof the PSM program is to prevent accidental chemical releases and minimize their impact if they do occur.\r\nThe focuses of the RMP and the PSM programs are to protect the employees and surrounding public. The\r\nEPA requires twelve (12) of the fourteen (14) elements of the PSM to be included in the RMP. The\r\nfollowing twelve (12) elements are incorporated into the prevention programs for Cape Cod Ice:\r\n\r\no Process Safety Information\r\no Process Hazard Analysis (PHA)\r\no Operating Procedures\r\no Training\r\no Mechanical Integrity\r\no Management of Change\r\no Pre-Startup Review\r\no Compliance Audits\r\no Incident Investigation\r\no Employee Participation\r\no Hot Work Permit\r\no Contractors\r\n\r\n1.5 FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENTAL HISTORY\r\nWhen an RMP is first submitted to the EPA, it must contain five-years of accident history. The five-year\r\nhistory involves reporting any significant accidental releases of one or more of the regulated substances from\r\na covered process. All accident history reports for Cape Cod Ice are located in Appendix E-1 of the RMP.\r\n\r\n1.6 EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\r\nIt is the policy of the Cape Cod Ice facility management to implement the requirements of the\r\nEmergency Action Plan by managing and operating the facility in accordance with applicable\r\nregulations and general good operating practices. The objective is to minimize the risk of a fire, or an\r\naccidental hazardous material release, including anhydrous ammonia.  Cape"

Therefore, Cape Cod Ice is a non-responding facility and has\r\ndeveloped an Emergency Action Plan to ensure employees safety as required by the RMP regulation.\r\n\r\n1.7 IMPROVEMENTS TO SAFETY\r\n\r\nCape Cod Ice has made the following improvements to safety:\r\n\r\nInstalled an emergency ventilation system at the facility engine room.\r\n\r\nInstalled emergency shutdown switches for the refrigeration systems that are either located outside the building at the rear of the ammonia engine room.\r\n\r\nInstalled windsocks that are visible to emergency responders and evacuating personnel in the event of a\r\nrelease at the facility.\r\n\r\nLabeled all ammonia piping and valve systems properly at the facility.\r\n\r\nCurrently Cape Cod Ice is evaluating all roof top ammonia piping and insulation for repair or replacement as necessary."
