This Executive Summary includes a description of the facility's accidental release prevention and safety policies, a facility and process description, a five-year accident history, and details of the facility's accidental release prevention program.\n\n\n\n2.0  Accidental Release Prevention Policies\n\n\n\nThe City of Starkville takes great care to ensure the safety of its employees and the surrounding community. Safety programs and policies are stressed in all aspects of facility operations.\n\n\n\nThe City of Starkville's safety program provides rules and guidance for the safe operation, maintenance, and construction of the treatment facility. The safety program includes the required personal protective equipment and safe work practices including lockout and tagout, hot work permitting, confined space entry, and hazardous chemical handling. \n\n\n\n3.0  Facility and Process Description\n\n\n\nThe Starkville Wastewater Treatment Facility treats domestic and industrial wastewater for the City of Starkville.\n\n\n\n4.0  Regulated Substances Present\n\n\n\nChlorine is the only substance used at the facility that is subject to the Risk Management Program regulations. \n\n\n\n5.0  Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\n\n\nThe facility's accident prevention program includes each of the elements required by the Risk Management Program regulations. \n\n\n\n5.1 Process Safety Information\n\n\n\nThe City of Starkville has gathered the necessary documentation of safety information on the covered process including the maximum/minimum pressure, temperature, and inventory in covered tanks, the tank and piping materials of construction, documentatio"

This information is periodically reviewed to ensure that the process is constructed according to good engineering practices.\n\n\n\n5.2  Process Hazard Review\n\n\n\nA Process Hazard Review has been conducted on the covered processes to determine the potential hazards of the process and to determine the possible equipment failures or human errors that could lead to a release. The results of the review were used to determine the appropriate safeguards needed to prevent failures or errors that could lead to a release.\n\n\n\n5.3  Operating Procedures\n\n\n\nWritten operating procedures have been developed for operations. The purpose of the written operating procedures is to make sure that each employee before operating a process is knowledgeable of the correct operating methods, is aware of the chemical hazards present, and is qualified to respond correctly in an emergency situation.\n\n\n\n5.4  Training\n\n\n\nNew employees are trained in the safe operation of plant processes and their performance is periodically evaluated. As needed, refresher training is provided. Employees are given safety training and are trained in the emergency response procedures discussed in Section 7.0.\n\n\n\n5.5  Maintenance\n\n\n\nWritten maintenance procedures and training guide the safe work practices of maintenance employees and ensure that they are made aware of the potential hazards of the plant processes. A hot work permitting program, lockout tagout procedures, and confined space entry procedures have been put in place to protect maintenance workers while servicing equipment. Preventive maintenance inspections and testing are schedule based on manufacturers recommendations so that aging equipment can be replaced before failing and possibly causing an accidental release.\n\n\n\n6.0  Five Year Accident History\n\n\n\nNo serious accidents have occurred at the facility in the last five years.\n\n\n\n7.0  Emergency Respons"

The facility has developed an emergency plan for responding to small releases and for contacting emergency responders in the event of a large release.\n\n\n\n8.0  Planned Future Safety Enhancements\n\n\n\nPlanned safety enhancements include the continued development of the facility's preventive maintenance program and ongoing safety training and new employee orientation. Together, these programs will continue to ensure the safety of employees and the community."
