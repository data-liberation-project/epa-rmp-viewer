Facility Policy.\n\n\n\n        The owners, management, and employees of Trotter Fertilizer are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department,Howard County LEPC,  and other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to persons and the environment.\n\n  \n\n2.Facility Information. \n\n\n\n     The primary activity at the facility is the storage of fertilizers for sale to farmers. Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application as a nutrient for crop production. The maximum quantity stored would be 225,000 pounds in a storage tank and nurse tanks. \n\n\n\n3.The worst-case release and alternative release scenarios.\n\n\n\n     a.The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of the storage tank released as gas over a 10 minute period.The distance to the endpoint would be 4.4 miles.The maximum quantity  released would be 133,000 volume of the largest storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards and administrative controls.\n\n \n\n     b.The alternative release scenario: a 1-inch transfer hose is used as an alternate release scenario followed by release of ammonia for 2 minutes before an automatic excess flow shudown valve/valves intervenes or remote manual shut-off is closed and stops the flow of ammonia. The maximum quantity released would be 2,900 pounds. The distance to the endpoint(point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is .30 mile.\n\n\n\n4. Accidental Release Prevention Program.\n\n\n\n     The facility is in compliance with the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by The American National Standards Institute, In,. (ANSI), and the standards of the U.S. Occupationa"

The OSHA standard is referenced in this RMP Registration Form, see Section 8.3 (b).\n\n \n\n5. Five-year Accident History. There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the last five years that have caused any deaths, injuries or significant property damage at the facility; nor, to our knowledge, has THERE BEEN ANY ACCIDENTAL RELEASES resulting in off-site deaths,injuries, evacuation, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n\n\n6. Emergency Response Program. \n\n\n\n     The Facility has:\n\n     \n\n     a.  A written action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.38;\n\n \n\n     b. Provided state and local authorities with the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).\n\n\n\n7. Planned Changes to Improve Safety.\n\n\n\n      Safety improvements are an on-going process at this facility. Periodic evaluations are preformed to assess the maintenance and safe conditions of our equipment. There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations at this time.\n\n\n\n8.
