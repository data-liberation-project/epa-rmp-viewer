Some facilities, typically installations storing or handling toxic or flammable gases, have installed computer systems to predict and/or monitor the travel of toxic gas clouds. These systems can be used in a read-time mode to assist in evaluating emergency response options. Where such a system exists, the emergency response plan documentation should include a sufficiently detailed description of the system, its capabilities and use, its inputs and outputs, backup capabilities, etc. Such systems often monitor and record information from meteorological data towers and/or remote gas sensors.

Among the documents that are a necessary part of an emergency response plan are organization charts for both on-site management and external organizations (e.g., surrounding industrial facilities and public emergency response agencies). These charts should he prepared early in the development of a response plan since they: can improve the quality of the planning by highlighting levels of responsibility and authority for participating organizations; and may uncover required functions inadvertently left unassigned or unrecognized. The chart for the on-site organization should show the chain of command from the manager to the lead member of each team on-site and should include the chain of command for any specialist personnel (e.g. security staff, safety engineers, fire department, etc.) involved.

The complete documentation for emergency preparedness must be available before a new facility handles hazardous materials for the first time. This means that plan preparation must begin well ahead of receipt of chemicals and subsequent start-up. Depending on the project schedule, plan preparation could begin as early as during the design phase. The plan should be subsequently updated in a timely manner to reflect significant modifications to the facility, processes, or personnel.\n\nOften, local communities will have an emergency response plan in place (e.g., prepared by the LEPC). If so, coordination with the facility plan must be established. If there is a potential requirement for a higher standard of external emergency response and/or aid than currently exists, the facility organization may need to take a lead role in assisting external organizations in upgrading their plans. Documentation will be a key aspect in defining these needs and supporting this effort.\n\nPlan Review and Authorization. The program documentation should establish procedures for the review, and define authority levels for the approval, of the emergency response plan. While off-site organizations would typically not be involved in the approval of the plan, the issuing organization may find it beneficial to solicit their opinions during the review process.\n\nExercises and Testing. Experience has demonstrated that emergency response does not work satisfactorily unless it is properly planned, documented, and rehearsed.

For example, at large sites, an individual (perhaps a member of the safety and security staff) might be assigned overall responsibility for the preparation of the facility emergency response plan and be assisted by a team assembled from different areas of the facility. During plan preparation, the team leader or his designate would act as liaison with the various off-site groups (e.g., other industrial facilities and public agencies near the facility).  Assistance from knowledgeable personnel at such facilities and agencies ensures the availability of needed information, builds communication channels and trust between mutually dependent parties and, thus, can help ensure cohesion of the program.\n\nSmaller organizations or facilities may require external assistance when developing the plan; however, the responsibility for the plan and its application remains with the facility. The responsible person should ensure that the plan is periodically audited and updated, as required. Considerations that might prompt the need for updating the plan include:\n\n\u2022\tchanges in the nature or magnitude of process hazards;\n\u2022\tsignificant changes in organization (either within the facility or in an external organization) that may affect emergency response capabilities;\n\u2022\tchanges in communication systems (including phone numbers and radio frequencies);\n\u2022\tchanges in external population distributions;\n\u2022\tchanges in regulatory requirements; and\n\u2022\trecommendations made because of an audit, incident, or exercise.\n\n\nPlan Content.

An example is the need to issue an advisory to evacuate or shelter-in\u00ad place. Note that the planning responsibility for off-site emergency response lies principally with those in the public sector. This document does not cover these details but does reference the interfaces between a company and the public authorities necessary to achieve an overall effective response.\n\nFacilities handling hazardous materials may wish to coordinate their emergency response plan with off-site agencies even if the scale of potential incidents is not likely to involve any public areas. Even in some small incidents, the local police and fire departments, as well as other agencies, may be involved, and proper coordination of efforts should be pre-planned. It is important to note, and factor into the organization's emergency response planning, that LEFCs have been created throughout the country to coordinate local responses to emergency situations with statewide disaster response agencies. Coordination with LEPCs should be part of an emergency response plan\nEmergency response has been extensively studied by many organizations. One such source is the Hazardous Materials Emergency Planning Guide, NRT-1, first issued by the National Response Team in March 1987. Many aspects of emergency response are covered by federal, state, or local regulations. Applicable regulatory requirements should be considered when developing an emergency response plan for a facility.\n\n3.

As used here, the term also includes the proactive planning that goes into preparing the response to such events. Thus, the objectives of emergency response planning, documentation, and its application are to adequately prepare for and respond to a wide range of potential emergency situations that may be encountered in operating processes and plants that utilize or produce hazardous or toxic materials. These documented preparations allow the facility to have available, and promptly apply, the right kinds of trained manpower and equipment to reduce the effects of such emergency situations.\n\n2.2.\tPlanning for Emergency Response\n\nThe appropriate time to consider how to handle an incident is before it happens. Sound planning begins with the identification of the hazards present in a process or facility and the evaluation of credible incident scenarios, ranging from minor incidents to realistic worst-case situations. The potential incident scenarios may be evaluated using an appropriate method of process hazard analysis (PHA). Next, it is important to gain a perspective on the potential magnitude of the effects of each incident scenario and, perhaps, an appreciation of its likelihood. It is important not to underestimate potential incidents simply because they have never happened or are considered unlikely. In some cases, (e.g., major explosions, fires, or toxic gas releases) the public may potentially be affected, or the assis"

Whenever hazardous chemicals are handled, some risk of an incident remains, despite well-engineered equipment, detailed operating procedures and highly trained personnel. Should an incident occur, such as an explosion or a release into the environment, its effects may be localized to the immediate vicinity or the effects may extend off-site, depending on the magnitude of the incident. An understanding of possible incident scenarios, their potential effects and, perhaps, their likelihood, serves as the basis for rational emergency response planning.  Proper planning allows the facility to prepare for dealing with both the incident and its effects. These plans may involve dedicated, specialized equipment or facilities, detailed procedures and specialized training of personnel. Clear, thorough documentation is critical to this effort.\n\n1.2.\tGoals and Benefits\n\nThe goals of the emergency response program are:\n\u2022\tto minimize the impacts of an incident (including health effects, costs, legal implications, loss of corporate image, and deterioration of relationships with employees and with the public);\t\n\u2022\tto identify aspects of other programs that affect emergency preparedness, and to address these in a practical way; and\n\u2022\tto participate in a cooperative effort with the public, i.e., the local community, through the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and other appropriate agencies and officials.\n\nA wide range of benefits can result from effectively documenting an emergency response program, especially when it involves the local community and authorities.

Recommendations and corrective action plans are then developed with the intent of preventing such incidents in the future.\n\n2.2.\tConducting Incident Investigations\n\nIncidents cannot be investigated if they are not reported. To ensure reporting, an incident should be viewed as any event that is unusual or out of the ordinary, whether harm resulted from its occurrence. The initial reporting of such events should not be limited to those perceived to be serious or potentially serious incidents, since the seriousness of an event often cannot be determined without analysis. It is important that all incidents be reported so that corrective action can be established before a similar occurrence results in a serious accident.

      "SummaryText": "t.\n\nOrganizations typically investigate incidents to determine their causes and to seek ways of preventing their recurrence. The process of incident investigation generally utilizes a team\u00ad based approach involving: gathering and analyzing the evidence; drawing conclusions as to the causes of the incident; generating corrective or preventive actions; and summarizing, documenting, and disseminating the findings. Proper documentation of incident investigation results provides the basis for corrective actions leading to improvements in the organization's process safety management (PSM) program and, accordingly, should enhance plant safety. This chapter discusses PSM documentation requirements for incident investigation.\n\nA description of many of the available methods of incident investigation techniques and how they can be applied is given in the CCPS book, Guidelines for Investigating Chemical Process Incidents.\n\n1.2.\tGoals and Benefits\n\nThe goal of an incident investigation is to define the facts related to the event, determine the causes, and develop remedial actions to control or eliminate recurrence.

Trading employees temporarily for audits helps foster improved knowledge and, by bringing in impartial observers, helps maintain the objectivity of the evaluation process.\n\nAudit Scope. Within the context of the documentation task, the audit should be focused on verification that a documentation program exists and that it is being followed as described. For example, in auditing Process Hazard Analysis (PHA), the team should first check that the program for implementing PHA defines the documentation requirements for PHA. The team should next check that the records produced when implementing PHA are documented in a manner that complies with the requirements of the program.  It should be remembered that, when auditing PSM documentation, the intent is not to confirm the technical accuracy or the merit of the contents of the documentation. Rather, the intent is to confirm that the documentation practices conform to the established program requirements. Auditing may, however, reveal areas of potential improvement in the implementation of the PSM element itself. Such findings, while beyond the scope of the documentation audit, could be separately documented and forwarded to the responsible parties for consideration. \n\nAudit Frequency.

This audit type is generally more detailed and specific than a PSM systems audit. Process safety audits seek to verify that the actual practices are in accordance with established procedures. Each PSM element may have a specific audit procedure or focus. For large facilities, it may be necessary to divide the documentation system into more manageable parts to ensure comprehensive coverage of the various PSM elements and their documentation. Sampling for verification is an important aspect of performing audits. In addition, efforts should be concentrated on areas subject to change.

Generally, planned or considered changes go through the facility's Management of Change system during normal daytime work hours. However, it should be recognized that some changes may be made when supervisory personnel neither are nor normally present, e.g., at night, weekends or during absences. The MOC system should always provide a means for obtaining approval so that MOC is not circumvented when the usual approval authority is not present on site. This also applies to changes made under emergency conditions. However, in some of these cases, it may not be possible to perform the desired level of review, nor to obtain approval from the appropriate authority, prior to making the change. In such situations, review and approval should be obtained and documented as soon as practical when conditions stabilize.\n\nf.\tHow Are Affected Personnel Notified? The program documentation should require notification of all personnel potentially affected by the change, as well documentation of the fact that this has been accomplished.\n\ng.\tHow Are Changes Authorized and Documented?

Reversed changes should be treated as a second change and should comply with the standard procedures and documentation requirement.\n\nd.\tWho Has Responsibility and Authority for Change? Change is initiated at every level, but it is necessary to control change and to limit the authority for approval of change. The PSM program may encourage requests for change, and there should be a clear procedure for dealing with these requests. The system should not be so cumbersome to use that it discourages safe and viable improvements but must ensure evaluation of the safety aspects of any change.\ni.\tChanges will vary in significance and organizations may find it appropriate to require higher levels of authorization for changes that are potentially more significant. Thus, it would be appropriate in describing the different levels of change to link these to the authority required for each. A tabular presentation of this authorization list may be helpful.

Change begins in the earliest phases of a project as, for example, in the evaluation of design alternatives. After start\u00ad up, changes are often made to improve the process. Additionally, unintentional changes can occur (e.g., a supplier might alter a raw material composition without notice).\n\nii.\tSuch changes continue throughout the life of the facility and, as experience has shown, even a small or apparently minor change can have a significant impact on process safety. When making changes, some people may only consider the direct objective of what they want to achieve and may overlook whether the change potentially has some undesired effect on other aspects of the design or operation. Safety reviews, such as Process Hazard Analysis (PHA), and audits can detect these effects. However, since these reviews are usually conducted intermittently, an incident might occur before the hazard could be identified in such a periodic review.

Through adequate attention to these areas and recognition of their interdependence, premature failures, which could result in accidental releases or other incidents, may be reduced in frequency and severity.\nb.\tThe integrity of equipment begins with an accurate, comprehensive, written definition of design, operating, and maintenance parameters. This information is utilized throughout the life cycle of the equipment by plant designers, equipment manufacturers and plant personnel. This documentation satisfies several technical and operational needs and helps fulfill applicable requirements of federal, state, and local regulatory agencies.\n\n2.\tGoals and Benefits\n\na.\tThe goals of the Process Equipment Integrity element are to ensure that process equipment will perform as expected and that adequate documentation exists to support its operation, maintenance, or modification in a reliable, safe manner.

Record management systems should be tailored to the individual needs of the facility. Systems can range from a completely manual, paper-based system with file cabinets and manual indexing to a part-less system where all information is entered and all documents are scanned into a computer. Some combination of these two approaches, addressing the operational and economic needs of the facility, can be effective for many users. System choices can be based on various performance requirements, such as speed of retrieval, indexing or search capabilities, or the data storage capacity required. Whether a computer-based system, a manual system, or some combination is used, the system chosen needs to address the potentially conflicting goals of providing information security while, at the same time, providing for ease of dissemination of information to authorized users.\n\n5.\tOSHA DEFINITIONS\n\n\u2022\tOSHA PSM definition of process: any activity involving a highly hazardous chemical including any use, storage, manufacturing, handling, or the onsite movement of such chemicals, or combination of these activities. For purposes of this definition, any group of vessels that are interconnected and separate vessels that are located such that a highly hazardous chemical could be involved in a potential release shall be considered a single process.\n\n\u2022\tInterconnected means hard piping or flexible hoses. Valves do not constitute isolation of connectivity, but blinds or spool pieces do disconnect inventories of high hazardous chemicals. Al"

As was previously pointed out, it is the communication of PSM information between elements that maximizes the effectiveness of the overall PSM program. Sound records management practices help ensure the effectiveness of these communications. Further, by coordinating record keeping for all PSM elements, organizations can minimize the costs of implementation and have a sound basis for future management decisions and actions. In addition to the process safety benefits, there are many side benefits of a comprehensive PSM records system, such as improved operating efficiency, which can lead to enhanced profits.\n\n4.1. 2. Goals and Benefits\n\nThe goals of records management are to:\n\u2022\tidentify what records should be maintained to ensure availability of the information needed to operate a process facility safely and efficiently;\n\u2022\tcollect, categorize, file, disseminate, and protect critical information;\n\u2022\tprovide easy, convenient means of entering information into the system;\n\u2022\tensure storage in proper locations and formats to permit later access and speedy retrieval;\n\u2022\tprovide safeguards to allow for access by authorized personnel only; and\n\u2022\tprotect records from physical damage, or unauthorized or inadvertent revision.\n\nThe principal benefit intended from sound records management is enhanced effectiveness of the PSM program. However, sound records management can additionally provide direct cost savings and other benefits by reducing the time required to find documents vital for normal operations, maintenance, and in emergency situations. For example, losses due to production downtime can be cut by having vendor information and maintenance records readily available. Maintenance workers can then respond to both scheduled and unscheduled needs quickly and safely based on timely, accurate information.\n\nOther indirect benefits can flow from or be contributed to by the existe"

It is equally important, however, that responsibilities for maintaining the broader policy and interpretative documentation (e.g., policy statements or corporate PSM guidelines) also be clearly established.\n\n3.2 Document Revision and Retention\n\nIt is imperative that PSM documentation remain current (e.g., procedures are updated to reflect current requirements and outdated information is purged from the files). Thus, it is important that PSM documentation be managed in accordance with the overall corporate records revision and retention policy. The policy should specifically address each element of the PSM program, since different elements may require different retention schedules. Accountability and responsibility should be assigned for the maintenance of PSM records for each element.\n\n3.3 Auditing\n\nTo ensure continued effectiveness of accountability and responsibility for PSM as organizations, processes, and technology change, the PSM documentation system should be periodically audited.  External and internal audits of individual accountability for each of the PSM elements will help ensure that the program objectives are met and any identified deficiencies are corrected.  The audit program should address the following issues:\n\n\u2022\tIs there a documented program for establishing PSM responsibility and accountabilities?\n\u2022\tDoes a means exist for updating the program, as required?\n\u2022\tIs the program being followed, as described?\n\u2022\tAre the records from the program implementation being properly managed?\n\n4.\tRECORDS MANAGEMENT\n\n4.1.

When incidents do occur, investigations are conducted, corrective actions are proposed, and modifications are made to prevent further occurrences. The likelihood of success of these and other PSM, efforts is enhanced by, or in some cases is dependent upon, accurate, effective documentation.\n \nIt may not be possible to prevent every incident. Thus, the second goal of PSM is to minimize the hazardous consequences of incidents that do occur. For example, during a process upset, the pressure in a reactor may exceed the design pressure; therefore, relief systems are provided to restrict the pressure to a safe level by discharging a portion of the reactor's contents. However, the hazardous discharge must be directed safely to prevent serious injury or damage resulting from the operation of the protective device. The objectives of each of these stages of protection should be documented via design drawings, operating procedures, maintenance procedures and training requirements. This documentation enables the many people who may be involved with the reactor system (e.g., operations, maintenance, process control, or engineering personnel) to be more fully aware of the operational requirements of the equipment and of their responsibilities. This reduces the likelihood that the protections will be compromised during the operating life of the facility.\n\nThe third goal of PSM is to enhance compliance with industry initiatives such as the Chemical Manufacturers Association (CMA) Responsible Care program or the American Petroleum Institute (API) Recommended Practice (RP) 750, and to satisfy regulatory requirements. Adequate documentation of procedures and audit results enhances the confidence of the public, and of regulatory bodies, that industry is being a good corporate citizen.\n\nAmong the many benefits of good and comprehensive process safety documentation are the following:\n\n\u2022\tan ability to link all elements of the PSM progr"
