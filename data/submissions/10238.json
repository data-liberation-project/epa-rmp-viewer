The largest ammonia \nprocess group (e.g., largest storage tank or group of interconnected \ntanks) has a storage capacity of 60,000 water gallons (280,000 pounds).  \nThe total ammonia stationary storage capacity is 280,000 pounds.  The \nfacility also stores numerous smaller transportable tanks (nurse tanks) \nthat are actually used in the fertilizer application process.  \n\nThe facility also has 48,000 water gallons (176,000 pounds) of propane \nis a single process.  The total propane stationary storage capacity is \n176,000 pounds.\n\nThe facility is required to complete one worst-case release scenario \nper hazardous substance handled [68.165(a)(2)] to determine program \napplicability.  Farmers Co-op has chosen to use the DEGADIS+ release \nmodel and RMP Comp (Version 1.06) to determine offsite impacts.\n\n\nFor this facility, a worst-case release would occur in the event that \nthe largest ammonia and propane storage tanks would rupture and the \nentire contents would be released to the atmosphere in 10 minutes.  The \nworst-case scenario requires a ground-level release height (0 feet).  \nAmmonia release rate for use of DEGADIS+ is presented below:\n\n\nSample Ammonia Endpoint Calculation\n\nGiven:       Storage Tank Capacity is 60,000 water gallons\n             ANSI K61.1 filling density = 56 % (of water wt.)\n\nRelease Rate = Tank Capacity / 10 minutes\n             =(60,000 gal * 8.345 lb/gal water)*(0.56)  / 10 min \n            = (500,700 lb)*(0.56) / 10 min\n            = 280,000 (rounded) / 10 min\n            = 28,000 lb/min \n\nCalculations"

The worst-case model output summary is included at the end \nof this section.

The residential population within a 0.40 mile radius of \nthe facility is 9 (rounded) based on the 1990 US Census data. \n\nThe facility is required to complete one alternate release scenario per \nregulated chemical per 40 CFR Part 68.165(a)(2).  The alternative \nrelease scenario considered is in accordance with the guidelines \nprovided in 40 CFR 68.22 and 68.28.\n\nThe alternative scenarios chosen for this facility involves a release \nbecause of a sudden split in the hose during transfer.  While this \nscenario is still unlikely because the transfer hoses used have \nmultiple layers of rubber and a layer of braided stainless steel wire \nunderneath the outer sheath (to prevent abrasions, cuts, and splits) it \nis more likely than the worst-case as required by 40 CFR 68.28(b)(i).  \nThis scenario is also the\nmost likely to occur, since overfilling is prevented by a return vapor \nline to the tank truck making the delivery.  The transfer hose rupture \narea is assumed at 0.5 square inches.  Because personnel are always \npresent at the facility during transfer, Farmers Co-op personnel will \nrespond within 10 minutes.
