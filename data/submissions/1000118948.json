This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program in place that integrates areas such as design, installation, management practices, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the chlorination process at our facility. The chlorination system at our plant is designed to meet industry standards and is well maintained. Appropriate controls and alarms are also in place to prevent possible releases of chlorine. \n\tIn the event an accidental release does occur, our facility is coordinated with the Lauderdale County Emergency Management Agency (EMA), local fire and police departments, as well as Harcros Chemicals in Muscle Shoals, Alabama. These institutions provide highly trained emergency response personnel to control and mitigate effects of the release.\n\n2.\tOur Facility and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\tOur facility is a publicly owned water treatment plant. Our primary activity is to provide potable water to the City of Florence, AL and Lauderdale County while meeting all Federal and State regulations. The one regulated substance at this plant is Chlorine. Chlorine is used for disinfecting treated water for potable use by the City of Florence and Lauderdale County. The maximum inventory of Chlorine at our facility is 16,000 pounds. \n\n3.\tThe Worst Case Release Scenario and the Alternative Release Scenario\n\n\tTwo possible chlorine release scenarios, one \u0093worst case release\u0094 and one \u0093alternative scenario\u0094 were analyzed in accordance with EPA\u0092s RMP regulations. To perform the required scenario analyses for our facility, we used Area Locations of Hazardous Atmospheres [ALOHA(R)] models and analysis. For the worst case and alternative case release scenarios ALOHA analyses were"

The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\t The worst case scenario, as required by EPA, assumes the maximum quantity of chlorine in the largest vessel is released as a gas over ten minutes due to an unspecified failure. Our largest vessel for chlorine is a ton (2,000 pounds) container. Neither passive nor active mitigation was considered. At class F atmospheric stability, a 1.5 m/s wind speed, and a temperature of 102F, a maximum distance of 3.04 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.0087 mg/L for chlorine. The potentially affected residential population was estimated to be approximately 29,192. Schools, residences, hospitals, prisons, public recreational areas, and major commercial, office, or industrial areas were all public receptors that were found within the radius of the worst case release scenario. One environmental receptor, the Seven Mile Island Wildlife Refuge, was identified in the toxic endpoint area.\n\tThe alternative release scenario assumes the chlorine release is less severe and is more likely to occur than the worst case release scenario. The scenario chosen involves a tubing failure, bad connection, or valve failure resulting in the release of gas through the 5/16 diameter valve body opening at the top of a 1 ton storage container. The total quantity released for chlorine is 317 pounds with an average release rate of 5.3 pounds per minute and a maximum sustained release rate of 10.5 pounds per minute. At class D atmospheric stability, a 3.0 m/s wind speed, and a temperature of 102F, a maximum distance of 0.57 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.0087 mg/L. The potentially affected residential population was estimated at 1,413 people. Public receptors found within the alternative release radius for chlorine were schools, residences, and recreational areas. \n\n4.\tThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps.\n\n\tT"

The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our facility.\n\n\tSafety Information\n\tThe Cypress Creek Water Treatment Plant maintains a record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with the chlorine.\n\n\tHazard Analysis\n\tThe Cypress Creek Water Treatment Plant conducts a comprehensive overview and analysis of our chlorination system to ensure that the associated hazards are identified and controlled efficiently. The methodology used to carry out this analysis is a hazard review checklist specifically designed for water plants. The analyses are performed by qualified personnel and are revalidated at regular intervals. Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\n\tOperating Procedures\n\tFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our process, our facility maintains written operating procedures. These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown, and startup after a change. The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the chlorination process.\n\n\tTraining\n\tOur facility has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating the chlorine process are competent in the operating procedures associated with the process. Refresher training is provided at least every three years in accordance with EPA\u0092s RMP regulations and more frequently as needed.\n\n\t\nMaintenance\n\tOur facility has established routine maintenance checks on the process equipment to ensure proper operations.

In accordance with EPA\u0092s RMP regulations we perform these audits at least every three years. Any corrective actions resulting from these audits are completed in safe and timely manner.\n\n\tIncident Investigation\n\tOur facility promptly investigates any incident which resulted in or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of the regulated substance. These investigations provide valuable information for assessing all possible causes of the incident ranging from human error to equipment failure. In addition, possible corrective actions are identified to prevent the accident from recurring. All reports are retained for a minimum of five years as required by EPA\u0092s RMP regulations.\n\n5.\tFive Year Accident History\n\n\tOur facility takes pride in doing everything possible to prevent accidental releases and has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last five years. Due to our stringent release prevention policies, there has been no accidental release during this period.\n\n6.\tEmergency Response\n\n\tIn the event of an accidental release of chlorine, we at the Cypress Creek Water Treatment Plant have opted not to implement an Emergency Response Program. Instead, in accordance with RMP regulations, we have included our facility in the community emergency response plan and have the appropriate procedures in place to notify emergency responders when there is a need to respond.\n\n7.\tPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\tAs a result of preparing this Risk Management Plan, our facility will take t"
