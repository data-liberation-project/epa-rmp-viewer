It includes required actions by plant employees as well as required notification and coordination with local responders and agencies. All employees are trained in the execution of the Emergency Response Plan and drills are conducted annually.\n\nThe Stationary Source and Regulated substances:\n\nThe Kutz Gas Conditioning Plant processes raw natural gas into pure methane, ethane, butane, propane, and other natural gas liquids. The raw natural gas is received by pipeline. The finished products are delivered to the pipelines.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program:\n\nThe Kutz Gas Conditioning Plant has implemented all the elements of a Program 3 Risk Management Plan (RMP) and all the elements of OSHA?s Process Safety Management (PSM) program.

The program consists of procedures for responding to releases of regulated substances, including the possibility of associated fires or explosions. The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including evacuation plans, accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, if a release occurs.  Employees receive training in these procedures annually to perform emergency response duties.  The program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to the gas plant processes.  Emergency response program changes are administered through the MOC process. The overall emergency response program for Kutz Gas Conditioning Plant is coordinated with San Juan Count Emergency Management.
