The Risk Management Program identifies the equipment, procedures, maintenance, inspection, and training associated with Regulated Substances (RS's) handled at this facility in excess of Federal threshold quantities; describes the structured assessment of hazards which was conducted to assess possible effects on employees and offsite public and environmental receptors; provides the results of an offsite consequences analysis; defines a prevention program, emergency response program, and mitigation measures to reduce the probability and magnitude of accidental releases of RS's; and establishes a schedule and responsibilities for implementation of mitigation measures and auditing of program elements.  This Risk Management Plan (RMP) is being filed with the USEPA as required by ARP regulations in order to report the elements of the current Risk Management Program and to describe further measures planned to mitigate or prevent accidental releases of RS's.  In addition, a revised RMP is being filed with the cognizant Administering Agency, Fremont Fire Department Hazardous Materials Program, as required by California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program regulations at 19 CCR Sections 2735 - 2795.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nGlacier Ice Co.'s Fremont Ice Packaging Facility is located at 43960 Fremont Blvd., Fremont, CA in Alameda County, and uses anhydrous ammonia, an RS, to charge the refrigeration system.  An RMP was filed with Fremont Fire Department in February 2000 in accordance with CalARP regulations covering the ammonia refrigeration system containing a quantity of anhydrous ammonia in excess of the California threshold quantity but less than the Federal threshold quantity.  Due to a system expansion, additional ammonia is required in th"

The plant is normally manned on the day shift Monday through Friday, and a telephone dialer system alerts a security company to alarm conditions when the plant is not manned.  \n\nBulk anhydrous ammonia is received by truck and charged into the high pressure receiver under pressure.  The ammonia refrigeration system serves the ice makers, a water chiller, and evaporators for room air cooling.  The system is totally self-contained, and the only losses of ammonia are minor in nature, from periodic oil draining operations, minor valve packing leaks, and the like.  Every few years, additional ammonia is added to the system to replace losses.\n\nThe refrigeration process operates generally as follows.  Compressors raise the pressure and temperature of ammonia vapor to hot gas condition, approximately 165 psig and 120 deg. F.  The vapor is condensed to liquid in evaporative condensers located outside the building, transferring heat to circulating water which evaporates.  Fans operate as necessary to increase the rate of water evaporation.  The condensed liquid ammonia drains into the high pressure receiver, and the pressurized liquid enters the flash subcooler.  In the flash subcooler, the high pressure liquid is reduced in temperature from approximately 90 deg. F to approximately 30 deg. F, and reduced in pressure from 165 psig to approximately 45 psig.  The subcooled liquid enters two recirculation accumulator vessels where its temperature and pressure are further reduced.  Liquid ammonia pumps force the cold liquid ammonia through the ice maker heat exchanger plates and the evaporator coils, and as the ammonia picks up heat it partially boils and two-phase flow returns to the respective recirculation accumulators.  Suction piping carries ammonia vapor from each of the two recirculation accumulators and"

The partially condensed gas is returned to the recirculation accumulators with the two-phase pumped liquid return flow.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nIt is the policy of Glacier Ice Co. that the receipt and handling of anhydrous ammonia at its facility be done in a manner which meets regulatory requirements and minimizes the probability and severity of accidental releases to the atmosphere, in order to protect the health and safety of its workers, the public, and the environment.  In order to accomplish this goal, Glacier Ice Co. has gathered safety information on anhydrous ammonia and on the process, equipment and procedures involving anhydrous ammonia; performed a structured assessment of hazards of the process and external events which might affect the process; performed an offsite consequences analysis of defined release scenarios; established a written program for prevention and mitigation of accidental releases; and established a written emergency response program coordinated with emergency response agencies.\n\nWORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\nA single \"worst case\" release scenario is required to be considered for each stationary source, resulting in the maximum distance to an endpoint for all toxic RS's contained on site above the threshold quantity.\nThe worst case release scenario for toxic chemicals is defined in the ARP regulations as the release of the contents of the largest single container of RS (in this case anhydrous ammonia) over a period of 10 minutes. The scenario considered the release of the entire charge of anhydrous ammonia in the system as a liquid under pressure, in this case 14,200 lb.  This release scenario is not physically possible, due to the characteristics of anhydrous ammonia.  The air dispersion mo"

The \"alternative case\" considered for this facility is the release of liquid anhydrous ammonia from an oil collection vessel due to an operator error during oil draining, with the release secured by the operator closing the oil drain valve after 1 minute.  The air dispersion modeling resulted in a toxic endpoint located beyond the plant's property line.\n\nADMINISTRATIVE CONTROLS\n\nAdministrative controls in effect at Glacier Ice Co. which were considered to mitigate the severity of the Worst Case and Alternative Case release scenarios include Glacier Ice Co.'s written policies and procedures for training of operators and maintenance personnel, written procedures for control of the inventory of anhydrous ammonia at the facility, and policies regarding quality level of replacement materials and components for the system.\n\nMITIGATION MEASURES\n\nNo mitigation measures were considered to limit the severity of the Worst Case scenario.  No passive mitigation measures were considered to limit the severity of the Alternative Case scenario.  Active mitigation was considered for the Alternative Case, in the form of the timely response of properly trained and equipped personnel following established emergency response procedures.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAMS\n\nGeneral accidental release prevention programs instituted by Glacier Ice Co. are categorized as administrative (manag"

This constitutes the general accidental release prevention program for operations at this facility. The program and document management procedures included in the PSM Program will be used as the management system for the Risk Management Program.\n\nCHEMICAL-SPECIFIC RELEASE PREVENTION STEPS\n\nRelease prevention steps specific to anhydrous ammonia have been identified and have been implemented.  These include, among other things, installation of an additional ammonia leak sensor in the receiver and condenser area, and installing battery backup power for the leak detection system.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere have been no accidents involving anhydrous ammonia at this facility within the past five years resulting in injuries or offsite consequences.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nGlacier Ice Co.'s Emergency Response Program applicable to anhydrous ammonia has been coordinated with the City of Fremont Fire Department.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nAll of the improvements and mitigation measures identified in the process hazard analysis which Glacier Ice Co. committed to accomplish have been completed or are in progress.  Any other measures identified by employees during workplace hazard surveys, or as a result of audit activities, will be thoroughly reviewed and considered for implementation."
