Exel Logistics operates a warehouse facility with hazardous substances that are covered under 112(r). \n\nRegulatory Compliance Services, Inc. (\"RCS, Inc.\") has been retained by Exel Logistics to investigate this facility's need to implement a Risk Management Plan. RCS, Inc. reviewed Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) for all the products stored at Exel Logistics. After the product review, eighteen (18) products stored at the facility contained constituents that were listed under RMP. \n\nThe second stage in completing this plan was to investigate the storage history for each constituent. After review of the inventories, two products, cyclohexylamine and vinyl ethyl ether, exceeded thresholds outlined by the EPA. This plan was created to reflect these two substances.\n\nThe RMP requirements were designed to facilitate communication to responders and the public in the event of a catastrophic release of the listed substances. These requirements also insure the continuing improvement and safety of each identified process. Major facilities needing to comply with 112(r) may be defined as; a facility that is used to store large volumes of highly hazardous substances for use in manufacturing, treatment processes or bulk storage. Some of the requirements are not applicable to a closed container non-bulk facility. All items that are not applicable are provided with an explanation in the attachments to this plan.\n\nThe RMP has three different models to follow when completing a plan. The models are based on types of products, processes, quantities, etc. This plan meets the requirement of Program 3.\n\nProgram 3 is required if the facility is covered by Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (\"OSHA\") Process Safety Management (\"PSM\")"

      "SummaryText": ", 29 CFR 1910.119. Exel Logistics does not exceed thresholds of highly hazardous chemicals listed in 1910.119, and does store listed chemicals in this warehouse. Inventories may fluctuate to above and below threshold levels so a PSM is warranted.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1)    The accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at the stationary source.\n\nExel Logistics operates a private, contract warehouse for BASF Corporation. The facility is located in a semi-rural area in Northeast New Jersey, 175 Raritan Center Parkway, Edison, New Jersey. Product stored in the warehouse exceeds threshold requirements outlined in the Code of Federal Regulations (\"CFR\") Title 40, Part 68. In fully demonstrating compliance with the standards set forth in Section 112(r) of the 1990 Clean Air Act, Exel Logistics is implementing a Risk Management Program through this Risk Management Plan.\n\nThe facility is a closed-container distribution facility for appropriately marked, labeled, and packaged non-bulk products. Some products contain substances that are considered extremely hazardous by the Environmental Protection Agency (\"EPA\"). These products are stored within specially designed and designated areas of the warehouse. These designated areas have been designed to store certain products, following guidelines established by Building Officials Code Association (\"BOCA\") 1996 Guidelines, and National Fire Protection Association (\"NFPA\") Guidelines.\n\nExel Logistics is dedicated to providing a safe, publicly aware, environmentally friendly solution to logistics management. All procedures at the facility have been written to ensure employee and public safety. Procedures are continuously scrutinized and revised based on employee suggestion and management review.\n\nEmployee discovery of a release of a hazardous substance would result in implementation of the emergency response procedures developed at Exel Logistics. The first step for an employee would be to immediately notify his or her supervisor. "

      "SummaryText": "The supervisor will immediately contact the Primary Emergency Coordinator. Upon notification of a release, the Primary Coordinator will immediately contact the local fire department, the police department, the BASF Hotline, the Community Emergency Planning Committee, the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (\"NJDEP\") Emergency Hotline, and the outside response contractor. \n\nEvacuation of the facility due to a release will occur whenever directed by an alarm signal, direction from facility management or by the local response officials. The emergency coordinator will direct all incoming vehicles to the facility, for normal operations of the facility, including but not limited to shipping and receiving, away from the facility. Those vehicles will avoid roads used for emergency vehicles and the entrance to the facility to wait for further direction.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2)    The stationary source and regulated substances handled.\n\nExel Logistics is a closed container warehouse for BASF Corporation product. The facility does not manufacture, package, transfer, or otherwise deal with raw product. Therefore, the facility only has one process that deals with hazardous substances regulated by the Risk Management Program.\n\nThe process includes the entrance of trucks containing containerized product, unloading the trailers using motorized forklifts, storage of the product in designated areas within the warehouse, loading the trailers with motorized forklifts, and the exit of the trucks from the property.\n\nThe products that are stored at this facility are varied in concentrations, physical states, and constituents. Only a small amount of the products in the warehouse contain regulated hazardous substances.\n\nDue to the constant change in inventory driven by the industry demand for BASF product, Exel Logistics does not have a steady amount of regulated substances in the warehouse.

The quantity of cyclohexylamine is 392.92 pounds and the quantity of vinyl ethyl ether is 341.71 pounds.\n\n\n3)    Worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario, including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario.\n\nCyclohexylamine is governed under the toxic substance category in the RMP. The worst case scenario would be a comprehensive incident, an \"act of God\" that is not controlled by Exel Logistics. In this worst case scenario, the only mitigating measures would be the internal containment of the building. Each room has a containment of 37,000 gallons, with an overflow capacity of 150,000 gallons within the building. If the product vaporized and could escape the confines of the building structure, under worst case weather conditions it would travel 0.47 miles before dispersing enough to no longer pose a hazard to the public. The endpoint distance was calculated using the EPA's Offsite Consequence Analysis (OCA) guidance.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for toxic substances would be a comprehensive incident, an \"act of God' that is not controlled by Exel Logistics. This may cause for destruction of one sea freight container, holding eighty 55-gallon drums. In this alternative release scenario, no mitigating measures are present to contain the release.
