Starting April 1, 2019 Dow AgroSciences, LLC Midland Operations will own and operate Building 1, 489, 680, 827, 858, 941 and 1028, along with only operating 954. There is another change expected later this year related to the ownership of the 954 assets and Dow AgroSciences, LLC Michigan Operations will submit their updated RMP plan at that time.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nDow AgroSciences, LLC Midland Operations is strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by a comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at the facility.  Appropriate controls are implemented to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  If a release were to occur, highly trained emergency response personnel are on hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  The facility also coordinates with the City of Midland Fire Department and Midland LEPC which can provide additional emergency response expertise.\n\n\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nDow AgroSciences, LLC Midland Operations primary activity is chemical manufacturing, including agricultural and specialty chemicals.

Both of these scenarios were chosen since they impacted the largest population. There are nine (9) total alternate cases, one of which is a flammable case.  Most of the toxic alternate cases were reported due to that being the only alternate case for that chemical.  No alternate cases for chlorine impacted a population, so the scenario reported for chlorine was the only alternate case that reached outside the fence line and would be the first scenario to reach a population based on historical prevailing winds coming out of the west in Midland, Michigan. EPA RMP*Comp and MARPLOT were used to evaluate the worst and alternate case scenarios. \n\n\n\nThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\n\n\nDow AgroSciences, LLC Midland Operations has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.
