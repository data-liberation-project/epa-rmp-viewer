Accidental Release Prevention and Response Policies\r\nWhiting Oil and Gas Corporation's (Whiting) Highland Central Processing Facility is making a commitment to worker and public safety, and to the environment.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of the plant. Whiting's policy is to implement reasonable measures to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. \r\n\r\nII. Description of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\r\nThe Highland Central Processing Facility, located in Highland, Oakland County, Michigan, operates as an unmanned facility with processes to remove liquids from natural gas. The plant has a single regulated flammable mixture, which contains methane, ethane, butane, propane, and pentane. The plant does not have any regulated toxic substances.  The Highland Central Processing Facility is a Program 2 Level facility.\r\n\r\nIII.  General Accident Release Prevention Program & Chemical \u00bfSpecific Prevention Steps\r\nBecause the Highland Central Processing Facility is subject to the USEPA's Risk Management Program (RMP) for Chemical Accident Prevention (40 CFR Part 68) for a Program 2 facility, this summary addresses the RMP elements and describes the management system in place to implement the prevention program.\r\n-  Safety Information: The Highland Central Processing Facility  keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to ensure safe operation of the processes. These documents address hazards of the highly hazardous chemicals at the plant, process technology, and process equipment.\r\n- Hazard Review: Within this program, the process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\r\n- Operating Procedures:  The Highland Central Processing Facility recently their operating procedures on June 14, 2012.

      "SummaryText": "Processing Facility uses skilled personnel that have appropriate training to assure the work they are doing is completed correctly and in a manner that safeguards the property and safety of the company, personnel and the general public.\r\n- Training: To complement the written procedures for process operations, the Highland Central Processing Facility has implemented and is currently updating a comprehensive and effective training program for all employees involved in operating a process. The program is intended to help employees understand the nature and problems arising from process operations, and increase employee awareness with respect to the hazards particular to a process. \r\n- Maintenance:   The Highland Central Processing Facility recently updated their maintenance procedures on June 5 2012.\r\n-Compliance Audits:  A compliance audit of the Highland Central Processing Facility was conducted on March 13, 2012.  The facility reviewed and resolving findings from this audit by June 15, 2012.\r\n-Incident Investigation:  The Highland Central Processing Facility has an Incident Investigation procedure in place, in the event it will need to be used.  \r\n\r\nThe processes at the Highland Central Processing Facility have hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation. The Highland Central Processing Facility has safety features in many areas to quickly detect a release, and reduce the consequences of (mitigate) a release. The  Highland Central Processing Facility uses release detection systems such as flame detectors, and release mitigation measures such as dikes to contain liquid releases.\r\n\r\nIV. Five-year Accident History\r\nThe Highland Central Processing Facility has an excellent record of accident prevention over the past five years. There have been no accidental releases of regulated substances in the past five years.\r\n\r\nV. Emergency Response Information\r\nThe Highland Central Processing Facility is not required to have an emergency response program becau"

Also the facility has coordinated arrangements with the Highland Township Fire Department and Emergency Medical Services to respond to releases. However, the facility has developed and implemented a written emergency action plan to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment. The plan consists of elements such as: communication procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance; response to a fire or explosion, severe weather response, environmental spill response, or pipe line failure.  The emergency response program is updated when necessary based on factors such as modification made to the plant process or operating procedures, or change in the communication procedures. \r\n\r\nVI. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\r\nAll findings from a March 2012 Hazard Review were reviewed and resolved by March 13, 2012.  All findings from a March 2012 Compliance Audit were addressed by June 15, 2012.  The Highland Central Processing Facility will continue to conduct hazard reviews, safety audits, and incident investigations as applicable to continuously improve the worker and public safety."
