Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\nWe at Dupont Pennsauken Plant are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.\r\nThis commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers\r\nareas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with\r\nthe processes at our facility. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of\r\nregulated substances.\r\n\r\n2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\r\nOur facility's primary activities encompass manufacturing rigid polyurethane foam board insulation. A blowing agent is required to manufacture the foam board insulation.  The blowing agent used (80% CYCLO / 20% ISOPENTANE BLEND) is regulated material.\r\n    \r\n3. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements\r\nset out under 40 CFR Part 68 of the Environmental Protection Agency. Additionally, the facility was designed\r\nand constructed in accordance with NFPA-58 Standard, 1998 Edition. The following sections briefly describe\r\nthe elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\nDupont Pennsauken Plant maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical\r\nhazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis\r\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are\r\nidentified and controlled. The checklist technique is used to complete these analyses. The studies\r\nare undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and\r\nare revalidated at a regular intervals me"

These procedures address various modes of operation such as\r\ninitial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations,\r\nnormal shutdown and startup after a turnaround. The information is regularly reviewed and is readily\r\naccessible to operators involved in the processes.\r\n\r\nTraining\r\nDuPont Pennsauken Plant has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who\r\nare operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.\r\nRefresher training is provided at least every year and more frequently as needed.\r\n\r\nMechanical Integrity\r\nDuPont Pennsauken Plant carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to\r\nensure proper operations. Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure\r\nvessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and\r\npumps. Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in\r\nmaintenance practices. Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed. Any\r\nequipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\r\n\r\nManagement of Change\r\nWritten procedures are in place at the DuPont Pennsauken Plant to manage changes in process chemicals,\r\ntechnology, equipment and procedures.  Process operators, maintenance personnel or any\r\nother employee whose job tasks are affected by modifications in process conditions will be promptly notified\r\nof the modification and will be offered the appropriate training.\r\n\r\nPre-startup Reviews\r\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new p"

A safety review will be conducted\r\nprior to start-up. The review will be constructed to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\r\n\r\nCompliance Audits\r\nThe Dupont Pennsauken Plant conducts audits on an annual basis to determine whether the provisions set\r\nout under the RMP rule are being implemented.  Any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\r\n\r\nIncident Investigation\r\nThe DuPont Pennsauken Plant promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably\r\nresult in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance. These investigations are undertaken to identify the\r\nsituation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring. All\r\nreports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\r\n\r\nEmployee Participation\r\nThe DuPont Pennsauken Plant truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention\r\nis a team effort. Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident\r\nprevention issues and to recommend improvements. In addition, our employees have access to all\r\ninformation created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP rule, including information resulting\r\nfrom process hazard analyses in particular.\r\n\r\nContractors\r\nOn occasion, our company hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities.\r\nPrior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is carried out.\r\nThe Dupont Pennsauken Plant has a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential\r\nhazards related the contractor's work and the processes.
