      "SummaryText": "Pacific NW Packers, Inc operates a berry freezing, storage and shipping facility located in Whatcom County, outside the city of Lynden, in WA State.  The facility was built in 2012.  Berries are received from the fields and immediately frozen, then shipped.  The freezing and refrigeration uses Anhydrous Ammonia as the refrigerant.  \r\n\r\nAmmonia is a colorless gas with a pungent odor that is irritating to the eyes, nose and throat.  It is present in the system as both a liquid under pressure and as a vapor.  The system has operated with approximately 6,000 lbs of ammonia, which is below the toxic threshold established by EPA. There have been no incidents to date. The facility has undergone an upgrade to increase the productivity of the system, which required additional ammonia be added. There is now approximately 15,000 lbs of ammonia on-site, in a closed circuit system.\r\n\r\nThis first time reporting is due to the increase of ammonia over the 10,000 lb threshold.  A refrigeration operator checks the entire system every day and continuous monitoring and alarming is done by the facility computer control system 24 hrs/day. Anhydrous Ammonia is considered a highly toxic chemical regulated by both EPA and OSHA.  \r\n    \r\nTo maintain a safe facility operation, Pacific NW Packers has developed an emergency action plan that provides instructions to all employees of actions to take if an ammonia leak is detected. The plan is coordinated with the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) of Whatcom County.  Since employees are not trained or equipped for HAZMAT responding, the emergency action plan instructs all employees to evacuate the facility and allow Whatcom County Fire Department personnel to take control of the incident upon arrival.\r\n\r\nAll construction and  maintenance has been done and documented per regulations.  The facility complies with both State and Federal regulations regarding the use of ammonia by establishing their Process Safety Management program (PSM 29 CFR"

Both plans are available to on-site personnel to help maintain a safe operating facility.\r\n\r\nAs required by the RMP an Off-site Consequence Analysis has been performed to determine the impact to the surrounding population in case of a Worst Case or Alternative Case release.  The facility is remote with very few homes in the general area.  Surrounding the facility for miles in all directions are berry farms and row crops."
