      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nWestvaco is a world-class producer of a wide range of innovative products and services.  A forest products company with offices and operations around the world, Westvaco's distinctive products manufactured for customers around the globe include paper, packaging, envelopes and specialty chemicals.\n\nWestvaco's presence in Virginia began in 1899 when the company launched operation of its papermaking facility in Alleghany County.  Since then, Westvaco has invested extensively in its Alleghany Highlands operations.  Today, nearly 2,000 men and women work at Westvaco's Alleghany Highlands manufacturing and research operations.\n\nA commitment to excellence in all aspects of its operations defines Westvaco.  The company's Bleached Board Division paper mill is recognized worldwide for its technological sophistication and production of premium coated bleached paperboard.  Paperboard from the Covington mill is used for a variety of consumer packaging and printing applications including packaging cartons, aseptic and other liquid packaging, books and greeting cards.\n                                                                                                                                                                             \nWestvaco also sets the highest standards for workplace safety.  The company and its employees have worked consistently to build a strong and solid system of work practices and procedures to prevent accidents from happening.  Westvaco remains committed to maintaining the integrity of a workplace safety program that is among the industry's best.  \n\nWestvaco's Bleached Board Division in Covington, VA has two substances that fall under the EPA's Accidental Release Prevention and Risk Management Plan (RMP).  The regulated substances handled at the source in excess of their applicable threshold qualities are chlorine dioxide (CAS No. 10049-04-4) and chlorine (CAS No. 7782-50-5).  There are six covered processes using chlorine and one"

EPA designated endpoint concentration out to a distance of 4.1 miles(6.6 kilometers) from Tank I.  The estimated population within this distance from the Covington Mill Tank I is approximately 2,900.  The one environmental receptor within this distance is a state forest.  The public receptors within this distance are public recreation areas, residences, schools, commercial and industrial facilities, office buildings and churches.  \n\nThe alternative release scenario for chlorine dioxide consists of the release of 100 gallons of  ClO2 solution (4.5 kilograms of ClO2) as a result of a failed gasket in the valve of a pipeline containing this solution at the Bleached Pulp Mill.  This alternative release scenario results in ClO2 concentrations that equal or exceed the U.S. EPA designated endpoint concentration to distances of 554 feet (169 meters) from the release point.  This area is entirely within the mill property.  Thus, there is no estimated population to be affected within this distance from the Bleached Pulp Mill.  Likewise, there are no environmental or public receptors within this distance from the release point.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for chlorine consists of the release of 0.4 kilograms of Cl2 from failure of the lead gasket at the Cl2 cylinder valve of one of the Cl2 cylinders at Paper Machine No. 2.  This alternative release scenario results in Cl2 concentrations that equal or exceed the U.S. EPA designated endpoint concentration to a distance of 108 feet (33 meters) from the release point.  This distance extends to Westvaco's boundary at Dunlap Creek; there is no estimated affected population within this distance from Paper Machine No. 2.  Likewise there are no environmental or public receptors within this distance.  \n\nIn regard to the five-year accident history, there have been no incidents at "

      "SummaryText": "the Covington Mill over the past five years that resulted in injuries, death, or significant property damage on-site; nor have there been known off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, shelterings in place, property damage or environmental damage associated with any of the regulated processes.\n\nThe site is also subject to OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation 29 CFR 1910.119.  The purpose of this regulation and Westvaco's PSM program is to prevent accidental releases and to minimize the consequence if one should occur.  The location also has an Emergency Response Program in place that includes:\n     Procedures for informing the public and local emergency response agencies about accidental releases;\n     Documentation of proper first-aid and emergency medical treatment to treat accidental human exposure;\n     Procedures for emergency response after an accidental release of a regulated substance;\n     Procedures for the use of emergency response equipment and for its inspection, testing and maintenance;\n     Training of all employees in relevant procedures, and;\n     Procedures to review and update the emergency action plan as appropriate.\n\nEnsuring safe operations will continue to be a foremost priority for Westvaco.  In that regard and as part of Process Safety Management, Process Hazard Analyses are completed for each covered process.  The most recent Process Hazard Analysis for chlorine has been completed with all action items completed.  A second Process Hazard Analysis was just recently completed for chlorine dioxide which identified action items to help strengthen and improve the system all of which will be completed by the end of 1999.  Westvaco's safety programs are audited internally on a periodic basis and modified or upgraded as needed to help ensure positive risk elimination and prevention."
