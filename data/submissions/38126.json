      "SummaryText": "Mennel Millling Company operates a mill in Mt. Olive, Illinois that processes wheat into several different grades of flour. Several of the grades involve a process in which chlorine is added to the the milled flour to achieve the desired pH. The amount of chlorine added varies depending on the desired characteristics of the flour and the type and nature of the incoming wheat.\n\nChlorine is delivered to Mennel Milling Co. and used in one ton containers. The supplier delivers full chlorine containers to the site via truck. The containers are unloaded by the supplier directly onto specially designed wheeled cars. Mennel Milling staff then positions the carts in the chlorine room and connects the ton containers to the feed system. The chlorine room was designed to hold a maximum of four ton containers. Mennel Milling intends to have a maximum of four containers on site at any one time. Therefore, the maximum current inventory is 8,000 pounds.\n\nMennel Milling Co. uses a vacuum feed system for the application of chlorine that is inherently safe.  This system involves the use of low-pressure air flowing through an eductor that creates a vacuum.  This vacuum allows for the feed of chlorine from the containers into the piping system.  If a chlorine line downstream of the vacuum regulator is broken or develops a leak, the vacuum is interrupted and the vacuum regulator automatically closes, preventing the discharge of chlorine gas.\n\nMennel Milling Co. has contracted with Research Products Co. (REPCO) of Salina, Kansas to perform preventive and corrective maintenance on the chlorine feed systems. \n\nMennel Milling Co. has developed a comprehensive, accidental release prevention program as part of the OSHA PSM program. The elements of this program include: \n *Process Safety Information\n *Process Hazard Analysis\n *Operating Procedures\n *Training\n *Management of Change\n *Pre-Startup Safety Review\n *Compliance Audits\n *Incident Investigation \n *Contractor Management\n *Hot Work Permit"

      "SummaryText": "s\n \nIn the past five years, there have been no accidental releases of chlorine at Mennel Milling Co. that have resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant damage on site, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage. \n\nThe Macoupin County Local Emergency Planning Committee and the Mt. Olive Fire Department have been contacted by Mennel in an attempt to coordinate response efforts and to become included in the community emergency response plan. An Emergency Action Plan for the site has been implemented. This plan contains measures that Mennel Milling staff can take to alert employees to a release, how to distinguish between an incidental release and a significant release, and many other elements. Mennel Milling will receive training to allow for defensive action in response to an on-site release. \n\nMennel Milling Co. has performed a hazard evaluation for the chlorination processes at the facility. As a result of this evaluation, several changes are planned to improve safety. These changes, to be implemented by the end of 2004, include (but are not limited to) the following:  \n1. Adding strobe or flashing lights on each floor that would alert personnel of a chlorine alarm intha mill and/or the chlorine room.\n2. Consider interlocking the automatic cabinet ball valve with the leak detector on 2nd floor to automatically shut off flow of chlorine in event of an alarm\n3. Revise Emergency Action Plan to include a caution for fire fighters to \"fog\" the building with water vapor in the event of a fire in an adjacent area to control the temperature to prevent a release.\n4. Develop a preventive maintenance (PM) work order for replacement of the flexible copper tubes on an annual basis.\n5. Develop a PM task or work order the requires 2 people to inspect the chlorine piping unions the connect the flexible hoses to the PVC piping at the agitator."
