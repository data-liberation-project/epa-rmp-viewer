We have completed this report under the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency\u0012s (EPA) risk management program (RMP) to communicate our efforts to achieve a safe workplace.  \n\nThe brewery uses ammonia as a key part of the cooling system that maintains beer at the proper temperature during certain stages of the brewing process.  Ammonia is one of the materials covered under the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration\u0012s Process Safety Management standard (PSM) and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency\u0012s Risk Management Program regulations.  The brewery follows these regulations, as well as others, to ensure that it safely handles, uses, and stores ammonia and other potentially hazardous chemicals safely.  The brewery has had no releases of ammonia that resulted in injuries to people, harm to property, or damage to the environment since it opened in 1968.\n\nOur corporate environmental, health, and safety (EHS) policy and requirements promote the overall safety of this brewery, employees, and the public.  This policy includes risk reduction programs that provide assurance for the safe management of process risks to prevent environmental, health and safety incidents and to protect the workplace, the community and the environment. These programs enable the brewery to prevent the occurrence, or minimize the consequences of, significant releases of ammonia.  \n \nIt is Anheuser-Busch's policy to conduct our business in accordance with all applicable laws, regulations, and permits and to promote a safe workplace and a quality environment.  Each employee is trained and required to comply strictly with this policy.  We do not allow production goals or financial objectives to over-ride safety and environmental concerns.  \n \nAlso, it is Anheuser-Busch's policy to"

Anheuser-Busch employees whose actions in the performance of their duties may affect the environment and/or public health are trained sufficiently to permit them to comply strictly with our EHS policy. \n\nIn conducting our businesses, we continue to seek and implement cost effective methods to reduce the EHS impact of our operations.  We integrate EHS considerations into our business planning and decision-making processes, including product research and development, packaging, and new manufacturing methods.  Our continuous EHS improvement goals include pollution prevention and resource conservation.  We ask our contractors to adopt EHS standards, ethics, and policies similar to our own and we will give preference to suppliers that do so.\n \nWe encourage our employees, customers, and the public to share with us their EHS concerns.  We continually talk with local authorities in communities in which we operate to share ideas about preventing incidents with materials we use or store.\n\n\n \nAmmonia System\n \nAmmonia is used in the refrigeration system of the brewery.  As part of the brewing process, the beer is cooled to ensure its consistency, flavor and overall quality.  The beer packaged in kegs also is stored in a refrigerated area in our facility until it's shipped.  Because of the characteristics of ammonia, our employees observe certain safety precautions to prevent unnecessary human and environmental exposure, both within the brewery and in the surrounding community.\n\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario\n \nAs required by the EPA's Risk Management regulation, we have identified an extremely unlikely worst-case"

Under worst-case weather conditions and with no mitigating actions, ammonia could travel 0.7 miles before dispersing enough to no longer pose a threat to the public.\n \nThis scenario is unlikely to occur at the Columbus brewery for a number of reasons: \n(\tWe meet or exceed industry standards for the manufacture and quality control of pipes and vessels that\n   contain ammonia used at our facility;\n(\tAmmonia is not corrosive in the form in which it is used at the brewery;\n(\tPressure relief safety valves limit operating pressure so chances for a large-scale release are minimal;\n(\tManual safety valves allow the immediate shut-off of the ammonia system (described below);\n(\tEquipment is inspected and kept in proper working order and replaced when necessary; \n(\tWorst-case weather conditions as assumed in by the definition of \u0013worst case\u0014 are uncommon in the\n   Columbus area; \n(\tThe brewery has an emergency response plan and equipment in place (see description below).\n \n\nAlternative Release Scenario\n \nAn alternative release scenario would be the opening of a pressure relief valve, which itself is a system safety device designed to relieve pressure to avoid a more serious release.  The largest release from a pressure relief valve at any of our 12 breweries in the past five years has been 400 pounds released in ten minutes.  Under common weather conditions, this amount of ammonia could travel 0.06 miles (105 yards) and remain within the brewery property lines, before dispersing enough to no longer pose a threat to the public. \n \nThis scenario is unlikely for the same reasons presented in the discussion above regarding the worst-case release.\n\n \nAccidental Release Prevention Program\n \nAnheuser-Busch has years of experience operating ammonia-based refrigeration systems at its breweries.
