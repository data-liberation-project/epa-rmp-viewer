EnCana takes an active role in preventing accidental releases at all of it's facilities by ensuring that it's employees are properly trained in the safe operations of covered processes and the safe handling of regulated chemicals.  As for emergency response, EnCana has established and maintained procedures for emergency notification and response.  These are reviewed with employees on a periodic basis and revised to accommodate changes in staffing when they occur.\nEnCana management understands it's duty to provide a safe working environment and to take measures to prevent accidents that may have an effect on the surrounding community.  This understanding is reflected in procedures described and referenced in the PSM/RMP manual, Stationary Source and Regulated Substances.\n\nEnCana is a natural gas liquid recovery facility designed to process 90 mmscfd of natural gas.  The purpose of the EnCana Ft. Lupton Gas Plant is to recover natural gas liquid products from the incoming gas.  The gas is then sold on a BTU basis to two outlet pipelines.  The liquid is further processed to remove carbon dioxide and water.  The NGL can then be taken out of the plant by liquid pipeline or fractionated into it's separate components to be sold into trucks as a propane, butane, and/or gasoline product.\n\n\nPrevention Program\n\nThe prevention program and chemical - specific prevention steps are described in detail in the EnCana PSM/RMP manual.  The prevention program includes the Program 3 elements:\n\n- Employee participation, which includes provisio"
