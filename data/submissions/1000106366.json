The facility\u2019s program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations. \n\nThe facility coordinates its emergency response program and response actions with the Montgomery County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC). This coordination includes quarterly meetings of the committee, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials, and industry representatives. In addition to quarterly LEPC meetings, the facility participates in emergency drills conducted by the LEPC that involve area emergency responders. The facility has 24/7 communication capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations to provide a means of notifying the public of an incident as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.\n\n6  PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY \n\nCRNF is continuously investigating and reviewing technology and/or applications that could possibly enhance its safety efforts. These currently include:\n\n       -  Enhanced DCS alarm management and control\n       -  Hazard recognition and incident investigation training of new employees and refresher training of existing employees \n       -  Adding various types of graphics to the operating procedures, where appropriate, to assist in operator training and comprehension\n       -  Increased staffing for mechanical integrity and equipment inspections \n       -  Regularly scheduled process and safety improvement meetings\n       -  Staff review of any process hazards at the beginning of each shift"

Such investigations also determine whether an accident meets the EPA definition of an RMP-reportable accident.  The latest RMP-reportable accident at CRNF occurred in Year 2014.\n\n5  EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\n\nCRNF maintains a written Emergency Response Plan to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment. The program includes procedures for responding to a loss of containment, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally releases. The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuations plans an accounting for personnel, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post incident management.

Compliance audits are conducted at least every three years. An audit team develops findings that are forwarded to facility management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until resolution. The resolution of each finding is documented. The two most recent audit reports are retained.\n\nCHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS \n\nHazards in the processes are continually managed to ensure safe operations. The existing safety features to prevent accidental releases of regulated substances in the facility are described below.\n\nFor ammonia, CRNF has reviewed and adopted industry guidelines and manufacturer's recommendations regarding safe storage and handling. This includes personnel training as well as robust equipment designs. For the flammable mixture, CRNF has adopted several API, NFPA, insurance company, ASME, ANSI, and other codes and standards.\n\nUniform Prevention Activities\nThe accident prevention program is applied throughout the RMP-covered processes. These prevention programs are designed and implemented to prevent potential accidental release scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and/or human errors.\n\nSpecialized Safety Features\nSafety features are incorporated into the design, construction, operation, and maintenance of the processes to help prevent, quickly detect and control a release, and to reduce the consequences of a release. The following types of safety features are used in the covered processes:\n\nRelease Detection\n       -  Ammonia detectors and alarms\nRelease Containment and Control\n       -  Process relief valves t"

This helps to ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.\n\nSafe Work Practices\nCRNF has safe work practices in place to help ensure workers safety. Examples of these include: (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel; (2) a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance; (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous substances before process piping and equipment is opened; (4) a permit and procedure to control spark producing activities (i.e., hot work); and (5) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space. These procedures, along with training of affected personnel, form a system to ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely at the facility.\n\nManagement of Change\nCRNF has comprehensive system to manage change to the processes at the facility. Changes to process equipment, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, changes to the quantity of regulated substances in the process, and other process changes are properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented. Reviews ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and to verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change. Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures, are updated to incorporate a change. In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are notified of changes and, if necessary, trained on the changes.\n\nIncident Investigation\nCRNF promptly investigates all incidents that result in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury.

This is accomplished by providing contractors with an orientation session that covers: (1) a process overview; (2) information about the safety and health hazards; (3) emergency response plan requirements; and (4) safe work practices prior to beginning their work. In addition, CRNF evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the contractor selection process. CRNF personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\nPre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR)\nCRNF conducts a PSSR on any new process or process modification that requires a change in process safety information. The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service. This review provides an additional check that construction is in accordance with design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready. The PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves as a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nCRNF has practices and procedures for maintaining process equipment at the facility.

This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, including training of personnel and safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of the processes at CRNF. CRNF implements reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. CRNF places emphasis on prevention prompt detection and expeditious correction of unsafe conditions by periodically conducting internal inspections and regularly training responsible personnel. Should a release occur, trained personnel will respond to control, contain and mitigate the release. \n\n2  STATIONARY SOURCES AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES \n\nCRNF operates a variety of processes to produce anhydrous ammonia and urea-ammonium nitrate (UAN) solutions. Regulated substances held in RMP covered processes above the threshold quantity include anhydrous ammonia and flammable mixture of hydrogen, methane, and carbonyl sulfide (carbon oxysulfide, a.k.a., COS). The facility includes a total of six (6) RMP covered processes, subject to Program 3 requirements. Seven prevention programs are presented in the RMP submission because the programs are slightly different for the pressurized bullet tanks and railcars belonging to the Ammonia Storage and Loading process. The facility is subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation. Hydrogen sulfide also presents in some process streams; however, in the amounts significantly smaller than the RMP applicability threshold. \n\n3  GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS \n\nCRNF has implemented an accidental release prevention program.
