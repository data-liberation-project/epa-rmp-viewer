      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\n\nEOG Resources, Inc.\n\nTitan Hub - Program Level 1\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICIES\n\n\n\nEOG Resources has a longstanding commitment to public welfare and worker safety.  EOG addresses accidental release prevention through four factors:  design, training, operating parameters and regular maintenance.  Through design efforts, we have limited the public exposure.  Through training, we have prepared our personnel to respond effectively.  Limiting the operating parameters reduces the stress on process equipment.  And regular maintenance serves to prolong equipment life as well as discover potential problems before they become a safety issue.\n\n\n\nShould an accidental release of a regulated substance occur, EOG personnel will evaluate the  conditions, take actions within their capabilities to minimize the risk and notify the appropriate outside agencies.\n\n\n\nFACILITY BACKGROUND INFORMATION\n\n\n\nThe Titan Hub is located in a rural area in La Salle County, Texas.  This facility is a natural gas dew point control plant with condensate stabilization utilizing fixed and skid mounted processing equipment as well as liquid storage tanks. \n\n\n\nMarplot indicates that there is no population within the area affected by the worst case scenario and no residential housing units.  The facility is located on a lease with a controlled entrance.\n\n\n\nThere are no public receptors within the calculated radius for exposure for the worst case scenario. Additionally, there are no environmental receptors in either the worst case scenario area.\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe referenced process at the Titan Hub is regulated under both the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Risk Management Plan (RMP)) and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standards.  Since the scope of these two programs encompass much of the same material, we have presented the pertinent information following the o"

Reviewing operating procedures is an element of the Management of Change (Mock) procedure.  In addition, the accuracy of all operating procedures are recertified annually.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\nThe Titan Hub has implemented a comprehensive training program to prepare potential process operators to safely and efficiently operate the facility.  Operators-in-training are taught an overview of the process, operating procedures, lock out/tag out, consequences of deviation, emergency response and operating parameters.  After an initial training phase, each candidate is paired with a senior operator for a minimum of 90 days to learn process specific tasks and duties.  The operator-in-training may remain paired with a senior operator beyond the 90 days if necessary, until they can demonstrate enough proficiency to satisfy the Operations Foreman.  The final step in becoming an operator is passing a rigorous written exam called the Compressor Operator Signoff (COS).  After all these requirements have been met, the new Operator can work independently.  New Operators are monitored by the Operations foremen.  Education is an ongoing process and as such, all operators receive periodic training related to their job duties.  In addition to all of this instruction, formal refresher training is conducted every three years. Each step of the operator training course is documented and becomes a permanent part of the employee's file.\n\n\n\nAdditionally, process maintenance personnel receive detailed training in each of the maintenance procedures as well as knowledge to diagnose and repair the process equipment.  They must demonstrate a proficiency in their field of maintenance.  Only after the foreman of their discipline deems them competent, will they be allowed to perform maintenance tasks on process equipment.  Document"
