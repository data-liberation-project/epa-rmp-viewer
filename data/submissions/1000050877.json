Like the Operators, maintenance personnel receive ongoing training in their field and a formal refresher every three years.\r\n\r\nContractors\r\nThe Titan Hub uses contractors to supplement its workforce for construction, maintenance and testing.  To ensure that these contractors meet the safety and workplace standard, Titan personnel complete contractor evaluation forms at regular intervals.  These completed forms are evaluated by safety and management to determine compliance with the established policies, procedures and guidelines.  Contractors must maintain an acceptable score on these reviews to continue working at the facility.  In addition, the Safety Group reviews the contractor's written safety program, its implementation, training and accident history to ensure that it complies with the Titan Hub requirements.\r\n\r\nThe Titan Hub provides contractors with:\r\n 1.  A process overview\r\n 2.  Safety orientation and ensures their understanding through testing.\r\n 3.  Information about health and safety hazards.\r\n 4.  Emergency evacuation procedures and mustering location.\r\n 5.  All site specific safe work practices.\r\n\r\nPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\r\nThe Titan Hub conducted a Pre-startup Safety Review (PSSR) before commencing initial process operations.  The records of those PSSRs are maintained at the facility.  In addition a PSSR is conducted anytime a change is made that effects the Process Safety Information or before startup after a turnaround.  The records of those PSSRs are maintained as part of the MOC process.  Titan uses a standardized corporate PSSR checklist.  The PSSR serves to ensure that:\r\n 1.  Appropriate training has been conducted.\r\n 2.  Equipment, instruments, safety equipment and other elements are properly installed.\r\n 3.  Valves and controls are in the normal/safe position.\r\n 4.  Compressors and process equipment have been prepared"

If a deficiency is identified that presents a safety concern, Titan Hub personnel will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service.\r\n\r\nSafe Work Practices\r\nSafe work practices at the Titan Hub are defined by  (1) the corporate safe practices manual, (2) a lockout/tag out procedure to isolate energy sources for equipment and piping undergoing maintenance, (3) a permit and procedure to control spark producing activities (i.e., hot work), and (4) a permit and procedure to verify that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space. (5) procedures to control entry into the facility.  These practices along with training and procedures help to ensure that operating and maintenance activities at the hub are performed safely.\r\n\r\nManagement of Change\r\nThe Titan Hub has a comprehensive system to manage changes to all covered processes.

Changes are reviewed to (1) determine that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change. Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, equipment information, and operating procedures are updated prior to incorporating these changes. In addition, operating and maintenance personnel and affected contractors are provided any necessary training on the change.\r\n\r\nIncident Investigation\r\nThe Titan Hub promptly investigates all incidents related to a covered process that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury. The goal of each investigation is to determine the factors that may have led to the incident, and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident. The investigation team documents its recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to Titan Hub management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's recommendations are tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the recommendations. Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years so that the reports can be reviewed during future and revalidated PHAs.\r\n\r\nCompliance Audits\r\nTo determine that the Accident Prevention Program is functioning properly, the Titan Hub conducts compliance audits every three years.

Operators-in-training are taught an overview of the process, operating procedures, lock out/tag out, consequences of deviation, emergency response and operating parameters.  After an initial training phase, each candidate is paired with a senior operator for a minimum of 90 days to learn process specific tasks and duties.  The operator-in-training may remain paired with a senior operator beyond the 90 days if necessary, until they can demonstrate enough proficiency to satisfy the Operations Foreman.  The final step in becoming an operator is passing a rigorous written exam called the Compressor Operator Signoff (COS).  After all these requirements have been met, the new Operator can work independently.  New Operators are monitored by the Operations foremen.  Education is an ongoing process and as such, all operators receive periodic training related to their job duties.  In addition to all of this instruction, formal refresher training is conducted every three years. Each step of the operator training course is documented and becomes a permanent part of the employee's file.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, process maintenance personnel receive detailed training in each of the maintenance procedures as well as knowledge to diagnose and repair the process equipment.

EOG addresses accidental release prevention through four factors:  design, training, operating parameters and regular maintenance.  Through design efforts, we have limited the public exposure.  Through training, we have prepared our personnel to respond effectively.  Limiting the operating parameters reduces the stress on process equipment.  And regular maintenance serves to prolong equipment life as well as discover potential problems before they become a safety issue.\r\n\r\nShould an accidental release of a regulated substance occur, EOG personnel will evaluate the  conditions, take actions within their capabilities to minimize the risk and notify the appropriate outside agencies.\r\n\r\nFACILITY BACKGROUND INFORMATION\r\n\r\nThe Titan Hub is located in a rural area in La Salle County, Texas.  This facility is a natural gas dew point control plant with condensate stabilization utilizing fixed and skid mounted processing equipment as well as liquid storage tanks. \r\n\r\nMarplot indicates that there is no population within the area affected by the worst case scenario and no residential housing units.  The facility is located on a lease with a controlled entrance.\r\n\r\nThere are no public receptors within the calculated radius for exposure for the worst case scenario. Additionally, there are no environmental receptors in either the worst case scenario area.\r\n\r\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\r\n\r\nThe referenced process at the Titan Hub is regulated under both the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Risk Management Plan (RMP)) and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standards.
