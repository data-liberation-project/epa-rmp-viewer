The stationary source is the ammonia refrigeration system located at the Wyman's, 178 Main St., Cherryfield, ME 04622.  Wyman's has enacted both the Process Safety Management Program and the Risk Management Program as part of their dedication to the health and safety of their employees, as well as the additional community and public receptors.  The only regulated substance at this facility is anhydrous ammonia, which is classified as a toxic substance, liquefied under pressure.  \n\n\n\nThis facility is a warehousing  with cold storage capabilities.  The refrigeration system encompasses three separate ammonia machinery rooms and has a combined inventory of approximately 24,393 pounds of anhydrous ammonia stored on site.  This process meets the requirements of EPA's Program 3.\n\n\n\nThis Process Safety Program Manual has been developed by HCG Associates on behalf of Wyman's, specifically to prevent or mitigate accidental releases associated with the storage and use of anhydrous ammonia at the Cherryfield facility. As noted in specific sections, portions of this Plan, including technical details associated with anhydrous ammonia operations were prepared by the American Refrigeration Company, Andover, Massachusetts. This manual was developed to meet the requirements of both the OSHA Process Safety Management Program, and the Risk Management Program regulations and is available to government agencies and the public for review.\n\n\n\nWyman's operates the 95,067-sq. ft., 178 Main St facility on an approx"

The Clean Air Act (CAA), as amended in 1990, requires the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to address concerns that chemical accidents could pose to employees, and both public and environmental receptors.  The primary objective of OSHA's process safety management standard is to reduce the number of employee fatalities and injuries associated with minor and catastrophic releases of hazardous substances. The intent of the regulation is to also prevent accidental chemical releases and minimize their impact if they do occur through selective engineering, administrative controls, and industry best practices.  The PSM Standard emphasizes the application of management controls, rather than specific engineering guidelines, when addressing the risks associated with handling, or working near anhydrous ammonia refrigerant. All new or existing facilities exceeding the 10,000 lb. anhydrous ammonia threshold planning quantity, must have a PSM Program in effect.  The implementation of a process safety management program, assembly of system and facility process safety information, and the identification of hazards, will assist in preventing the occurrence, or minimize the consequence of an unintentional release.  \n\n\n\nOSHA published its Process Safety Management Standard (29 CFR 1910.119) in February 1992 and it became effective 26 May 1992.  The complete OSHA Standard 29 CFR 1910.199 can be found in the next section of this binder.\n\n\n\nScope\n\n\n\nThis document is written for ammonia refrigeration facilities, which are required to be in compliance with the OSHA PSM Standard.\n\n\n\nProcedures\n\n    The procedures for complying with the PSM Standard are outlined by the following major steps:\n\n"

      "SummaryText": "        Identifying Covered Processes\n\n        Developing Process Safety Management (PSM) Procedures for each required element\n\n\n\nIdentifying Covered Processes\n\nThe PSM Standard covers three basic types of processes:\n\n?    Processes which handle Highly Hazardous Chemicals (HHC's) above threshold quantities.  The threshold quantity (TQ) for anhydrous ammonia is 10,000 pounds.  There are 133 HHC's and the list of these materials can be found in Section 3 of this binder.\n\n?    Processes which handle flammable materials above the threshold quantities of 10,000 pounds; and\n\n?    The manufacture of any amount of explosive materials.\n\n    Groups of interconnected vessels and pipes must be considered as a single process when     determining the total system potential system quantity of HHC's.  Also, separate vessels which are     located such that a highly hazardous chemical could be involved in a potential release must be     considered a single process.\n\n    The boundaries of a process must be determined on a case-by-case basis.  In a recent interpretation     letter, OSHA set forth a three-part analysis for determining the boundaries of a process.  Utilities     that serve a covered process must be considered part of the process where they can significantly     impact or affect the release of a highly hazardous chemical in the process.  The process hazard     analysis should confirm the PSM boundaries selected.\n\n    The PSM Standard also contains several exemptions:\n\n?    Hydrocarbon fuels used solely for workplace consumption and not part of a cover process;\n\n?    Flammable fluids stored in atmospheric tanks without cooling;\n\n?    Retail facilities;\n\n?    Oil or gas well drilling or servicing operations; and \n\n?    Normally unoccupied remote facilities.\n\n    For most ammonia refrigeration facilities, these exemptions will not apply and the applicability of     the PSM Standard will be determined by the amount of anhydrous ammonia in the refrigeration     plant, and perhaps the presence of flammable liquids or gases on-site in quantities about "
