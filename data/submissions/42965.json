Corporate EH&S personnel assist facilities in developing programs to meet internal environmental and safety goals.  The Queensbury, NY facility (Plant 2) has on-site support to coordinate health, safety and environmental programs.\n\nThe facility maintains a comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers design, installation, operation, maintenance and training for affected processes.  Pactiv maintains programs and procedures consistent with the requirements of OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) program, which serves as a basis for implementation of the facility's RMP program.  In the event that any unforeseeable release might still occur, the facility coordinates emergency response primarily with local fire departments.  The Warren County LEPC is provided, on an annual basis, the approximate quantities maintained onsite within their covered processes.  The covered process for Plant 2 includes (1) 12,800 gallon tank and all associated conveyance systems for the storage and transfer of the RMP-regulated process blowing agent.\n\nStationary Source and regulated Substance\n\nThe facility manufactures various polyethylene foam products and bubble wrap.  The foam manufacturing processes use a regulated flammable gas as a blowing agent.  The maximum inventory of blowing agent at the facility exceeds the 10,000-lb RMP threshold.\n\nThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\nSummarized below is a brief description of the facility\u00bfs program elements:\n\nProcess Safety Information\nThe facility maintains process safety information that describes chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with the covered process.\n\nProcess Hazar"

The hazard review is updated at least every 5 years or when major changes are made.  The findings are addressed in a timely manner and documented.\n\nOperating Procedures\nTo ensure the covered process is operated safely, written operating instructions have been developed, maintained and made available to operators.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as start-up, shutdown, normal operation, temporary operations, emergency shutdown and emergency operation.\n\nTraining\nThe facility trains employees that operate covered processes initially, as changes are made and conducts refresher training\n\nMechanical Integrity\nThe facility\u00bfs maintenance personnel perform documented maintenance on covered process equipment to ensure proper operation.  The work is performed by trained maintenance personnel and the equipment includes storage tanks, piping systems, relief vent and vent systems, control pumps, etc.\n\nManagement of Change\nWritten Management of Change procedures are maintained at the facility, which cover changes to process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures.  Operating and maintenance personnel affected by changes are made aware of the changes and trained as needed.\n\nPre-Start Up Safety Reviews\nThese reviews are conducted for initial startups and following modifications.  The reviews confirm that construction, equipment and operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for a safe startup prior to placing the equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits\nAudits are conducted to ensure that the provisions of PSM and RMP are being implemented.  Any necessary corrective actions are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\nIncident Investigation\nFacility personnel promptly investigate any incident that has or could reasonably have resulted in a catastrophic release of a regulate"
