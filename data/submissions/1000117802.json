This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training, written procedures, routine maintenance and inspection programs, and consideration of safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes. Our policy is to implement controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous chemicals. However, if a release should occur, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n\nII.\tDESCRIPTION OF THE FACILITY AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe Sweeny Unit 44 NGL Fractionator 1 is a fractionation and treating facility to provide a nominal 100,000 BPD of NGL fractionation capacity. The facility consists of amine treating, dehydration, fractionation and product sulfur treating equipment to provide upgrading of Y-grade natural gas liquids to ethane, propane, n-butane, i-butane and C5+ gasoline products.\n\nThe Sweeny Unit 47 NGL Fractionator 2 is a fractionation and treating facility to provide a nominal 150,000 BPD of NGL fractionation capacity.

The facility consists of Y-grade receiving equipment, C5+ gasoline and Iso-butane sulfur treating equipment, hot oil equipment, thermal oxidizer equipment, amine regeneration equipment, process waste water handling equipment, and product pipeline injection equipment. \n\n\nThe C5+ to Pasadena system receives C5+ from Frac 1, 2, 3 and 4.  The product is stored in two (2) storage tanks and sent out via pipeline.   \n\nThe processes utilize the following chemicals over the threshold quantity that EPA has identified as having the potential to cause significant, offsite consequences in the event of a substantial accidental release:\n\nToxics:  There are no RMP covered Toxics over the threshold quantity for this process.\n\nFlammables:  Butane; Carbon  Oxysulfide; Ethane; Isobutane; Isopentane; Methane; Pentane; Propane; Propylene; Ethyl Mercaptan.\n\nIII. HAZARD ASSESSMENT RESULTS\n\nAt the heart of the Risk Management Plan rule is the requirement to conduct a hazard assessment to examine and communicate potential offsite impacts of releases of regulated hazardous substances. Two types of releases are to be considered, a Worst Case Scenario and an Alternate Release Scenario. The WCS (representing a catastrophic event) is defined as a release with the largest quantity of a regulated substance from a single vessel or process line failure that results in the greatest distance to a specified endpoint. The ARS represents a more credible, but still potentially significant, accidental release of a regulated hazardous material. It is also understood that active and passive mitigation systems can be considered in developing the ARS. However, in some cases mitigation measures and systems may not have been included"

In helping to establish the Alternate Release Scenarios that are more credible and likely, various information such as previous incident history, PHA failure scenarios, siting and spacing studies, etc. were considered.\n\nNote: For Security purposes, the Offsite Consequence Analysis description and scenarios are not shown in the Executive Summary.\n\n\nIV. GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM STEPS\n\nThe following is a summary of the general Accident Prevention Program in place at the Sweeny Refinery.  Because processes at the plant are subject to both EPA Risk Management Program Rule and OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) compliance, this summary addresses each of the PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the Accident Prevention Program.  \n\nA. Employee Participation\n\nSweeny Refinery management supports and encourages employees to participate in all facets of risk management and accident prevention. Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) team.  In addition, Sweeny Refinery has a number of initiatives that address process safety and employee safety issues. These initiatives include forming problem-solving teams to promote both process safety and employee safety.\n\nPersonnel representing operations, maintenance, support, and management work together on the Employee Excellence Team to represent facility employees involving the following areas:\n\n\u00bf\tEmployee Ownership and VPP (Behavior Based Safety Process, ergonomics, traffic safety, general safety, safety concerns),\n\u00bf\tPollution Prevention (recycling programs, waste prevention and minimization),  \n\u00bf\tSafety Standards and Procedures (review, edit, create, and audit)\n\u00bf\tProcess Safety (process safety metrics, Process Safety Event lessons-learned, communication a"

Process Safety Information\n\nSweeny Refinery maintains a variety of technical documents that are used for the safe and reliable operation of facility processes. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  Specific teams/groups within the facility are assigned responsibility for maintaining current and up to date process safety information. Process safety information documents are readily available for review and use (e.g. during unit process hazard analysis, etc.). The refinery Management of Change (MOC) process is utilized to maintain process safety information current and up-to-date.\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in safety data sheets (SDSs). For specific process areas, the complex has documented safety related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, and composition) in the unit specific Process Safety Information (PSI). The respective teams verify the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel and instrumented protective systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems, etc.).  \n\nNumerous technical documents are also maintained that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment. This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, etc. This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to confirm that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\nC.

Within this process, PHAs are conducted to systematically examine covered processes to identify potential process-related hazards and verify that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards. The HAZard and OPerability (HAZOP) analysis technique is the primary method used to perform these PHA evaluations. Additional PHA tools and methodologies (e.g., Layers of Protection Analysis, What-If, etc.) are utilized based on need and appropriateness for the process under review. The PHAs are conducted using a team of people who have operating, maintenance and process engineering experience and expertise.\n\nAny PHA findings or recommendations identified are forwarded to the respective team management for resolution. Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team. This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive appropriate priority attention. All approved mitigation options being implemented in response to PHA team findings are tracked to completion. The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained in the facility formal corrective action tracking database.\n\nTo confirm the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, Sweeny Refinery periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results. These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer in operation.\n\nD. Operating Procedures\n\nSweeny Refinery maintains written operating procedures that address the various modes of process operations, to include: unit startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown, and initial startup of a new process. These procedures can be used as a refer"

Formal processes and procedures are developed and maintained through the Training Team to help ensure operating procedures are periodically reviewed and certified annually as current and up-to-date.\n\nE. Training\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, Sweeny Refinery has implemented a comprehensive training program consisting of various job/certification models for all employees involved in operating a process. New employees receive basic training in plant operations if they are not already familiar with such operations. After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks. After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration, etc.) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently. In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to confirm their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level. This training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\nF. Contractors\n\nSweeny Refinery uses contractors as part of its regular work force and during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities. Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the facility has procedures in place to help verify contractors have the appropriate knowledge and skills to perform their work in a safe manner, are aware of the potential hazards in their workplace, understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, understand and follow site safety rules and procedures, and inform plant personnel of any hazards they may discover during the course of their work.

Plant personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to help ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations. Meetings are held monthly with facility contractors and plant personnel to promote effective information sharing and to ensure site and work requirements are adequately communicated.\n\nG. Pre-Startup Safety Reviews (PSSR)\n\nAs required by the OSHA PSM standard and in accordance with the EPA RMP Accident Prevention Program requirements, the Sweeny Refinery conducts PSSRs for any new facility or when existing facilities/processes are modified and requires a change in the process safety information. The intent of the PSSR is to confirm various features are in place prior to placing the equipment in service, such as: proper hazard reviews, procedures, personnel training, and equipment is constructed and installed per design. The PSSR review team uses checklist type questions to verify all aspects of readiness. A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that Accident Prevention Program requirements are properly implemented.  The PSSR process is an integral part of the overall facility Management of Change / Pre-Startup Safety Review process. \n\nH. Mechanical Integrity\n\nSweeny Refinery has well established practices and procedures to help ensure covered process equipment is maintained in a safe and reliable condition, to include: pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems. The basic aspects of this program include: training, written procedures, inspections and tests, correcting ide"

In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of process equipment.  \n\nMaintenance personnel receive training on an overview of the process, safety and health hazards, applicable maintenance procedures, emergency response plans, and the applicable safe work practices necessary to perform their job in a safe manner. Written procedures confirm work is performed in a consistent manner and provide a basis for training. Inspections and tests are performed to verify equipment functions as intended, and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels). If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back in service (if possible), or appropriate personnel/teams will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to verify the continued safe operation of the equipment.\n\nAnother integral part of the Mechanical Integrity Program is quality assurance. Quality assurance measures are incorporated into equipment purchases and repairs to help ensure new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.\n\nI. Safe Work Practices\n\nSweeny Refinery has well established written safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety. Examples of these include: control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, lockout/tagout procedures to verify proper isolation of energy sources for equipment maintenance, procedures for the safe removal of hazardous materials before process piping or equipment is opened, hot work permit procedures, confined space entry procedures, and safety and emergency systems bypass permit/procedure.

These procedures require that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, and changes to facilities that may affect a covered process, are properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented. Hazard reviews are conducted to verify adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and to verify existing controls have not been compromised by the change. Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures, are updated as necessary to incorporate these changes. In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on the change. \n\nK. Incident Investigation\n\nThe Sweeny Refinery has established a formal incident reporting and investigation process to promptly investigate all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, chemical release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury. The goal of each investigation is to determine the root cause of the incident and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident. The investigation team documents its findings, develops corrective actions to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to plant management and respective Teams for resolution.  Corrective actions documented in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked to completion in the facility formal incident reporting and corrective action tracking database, and retained in accordance with the company document records retention policy.\n\nL.

The following types of safety features are used in various processes:\n\nRelease Detection:\n\u00bf\tGas Detectors (Hydrocarbon, H2S, etc.) with Alarms\n\u00bf\tCamera surveillance\n\u00bf\tRoutine unit operator rounds/inspections of equipment\nRelease Containment/Control:\n\u00bf\tProcess relief valves that discharge to a flare system to capture and incinerate episodic releases\n\u00bf\tBlock valves to permit isolation of the process (manual or automatic)\n\u00bf\tAutomated Shutdown Systems for specific process parameters (e.g., level, flow, temperature, etc.)\n\u00bf\tRedundant equipment and instrumentation (e.g., uninterruptible power supply for process control system, backup firewater pump)\n\u00bf\tAtmospheric relief devices\n\u00bf\tDiked areas\n\u00bf\tCheck valves\n\u00bf\tFlare systems\n\u00bf\tStructural/equipment fire proofing\n\nRelease Mitigation:\n\u00bf\tFire suppression and extinguishing systems\n\u00bf\tDeluge systems for specific equipment\n\u00bf\tTrained emergency response personnel\n\u00bf\tPersonal Protective Equipment (e.g., protective clothing, self-contained breathing apparatus)\n\u00bf\tWater curtains for specific equipment\n\u00bf\tEmergency Isolation Valves\n\u00bf\tEmergency Activation Systems\n\u00bf\tRapid Notify Community Alert Network\n\u00bf\tRisk Based Inspection\nV. FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nBased on an examination of the Sweeny Refinery incidents within the past 5 years and effects of any accidental releases, there have been no RMP events with offsite impacts, and no incidents involving covered regulated substances that"

      "SummaryText": "met RMP reporting criteria.\n\nAs indicated above under the Incident Investigation element, the Sweeny Refinery has a formal written incident investigation process that is designed to identify root causes of incidents and develop appropriate corrective actions to prevent recurrence. Risk assessments are also made of incidents. However, the Sweeny Refinery's focus and philosophy is in the area of preventing accidents, and controls and measures are developed and implemented to help accomplish this.\n\nVI. EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\n\nSweeny Refinery maintains written Emergency Response Procedures and Action Plans to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment. The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released. The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post-incident cleanup and decontamination requirements. In addition, Sweeny Refinery has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment, as well as instructions that address the use of emergency response equipment. Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties. The Emergency Response Program is periodically reviewed and updated when necessary based on modifications made to plant processes or other plant facilities.\n\nThe overall Emergency Response Program for Sweeny Refinery is coordinated with the Brazoria County Emergency Planning Committee (BCEPC). This coordination includes periodic meetings of the committee, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials, and industry representatives. S"

      "SummaryText": "weeny Refinery has around the clock communications capability with appropriate BCEPC officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., fire departments). This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident. Periodic emergency drills are conducted that involve the BCEPC and local emergency response organizations. In addition to the BCEPC, the Sweeny Refinery also has a Mutual Aid System in place, the Emergency Assistance Agreement Committee (EAAC) which is a subcommittee of the Industrial CAER organization in the Brazosport area and the Southeast Texas Matagorda County (SETMAG). This system provides Mutual Aid from other industry members in the Brazosport and Matagorda County areas. Also, the Old Ocean Volunteer Fire Department, the Brazoria Volunteer Fire Department and West Brazos Emergency Medical Services would provide assistance in the event of an emergency at the Sweeny Refinery. The EAAC conducts emergency drills quarterly each year, hosted by a facility with other member facilities participating.\n\nVII. PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nSome new and/or planned upcoming events (some on-going) or changes to continue to improve safety and environmental performance at Sweeny Refinery include the following:\n\n-\tFacility Siting and Spacing Analysis, Reviews and Initiatives\n-\tConducting Emergency Response and CAER Drills\n-\tHands on Safety Training for Site Personnel & Contractors \n-\tPump Seal Upgrade/Pump Safeguarding Projects\n-\tUpgrades to Safety Instrumented Systems throughout facility\n-\tAlarm Management/Rationalization\n-\tCooling Tower Bleach Conversion\n-\tEmission Calculation Validations\n-\tAtmospheric Relief Mitigation\n-      Continuous Feedback from Operations\n-      Implementation of Process Controls Logic"
