      "SummaryText": "ChemQuest Chemicals operates an ammonia storage and loading facility. The ammonia is stored in storage tanks, drums, totes and tank trucks. Any vapors generated during filling or unloading activities are vented back to a scrub tank. It is the policy of ChemQuest Chemicals to operate the ammonia units in a safe and environmentally sound manner reducing to the greatest extent possible any hazards associated with processes and reducing any subsequent risk to the surrounding community, employees and the environment. It is also ChemQuest Chemicals' policy to work with the surrounding community and local emergency response agencies to promote a spirit of cooperation and teamwork, to orchestrate an effective contingency plan in the unlikely event that a process incident at the facility was to occur.\n\n\n\nIn response to the Rule, a Prevention Program has been implemented. The program consist of chemical and process safety information, a process hazard analysis, written operating procedures, training, preventive maintenance procedures, as well as programs to protect contractors and employees (hot work and employee participation), compliance audits, incident investigation, management of change and pre-startup safety reviews.\n\n\n\nProcess equipment is operated and maintained in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendation and/or best practice. Safe practices are incorporated into the operating and maintenance procedures to reduce exposure of potential hazards to personnel, the public and/or the environment. These procedures are supported by training to ensure personnel, operators and mechanics in particular, associated with the ammonia processes and/or associated equipment are competent and understand the procedures. A Management of Change (MOC) Procedure is followed to assess the risk of any administrative or facility changes and to ensure that  additional actions are performed to reduce risk, procedures/drawings are revised and training is conducted, performed as specified "

Actions are tracked to closure as outlined in the Corrective Action and Preventive Action (CAPA) Procedure.\n\n\n\nAll incidents will be reported and investigated according to the Incident Reporting and Investigation Procedure. Results of the investigation and lessons learned are then shared with appropriate personnel to prevent future recurrence. Any corrective actions resulting from the incident investigation are tracked to closure using the CAPA Procedure.\n\n\n\nChemQuest Chemicals has never had a significant release of hazardous substance defined by this Rule for the ammonia processes. In the event there is a release, ChemQuest Chemicals has an Emergency Action Plan (EAP). The EAP describes requirements that must be followed in the event ammonia is released or if an emergency arises during maintenance or the loading or unloading of this substance. Since ChemQuest Chemicals' employees will not respond to releases of regulated substances, the EAP defines the response organizations on call, emergency notification procedures (internal and external), facility evacuation, site communication and best practices to be used in the event an incident should occur. The EAP is reviewed and updated at least once per year to incorporate any facility changes.\n\n\n\nAt a minimum the RMP will be audited at least every three years and updated and renewed every five years. Any necessary changes to the to the EAP or any other relevant programs or procedures would be made on an ongoing and as needed basis or following an incident investigation, RMP audit or RMP renewal.\n\n"
