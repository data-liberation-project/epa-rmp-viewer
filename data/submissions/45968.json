(Penford) is committed to operating its business in a manner that is safe for its workers, the public, and the environment.  As part of this commitment, Penford has established a comprehensive safety, health, and environmental management process to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility.  One part of this process is a Risk Management Program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at Penford and that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) regulation 40CFR part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule).  One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit a risk management plan (RMPlan) describing the risk management program at Penford.  This document is intended to satisfy the RMP Plan requirements of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of the program.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nPenford is committed to the safety of its workers and the public, the preservation of the environment, and the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances.  Penford has made significant investments in process equipment, safety systems, and personnel to ensure the safety of its operations, minimize the impact of its operations on the environment, and prevent releases from occurring.  This commitment is clearly stated in Penford's Environmental, Health, & Safety Policy, and reinforced as a critical element in employee performance appraisals and the profit sharing plan.  A well-qualified Environmental, Health, & Safety (EHS) staff, a highly competent in-house engineering group, and a committed senior management team ensure process safety is given the highest priority.\n\nPenford is also well prepared to respond to and contain a release if one should occur.

Active participation on the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and regular interface with the fire department and other response agencies ensure a large team of experts is ready to respond should they be needed.  Familiarity with Penford's processes and chemicals, established emergency actionplan, and extensive training ensure local emergency agencies can provide the community appropriate support if needed.\n\nChemical Processes and Regulated Substances\n\nPenford is an industry whose primary business is the manufacture of specialty carbohydrate based products for food ingredients and the paper industry.  Penford is headquartered in Centenial, Colorado.   Penford's Idaho Falls facility has been in this location for over 85 years and is considered today to be an innovative leader in carbohydrate technology.\n\nIn the manufacture of its specialty carbohydrate based products, Penford uses propylene oxide, a chemical listed by the RMP rule as a regulated substance which is stored on site above the EPA threshold quantities.\n\nPropylene oxide is stored for use in the Hydroxypropyl Starch Process.  In this process a small quantity of propylene oxide is reacted with starch to structurally modify or alter the basic natural starch polymer.  The resulting hydroxypropylated starch is used in specialty food ingredient starches.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the Penford Products Co. facility in Idaho Falls, Idaho.  Because processes at Penford that are regulated by the EPA RMP regulation are also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard, this summary and the subsequent section on emergency response address each of the OSHA PSM elements and describe the management system in place to implement the accidental prevent"

Employee Participation\n\nIt is Penford's policy to utilize the most knowledgeable and experienced resources available in the execution of its process safety and accident prevention programs.  To accomplish this, Penford encourages (and at times requires) contractors and employees at all levels of the organization to participate in these programs.  Operating unit personnel participate in hazard studies, incident investigations, periodic audits, and management of change reviews.  Teams with management, operator and contractor participation are responsible for the development of related programs and procedures.  Written policies reinforce the importance of employee participation and ensure process-related information is made available to those involved.  All employees actively participate in Penford's safety process.\n\n2. Process Safety Information/Trade Secrets\n\nRecognizing the importance of developing and maintaining technical documentation, Penford has established documentation standards and developed a computer-based document control system.  When new or modified processes are developed, they are designed to meet or exceed all accepted trade and design standards.  Information from chemical suppliers, engineering and trade associations, regulatory agencies, and equipment suppliers is utilized to design processes.  Materials of construction, design specifications, safe operating limits, operating and maintenance procedures, chemical safety information, and other key information are collected or developed to ensure the process operates safely.  Maintenance, operating, emergency shutdown, and an emergency action plan are developed and maintained. Penford ensures that its processes are maintained within their process limits by using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown and safety systems).\n\nProcess-related information is managed using ISO-compliant practices to e"

Penford's access to information policy ensures process safety information is available to all personnel working in or affected by the process.\n\n3. Process Hazard Analysis\n\nPenford utilizes team-based hazard analysis techniques to ensure all potential hazards are identified and multiple levels of protection are in place to prevent an incident.  Teams with engineers, operators, mechanics and safety professionals evaluate each component and procedure of each process.  If new processes are developed, hazard evaluations are conducted at each phase of the design and construction.  Multiple hazard evaluation techniques including hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis and what-if/checklists are utilized.    \n\nTrained study leaders, computerized hazard analysis software, and written hazard study protocol ensure each study is effective.  Every change to a process is similarly evaluated, and each process is comprehensively re-evaluated at least every five years. Penford has established a system to ensure timely response to findings and recommendations.  The computer-based system ensures: recommendations are documented, actions prioritized, and responsibilities assigned; a written schedule for completing action is developed; action is taken and documented; and action is communicated to affected personnel. \n\n4. Management of Change\n\nTo ensure proposed changes to processes are properly evaluated before they are implemented, Penford has developed an effective management of change program.  All proposed changes are carefully evaluated by engineers, operators, safety professionals, and site management to ensure a change does not introduce an unforeseen hazard.  Changes to process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process-operating conditions), procedures, and other process changes are subject to the management of change review.  When "

To ensure this occurs and the installation is completed as designed, a pre-startup safety review is conducted.\n\n5. Operating Procedures\n\nPenford maintains detailed written procedures that address various modes of process operations, including unit startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, normal shutdown, and initial startup of a new process.  These procedures are used as reference by experienced operators and provide the basis for consistent training of new operators.  Procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.  When process changes are made, the management of change process ensures affected procedures are updated and operators are re-trained.  Process control equipment and software have also been programmed to require compliance with operating procedures.  In addition, Penford's distributed control systems (DCS) which control the process equipment have been programmed with safety interlocks that run in parallel and oversee normal operations providing yet another layer of protection.  \n\n6. Training\n\nTo complement the written procedures, Penford has developed a comprehensive training program for all of its employees and contractors.  New employees are required to complete a new hire orientation prior to assignment in the facility.  After successfully completing the new hire orientation, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  The new operator must demonstrate (through tests and skills demonstration) adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner prior to working independently.  In addition, all operators must successfully complete periodic refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acce"

Contractor management must provide this certification by listing the names of the individual contract employees.  Penford then provides additional training to every contractor employee prior to his or her assignment within the plant.  \n\nA computer-based training management package helps keep track of training for employees and makes sure refresher training is completed as required.  Contractor training records are kept manually in the contractor training manual.\n\n7. Contractors\n\nPrior to working at the facility, potential contractors must pre-qualify, describing their management structure, insurance coverage, training process, historical safety performance, and a wide range of other pertinent information.  If the contractor meets Penford's stringent requirements, each contractor employee must complete Penford's contractor safety training.  This training includes a process overview, information about safety and health hazards, emergency action plan requirements, and safe work practices.  .  Penford periodically audits each contractor's safety performance and their overall safety process.  \n\n8. Pre-startup Safety Review (PSSR)\n\nPenford conducts a Pre-startup Safety Review (PSSR) for any new process or significant process modification.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all support systems are operationally ready.

Corrective action taken in response to the audit team's recommendations is documented and the two most recent audit reports are retained.\n\nChemical-specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe RMP covered process at Penford has hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation.  The prevention program summarized previously applies to the Program 3 EPA RMP-covered process at Penford.  This prevention programs helps prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures or human errors.  \n\nIn addition to the accident prevention program activities, Penford has installed safety features on many process units to quickly help detect a release, contain/control a release, and reduce the consequences of (mitigate) a release.  The safety features listed below are in use in various processes:\n\nRelease Detection\n\nChemical specific detectors with alarms and process interlocks\n\n\nRelease Containment and Control\n\nScrubber to neutralize releases\nAutomatic and manual valves to permit isolation of process components\nAutomated shutdown systems for specific process parameters (e.g., high level, high temperature)\nCurbing or diking to contain releases\nBackup power supply to mitigation systems\n\nRelease mitigation\n\nFire suppression and extinguishing systems\nWater and foam deluge systems\nTrained emergency response personnel  in addition to the local fire department\nPersonal protective equipment\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nPenford has an excellent safety record.  All incidents, including those with the potential to cause any injury or damage, are investigated.  The RMP Program regulations require the reporting of accident histories involving regulated substances that result in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on-site or known deaths, injuries, evacuations, shelter-in-place, propert"

There have been no accidents involving propylene oxide that have resulted in injury or property damage on-site or off-site in the last ten years at this facility. \n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nPenford maintains a written emergency action plan, which is in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment.  The program consists of procedures to notify the Idaho Falls fire department to respond to a release of any hazardous substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  These procedures address evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post-incident cleanup and decontamination requirements.  In addition Penford has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency equipment, as well as instructions that address the use of emergency response equipment.  Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency duties including evacuation.  Penford workers will respond to minor events that do not have the potential for significant effects (e.g., small fires or small leaks).  In the event of a larger fire or release, workers evacuate the area and contact the Idaho Falls Fire Department.\n\nPenford's emergency action plan is updated when necessary based on modifications made to Penford plant processes.  The emergency action plan is managed using ISO-compliant practices to ensure that all changes to the program are readily available and properly updated.\n\nThe overall emergency action plan for Penford is coordinated with the Idaho Falls Fire Department and the Bonneville County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  This coordination includes periodic meetings with the committee, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials, and industry "

      "SummaryText": "representatives.  Penford has been an active member of the committee.  Penford has around the clock communications capability with appropriate emergency response organizations (e.g., fire department) and LEPC officials.  This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.  In addition to periodic LEPC meetings, Penford conducts periodic emergency drills for all facility personnel and has worked with both the LEPC and emergency response organizations on county-wide chemical emergency response training.  Penford involves local responders in refresher training on the hazards of regulated substances in the Penford facility. \n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nPenford constantly strives to improve its safety performance and minimize potential impact on the environment.  Routine audits and inspections, an effective incident investigation procedure, routine PHA's, employee participation, and community involvement all provide input on improvement opportunities.  Some of the improvements currently planned include:\n\nInstallation of a bulk chemical unloading to eliminate manual handling and unloading from multiple cylinders.\nInstallation of a new fire protection system\nInstallation of a new leak detection system\nInstallation of a new computer-based-training (CBT) to facilitate the operator training process\nUpgrades to several piping systems"
