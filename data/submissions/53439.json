This Risk Management Plan summarizes the management, administrative, procedural and tehnological controls that work together to minimize the risk to the community of hazardous chemical releases.\n\nARKEMA POLICIES FOR HEALTH, ENVIRONMENT AND SAFETY\n\nRisk management and safety have een important concerns at Arkema for many years.  The Risk management Plan formalizes and documents thhese activities.  Arkema is committed to conducting its operations in a safe, responsible manner and to reduce risks to health and the environment.  Commitment to health, environment, and safety (HES) starts with the CEO.  Senior management routinely dedicates time to review HES Matters.  Emphasis on safety is carried through to the facility level, where the Plant Mananager and the Safety Committee regularly review safety performance, take corrective actions and strive for continuous improvement.  The success of Arkema's HES programs include policies, procedures, standards, and guidance materials designed to fulfill Arkema's commitment to health, environment and safety.  These materials include Risk Management Program guidance to held our facilities prevent and/or reduce the risk of accidents.  This facility is covered by Title V of the Clean Air Act.\n\nFACILITY IDENTIFICATION AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES IN COVERED PROCESSES\n\nThe Arkema Houston facility is located at 2231 Haden Road, Houston, Texas.  The facility manufactures mercaptans and sulfides.  Certain substances used and produced within the facility are regulaed substances under 40 CFR 68, the EPA Risk management Program (RMP) rule.  Thse substances are present at or above the minimum threshold for RMP applica bility and include:  Carbon Disulfide (CS2) 2,540,000 pounds and Hydrogen Sulfide (H2S) 13,000 pounds.  Carbon Dis"

This program is designed to address the requirements of 29 CFR 1920.119, Process Safety management (PSM) and the EPA Risk Management Program.  This prevention program addresses processes that handle regulatd substances.  The accidental release prevention program includes the following components and activities.\n\nIn depth hazard analyses are completed every five years by qualified personnel usig tecniques approved under the OSHA PSM Standard of 29 CFR 1920.119:  Written operating procedures are used for training and directing the work of oprtors, who receive refresher training every three years;\n\nOperators, mechanics and contractor personnel are qualified trained in the general hazards in the facility, and informed of any temporary situations affecting safety;\n\nA management of change system is in place to ensure that process-oprating changes are managed safely,\n\nCritical equipment is inspected on a planned, periodic basis to ensure proper operating condition,\n\nPre-start up review are performed to ensure that conditions for safe operation have been satisfied piror to starting new or modified equipment,\n\nIncidents are investigated and actions taken as part of a continuous iprovement effort,\n\nRoutine audits are conducted to ensure that safe practices are being followed,\n\nStorage vessels are designed and constructed in accordancw with American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) pressure vessel standads using industry-standrd atrials of construction,\n\nAs part of the echanica Integrity program, pressure vessels and transfer lines are inspected and tested accordingn to the American Petroleum Institute Standards,\n\nThe use of trained"

Management and facility personnel strive for continuing improvements in accident reduction.  The training, qualification standards, and safety awareness of our opeations, maintenance, and emergency response personnel are key elements in reducing and mitigating accidents.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere have been no off-site releases of carbon disulfide or hydrogen sulfide that have resulted in the on-site inuries during the past five years.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nA written Emergency Response plan is maintained at the facility.  The plan was developed in cooperation with civil authorities and was coordinated with the community emergency response plan.\n\nThe emergency response plan includes procedures for notifying civil authorities and the public in the event of an incident.

Chemical exposure risks to employees and the public have  been minimized through ongoing internal risk reduction efforts as well as retulatory requirements.  Planned improvements to the existing safety program include; implementation of behavior based safety and additional accident investigation training.  Additional planned facility improvements include upgrades in the process control systems of a production unit and increases security measures."
