The Waste Water Facility has assembled and maintains appropriate materials in the form of manufacturers\u0012 literature, handbooks, pictures, drawings, etc. to demonstrate clearly the layout of the facility\u0012s potential trouble areas and the equipment which the Sulphur Springs Fire Department may need to work with to alleviate an emergency situation. This material will be used by facility personnel, in a safe area prior to entry into the emergency site, to assist the Sulphur Springs Fire Department in their activities, and to show the outside responders what they need to do to mitigate any potential emergency situation.\n\nPeriodic tours are offered to the Sulphur Springs Fire Department and the Sulphur Springs Office of Emergency Management in order to familiarize their personnel with our facility.

The Sulphur Springs Fire Department or Office of Emergency Management will be in charge of actual response activities.\n\nTHE CITY OF SULPHUR SPRINGS WASTE WATER FACILITY AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nThe primary activity of the City of Sulphur Springs Waste Water Facility is the treatment of the municipal waste water supply. The primary regulated products are chlorine and sulphur dioxide.\n\nTHE WORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO AND THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\nThe chlorine worst-case release scenario is based on a ten minute release of a 2000 pound cylinder. The offsite impact could be up to 1.3 miles from the Waste Water Facility. The number of citizens who might be affected by such a release would depend on the wind speed, direction, and other atmospheric conditions at the time of the release. In the entire 1.3 mile radius around the facility the approximate residential population is 2500 citizens.\n\nThe chlorine alternative release scenario is based on a 200 pound pipe leak release of chlorine which would affect only a radius of 0.10 miles around the facility. This area has no residential population. This type of leak can be mitigated by trained plant employees with minimal exposure.\n\nThe sulphur dioxide worst-case release scenario is based on a ten minute release of a 2000 pound cylinder. The offsite impact could be up to 1.3 miles from the Waste Water Facility.

      "SummaryText": "THE ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICY AT THE CITY OF SULPHUR SPRINGS WASTE WATER FACILITY\n\nThe City of Sulphur Springs Waste Water Facility located at 360 Thomas Road has a comprehensive Emergency Response Policy to be followed in all cases which involve real or potential injury to City personnel, immediate neighbors, nearby residents of the community and/or the environment. The plan concentrates on chemical release emergencies and specifies emergency response procedures to be followed by City of Sulphur Springs employees. These activities include recognition of the emergency; responding in a defensive manner in the protection of life and property; limited control, containment, and confinement activities; and facility evacuation. OSHA HAZWOPER requirements for achieving this capability are detailed. The plan is constructed generally around the requirements given in 29 CFR 1910.120. It is intended primarily for use in connection with a chlorine or sulphur dioxide release, since those are the facility\u0012s most sensitive chemicals from both safety and environmental points of view. This plan is intended for use in conjunction with the Facilities Emergency Action Plan covering evacuation procedures. The Emergency Response Policy is backed up by and is a supplement to Annex Q of the City of Sulphur Springs Emergency Management Plan.\n\nThe facility manager is directly responsible for coordinating the efforts involving this Emergency Response Policy. The facility manager is closely involved with the activities which bear on the facility\u0012s interface with the public and Fire and Emergency Management responders as well. The City Manager has overall accountability for the program. The facility manager and shift supervisors are responsible for directing the activities of the employees involved in emergency responses.\n\nIt is not the intent of the Waste Water Facility to maintain a complete hazardous materials emergency response team.
