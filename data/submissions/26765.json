      "SummaryText": "Carneys Point Generating Plant is operated and managed by PG&E Generating, the competitive electric generation business of San Francisco-based PG&E Corporation.  PG&E Generating operates the Carneys Point facility in strict accordance with stringent policies and protocols designed to protect the health and safety of our employees and neighbors, as well as the environment.  Responsibility for safety and environmental performance at the plant is shared by every employee.  This message is communicated through ongoing training programs designed to raise awareness and build necessary on-the-job skills.  Performance in these areas is regularly evaluated through audits, assessments and other mechanisms, with the goal of measuring progress and identifying areas for continued improvement.\n\nCarneys Point Generating?s approach to chemical safety is to always use the least hazardous chemical available for any application, to use chemicals only in equipment that is designed to handle such chemicals safely, and to train facility personnel in the safe handling of all chemicals onsite.  Carneys Point operates an electric and steam generating facility.  Pulverized coal is burned in two state-of-the-art boilers, and the steam is used to generate electricity.  \n\nAs is the case for many facilities, Carneys Point Generating Plant's participation in the RMP program is triggered by the use of only one substance (ammonia) on-site in quantities that exceed a threshold amount.  At this and other PG&E Generating facilities, ammonia is a key ingredient in the facilities' air pollution control systems.  In both the design and operation of our plants, among the most important priorities is the minimization of air emissions, including nitrogen oxides (NOx).  Nitrogen oxides are a primary contributor to smog.  The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and state regulators have identified NOx emissions reductions as one of the most important keys to achieving national air quality improvement goals. "

      "SummaryText": " In order to help achieve this objective, the Carneys Point facility employs advanced emissions control technology that uses ammonia to reduce nitrogen oxides emissions.  This technology enables the plant to achieve NOx emission rates that are among the lowest for any facility of its kind.\n\nCarneys Point Generating stores ammonia as an aqueous solution, which is safer to handle than anhydrous ammonia.  Aqueous ammonia is stored in a 19,800 gallon storage tank inside a concrete dike.  This dike will limit evaporation of ammonia in the unlikely event of a tank failure.  Carneys Point Generating analyzed several possible release scenarios.  The worst-case release was predicted based on a pipe shear outside the dike, releasing the contents through a pipe outside the dike, and evaporation of ammonia from this liquid spill.  The WAKE model has predicted a \"distance to endpoint\" that does not include any public receptors.  A pipe shear after the aqueous ammonia pumps was reviewed as the alternative release; the \"distance to endpoint\" is within the property boundaries.  \n\nThe aqueous ammonia system has had no spills and no accidents.  Significant releases of aqueous ammonia are very unlikely because any loss of aqueous ammonia flow would instantly cause an alarm in the control room, where trained operators would take immediate action to correct the problem.  All aqueous ammonia deliveries are supervised, and only trained personnel are allowed near the ammonia system.\n\nCarneys Point Generating has an Emergency Response Plan which is coordinated with the Carneys Point Township Office of Emergency Management.  Workers undergo annual hazardous materials safety training and emergency response training, as well as regular emergency drills.\n\nImportantly, even under the worst-case scenario, the impact of an accidental ammonia release on-site would not reach any public receptors.  Within the fence, the risks to our employees are minimized through ongoing skills and awareness trainin"

      "SummaryText": "g.\n\nCarneys Point Generating Plant is pleased to share the information in this document.  As the operators of this facility, PG&E Generating takes seriously its commitment to accident prevention and effective emergency response. While no industrial site is entirely free from risk, it is our goal, through continuous improvement, to manage risks as effectively as possible.  This plan demonstrates that the company has the programs in place both to minimize the possibility of a release and to respond to one in the unlikely event that it occurs."
