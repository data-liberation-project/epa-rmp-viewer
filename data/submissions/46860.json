(GPRI), a wholly owned subsidiary of Georgia-Pacific Corporation, owns and operates a synthetic resin manufacturing facility in Eugene, Oregon, which is referenced as the ?plant? throughout the remainder of the document. The facility is located on 2665 Highway 99 North.  The resin plant that was originally constructed in 1960 and purchase by Georgia-Pacific in 1981. The resin process contains raw material tanks, the process equipment, and finished product tanks.  Overall, the facility employs 32 full-time employees.\n\nGPRI is committed to operating the plant in a manner that is safe for its workers, the public, and the environment.  As part of this commitment, GPRI has established a system to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility.  One component of this system is a risk management program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at the plant and that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency?s (EPA's) regulation 40 CFR part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule).  One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit a risk management plan (RMP Plan) describing the risk management program at the plant. This document is intended to satisfy the RMP Plan requirement of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program at the plant.\n\nThe risk management program at the Plant consists of the following three elements:\n\n- a hazard assessment to help understand (a) the potential offsite consequences of hypothetical accidental releases and (b) accidents that have occurred during the last five years associated with the use of substances regulated by the RMP rule (regulated substances).\n- a prevention program to help maintain and safely operate the processes containing more than a threshold quantity of a regulated substance (covered processes).\n-  an emergency response program to help respond to accidental releases of reg"

In fact, the Plant has a comprehensive safety program in place establishing many levels of safeguards against release of a hazardous substance and injuries and damage from a release of a hazardous substance.\n\nGPRI limits the use of hazardous substances.  Before using a hazardous substance at the Plant, less hazardous alternatives are considered. When a hazardous substance is used at the Plant, GPRI considers the potential for this substance to adversely affect plant workers, the public, and the environment and takes steps to prevent any such effects.\n\nGPRI prevents releases of the hazardous substances used at the facility.  When a hazardous substance is used at the Plant, the equipment is carefully designed, built and operated to reduce the likelihood of an accidental release. Industry and government standards are closely adhered to in the design, construction, and operation of the equipment. \n\nGPRI limits damage from a release, if such a release occurs.  GPRI trains its workers to respond to an accidental release, reducing the consequences of a release if it occurs.  In addition, GPRI works with the local fire department to help prevent injuries and/or environmental damage if a release does occur.\n\nThe safety program at the Plant consists of a number of elements, only some of which are required by the RMP rule. This RMP Plan is primarily intended to describe those parts of the safety program at the Plant that are required by the RMP rule.\n\n\n1.1  Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nGPRI is committed to the safety of workers and the public, and the preservation of the environment, through the prevention of accidental releases of"

These controls include training programs for personnel, programs to help ensure safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of processes at the Plant; and programs to evaluate the hazards at the plant.\n\nIn the event of an accidental release, the Plant controls and contains the release in a manner that will be safe for workers and will prevent injury to the public and the environment.  GPRI provides response training to its personnel, designates an emergency response coordinator to oversee response activities, and coordinates response efforts with the local fire department.  Response activities have also been discussed with the local fire department.  In order to effectively implement these policies, GPRI established a management system headed by the Safety Manager to oversee safety-related activities.\n\n\n1.2  Regulated Substances\n\nThe plant handles two (2) federally regulated substances in sufficient quantity to be covered by the RMP rule; Formaldehyde Solution and Epichlorohydrin.\n\n\n1.3  Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nSince 1982, the Plant has used a prevention program to help prevent accidental releases of hazardous substances.  Beginning in 1992, the plant formalized this prevention program for the formaldehyde manufacturing and storage process to comply with the 14 elements of the OSHA process safety management (PSM) prevention program. RMP program elements were incorporated into the PSM program prior to 1999.  The EPA RMP rule established two levels of prevention requirements:  \n\nProgram 3?essentially the same as OSHA PSM, except that the program also focuses on protecting the public and the environment\n\nProgram 2?requires simplified versions of 7 of the 12 elements of the Program 3 prevention program (not applicable for Plant)\n\nThe following sections briefly describe the elements "
