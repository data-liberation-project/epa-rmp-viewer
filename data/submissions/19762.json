      "SummaryText": "At this wastewater treatement plant , we handle chlorine which is considered  hazardous by the EPA. The use of chlorine as a disinfectant; inactivates potential pathogens found in human waste in the sewer waste stream, this inactivation assures that receiving waters are clean when returned to the environment. The same properties that make chlorine an invaluable source in protecting human health and the environment make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions when handling chlorine. The safety precautions must be taken to prevent unnecessary human exposure , to reduce the threat to our own personal health as well as the health of our co workers and to reduce the threat to nearby members of the community. It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and state rules and regulations , safety depends upon the manner in which we handle chlorine, the safety practices inherent to the design of this facility , the safe handling procedures that we use and the training of our employees. Our emergency response plan is based on the EPA's model for WWTP plants  and the Chlorine Institues Pamphlet  #64 Response Plans for Chlorine Facilities. The Emergency Response Plan includes notification of ( 911 ) MIssion Fire Department HAZ-MAT response protocol/SOP's . The Mission Fire Department is the primary first responder in all chemical spills or releases in the City of Mission, Texas. The primary purpose of this facility is  to treat wastewater and releasing a clean water that meets or exceeds EPA standards. Chlorine is delivered by the vendor in DOT approved ton containers on a flat bed trailer equipped with a hydraulically operated unloading device. The inventory chlorine stored at this facility is 10,000 pounds. The worst case release scenario of a one ton conatainer is 2,000 pounds in 10 minutes . It is assumed that the contents would be released as a vapor, which is heavier than air. The distance to the end point of .0087 mg/l ( 3ppm) would be 0.9 miles or less"

      "SummaryText": "than 1 mile as determined by the EPA RMP COMP model. An alternative scenario of a hole in gas feed line  would release 105 pounds of chlorine in 10 minutes . The end point of .0087 ( 3ppm ) would extend 0.1 miles as determined by the EPA RMP COMP model. This facility complies with the EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations. The handling of chlorine in this facility is in accordance with recommendations from the Chlorine Institutes Chlorine Manual and pamphlet #'s 6,63,64,65,73,74,89,151,and 162. We have not had any accidental releases or incidents in the last five years. This facility was constructed in 1952 and has been refurbished in subsequent years to meet Standard Building Code Standards as well as design engineering for chemcial applications. We will continue to improve our operations by incorporating new ideas and principles in responsible safety and care."
