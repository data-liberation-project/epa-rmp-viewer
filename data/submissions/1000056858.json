We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public as well as protection of the environment.  This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including:\n\n\n\n *  A description of our facility and use of substances regulated by EPA's RMP regulation\n\n *  An overview of our accidental release prevention programs\n\n *  A five-year accident history for accidental releases of chemicals regulated by EPA's RMP rule\n\n *  An overview of our emergency response program\n\n *  An overview of planned improvements at the facility to help prevent accidental chemical releases from occurring and adversely affecting our employees, the public, and the environment\n\n *  The certifications required by EPA's RMP rule\n\n *  The detailed information (called data elements) about our risk management program\n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n\n\nOur facility produces para-aminophenol and acetaminophen using a variety of chemicals and processing operations.  Acetaminophen is a pain-relief medication for use by the pharmaceutical industry.  In our processes, we use the following chemicals that EPA has identified as having the potential to cause off-site consequences in the event of a substantial accidental release:\n\n\n\nToxics\n\n\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia:  Anhydrous Ammonia is used as a neutralizer for an acidic phase in one of our process steps for manufacturing para-aminophenol.
