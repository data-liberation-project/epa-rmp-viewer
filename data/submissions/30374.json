      "SummaryText": "The Supervalu - St.  Louis Distribution facility is a grocery warehousing operation located in the metropolitan St.  Louis area near Lambert Airport.  The facility employs approximately 700 persons on three shifts.  Normal operations are five days per week, with infrequent weekend operations.\n\nThe covered process at this facility is an ammonia-based mechanical refrigeration system which contains a maximum intended inventory of 26,000 pounds. The system was installed in 1998.\n\nThe facility has an active Process Safety Management Program.  Operation of the ammonia equipment is restricted to only a select few trained, authorized operating/maintenance personnel. The majority of the distribution piping which contains ammonia, and connects to air cooling evaporator units and process equipment, is located above the roof of the warehouse freezer and cooler areas, and therefore not very susceptible to damage from accidental, inadvertent contact by lift trucks and lifted loads.   The significant investment associated with the pre-planning for safety is an example of the commitment of management to identifying critical safety control points and improving the process accordingly.\n\nAn OSHA-prescribed Process Safety Management Program has been adopted for this facility.  Under that Program, the major components of the process are inspected frequently.  Operating conditions are constantly monitored by a computerized system with integral alarms that notify process operators of an upset.  The automatic leak detection devices alert persons in the constantly-inhabited areas where ammonia-containing equipment is located that even the slightest release may have occurred.  As stated above, the company has located principal piping and many key shutoff valves on the roof area for easier access in emergency conditions.  Shutoff valves which allow operators to isolate sections of piping/equipment in compressor room areas are readily accessed.  The compressor room area is well vented with hig"

The ammonia leak detection devices in the compressor room automatically start the ventilation system and also communicate directly to a supervised alarm system.\n\nAs a testimony to the overall safety of the ammonia refrigeration at this facility, and the diligence of the process operators, no accidents have occurred within the past five years which have necessitated an off-site evacuation or have had any offsite consequences.\n\nThe St.  Louis County LEPC has included the Supervalu facility in the community emergency plan.  The facility's relationship with the LEPC includes infrequent interactive exercises and regular dialogue regarding the process. The Hazelwood and Berkeley Fire Departments maintain  HAZMAT squads, and have mutual aid agreements in place with nearby municipalities for the provision of those services in the event of an accidental release which requries external intervention or assistance.   Supervalu - St.  Louis has adopted the INTEGRATED CONTINGENCY PLAN format preferred by EPA and OSHA for preparing and implementing its onsite Emergency Action and Response Plan.   Under this plan, emergency training and practice drills will be frequent and will cover a multitude of potential scenarios.  Three key managers will become involved immediately upon the recognition and characterization of all non-incidental ammonia releases, and their duties will be as follows:  (a) coordination of and direction to onsite and external emergency responders; (b) notification of agencies and on-site safety and security; (c) protection and continuation of business operations and employee welfare; and (d) communication with the public as necessary."
