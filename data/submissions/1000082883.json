This\n\ncommitment is inherent in its comprehensive accidental release prevention program in place that covers areas\n\nsuch as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the\n\nprocesses at our facility. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of\n\nregulated substances. If such a release does occur, our highly trained emergency response personnel are at\n\nhand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.\n\n\n\n2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nOur facility's primary activities encompass Cheese Manufacturing. The plant is located at 490 F Street in Lemoore, California. We have one RMP-regulated substance, Ammonia, at our facility, which is used to\n\nprovide refrigeration for the manufacturing of cheese. The maximum inventory of Ammonia at our facility is approximately 34,000 lbs.\n\n\n\n3. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set\n\nout under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA. The ammonia refrigeration system is also subject to the OSHA PSM\n\nstandard under 29 CFR 1910.119. Our facility is also subject to EPCRA Section 302 notification requirements.\n\nThe following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our\n\nstationary source.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\n\n\nLeprino Foods Company maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards,\n\noperating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\n\n\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are\n\nidentified and controlled effi"

These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial\n\nstartup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal\n\nshutdown and startup after a turnaround. The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to\n\noperators involved in the processes.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\n\n\nLeprino Foods Company has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are\n\noperating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with those processes. Refresher\n\ntraining is provided at least every three years and more frequently if needed. All training will be documented\n\nand validated by employees on the LFC Training Tracking System as well as in APSM.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\n\n\nLeprino Foods Company carries out documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper\n\noperations. Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure vessels, storage\n\ntanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.\n\nMaintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.\n\nFurthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.
