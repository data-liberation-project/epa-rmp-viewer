Note that final onsite damages are still being assessed. The value provided is the amount of onsite damage that 99 Cent Only Stores has experienced to date.  Regarding the shelter in place number, this was initiated by Harris County. The number provided is an estimate based on the area of the order using current census data.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nIn 2022-2023, the system underwent and is still in the process of a major system upgrade. The upgrade included but is not limited to upgraded computer control system, additional ammonia detection capabilities, increased exhaust system and upgraded pressure relief system. Ongoing improvements are made based on PSM required inspection and audits, including the PHA, three-year compliance audit, and independent mechanical integrity inspections."

Ammonia is the only regulated substance used at this facility.  Note that in December 2021, 99 Cent Only Stores sold the building to a new owner (Katy Mission LLC). 99 Cent Only is now the majority tenant. Note that the number of employees represents 99 Cent employees only as there are other tenants in the building and we do not have access to that information.  The owner is responsible for replacing the refrigeration system in the cold storage portion of the warehouse.  \n\nACCENDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION\n\nReleases are prevented by a combination of engineering and administrative controls.  Engineering controls include automated system shutdown when safe parameters are exceeded.  Administrative controls involve manual isolation and shutdown procedures to be performed by trained personnel.  The system is also equipped with pressure relief valves that operate to prevent damage to system components should pressures reach unsafe levels.  Operation of pressure relief valves will result in a controlled release of refrigerant.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThis facility has developed a prevention program which complies with the requirements of OSHA CFR 29, 1910.119, Process Safety Management.  This program includes procedures, training, and proactive maintenance measures to keep the system operating without catastrophic release.\n\nEMERGENCY ACTION PLAN\n\nThe Emergency Action Plan for this facility calls for the immediate evacuation or shelter in place as determined necessary for the particular event.  A third party response contractor is notified of an uncontrolled release event.  The local fire department has been included in t"
