      "SummaryText": "Evans CA LLC operates a controlled atmosphere fruit storage facility warehouse in the small community of Cowiche, Washington. The facility typically is loaded during the autumn over a several week period, then the fruit is held in storage for several months. The last room may be held till close to the next fruit-loading season. A refrigeration operator checks the operation of the system several times a week while continuous monitoring and alarming is done by the facility computer control system.\r\n\r\nAmmonia is used as the refrigerant in the system. Ammonia is a colorless gas with a pungent odor that is irritating to the eyes, nose and throat. It is present as both a liquid under pressure and as a vapor in the system.\r\n\r\nTo maintain a safe facility operation, Evans CA LLC has developed an emergency action plan that provides instructions to all employees of what actions to take if an ammonia release is detected.  All refrigerated areas in the facility are monitored by an ammonia detection system, which will automatically shut down and pump out any alarming area. Any alarm would also be sent to the refrigeration operator by a dial up modem. Also, the computer system will notify the refrigeration operator on any alarming or out of normal condition in the system (temperatures/pressures). All employees at the facility receive annual training on the emergency action plan.\r\n\r\nThe facility has complied with both State and Federal regulations regarding ammonia used as a refrigerant and has in place both the OSHA's Process Safety Management standard (PSM)(29 CFR 1910.119) and EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP)(40 CFR, Part 68). These programs are readily available to on-site personnel to help in maintaining a safe operating facility. As required by RMP, an Off-site Consequence Analysis has been done for the facility to determine what impact the Worse Case and the more realistic Alternate Case releases of ammonia would have to the surrounding area.\r\n\r\nTo deal with any possible"

In the event of a significant accident, the fire department is about five minutes away; response from Yakima (owner, refrigeration contractors) is about 20 minutes. Ammonia cartridge masks are available onsite. In the event of a large release, the Yakima HazMat team would likely respond to the site. In such cases, it is not expected or intended that persons would attempt to enter the facility until properly trained personnel with the appropriate PPE arrive."
