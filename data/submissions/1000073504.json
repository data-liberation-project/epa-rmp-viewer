This PSI assists the employee operators and outside contractors in understanding the ammonia refrigeration system so they can operate and maintain the ammonia refrigeration system in a safe efficient manner. PSI is available to all employees.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis:\n\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our process are identified and controlled efficiently. The methodology used to carry out these analyses is the What if/Checklist Study. The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of every five years. The process hazard analysis is also revalidated when there is an extensive change in the process. Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures:\n\nAmericold Roanoke maintains written operating procedures. These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial start-up, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown, and start-up after a turnaround. The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the process.\n\n\n\nTraining:\n\nAmericold Roanoke has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes. New employees involved in the process receive basic training in process operations, followed by on-the-job supervision until they are deemed competent to work independently. Refresher training is provided at least every 3 years and more frequently as needed.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity:\n\nAmericold Roanoke carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operation. Process equipment examined by these checks includes pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping system, relief and vent systems, emergency"
