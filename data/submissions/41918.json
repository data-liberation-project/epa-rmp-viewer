This facility satisfies the definition of a program 3 facility as found in 40 CRR Part 68.10(d), and is therefore required to generate and maintain an appropriate RMP.  Plains LPG Services, L.P. (Plains) and its affiliated limited partnerships adhere to high standards of environmetnal quality and are committed to operating our facilitties in a manner that will protect the health and safety of its employees, the communities surrounding our facilities, and the environment.  The emergency response policty of Plains is to establish, maintain, and implement emergency repsonse procedures when necessary with the prime objective of protecting the safety and health of our employees and the public, and to mitigate the the greatest possible extent the impact to the environment.  The safety of emergency and other personnel is the highest priorityin any emergency event.  Only after life, safety , and environmental concerns are addressed will the seondary issues of property preservation and business recovery be addressed.  This facility is located at 6012 Alden Nash Avenue, Kent County, Michigan, 49302, in an industrial area near Alto, Michigan.  The facility is fenced and contains three (3) 30,000 gallon propane storage vessels with a maximum working volume of 25,500 gallons, one (1) propane storage vessel of 10,000 gallons (used for plant operations), one (1) 30,000 gallon butane storage vessel (also with a maximum working storage capacity of 25,500), a pump, compressor, meter and associated piping and valves, and a total underground cavern storage capacity of 38,000,000 gallons of propane and 10,000,000 gallons of butane.  The regulated substances at Alto Terminal at this time include propane and butane only.  Plains performed an off site consequence analysis using RMP Comp, assuming a worst case scenario of a catastrophic release of the content"

      "SummaryText": "s of one of the 30,000 gallon storage vessels.  A second or alternate scenario consisting of a pull away or \"drive off\" was also considered.  In the alternate scenario the release volume was limited to the volume of the piping and hoses.  This was considered our most likely release scenario.  Under the worst case scenario, the estimated distance to the 1 psi overpressure point was 0.4 miles (2112 feet) and for the alternate scenario, the estimated distance to the 1 psi overpressure point was 0.1 miles.  The nearest public receptor to the facility is to the immediate east, approximately 1,000 feet from the storage vessels.  There are no desingated environmental receptors near the facility.  Plains has developed written emergency response procedures to address all elements that may be encountered during the planning or response phase of an expected emergency.  The emergency response procedures are designed to comply with OSHA's required standard as found at 29 CFR Part 1910.38, and the emergency response element of Process Safety Management.  Specific elements of these procedures are addressed in the Plains Emergnecy Response Plan (found in the RMP).  Plains does not staff a standing or volunteer Emergency Response Team for this facility.  Rather, Plains depends upon local response authorities to conduct an appropriate response to the type of emergencies that might possibly occur at the Terminal.  Plains staff will take quick and defensive measures without jeapordizing our personnel.  Those measures are listed in the Emergency Response Plan."
