The emergency response plans are tailored to each \nfacility owned and operated by the Borough of Huntingdon. The Borough employs the latest \ntechnology in process controls and monitoring detection systems. Active and passive mitigation \nsystems are designed to minimize the impacts of any accidental releases of regulated substances.\n\nThe Huntingdon Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP), owned and operated by the Borough of \nHuntingdon, provides sewer service to residential, commercial and industrial users in the \nBorough of Huntingdon and in portions of Smithfield and Walker Townships. The Huntingdon \nWWTP utilizes one (1) chemical onsite which is subject to the Chemical Accident Prevention \nprovisions found at 40 CFR Part 68. This toxic substance is Chlorine. Chlorine is used for \ndisinfection of the treated effluent prior to discharge to the Juniata River. \n\nTypically, there are two (2) one-ton cylinders of Chlorine present onsite at any given time. These \ncylinders are located in a brick chemical storage building. The room containing the cylinders \nvents to the outside. The chlorination feed system has manual shutoffs. A remote alarm system is \nemployed to notify employees of any releases of chlorine gas. Safety equipment is located \nnearby. The facility is manned 8 hours per day, five days per week. Gates to the facility are \nlocked when personnel are not on duty, therefore, the chlorination building is not accessible to \nthe public. \n\nThe offsite consequence analysis conducted for the Huntingdon WWTP consisted of two \nscenarios, worst-case release and alternative release. The parameters for the worst-case release \nscenario are establi"

These parameters assume the maximum quantity in the largest \nvessel is released over a 10-minute period with default wind speed, temperature and humidity \nconditions. The only passive mitigation present at the Huntingdon WWTP is the fact that the \nchlorine cylinders are stored in a building which vents to the outside air. Using EPAA?s \nRMP*Comp model, the estimated distance to the toxic endpoint for a worst-case release is 0.9 \nmiles. According to LandView 6 software, the estimated residential population within the 0.9 \nmile radius of the facility is 1,108 persons based on 2000 U.S. census data. Other than the \nresidential population, there are a few commercial establishments, a church, a county prison, and \na recreational area located within this measured radius.\n\nThe proposed alternative release scenario assumes a release will occur due to equipment failure. \nThe assumed parameters used in the RMP*Comp model are based on an actual incident that \noccurred in 1997. The estimated distance to the toxic endpoint for an alternative release is less \nthan 0.1 miles. According to LandView 6 software, the estimated residential population within \nthe 0.1 mile radius of the facility is 0 persons based on 2000 U.S. census data. \n\nA prevention program policy document was developed for the Huntingdon WWTP in accordance \nwith regulations found at 40 CFR A?A?68.48-68.60. The facility is classified as a Program 2 \nfacility. Huntingdon WWTPA?s Program 2 Prevention Program summarizes the pertinent safety \ninformation, hazard review procedures, operating procedures, training requirements, maintenance \nprocedures, compliance audits and incident investigation policies. \n\nThe facility has standard operating procedures (SOPs) in effect for operation and maintenance of \nthe chlorination system. These SOPs are readily accessible to the chlorine building. Safety \nprecautions include, checking the chlorine detector before entering the cylinder room, use of a \nface mask and other "

Other training plant employees are offered include: confined space entry, first aid and \nCPR. Documentation of the training events for each employee is maintained in the employeesA? \npersonnel file.\n\nThe Huntingdon WWTP has an Offsite Response Plan which has been coordinated through the \nHuntingdon County LEPC. The Plan provides notification procedures, emergency response \nprocedures, reporting requirements, and coordination efforts of all involved parties. The plan is \nreviewed and revised periodically to ensure contact names and telephone numbers are correct."
