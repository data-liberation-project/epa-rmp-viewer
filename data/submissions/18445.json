('68.155(a) ).\n\nCrider Poultry, Inc. prevents accidental releases of ammonia through on the job training of refrigeration personnel and ongoing inspection and maintenance of the refrigeration system.  Refrigeration system components are located in areas that are not as likely to become damaged (i.e., tanks placed away and protected from forklift and truck traffic).\n\n2.0  Source and regulated substances handled ('68.155(b)).\n\nApproximately 16,500 lbs. of anhydrous ammonia is contained within the Old (original) Refrigeration System and approximately 11,500 lbs. of anhydrous ammonia is contained in the New Refrigeration System on site at Crider Poultry, Inc.  The EPA requires a Risk Management Plan be developed and maintained when the total amount of anhydrous ammonia exceeds the threshold quantity of 10,000 lbs.  No other substances, in quantities subject to EPA RMP certification requirements, are located at the Crider Poultry, Inc. facility.\n\n3.0  Ammonia Worst Case and Alternate Case Release Scenarios ('68.155(c)).\n\n3.1  Worst Case Scenario (WCS)\n\n3.1.1  The new high pressure receiver (installed in June 1999), located outside the New Equipment Room, contains the largest quantity of anhydrous ammonia, on site, on a predictable worst case basis.  This tank is typically 15 to 30% full during normal operations.  During plant shutdown or partial operations, this tank holds approximately 10,600 lbs. of anhydrous ammonia when 50% full, under an internal pressure and temperature of approximately 114 psig and 70 0F.  The Worst Case Scenario as required by EPA, assumes that the tank's contents are fully released as a gas/vapor over a 10-minute period.\n\n3.1.2  The dispersion model, Degadis, predicted, with a wind speed of 3 mph and atmospheric stability class F, the anhydrous ammonia release may travel 2"

Approximately 220 people, in the surrounding community, according to Landview Census data, reside within the radius to the toxic endpoint (level of concern = 200 ppm, anhydrous ammonia).  There are residences, one school, and one church within the radius to the toxic endpoint.  (See: Section 9.0)  There are no environmental receptors within the radius to the toxic endpoint. \n\n3.2  Alternate Case Scenario (ACS)\n\n3.2.1  The Alternate Case, more likely, Release Scenario for Crider Poultry, Inc. was selected to involve a relief valve release on a condenser located above the New Equipment Room.  Anhydrous ammonia (at approximately 150 psi and 77 0F) was estimated to have a flow rate from the relief valve (inner orifice diameter: 0.75 inches) of approximately 71 lbs./min., determined from an ammonia gas release table.  It is estimated that the relief valve could be isolated, or the overpressure condition corrected, in approximately 10 minutes by trained operators on site, with a corresponding anhydrous ammonia quantity released of approximately 710 lbs.\n\n3.2.2  The air dispersion model, Degadis, predicted, with a wind speed of 6 mph and atmospheric stability class D, that the anhydrous ammonia release may travel approximately 0.18 miles.  Approximately 5 people, in the surrounding community, according to Landview Census data, reside within the radius to the toxic endpoint (level of concern = 200 ppm, anhydrous ammonia).  There are no other public or environmental receptors within the radius to the toxic endpoint.\n\n4.0  Accidental release prevention program ('68.155(d)).\n\nCrider Poultry, Inc. performs daily monitoring and inspection of the anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system.  System modifications and repairs are made by qualified contracted services personnel, in accordance with OSHA and IIAR  guidelines.

The Stillmore Fire Department can perform rescue and evacuations during a hazardous material spill or release, but do not have HAZMAT trained personnel.  In the event that HAZMAT response was required, a HAZMAT contractor would be called in.  \n\n6.2  Red Cross shelter resources in the Stillmore area consist of pre-arranged service agreements with the local school board and some local churches.  Schools and churches that would serve as a Red Cross shelter would have food, cots, and first aid supplies on site and reserve supplies would be shipped in.  An authority official (HAZMAT Team, Fire Department, Police Department, etc.) would decide if sheltering in place or evacuation and sheltering is required in a given emergency.  They would then contact the Red Cross to activate the shelter(s) determined to be located at a safe distance from the hot area.  Those in need of medical attention would be taken to a nearby hospital.
