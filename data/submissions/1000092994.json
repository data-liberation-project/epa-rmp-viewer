(ORM)\r\nLONESOME CREEK GAS PLANT\r\n\r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICIES\r\n\r\nThe Lonesome Creek Gas Plant (Facility) has a commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, gas plant trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.  ONEOK Rockies Midstream (ORM) believes in maintaining a safe working environment for all employees. Our equipment and personnel reflect this belief, and our prime objective is to ensure the personal safety of every employee on the jobsite and to safe guard company property through preventative measures.  Employees of ORM are expected to be familiar with all company safety policies. Through continuing education, in-house training and management support, we will provide a safe and professional working environment for our employees as well as those whose lives and safety have been entrusted to us.\r\n\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\r\n\r\nThe Lonesome Creek Gas Plant, located near Watford City, North Dakota, uses mechanical refrigeration, cryogenic extraction and fractionation to process wellhead gas into marketable natural gas and natural gas liquids (NGL).  As a result of this operation, several EPA regulated flammable substances are processed, recovered, and stored at the Facility (e.g., methane, ethane, propane, butane, pentane, gas condensate).  The Facility does not use or store any regulated toxic substances above the EPA set threshold levels.\r\n\r\n\r\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS RESULTS\r\n\r\nThe worst-case scenario (WCS) associated with a release of flammable substances in Program Level 3 processes at the Facility i"

The following is a description of existing safety features applicable to prevention of accidental releases of regulated substances in the Facility.\r\n\r\n \r\nUniversal Prevention Activities\r\nThe accidental release prevention program summarized previously is applied to all RMP-covered processes at the Lonesome Creek Gas Plant.  Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human errors.\r\n\r\nSpecialized Safety Features\r\nThe Lonesome Creek Gas Plant has safety features on many units to help (1) contain/control a release, (2) quickly detect a release, and (3) reduce the consequences of (mitigate) a release.  The following types of safety features are used in the covered processes:\r\n\u00bf\t  Release Detection\r\n\u00bf\t  Daily Operator Inspection\r\n\u00bf\t  Monthly Valve, Seal, and Flange Inspections\r\n\u00bf\t  Release Containment/Control\r\n\u00bf\t  Process Relief Valves that prevent vessel over pressurization\r\n\u00bf\t  Valves to Permit Isolation of the Process (manual and automated)\r\n\u00bf\t  Automated Shutdown Systems for Specific Process Parameters (e.g., high temperature)\r\n\u00bf\t  Curbing or Diking to Contain Liquid Releases\r\n\u00bf\t  Redundant Equipment and Instrumentation (e.g., emergency power supply, backup pumps, etc.)\r\n\u00bf\t  Release Mitigation, and\r\n\u00bf\t  Personal Protective Equipment (e.g., hard hat, safety glasses, protective clothing, FR clothing, etc.).\r\n\r\n\r\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nThe Lonesome Creek Gas Plant is a new Linde plant, desi"

The plan consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address or reference all aspects of emergency response, including proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post incident cleanup and decontamination requirements.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the Plant has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response.  Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties, and participate in annual plant emergency drills to ensure emergency shutdown system (ESD) integrity and reinforce proper employee response.  The emergency response plan is updated when necessary based on modifications made to gas plant process or other ORM facilities.  The emergency response program changes are administered through the MOC process, which includes informing and/or training affected personnel in the changes.  The overall emergency response plan for the Lonesome Creek Gas Plant is coordinated with the McKenzie County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) which is responsible for preparing the community's emergency response plan.  The local responders for plant emergencies are the Alexander Volunteer Fire Department and the McKenzie County Sheriff's Department.  The Lonesome Creek Gas Plant has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organization (e.g.,"

Safety training will be continued for all employees."
