The\r\nhazard assessment discusses off-site consequences for a Worst Case Scenario (WCS) and Alternative\r\nRelease Scenario (ARS) of the regulated substances(s) at this Facility. From the subsequent analyses\r\nof the scenario(s), accident prevention programs will be reviewed, revised, and implemented.\r\nEmergency response programs will also be reviewed/enhanced in an effort to minimize the impact of\r\nthe potential consequences resulting from an accidental release of regulated substances in the covered\r\nprocess.\r\nThere are two primary purposes of the development of the Section 112(r) regulations, paraphrasing the\r\nintents of the U.S. Congress and EPA:\r\n1. To encourage sources to reduce the probability and severity of accidental releases\r\nhaving the potential to cause harm to the public and the environment\r\n2.

Therefore, EPA's RMP applies. Toxic (ammonia) is\r\nthe only substances in the Facility's current chemical usage inventory, which would be present in\r\nquantities above the TQ limits set by the EPA, triggering the requirement for submitting this RMP.\r\nProgram Level Determination\r\nDetermining which program level the Facility is subject to within the RMP Guidelines requires\r\ndevelopment of a WCS and/or Off-site Consequence Analysis (OCA) and a review of the Facility's\r\naccident history with respect to the covered process for the previous five years.\r\nCalgren Renewable Fuels is not eligible for Program 1 because the distance to hazardous endpoint\r\nderived in the WCS includes public receptors.
