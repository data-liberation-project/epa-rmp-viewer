The release was 700 pounds. This release resulted in one employee being exposed to the release.  On Monday, February 19,2001 an MBS Operator experienced a significant injury resulting from chemical exposure that required transport to Bayshore Hospital Emergency Room. This incdent was recordable per OSHA record keeping guidelines (29 CFR Part 1904) and was placed on the site OSHA 200 log.                                                                                                                                            \nA.  Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies:\nIn this facility, we handle Butadiene, Acrylonitrile and IsoButane that are considered hazardous by EPA. It is very necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling these chemicals to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to our own personal health as well as our co-workers, and to reduce the threat to nearby members of the community. It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and state rules and regulations. Safety depends on the manner in which we handle these chemicals combined with the safety devices inherent in the design of this facility as well as the safe handling procedures that we use and the training of our personnel.\n\nThe emergency response plan includes procedures for notification of facility personnel, including emergency response personnel, the local CIMA (Channels Industry Mutual Aid) agency, CAER (Community Awareness Emergency Response) & LEPC (Local Emergency Planning Committee). Also included in the emergency response plan are evacuation routes, and the duties and responsibilities of plant personn"

The primary purpose of Butadiene and Acrylonitrile is they are raw materials to create a polymer, which are blended with plastics such as PVC for impact improvement as well as applications for window frames and siding. IsoButane is used to expand Polypropylene and Polyethylene beads, which are used in molding applications. This facility has equipment for unloading tank trucks into storage vessels. Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel and authorized contractors.\n? The regulated substance handled at this facility is Butadiene, IsoButane and Acrylonitrile.\n\nThe maximum amount of Butadiene that can be stored in a vessel is 301,000 pounds.\nThe maximum amount of Acrylonitrile that can be stored in a vessel is 132,000 pounds.\nThe maximum amount of IsoButane that can be stored in a vessel is 56,400 pounds."
