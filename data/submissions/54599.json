This Plan will be reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations, as well as to incorporate any facility changes.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE \n\nConstruction of the ammonia refrigeration system at US Foodservice was completed in 1995 with expansions occurring in 2001 and 2005-2006. The facility is located at 15155 Northam Street, La Mirada, California 90638. The system was constructed in accordance with all applicable federal, state, and local regulations including the Uniform Fire and Mechanical Codes. The US Foodservice facility receives and distributes food and food products to local vendors. The ammonia refrigeration system uses 22,000 pounds of ammonia for dock operations, warehouse cold storage, and freezer storage. The majority of the system is located in the ammonia engine room including vessels and compressors. The condensers are mounted on the engine room roof, and all of the evaporators are located in their respective cold storage rooms/areas. \n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS \n\nThe US Foodservice ammonia refrigeration system has many safety features. Much of the safety of the system is inherent in the policies and procedures that govern the operation of the system. For example, the US Foodservice facility operates in accordance with OSHA's Process Safety Management regulation. \n\nThe US Foodservice facility including the ammonia system was designed and constructed in accordance with the Uniform Mechanical Code which specifically outlines requirements for the safe operation of the ammonia refrigeration system. These safety features include a water diffusion tank, ammonia sensors in the machine room as well as sensors in selected cold storage areas, and automatic shut down systems. In addition, the majority of the ammonia is maintained inside the engine room and just outside of the ma"

The contractor makes routine visits to the facility to ensure the integrity of the ammonia equipment is kept up.\n\nIn addition, the facility uses a professional refrigeration service contractor to assist in maintaining and repairing as necessary the ammonia system.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY \n\nThere have been no significant releases at the facility over the past five years (May 2004 \u00bf May 2009) of ammonia that exceeded the Federal Reportable Quantity of 100 pounds or the state requirement mandating immediate reporting of any release or threatened release of a hazardous material.  In addition, there have been no injuries resulting from an ammonia release, nor any releases or \u00bfnear misses\u00bf that warranted an internal incident investigation.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM \n\nThe US Foodservice has an emergency action plan in effect at the facility.  The Emergency Evacuation and Action Plan (Plan) is detailed in the PSM/RMP document maintained at the facility.  This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n  1.)

The most recent study conducted was in April 2009 where the status of previous recommendations was reviewed with most action items being determined to be complete.  The Revalidation study recrommendations are scheduled to be complete by April 2010.  \n\nIn addition, the facility is planning to complete several items over the next year as their continued effort to provide a safe work environment for US Foodservice employees in La Mirada, California.
