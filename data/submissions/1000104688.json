Releases are prevented by a combination of engineering and administrative controls.  Administrative controls involve manual isolation and shutdown procedures to be performed by trained personnel.  The system is also equipped with pressure relief valves that operate to prevent damage to system components should pressure reach unsafe levels.  Operation of pressure relief valves will result in a controlled release of refrigerant.\r\n\r\nFacility and Regulated Substance Handled\r\nBecause of the nature of ice-cream based products, the manufacturing process at Ben & Jerry's includes refrigeration systems to ensure that the ice cream products remain in their intended frozen states.\r\n\r\nBen & Jerry's utilizes anhydrous ammonia in its refrigeration system. The anhydrous ammonia triggers the requirement of EPA 40 CFR Part 68, Risk Management Plan, because the facility's refrigeration system has 78,852 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.\r\n\r\nOur facility is located at 900 Industrial Park Road, St. Alban's, Vermont   05478.\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response\r\nBen & Jerry's Homemade, Inc. is involved in an ongoing effort to comply with OSHA 1910.119 Process Safety Management requirements as well as EPA 40 CFR Part 68, Risk Management Plan for accident prevention planning, training and response.  \r\n\r\nFive Year Accident History\r\nThis facility has not experienced any reportable accidents in the past five (5) years.  \r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program\r\nAll employees are trained to act based on their pre-assigned roles during emergency situations.
