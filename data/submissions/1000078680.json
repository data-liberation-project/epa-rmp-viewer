Introduction\n\nA Risk Management Program has been implemented at the Nation Pizza and Foods (Nation Pizza Products) facility located at 601 East Algonquin Road in Schaumburg, Illinois, for the reduction of accidental releases of hazardous materials. This updated, five (5) year Risk Management Plan (RMP) summarizes the management, administrative, procedural, and technological controls that work together to minimize the risk to site personnel, contractors, visitors, and the community and environment at large of hazardous chemical releases. The RMP is organized to correspond with specific U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) RMP, Program 3 of 40 CFR 68, definitions and requirements of Subpart G, including: \n\n?    Introduction;\n\n?    Nation Pizza Products policies to protect health, environment, and safety;\n\n?    Facility identification and regulated substances covered processes;\n\n?

Nation Pizza Products Policies To Protect Health, Environment, and Safety\n\nRisk management and safety are important concerns at Nation Pizza Products; this RMP formalizes and documents these activities. Nation Pizza Products is committed to conducting its operations in a safe and responsible manner and to reducing risks to human health and to the environment. It is Nation Pizza Products' policy to comply with all applicable federal, state, and local rules and regulations.  This updated risk management plan is being submitted to comply with EPA 40 CFR 68 requirements to submit a risk management plan, every five (5) years.\n\n\n\nThis RMP has identified potential hazards and has taken steps to design and maintain a safe facility in order to prevent releases, and minimize the consequences of accident"

RMP addresses potentially catastrophic chemical releases that could result in immediate harm and acute health effects to offsite receptors (public and environmental). Nation Pizza Products has developed an Emergency Action Plan (EAP) that contains procedures designed to maximize the safety of all employees, contractors, and visitors in the event of an emergency and also guard against environmental consequences.\n\n\n\nIII.    Facility Identification\n\nThe Nation Pizza Products facility is located at 601 East Algonquin Road in Schaumburg, Illinois.  The facility is a producer of custom and branded pizza and prepared foods for the food service industry, and retailers in the United States. \n\n\n\nThe NAICS code for the facility is 311412. Many areas of the plant are refrigerated to preserve ingredients, pizza, prepared foods, and dough products.   \n\n\n\nThe facility uses ammonia for refrigeration, and is regulated under 40 CFR Part 68, the EPA RMP Rule. There are two (2) refrigeration systems onsite that are used for refrigerating pizza and food products. \n\n\n\nThe amount of ammonia currently present in the refrigeration system #1 is approximately 13,000 pounds.  Refrigeration system #1 is used to cool production rooms, holding freezers, cheese cooler, glycol chiller, and a frigo blast freezer.  This system is a two-stage system with five (5) high stage compressors and two (2) booster compressors.  Evaporators in the production areas are fed with high pressure pumped liquid from the receiver, the holding freezer evaporators are fed from the intercooler at 32 psi, and the frigo blast freezer is fed pumped liquid at 30 psi from another intercooler.                                                    \n\n\n\nThe amount of ammonia currently present in the refrigeration system #2 is approximately 32,000 pounds.

Hazard Assessment - Worse Case Scenarios (WCS)\n\nAppendix B consists of the RMP*Submit Printout and contains additional information on the worst-case scenario.  Appendix C consists of the offsite consequence analysis data and maps for the worse case release scenario. \n\n\n\nV.

However, as discussed through out this document Nation Pizza Products is continuously working on improving this program. \n\n\n\nThis prevention program covers those processes that handle ammonia above the threshold quantity for both PSM and RMP rules. The next audit of the PSM program will occur by January 11, 2021, in compliance with the requirement to conduct PSM audits every three years.
