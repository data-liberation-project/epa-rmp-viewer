Introduction\n\nA Risk Management Program has been implemented at the Nation Pizza and Foods (Nation Pizza Products) facility located at 601 East Algonquin Road in Schaumburg, Illinois, for the reduction of accidental releases of hazardous materials. This updated, five (5) year Risk Management Plan (RMP) summarizes the management, administrative, procedural, and technological controls that work together to minimize the risk to site personnel, contractors, visitors, and the community and environment at large of hazardous chemical releases. The RMP is organized to correspond with specific U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) RMP, Program 3 of 40 CFR 68, definitions and requirements of Subpart G, including: \n\n?    Introduction;\n\n?    Nation Pizza Products policies to protect health, environment, and safety;\n\n?    Facility identification and regulated substances covered processes;\n\n?

Nation Pizza Products Policies To Protect Health, Environment, and Safety\n\nRisk management and safety are important concerns at Nation Pizza Products; this RMP formalizes and documents these activities. Nation Pizza Products is committed to conducting its operations in a safe and responsible manner and to reducing risks to human health and to the environment. It is Nation Pizza Products' policy to comply with all applicable federal, state, and local rules and regulations.  This updated risk management plan is being submitted to comply with EPA 40 CFR 68 requirements to submit a risk management plan, every five (5) years.\n\n\n\nThis RMP has identified potential hazards and has taken steps to design and maintain a safe facility in order to prevent releases, and minimize the consequences of accident"

RMP addresses potentially catastrophic chemical releases that could result in immediate harm and acute health effects to offsite receptors (public and environmental). Nation Pizza Products has developed an Emergency Action Plan (EAP) that contains procedures designed to maximize the safety of all employees, contractors, and visitors in the event of an emergency and also guard against environmental consequences.\n\n\n\nIII.    Facility Identification\n\nThe Nation Pizza Products facility is located at 601 East Algonquin Road in Schaumburg, Illinois.  The facility is a producer of custom and branded pizza and prepared foods for the food service industry, and retailers in the United States. \n\n\n\nThe NAICS code for the facility is 311412. Many areas of the plant are refrigerated to preserve ingredients, pizza, prepared foods, and dough products.   \n\n\n\nThe facility uses ammonia for refrigeration, and is regulated under 40 CFR Part 68, the EPA RMP Rule. There are two (2) refrigeration systems onsite that are used for refrigerating pizza and food products. \n\n\n\nThe amount of ammonia currently present in the refrigeration system #1 is approximately 13,000 pounds.  Refrigeration system #1 is used to cool production rooms, holding freezers, cheese cooler, glycol chiller, and a frigo blast freezer.  This system is a two-stage system with five (5) high stage compressors and two (2) booster compressors.  Evaporators in the production areas are fed with high pressure pumped liquid from the receiver, the holding freezer evaporators are fed from the intercooler at 32 psi, and the frigo blast freezer is fed pumped liquid at 30 psi from another intercooler.                                                    \n\n\n\nThe amount of ammonia currently present in the refrigeration system #2 is approximately 32,000 pounds.  Refrigeration system # 2 is used to cool production rooms, spiral freezers, air handlers, dock areas, and a plate and frame glycol chiller.  It is a two"

Hazard Assessment - Worse Case Scenarios (WCS)\n\nAppendix B consists of the RMP*Submit Printout and contains additional information on the worst-case scenario.  Appendix C consists of the offsite consequence analysis data and maps for the worse case release scenario. \n\n\n\nV.    Hazard Assessment - Alternative Release Scenarios (ARS)\n\nAppendix C consists of the RMP*Submit Printout and contains additional information on the alternative release scenario.  Appendix D consists of the offsite consequence analysis data and maps for the alternative release scenario. \n\n\n\nVI.    General Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nA prevention program is in place to minimize the risk of hazardous chemical releases in accordance with the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (29 CFR 1910.119) and the EPA Risk Management Program.   However, as discussed through out this document Nation Pizza Products is continuously working on improving this program. \n\n\n\nThis prevention program covers those processes that handle ammonia above the threshold quantity for both PSM and RMP rules. The next audit of the PSM program will occur by January 11, 2021, in compliance with the requirement to conduct PSM audits every three years.  The elements of the PSM / Program 3 prevention program and a brief description are listed below.\n\n?

Process Safety Information - Nation Pizza Products maintains a site-specific PSI program that ensures information pertaining to the hazards, technology, and equipment of the process are properly developed and maintained. Process safety information for the ammonia process has been compiled and was last reviewed during the PHA that was completed on May 7, 2019.\n\n?    Process Hazard Review - Nation Pizza Products has updated a site-specific PHA program that ensures a PHA is conducted initially, at a minimum of every five (5) years, and whenever a change is significant enough to require a change in PSI.  In addition, this program ensures PHAs are conducted in accordance with OSHA and EPA regulations and ensures findings and recommendations of PHAs are properly documented. Nation Pizza Products conducted a thorough PHA revalidation study for refrigeration system #1 and #2 during April and May 2019.\n\n?    Operating Procedures - Nation Pizza Products has updated a site-specific procedure that ensures operating procedures provide clear instruction for different phases of process operations and ensures they are properly maintained.  Nation Pizza Products updated operating procedures for both system #1 and #2 during August 2004, and most recently reviewed the procedures during April 2019.  Annually, the operating procedures are reviewed and certified as accurate.\n\n?

The current HAZWOPER training includes the first responder awareness level, the first responder operations level and hazardous materials technician training. However, the facility does not currently have a full on-site HAZMAT Team.  \n\n\n\nThe facility has four (4) windsocks (one at each corner of the building) present onsite for use in determining wind direction in the event of an ammonia release and evacuation of the building.\n\n\n\nThe current Safety Data Sheet (SDS) for anhydrous ammonia is included in Appendix E. \n\n\n\nIX.    Emergency Communications\n\nThe telephone numbers of agencies and plant personnel that may be contacted in case of an emergency are available onsite.\n\n\n\nX.    Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nChemical safety is an important part of Nation Pizza Products operations. Nation Pizza Products recently conducted an audit of their Process Safety Management Program and will be dutifully implementing the recommendations from that audit. Continuous improvement in safety is an important goal for Nation Pizza Products. \n\n\n\nXI.
