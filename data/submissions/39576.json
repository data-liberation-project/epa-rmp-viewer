      "SummaryText": "The North Regional WWTP, located at 3777 Old Needmore Road in Daytion, is operated by Veolia Water North America (Veolia) for Tri-Cities North Regional Wastewater Authority on behalf of the cities of Huber Heights, Vandalia and Tipp City.  This facility contains as much as 4,000 pounds of chlorine during the chlorination season (May 1 through October 31) and typically less than 2,000 pounds during the off-chlorination season (November 1 through April 30).  The chlorine is contained in one ton cylinders.  Chlorine is used at this facility to disinfect wastewaters before discharge into the receiving waters.\n\nVeolia has general policies and procedures for the use of materials and equipment.  These policies are provided to give each operating site a general format or structure in which to base Standard Operating Procedures specific to this site.  Veolia conducts compliance audits at facilities every two years and self audits on opposing years to ensure that safety standards are being met and to initiate action to remedy any shortcomings.\n\nThe worst case scenario for the North Regional facility included the release of the entire contents of a one-ton cylinder of chlorine gas into the atmosphere within ten minutes.  This scenario assumed a wind speed of 1.5 meters/sec and an urban topography.  Using USEPA's RMP*Comp software, the scenario presented a toxic endpoint of 0.9 miles from point of discharge which encompasses a population of less than 11,000.  Public receptors within that distance includes residences and one golf course.\n\nThe alternative scenario for this facility includes the release of chlorine gas due to a lead seal failure.  This was modeled using a 1/16th inch diameter hole which discharges a 10 pound per minute release of chlorine gas into a building.  The mitigation of the building was not taken into account since the toxic endpoint was .1 miles which does not extend to any off-site receptors, residential, public or environmental.\n\nThe North Regional WWTP"

      "SummaryText": " facility complies with the OSHA PSM, EPCRA and CWA.  As part of our operating procedures, we have developed Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) and a Chlorine Emergency Response Plan.  Moreover, our facility is monitored by a SCADA system which contacts the on-call operator when an alarm is activated.\n\nThere have been no reportable accidental releases of chlorine in the past five years.\n\nCurrently, chlorine leaks are handled on site by qualified plant personnel.  Training is divided into to two categories:  affected and other employees.  Affected employees are employees that must deal with the chemical on a day-to-day basis and are trained to a competent level.  Other employees are employees that do not handle the chemical.  Other employees must be trained to a knowledgable level.  Training session attendance sheets, competency sheets and sign-off sheets are filed in Safety Training folders."
