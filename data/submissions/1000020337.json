The commitment to excellence regarding Environmental, Health & Safety (EHS) issues is supported in total by Senior Management of CF Industries.\n\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance\n\nOne of the Company's distribution facilities is the Frankfort Terminal, located approximately 5 miles west of Frankfort.  CF Industries has been a member of the community since 1969.  Anhydrous ammonia is the only RMP-regulated substance at the Frankfort Terminal.  The Frankfort Terminal receives ammonia by pipeline and trucks, then distributes it into tank trucks.  An extensive EHS program assures compliance with applicable local, state and federal rules and regulations.\n\n\n\nCF Industries' anhydrous ammonia is used primarily as a fertilizer.  Ammonia is a source of nitrogen that is essential for plant growth.  It is classified by the Department of Transportation as a non-flammable, compressed gas.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nCF Industries' Layers of Protection\n\nCF Industries has implemented a comprehensive program at its distribution facilities designed to safeguard the environment, its workers and the surrounding communities.  The layers of protection are the numerous prevention mechanisms implemented at the Company's fertilizer storage facilities to help manage the risks inherent in handling anhydrous ammonia.  The key safety features are listed below.\n\n\n\nAA?  The facility conducts comprehensive reviews to ensure that hazards associated with CF Industries' processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  These reviews are conducted in accordance with the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration's Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard.  One of these reviews is a Process Hazards Analysis (PHA) which is designed to identify all failure scenarios that could lead t"

The review is undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and is revalidated every five years.  Any findings related to the PHA are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nAA?  Critical operating conditions at the Frankfort Terminal are monitored through two independent sets of instrumentation.  Pressure and level gauges alert Terminal personnel with alarms and automatic shutdowns.\n\nAA?  A flare helps control tank pressure by burning ammonia vapor before it can be released to the atmosphere.  This is performed when the ammonia compressors are unable to hold the tank pressure.\n\nAA?  The ammonia tank system is protected by pressure/vacuum relief valves and compressors which operate automatically.\n\nAA?  Emergency shutdown buttons are located throughout the facility.  These buttons can be used by anyone to shutdown the product flows in the event of an emergency.\n\nAA?  CF Industries has instituted a comprehensive tank inspection program that requires every tank be inspected at twenty year intervals.  Tanks are emptied and subjected to a series of tests.  This program is designed to identify and correct any tank problems.  A tank outage typically lasts three months and costs the Company $300,000.  Although an inspection is costly in terms of money and distribution logistics, CF Industries believes the safety benefits far outweigh the costs.\n\nAA?  Through CF Industries' PSM program, all covered equipment used at the facility undergoes routine performance tests and maintenance.  This PSM program forms the foundation for the RMP prevention program.\n\nAA?  The Frankfort Terminal is staffed around-the-clock.  Thus, operating temperatures and pressures, and other parameters, are monitored 24 hours a day.  Such monitoring allows Terminal personnel to quickly respond to operational problems in their early stage; thereby preventing releases of ammonia to the "

Each truck is checked for leaks, and surveillance cameras provide operating personnel additional views of truck loading conditions.  Any truck that fails the inspection is not permitted to remove anhydrous ammonia from the facility.\n\nAA?  Another essential element of our Layers of Protection is employee training and continuing education.  Every operating person receives extensive Hazardous Materials Safety training with eight hours of refresher training each year.  They also receive documented training covering 38 specific topics.\n\nAA?  The Frankfort facility maintains industrial hygiene and medical programs that meet or exceed standards of good professional practice.\n\nAA?  CF Industries also works extensively with the local emergency  and fire responders through simulation training and drills.  The Company believes it is important that first responders are prepared to deal with any emergency on site.\n\nAA?  CF Industries routinely carries out highly documented maintenance checks on its process equipment to ensure proper functions.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief valve systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.\n\nAA?  CF Industries maintains and enforces formal procedures and policies on environmental protection, safety awareness, facility design and operation, and contractor compliance that, in many cases, go beyond legal and regulatory requirements.  The Company's internal EHS audit program is designed to make the Frankfort Terminal the best in the industry.  In addition, the Terminal maintains written operating procedures which describe what tasks a process operator must perform, define safe operating parameters that must be maintained, and set safety precautions for operations and maintenance activities.

Copies of the Frankfort Emergency Manual are kept at the facility and the Company's corporate headquarters.  Copies are sent to the Local Emergency Planning Committee, the State Emergency Response Commission, and the Madison Township Volunteer Fire Department.  The Manual includes all aspects of emergency response including personnel roles and responsibilities, lines of authority, communication, pre-emergency planning, emergency recognition and prevention, emergency alerting and response procedures, site evacuation routes, site security, decontamination, emergency response equipment, medical treatment and first aid services, and post-emergency activities and training.  The Manual is reviewed annually with the first responders.  In addition, CF Industries trains its employees annually on the use of this Manual.\n\n\n\nThe Five-Year Accident History \n\nThere has never been a catastrophic failure of a refrigerated storage tank at any of the  CF Industries-owned ammonia storage and distribution facilities.  Additionally, CF Industries' Frankfort Terminal has had no releases in the last five years that resulted in any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on-site, or known off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nCF Industries will continue to coordinate information and training with emergency responders.  This information-sharing will occur during face-to-face discussions and emergency response drills.\n\n\n\nCF Industries will continue its long standing policy to host Community Interface Meetings for the first responders, government officials, businesses and neighbors.

Additionally, CF Industries provided funds used to send 8 members of the local Fire Departments to special ammonia suppression training in Holden, Louisiana, conducted by CF Industries and the Louisiana State Police.  This training provided firefighters the opportunity to learn how to protect the public in the unlikely event of an accidental ammonia release.  Also, the Company has supported the local Red Cross Disaster Relief Fund.  Additionally, CF Industries has provided funds to Clinton County in support of their installation of a reverse 911 system.  60 high-visibility vests were donated to the City of Frankfort.  Finally, a laptop computer was donated to the Clinton County LEPC, an AED was donated to the Perry Township Volunteer Fire Department, and a digital camera was donated to the Frankfort Fire Department."
