              "Description": "The anhydrous ammonia storage tank is interconnected to the PAO production process through process piping and is used as a neutralizer in the process. The storage vessel stores the anhydrous ammonia as a liquid and utilizes pressure relief valves as a control device. The storage vessel is built to pressure vessel codes. Hydrant monitors are positioned to provide coverage and can be used as a mitigation device in the event of a leak. The PAO process is protected by relief valves, manual and remotely actuated block valves, and a  Distributed Control System (DCS) with numerous process monitors, warnings and alarms. The unit operators utilized standard operating procedures to ensure proper operation ofthe unit. Lyondell Chemicals, the operator of the unit, has a complex wide Emergency Response Team which has the capacity and training to respond to fires and hazardous material releases. Boron Trifluoride (BF3) is utilized in the manufacture of PAO as a catalyst. BF3 is received from the manufacturer as a compressed gas in dedicated tube trailers. Inventory is limited and only one tube trailer is connected to the process at any given time. The process itself is protected by relief devices, vents, manual and remotely activated block valves, and a DCS. The DCS system monitors the process and provides warnings and alarms. BF3 unloading and storage is in a enclsure protected by a remotely or locally activated water curtain. The plant operators are provided training on standard operating procedures, and abnormal and emergency situations.  The site provides an Emergency Response Team that provides fire and hazardous materials release response. Team members are trained in fire and hazardous material release response.",

A Risk Management Plan (RMP) for this facility (and an adjacent unit) was submitted on June 21, 2004.\n\n\n\nThat RMP submittal was a first time submittal for the PAO facility alone. However, the PAO process and the chemicals inventoried on site have not changed since the June, 2004, RMP submittal.\n\n\n\nThe facility has two compounds on the RMP toxics listing; ammonia and boron trifluoride. There are no listed RMP flammables above threshold quantity within the facility.\n\n\n\nINEOS conducted an off-site consequence analysis for the worst case and more likely alternative scenarios, using the guidance provided in the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) RMP program.\n\n\n\nThis Risk Management Plan submittal summarizes the results of the off-site consequence analysis.\n\n"
