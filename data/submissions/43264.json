Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Action Policies\nAirgas Specialty Products Inc. is committed to compliance with all laws and regulations, the safety of employees and the public as well as the protection of the environment. This commitment is demonstrated by a comprehensive ammonia release prevention program that includes areas such as system design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance procedures, security and a comprehensive employee training program associated with all ammonia processes. Airgas Specialty Products' policy is for all facilities to meet ANSI K61.1 standards for \"Safety Requirements for The Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\". Company policy also requires the implementation of appropriate controls to prevent releases of ammonia to the atmosphere. Airgas Specialty Products strives to prevent emergency situations, but maintains an Emergency Action Plan to be prepared should an emergency situation develop.\n\n2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nThe primary business at the subject facility is the Distribution of Anhydrous Ammonia. Ammonia is not produced at the subject facility; rather it is received via rail as a liquefied compressed gas. Ammonia is stored in ASME code pressure vessels and the storage and handling system meets OSHA, EPA and ANSI K61.1 requirements. Very little ammonia is released to the atmosphere at this facility. Ammonia storage and transfer operations are accomplished in totally enclosed pressure systems designed to meet all code requirements.\n\nThe maximum inventory of Anhydrous Ammonia at the S. St. Paul, MN facility is 350,000 lb.  All product is shipped from the facility over the road in DOT approved cylinders or vessels.\n\n3. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nAirgas Specialty Products Inc. has implemented the accidental release"

All LaRoche facilities are constructed and operated in accord with AMERICAN NATIONAL STANDARD SAFETY REQUIREMENTS FOR THE STORAGE AND HANDLING OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA (ANSI K61.1). The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at the subject facility.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nAirgas Specialty Products Inc. maintains a detailed file of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all pertinent operations.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nAirgas Specialty Products Inc. conducts comprehensive Process Hazard Analysis studies to ensure that hazards associated with its operations are identified and controlled efficiently. The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at intervals no less frequently than required by regulations (5-yr intervals), and even more frequently if needed. Conclusions and recommendations of the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\nAirgas Specialty Products Inc. develops and maintains written operating procedures (SOPs) for all phases of ammonia related operations. These procedures address all modes of operation including, but not limited to, initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency operations, emergency shutdown, normal shutdown and maintenance procedures. The procedures are reviewed annually and are readily available to all operators involved in the ammonia operation.\n\nTraining\nAirgas Specialty Products Inc. has a comprehensive on-line training program coupled with on-the-job training to ensure that employees are competent to perform the operating procedures that they participate in. Refresher training is provided annually and even more often if needed.\n\nMecha"

Process equipment examined by these checks includes (but is not limited to); pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps. Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in pertinent maintenance practices. Specialized training is also provided to maintenance personnel as needed. All identified equipment deficiencies are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nManagement of Change\nWritten procedures are in place at Airgas Specialty Products Inc. to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures. Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are influenced by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification. The Management of Change process helps insure that proper parts and equipment are always used in operations.  Few changes have been made at this facility in the last several years.\n\nPre-startup Reviews\nPre-startup safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a standard practice at Airgas Specialty Products Inc. These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits\nAirgas Specialty Products Inc. conducts routine audits to determine/confirm compliance with PSM / RMP regulations. The most recent compliance audit was conducted on 11-13-2002. These audits are conducted at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required are undertaken in a safe and timely manner.\n\nIncident Investigation\nAirgas Specialty Products Inc. promptly investigates incidents that resulted in, or could re"

All employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements. In addition, all employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation of Process Safety Management and Risk Management Plan regulations, including information resulting from process hazard analyses in particular. Local employees participate in Process Hazard Analyses (PHAs) and Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) reviews.\n\nContractors\nOn very few occasions, Airgas Specialty Products employs contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities. Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is carried out. Airgas Specialty Products Inc. has a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related to the contractor's work. Relevant Material Safety Data Sheets are made available to and reviewed with contractors and their onsite workers. Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of  ammonia occur.\n\n5. Five-year Accident History\nAirgas Specialty Products Inc. has an excellent record of preventing releases of ammonia to the atmosphere. Due to our stringent release prevention policies, the number of accidental releases has been reduced to a minimum.  The S.
