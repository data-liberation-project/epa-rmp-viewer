      "SummaryText": "Vandenberg Air Force Base (AFB) is the third largest Air Force installation in the nation encompassing over 99,579 acres in Santa Barbara County, California.  Its unique geography provides America with its primary means to launch polar orbiting satellites without over flying populated areas.  This mission?which is crucial to national security as well as the burgeoning interest in communications, land resources surveillance, and space research?is dependent on the continued launching of an array of space boosters.  In addition, Vandenberg AFB conducts operational test launches of Minuteman and Peacekeeper intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) and also manages the Western Range?a vast network of radar, telemetry, and optical sensors stretching across the Pacific Ocean?in which all three services conduct a variety of aeronautical and missile flight activities.\n\nWhile Vandenberg AFB comprises over 1,000 buildings and some 1,200 residences for military personnel, only 15 percent of its total area is developed.  The remainder provides the buffer needed to preclude encroachment by local development and to protect outlying communities from launch anomalies and associated operational hazards.  Restrictive easements affecting development on adjacent private land further limit potential risk to the public.  Significantly, over the last 47 years, more than 1,800 launches of space boosters and ICBMs have been conducted at Vandenberg AFB, and there is no known instance of serious injury or death to anyone in the surrounding communities as a result of a chemical release due to the launches themselves or to supporting operations.\n\nWith this submittal, Vandenberg AFB is making a conscientious effort to fully comply with Section 112r of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 as implemented by the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 40, Part 68 (40 CFR 68), as well as with the California Code of Regulations (CCR), Title 19, Division 2, Chapter 4.5, California Accidental Release Prev"

The format developed by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for this submittal is generally oriented toward accommodating commercial or government operated stationary sources that differ significantly from Vandenberg AFB in terms of physical size, complexity, emergency response capability, and organizational make-up.  Accordingly, additional detail and clarification are incorporated in this Executive Summary to provide the public clearer, more complete insight into the scope and effectiveness of Vandenberg AFB's accidental release prevention and emergency response policies.\n\nScope of the Vandenberg AFB Risk Management Plan\n\nThis Risk Management Plan (RMP) includes all covered processes within the borders of Vandenberg AFB that are subject to Department of the Air Force oversight and control.  Under the Commercial Space Act, excess facilities on the base may be leased by private entities to conduct commercial activities that are not under the purview of the Department of the Air Force.  Compliance with EPA RMP and CalARP requirements for covered processes that solely support such commercial activities is the responsibility of the respective commercial owner and operator; such covered processes are not included in this RMP.\n\nThis RMP includes one process in which the EPA threshold of a regulated toxic or flammable substance is exceeded?the Hypergolic Storage Facility.  This facility stores and handles the regulated toxics dimethylhydrazine (UDMH), hydrazine, and methyl hydrazine. The largest quantities of UDMH and hydrazine occur in an approximately one-to-one mixture of the two typically referred to as Aerozine 50.  In addition, the Hypergolic Storage Facility is used to store significant quantities of the toxic nitrogen tetroxide, which is included in this Risk Management Plan in accordance with the General Duty Clause: Section 112(r)(1) of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nVandenberg AFB possesses sig"

This Fire Department comprises over 100 firefighters who staff five fire stations strategically positioned across the base.  One fire station is located within a three-minute response time of the Hypergolic Storage Facility.  This Fire Department is also seasonally augmented by a 20-person \"Hot-Shot\" crew that is specially trained to respond to wildland fires.\n\nThe Vandenberg AFB Fire Department is fully compliant with National Fire Protection Agency standards and has mutual aid agreements with Santa Barbara County, the City of Lompoc, the City of Santa Maria, the California Forestry Department, and the Los Padres National Forest.  Per the Santa Barbara County Integrated Hazardous Materials Management System (IHMMS) Operation Agreement, the base Fire Department approves and maintains the Business Response Plans and hazardous material inventories?as prescribed by the California Health and Safety Code, Chapter 6.95?that are developed by organizations assigned to or doing business on the base.

Additionally, the base Fire Department conducts onsite facility inspections to identify potentially hazardous conditions that could lead to an accidental release.  It should be noted that the Vandenberg AFB Fire Department is advised of all operations involving the transfer of hypergolic propellants, which comprise the regulated substances at the Hypergolic Storage Facility.  During launch operations, Fire Department response elements are pre-positioned to expedite response in the event of an anomaly.\n\nVandenberg AFB also contracts for a Hypergolic Emergency Response Team (HERT) that can respond within 60 minutes of notification with scapesuit-qualified technicians; this emergency response team is capable of handling the hypergolic propellants described in this submittal.  It should be noted that scapesuit-qualified technicians are pre-positioned on location for hypergolic propellant transfer operations.\n\nThe Vandenberg AFB Command Post is staffed 24 hours a day, every day of the year, and provides a central point of contact in the event of an emergency on the base.  Its extensive suite of communications equipment includes a hotline to Santa Barbara County Emergency Services.\n\nEmergency response at Vandenberg AFB, which is consistent with the National Incident Management System, is implemented through the Disaster Response Force (DRF)--a management structure of experienced, senior personnel comprising a cross-section of technical, logistical, medical, and communications expertise.  In the event of an incident involving the release of a hazardous material, on-scene response will be directed by an Incident Commander certified through the Department of Defense Fire and Emergency Services Certification Program to handle such incidents.  Vandenberg AFB regularly exercises the DRF in accordance with AFI 10-2501, \"Air Force Emergency Management Program Planning and Operations;\" VAFB CEMP 10-2, \"Comprehensive Emergency Management Plan;\" and 30 SW Plan 32-4"

Accordingly, Vandenberg AFB identifies nitrogen tetroxide as a highly toxic substance that is stored on the installation in quantities that could pose a risk to the general public.  Nitrogen tetroxide is used primarily as the oxidizer component of the hypergolic propellants employed by various space boosters launched from Vandenberg AFB; it is also occasionally used in smaller quantities as a propellant for satellites launched from Vandenberg AFB and in the Propulsion System Rocket Engine (PSRE) of certain ICBMs tested at the base.\n\nAll aspects of Vandenberg AFB's RMP and CalARP programs?to include OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standards and emergency response program planning and training?encompass nitrogen tetroxide storage and operations to the same extent they apply to the regulated hydrazines as described in this submittal.  It should be noted that a review of the base's five-year accident history reveals there have been no reportable accidents involving base employees, contractors, and/or anyone in the general public as a result of exposure to a release of nitrogen tetroxide.  Vandenberg AFB fully intends to maintain every aspect of its current accidental release prevention program as it applies to nitrogen tetroxide as long as significant quantities of this substance are stored or used at the base."
