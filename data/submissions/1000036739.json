      "SummaryText": "III.  Summary of Worst Case and Alternative Release Scenarios\r\n\r\nThe worst-case release scenario and an alternative release scenario were identified and analyzed to determine the distance to endpoint for each assumed release.  To perform the required offsite consequence analysis for the facility, the very conservative EPA RMP*Comp model was used.\r\n\r\nThe worst case release scenario involves the complete rupture of one 35,000-gallon storage tank.  A maximum release of 161,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia over a 10-minute period was considered.  The released quantity was not limited by a system of administrative controls.  Under worst case meteorological conditions of Class F stability and 1.5 m/s wind speed, ammonia could travel up to 6.9 miles before reaching the specified toxic endpoint level of 0.14 mg/L.\r\n\r\nThe alternative case release scenario involves the release of 19,400 pounds of ammonia over 30 minutes from the failure of a tank flange gasket.  Under typical meteorological conditions of Class D stability and 3 m/s wind speed, ammonia could travel up to 0.5 miles before reaching the specified toxic end point level of 0.14 mg/L.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.  Description of Release Prevention Program\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information DP&L maintains documentation of safety information concerning chemical hazards, operating parameters, and equipment designs and specifications associated with the process.\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis-DP&L conducted detailed analyses of the process to ensure that hazards associated with the process were identified and controlled effectively.  The What-If analysis methodology was used to assess the potential hazards of the process.  The study was conducted by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering, control logistics, and process operations.  Findings resulting from the analysis were addressed.  The initial What-If analysis was conducted on September 5 -6, 2001, and a pre-startup safety review was conducted on April 5, 2002.  An update and"

The procedures cover various operational phases including initial setup, normal startup, normal shutdown, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, and startup following a turnaround or emergency shutdown.  The information is readily available to operators and maintenance personnel involved in the process and the information is periodically reviewed to assure it is current.\r\n\r\nTraining - DP&L's training program is comprehensive and is implemented to ensure that all personnel involved in the operation and maintenance of the process are properly trained in the safe operation and maintenance of the process and knowledgeable of the hazards of the process.  The personnel are provided with refresher training at least every three years or more often if needed.\r\n\r\nMechanical Integrity - DP&L conducts well-documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure safe and reliable operations.  All process equipment routinely checked includes storage tanks and pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and venting systems, controls and pumps, emergency shutdown systems, and monitoring devices.  All maintenance operations conducted on the covered process are performed by qualified personnel who have had proper training.  Equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected promptly and safely.\r\n\r\nManagement of Change - DP&L maintains written documents to manage changes in the process equipment, procedures and monitoring technology.  Personnel whose job tasks are affected by a modification in the process are promptly apprised of the modification and provided training to address the modification.\r\n\r\nPre-Startup Review - A pre-startup safety review was conducted prior to the startup of the new process.

The requirements for non-responding facilities are covered in Section 68.90 of the rule.  To determine whether a facility is a responding one, the EPA interpretation of response is commonly used.  It is the definition of response used in the OSHA HAZWOPER standard in 29 CFR 1910.120(a)(3).\r\n\r\nThe standard defines response as a response effort by employees from outside the immediate release area or by other designated responders to an occurrence which results, or is likely to result, in an uncontrolled release of a hazardous substance.  This definition specifically excludes responses to incidental releases, which are those where the substance can be absorbed, neutralized, or otherwise controlled at the time of released by employees in the immediate release area, or by maintenance personnel.  Also excluded are those releases of hazardous substances where there is no potential safety or health hazard.  Such hazards include fire, explosion, or chemical exposure.  If the release of chemical is substantial or clearly growing in , the leak is no longer considered incidental and employees should not respond unless they are specifically trained in response procedures and the facility has an emergency response program that meets the requirements of 40 CFR 68.95.\r\n\r\nOSHA Standard 29 CFR 1910.120(q)(1) states that Employers who will evacuate their employees from the danger area when an emergency occurs, and who do not permit any of their employees to assist in handling the emergency, are exempt from the requirements of this paragraph if they provide an emergency action plan in accordance with Section 1910.38(a). . .

The plan includes such requirements as adequate first aid and medical treatment, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, and qualified contractor responder for post-incident response and decontamination of affected areas.  The plan will be promptly updated to address any pertinent changes within the process that would require a modification of the emergency action plan.\r\n\r\nVII. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\r\n\r\nDP&L is always receptive to suggestions from employees to improve safety.  Employee meetings that focus on safety issues are held regularly.  Further, employees are trained to recognize hazards and to present ideas to eliminate them or minimize the potential consequences of those hazards.  The recommendations made during the process hazard analysis have been considered for implementation."
