To do this, we are dedicated to continuous improvement in our operations to prevent pollution, reduce risks, and to enhance safety, health, and environmental performance.  By incorporating these beliefs and attitudes into the way we do things at the Chicopee Plant, we take a key step forward in minimizing the environmental impact of our operations, providing a safe workplace for our employees, satisfying customer needs, and creating shareholder value.  We adhere to the following basic principles in managing our business worldwide:  \n\n* We will comply with the letter and the spirit of all applicable health, safety and environmental laws, regulations, and corporate guidelines.\n  \n* We will define strategic objectives, develop tactical plans, identify clear accountability, provide necessary resources, and measure our progress on safety, health, and environmental matters on an ongoing basis.  \n\n* Our planning will consider our business goals and significant safety, health and environmental aspects of our products and operations, and will work to reduce adverse impacts. \n\n* We will provide for an open dialogue on safety, health, and environmental issues relating to our products and our operations with our stakeholders, including shareholders, employees, customers, suppliers, government agencies, and communities.  \n\n* We will work continually to reduce workplace injuries, incidents with the potential to cause property damage, material loss, or interruption of our business, or waste and releases to the environment.  \n\n* All Hercules employees, worldwide, are responsible and accountable for incorporating safety, health, and environmental activities into our daily business activities.  \n\nFacility Description:\n\nThe primary activity at the Chicopee Plant is the manufacture of chemical additives used in the pulp and paper industry.

      "SummaryText": "'s two main processes are emulsion sizes and wet-strength resins.  The sizes prevent wetting and penetration of the pulp fibers and are used in a variety of products from writing paper to food packaging.  The wet-strength resins are used in paper tissue and towels, so that they will not come apart easily when they get wet. \n\nEpichlorohydrin is a raw material for the Kymene process and is consumed in a chemical reaction to make the wet-strength resin.  The plant receives epichlorohydrin in tank trucks and railroad tank cars and stores the material in a gallon storage tank that holds a maximum of 206,000 pounds.  The storage tank is provided with a containment dike to minimize the adverse impacts from any leaks or spills.  Spill containment capability is also provided for the area where tank trucks are unloaded.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release and Accident Prevention Program:\n\nThe Chicopee plant is subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management standard (29 CFR 1910.119) and has a complete process safety management system in place.  This includes the use of process hazards analysis to identify and address potential hazards, management of change procedures to control modifications, mechanical integrity procedures for minimizing mechanical failures, detailed operating procedures for process control, and operator training for the personnel involved in the process.\n\nFive Year Accident History:\n\nOn November 25, 2007 an employee received a third degree burn on the top of his foot from being exposed to Epichlorohydrin.  The employee had loss time from work because of the injury.\n\nEmergency Response Program:\n\nThe Chicopee Plant has written emergency response plans and coordinates emergency response matters with the Chicopee Fire Department and the District Hazmat team.  The plant provides ongoing emergency response training for all plant employees.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:\n\nIn 2008 a site security vulnerability assessment at the Chicopee facility.

Upgrades to the Chicopee facility camera surveillance are currently under development. The upgrades planned include installing a camera in the front foyer to check visitor identification from remote locations before allowing the visito onto the facilty.   A second LEL detector has been installed outside the Epicholorhydrin dike next to the transfer pumps.  There is a 25 foot restricted zone around the Epichlorhydrin tank. The facility conducts security background checks for new employees.  The Chicopee facility has requested that contractors perform security screening contract employees assigned to work at our facility."
