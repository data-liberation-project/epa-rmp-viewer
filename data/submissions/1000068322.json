(Univar) branch located at 3950 NW Yeon Avenue, Portland, Oregon (the Branch).\n\n\n\nERM-West, Inc. (ERM) prepared this Plan on behalf of Univar to satisfy the requirements of the Federal Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions in the Federal Code of Regulations (40 CFR Part 68). The RMP registration required under Section 68.160 of the Federal regulations is included in Appendix E.\n\n\n\nUnivar is a wholesale chemical distributor serving a number of U.S. industries. Founded in 1924, Univar supplies the food industry, chemical compounders, pharmaceuticals, mining, forest products, oil and gas producers, electronics, coatings and many other key industries with the chemical raw materials and support services required to produce or refine products used in numerous end-use markets.\n\n\n\nSome of the products stored and handled by the Branch are subject to the Federal RMP regulations.  A key requirement of this program is the preparation and submission of a RMP.  The Federal EPA prescribes the content of the RMP.\n\n\n\nThe latest 5-year update to the Federal RMP for the Branch was submitted to the USEPA in September 2012.  The current required 5-year update included the following modifications to the program:\n\n\n\n?    Removed regulated substances that are no longer handled onsite in quantities exceeding the regulatory limits:  formaldehyde; \n\n?    Increased quantities of hydrofluoric acid.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nUnivar's accidental release prevention program covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at the Branch, which demonstrates the facility's commitment to reducing the potential for accidental releases.  It is the Branch's policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. \n\n\n\nThis program includes provisions and requirements for "

Process #1 - Warehousing Operations (Container Storage and Distribution): aqua ammonia (less than 44% by weight).\n\n?

The Branch's three covered processes (#1 - Aqua Ammonia Warehousing Operations, #2 - Aqua Ammonia Bulk Operations, and (#3 - Hydrofluoric Acid Warehousing Operations) described in Section 1.3 were designed and constructed in accordance with applicable codes and ordinances in effect at the time of construction. \n\n\n\nS"

The emergency response plan includes adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas.\n\n\n\nThis Plan is shared with local emergency responders who have access to branch personnel (and up--to-date phone numbers).  The Branch responds to minor incidents but will call in professional emergency responders in the event of all other incidents.\n\n\n\nLocal emergency responders, such as the fire department, are invited and encouraged to visit and familiarize themselves with the products and facilities.  Joint emergency exercises are conducted when possible.\n\n\n\nFor more detail see Section 5.0.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nRecommendations to further reduce the likelihood and/or severity of accidental releases of the three control processes at the Branch were generated during the February 2018 PHA."
