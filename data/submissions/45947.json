      "SummaryText": "INTRODUCTION\n\nA Risk Management Program has been implemented at Arkema Inc.'s Crosby, Texas production facility to reduce the risk of accidental releases of hazardous materials.  This Risk Management Plan summarizes the management, administrative, procedural, and technological controls that work together to minimize the risk to the community of hazardous chemical releases.  The plan summary is organized to correspond with specific EPA RMP definitions and requirements, including:  \n\n-Introduction;\n-Arkema Inc.'s Policies to Protect Health, Environment, and Safety;\n-Facility Identification and Regulated Substances in Covered Processes;\n-Hazard Assessment;\n-Prevention Program;\n-Five Year Accident History;\n-Emergency Response Plan; and,\n-Planned Changes to Improve Safety.\n\nArkema Inc. POLICIES FOR HEALTH, ENVIRONMENT, AND SAFETY\n\nArkema Inc. is committed to employee, public, and environmental safety by conducting its operations in a safe and responsible manner.  This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive risk management program that covers areas such as equipment design and installation, plant operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at the Crosby plant.  The Risk Management Plan formalizes and documents these activities.\n\nThis commitment to health, environment, and safety (HES) starts with the CEO.  Senior management routinely dedicates time to review HES matters.  This emphasis on safety is carried through to the facility level, where the Plant Manager and the Safety Team regularly review safety performance, take corrective actions, and strive for continuous improvement.  The success of Arkema Inc.'s HES programs is also reflected by a strong commitment to safety by employees and contractors.\n\nArkema Inc.'s HES programs include policies, procedures, standards, and guidance materials designed to fulfill Arkema Inc.'s commitment to health, environment and safety.  These materials include Risk Management Program guidance"

Crosby facility is located at 18000 Crosby-Eastgate Road in Crosby, Texas.  The facility manufactures liquid organic peroxides which are primarily used in the production of plastic resins, polystyrene, polyethylene, polypropylene, PVC, and fiberglass.  Certain substances used and produced within the facility are regulated substances under 40CFR68, the EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) Rule.  These substances are present at or above the minimum threshold for RMP applicability and for the Crosby plant include Sulfur Dioxide (SO2) and 2-Methyl Propene (Isobutylene).\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT\nWORST-CASE RELEASE MITIGATION MEASURES\n\nThe multiple layers of preventive and mitigation measures in use at the Crosby facility make it very unlikely that either worst-case scenarios will occur.  In the unlikely event that such a release occurs, Arkema Inc. has mitigation measures in place to reduce any potential impacts.\n\nIn compliance with regulatory criteria associated with RMP evaluations, active mitigation systems cannot be considered in modeling worst-case scenario impacts; however, the significant planning and subsequent implementation that Arkema Inc. has made in active mitigation measures could effectively reduce the risk associated with an RMP worst-case related incident.  Mitigation measures include:\n\n-Stationary fire monitors that could remove airborne vapors with water sprays;\n\n-On-site emergency responders 24 hours per day as well as communications links with additional off-site responders and response equipment;\n\n-The FirstCall Interactive Network enabling the facility to immediately notify the surrounding neighbors.\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT\nALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS MITIGATION MEASURES\n\nWhile the Alternative Release Scenarios are, by definition, more likely to occur than the Worst-Case Scenario, they are still very unlike"

If a release should occur, Arkema Inc. has mitigation measures to reduce potential human health and environmental receptor impact.  The prevention program elements in place at Crosby are:\n\n-Remote shut-off valves on tank piping designed to shut down all flow from the storage tanks, thereby reducing the amount potentially released;\n\n-Excess flow valves on tank process feed lines from the storage tanks designed to close in the case of a line failure, thereby reducing the amount potentially released;\n\n-Stationary fire monitors that could remove airborne vapor with water sprays;\n\n-On-site emergency responders 24 hours per day as well as emergency communications links with additional off-site responders and response equipment;\n\n-The FirstCall Interactive Network enabling the facility to immediately notify the surrounding neighbors.\n\nTHE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe Arkema Inc. Crosby facility has an accidental release prevention program in place to minimize the risk of hazardous chemical releases.  This program is designed to address the requirements of 29CFR1910.119, Process Safety Management and the EPA Risk Management Program pursuant to 40CFR68.  The accidental release prevention program includes the following elements and activities:\n\n-In-depth hazard analyses are completed every five years by qualified personnel using techniques approved under the OSHA PSM standard of 29CFR1910.119;\n\n-Written operating procedures are used for training and directing the work of operators, who receive refresher training every three years;\n\n-Operators, mechanics, and contractor personnel are qualified, trained in the general hazards in the facility, and informed of any temporary situations affecting safety;\n\n-A Management of Change (MOC) system is in place to ensure that process operating changes are managed safely;\n\n-Critical equipment is i"

Crosby facility maintains a written Emergency Response Plan. The plan includes procedures for notifying civil authorities and the public in the event of an incident; documentation of proper first aid and medical treatment necessary to treat accidental human exposures; procedures for the use of emergency response equipment and for its inspection and testing; descriptions of the training programs for all employees in the relevant emergency response procedures; and the review and update of our response plan to reflect changes at the facility and to ensure that employees are informed of these changes.  The facility also conducts emergency drills on a regular basis.\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES FOR HEALTH, ENVIRONMENT, AND SAFETY\n\nSafety has been a part of the culture at the Crosby facility for many years. An example of Crosby's dedication to safety is that in March of 2006, the facility acheived 23 years without a plant employee lost time incident.  Chemical exposure risks to employees and the public have been minimized through ongoing internal risk reduction efforts as well as regulatory requirements. The Crosby facility continues to implement methods to reduce risk, as demonstrated by the installation of remote access controls for these tank systems.\n\n\nCERTIFICATION\n\nI ceritify to the best of my knowledge, the information, and belief formed after reasonable inquiry, that the information submitted is true, accurate, and complete.
