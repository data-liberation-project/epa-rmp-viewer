      "SummaryText": "Background\n\n\n\nFirst Energy Generation Corporation is a utility that generates electricity at  the Allegheny Energy Units 3, 4 & 5 Allegheny Supply Company, LLC in Springdale Township, Allegheny County, Pennsylvania. In order to reduce NOx air emissions, Springdale installed a Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) system back in 2002.  This system removes NOx by catalytically reacting NOx with Ammonia to form Nitrogen and water vapor.  The First Energy Springdale facility currently uses aqueous ammonia at a concentration of 19%. The facility intends to change the concentration of the aqueous ammonia stored at the site and used in the SCR emission control system from 19% to 29.5%, which is the reason for developing this RMP Plan. The process will be applicable to the EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) rules due to the presence of 29.5 % Aqueous Ammonia.\n\n\n\nThe covered process includes: delivery tank truck unloading, storage, and SCR feed.  The aqueous ammonia storage tank maximum storage capacity is 18,398 gallons (90% capacity).  \n\n \n\nOverview of the RMP Prevention Program \n\n\n\nThe Springdale aqueous ammonia process is considered a Program 2 site by RMP rules.  Springdale uses a management of change and tri-annual compliance audit following EPA requirements.\n\n\n\nProcess protections are primarily those measures that will reduce, prevent or minimize a release from happening or, if it did happen, minimize the consequences of that threat.    These include:\n\n\n\n?    Procedures and plans such as operational SOPs and the Emergency Response Plan\n\n?    Training on operations, emergencies etc;\n\n        -Operators of the systems covered by the RMP plan have refresher training at least every 3 years.\n\n?    Regular maintenance/SOPS;        \n\n?    During deliveries, attendance by the operator and driver are continuous until the delivery is complete;\n\n?    No ammonia delivery tank trucks stored on site other than those in the process of being unloaded;\n\n?    Onsite wireless communication;\n\n?    Onsite trucks"

Warning signs\n\n\n\nIt is the policy of FirstEnergy to assure the safe operation of the facility which is designed and built to good engineering practices that incorporate methods or principles in accordance with applicable industry standards.  Some of these standards include ASME Code for Power Piping, B31.1, and ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code, Section VIII.   \n\n\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\n\n\nThere have been no reportable accidents in the past five years.  \n\n\n\nEmergency Response\n\n\n\nThere is a written emergency response plan that is coordinated with the Allegheny County Health Department, the Springdale LEPC and the local fire departments.  Selected site response personnel are HAZWOPER trained.    \n\n\n\nEmergency response planning has long been an integral part of operations at Springdale.  Regulations under OSHA, EPA, and PADEP have required the site to develop and implement procedures to plan for and respond to emergency situations at the plant whether due to natural disasters, storms, chemical release exposure or harm/damage resulting from potentially flammable or explosive materials.  \n\n\n\nThe RMP Emergency Response Plan includes the following sections:\n\n1.0    Facility Description                   "

Installation of ammonia detectors in the vicinity of the ammonia storage and unloading area and each SCR skid with visual and audio alarms for a 50 ppm concentration action level.\n\n? Installation of bollards where ammonia pipeline travels underground and emerges aboveground to prevent pipeline impacts.\n\n? Painting and installation of signage which labels the underground ammonia pipeline.\n\n? Purchased and supplied additional escape air canisters in the Control Room and ammonia unloading area.\n\n? Installation of a wind sock for instantaneous determination of wind direction for emergency planning purposes.\n\n"
