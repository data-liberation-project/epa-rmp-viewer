Royal Valley Growers Association chose Cold Storage Technologies \nto review it?s existing policy?s, procedures, documentation and refrigeration system for \ncompliance with new requirements. After the review Royal Valley Growers Association \ndecided to choose to implement an Ammonia industry standard for regulation \ncompliance. The IIAR Guidelines provide Ammonia Refrigeration specific detailed \ntemplates that are customized for a specific facility. Resources used in the process were \nInternational Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) Guidelines and RMP Pro 98 \nOCA Software by Dyadem. \n\nExecutive Summary organization includes; Certification statement, Summary, Detailed \nElements and Map of Potential Impact. A current copy of RMP, PSM and PHA materials \ncan be reviewed at the facility by contacting Ken Suemoto. Since the materials consist of \nseveral 2\" binders and facility drawings which are constantly updated as changes are \nimplemented, any reproduction becomes obsolete at the time of printing. \n\nPublication or sharing of OCA portions of RMP materials can be in violation of the \nChemical Safety Information, Site Security and Fuels Regulatory Relief Act (PL106-40). \nThis facility will not make specific RMP or OCA information available to the public until \na final ruling is made. General details only will be discussed at a required public meeting \nscheduled for 1/12/2000. Any accidental or authorized release of information in section \n2-5 by government officials violates Federal Law.\n\n1.

It is our policy to \nimplement appropriate controls and perform preventative maintenance to prevent \npossible releases of regulated substances.\n\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nOur facility's primary activities are consistent with SIC code 0723. Specific activities \ninclude washing, packing, pre-cooling and cold storage of grapes and tree fruit.  The \nflooded Ammonia refrigeration system provides 3 pre-coolers, 3 storage rooms 1 \nrefrigerated hallway/dock and a hydro-cooler.  Ammonia (anhydrous) refrigerant is the \nonly regulated substance present at our facility above thresholds requiring an RMP.  Total \nsystem NH3 capacity is estimated at 17,700 lbs..  Sulphur Dioxide seasonally used for \nfumigation is also present however quantities are under 300 lbs.\n\n3.    The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release \nScenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to \nlimit the distances for each reported scenario\n\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used the \nEPA's RMP Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration Reference Tables or Equations. No \nspecific unusual external events were included due to the facilities rural location, remote \nequipment location and recent construction meeting all applicable seismic and safety \ncodes. Potential impacts by forklift or other facility traffic typical to this type of operation \nwere included. Any catastrophic type events would result in the same impacts as \npresented in this OCA or less. The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen \nscenarios.

This is the combined capacity of the interconnected \nHigh Pressure Receivers.  The actual amount used for calculations was 15,000 lbs. since \nit was the closest table value available. The toxic liquid released is assumed to form a 1 \ncm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to \nevaporate over 10 minutes.  Evaporation at this rate is required but very unlikely.  The \nreleased quantity has been limited to 61% of the maximum capacity of the source by the \nflooded refrigeration system design characteristics and limited HPR capacity.  At Class F \natmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s windspeed, the maximum distance of 1.42 miles is \nobtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L. Tree?s surround the facility \nproviding an urban-like setting. Estimated population within this circle is 195. Population \nimpacted would be approximately 10% or less based on a plume footprint. This scenario \ndoes not represent historical performance of these types of refrigeration systems.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for Ammonia (anhydrous) involves a release from \nAmmonia Refrigeration .  The scenario involves the release of 3000 lb. of Ammonia \n(anhydrous).  Toxic liquid is assumed to be released to form a 1 cm deep pool from \nwhich evaporation takes place.
