The Ensign-Bickford Company has had 0 accidental releases of nitric acid in volumes greater than 5 gallons over the past five years.

Only passive mitigation measures (i.e. those measures that function without human, mechanical, or other energy input), such as dikes, may be considered to operate to minimize the effects of the release.  Given the constraints of the worst-case scenario, the estimated exposure distance, as determined using EPA's RMP Offsite Conssequence Analysis Guidance, is 7.9 miles.\n\nThe Ensign-Bickford Company utilizes both active and passive mitigation systems to limit the potential for a catastrophic event such as this to occur.  Our active mitigation systems, which were not used in determining the worst-case scenario, include routine inspections of storage vessels for evidence of structural defects before a release occurs; managerial and inventory controls that limit the frequency of deliveries of concentrated nitric acid; trained in-house emergency response teams equipped with personal protective equipment that can respond to a release and neutralize the released acid; and on-site equipment that can be employed to create dams, dikes and berms that can contain the potential spread of released material and improve neutralization and recovery efforts.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario - Regulated Toxic Chemicals\n\nThe RMP Rule also requires a facility to evaluate alternative release scenarios.  These scenarios involve a study of an event, which would be more likely to occur than the worst-case scenario, and must produce an endpoint off-site.  These scenarios may include: transfer hose releases due to splits or sudden hose uncoupling; failures at flanges joints, or welds; vessel over flow and spill or overpressurization; and shipping container mishandling or breakage.  Although several alternative release scenarios were evaluated, none of the scenarios could produce an off-site endpoint.

The following are brief summaries of these scenarios, including information about the key administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the exposure distances for each scenario:\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario - Regulated Toxic Chemicals\n\nWe have reviewed our process and have determined our worst-case release scenario is represented by a catastrophic failure caused by a detonation which releases the entire contents of the nitric acid (concentration > 80%) storage tank (located near the processing area).  The maximum volume of nitric acid (concentration > 80%) storage tank is 9,500 gallons, however the maximum quantity that could potentially be stored in this tank is 6,650 gallons.  This maximum inventory is administered by administrative controls and high level alarms.  The quantity of nitric acid that would be released under this scenario is 83,000 pounds.  The worst-case scenario assumes, for purposes of this study, the entire contents of the vessel is instantly released followed by volitization into the air.
