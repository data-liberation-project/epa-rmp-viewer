      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\n\n\nFacility Overview\n\nHexcel's Decatur facility manufactures polyacrylonitrile (PAN) fiber that is converted into carbon fiber at a Hexcel facility in Salt Lake City, Utah.  Carbon fiber is utilized in many important applications such as commercial and military aircraft structural components, satellites, recreation products (golf shafts, fishing rods and tennis rackets), and infrastructure applications (bridges) and industrial products (air tanks, computer housings, etc.). \n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nHexcel Decatur is strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is the foundation of our comprehensive accidental release prevention program.  Hexcel's program covers areas such as design, installation, operation procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  For example, our critical control valves are design to \"fail\" close, meaning in a loss of power or other incident they would close preventing a release.  In the unlikely event of a release, we are tied directly to the Emergency Management Association (EMA) who would coordinate an orderly response to minimize the impact.  Through the EMA, the Decatur Fire Department would provide emergency response to our site, if necessary.\n\n\nStationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe Hexcel Decatur facility is regulated under RMP due to onsite propane storage being in excess of the 10,000-lb. flammability RMP applicability threshold and onsite acrylonitrile storage being in excess of the 20,000-lb. toxicity RMP applicability threshold.  The propane storage system provides fuel for onsite equipment and consists of one storage tank with a maximum capacity of 30,000 gallons (127,200-lb).  The acrylonitrile storage system provides raw materials to the process and consists of a s"

The single largest vessel stores a maximum of 100,000 gallons (684,000-lb).    \n\n\nThe Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s)\n\nWorst-case and alternative release scenario assessments were conducted for the facility's single largest vessels based on US EPA's Offsite Consequences Analysis guidance.  For propane, a vapor cloud explosion scenario was considered for both releases and public receptors were determined to be located within the impact zone of both the worst-case and alternative releases.  The resulting worst-case and alternative release impact zones were (0.41) miles and (0.25) miles, respectively.  NFPA 58 guidance on restricting the maximum propane inventory stored within a vessel to 88% (at 60F) of the vessels rated capacity is followed at the facility to minimize the potential quantity released in an accident scenario.  \n\nFor acrylonitrile, both release scenarios were considered.  Public receptors were determined to be located within the impact zone of both the worst-case and alternative releases.  The resulting worst-case and alternative release scenarios included passive mitigation (cement dike around the tank), which limited the exposed surface area of the pool and thus reduced the release rate.  The impact zones were determined to be (1.70) miles and (0.40) miles, respectively.\n\nThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe facility's overall approach and commitment to chemical safety is demonstrated by 1) the existing procedural, training, management and maintenance systems already in place at the facility, and 2) the hazard assessment, prevention program and emergency response provisions implemented specifically for propane and acrylonitrile in response to the RMP requirements.  The management structure ensures safety is documented in the facility's RMP and includes compliance with applicable regulations, codes and sta"

Hexcel Decatur complies with OSHA standard 29CFR1910.119 (PSM).\n\nProcess Safety Information\nHexcel Decatur maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.  \n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodologies used to carry out these analyses include Hazop. The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of no more than three (3) years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\nHexcel Decatur maintains written operating procedures for the purposes of safely conducting activities within our processes.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a shutdown.  The information is reviewed at least annually and revised as necessary, and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nTraining\nHexcel Decatur has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Refresher training is also provided.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nHexcel Decatur carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others: pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Only q"

Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nManagement of Change\nWritten procedures are in place at Hexcel Decatur to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures.  Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification.\n\nPre-startup Reviews\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at Hexcel Decatur.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nAudits\nHexcel Decatur conducts compliance audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented.  These audits are carried out at least every three (3) years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.  We also conduct other safety, environmental, and health audits at least annually.\n\nIncident Investigation\nHexcel Decatur promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring. \n\nEmployee Participation\nHexcel Decatur truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.  Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  Hexcel has an active employee sug"
