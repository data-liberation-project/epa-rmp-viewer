      "SummaryText": "Accidental Release and Emergency Response Policy\n\nThe City of Columbus's Process Safety Management Plan (PSM) was prepared for the use of chlorine and sulfur dioxide handling at the Columbus Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP).  Chlorine and sulfur dioxide have never before been stored onsite at or above the threshold quantities of 2,500 pounds and 5,000 pounds respectively.  However, the plant operations will be storing these chemicals at volumes in excess of the threshold quantities in the near future for better economy and efficiency in wastewater treatment processes.  The PSM plan is designed and enforced to ensure the safety of city employees who work with chemicals in the event of an accidental release.  The Risk Management (RMP) builds on the PSM and is designed to minimize hazards to the community and the environment in the event an accidental from releases of hazardous chemicals.  The individual facility managers are responsible for the maintenance and enforcement of the RMP.\n\n\nColumbus Wastewater Treatment Plant and Regulated Substances Handling\n\nThe Columbus WWTP treats most of the wastewater of the City of Columbus, Indiana.  The processes at the plant include mixing, filtration, sedimentation, digestion, chlorination disinfection, and discharge to the East Fork of the White River.  Waterwater disinfection is provided by chlorination.  The only regulated substances used at the WWTP covered by this RMP are chlorine gas and sulfur dioxide (anhydrous).  Historically, these hazardous substances have always been stored on site at the Columbus WWTP in quantities less than the threshold quantities.   Since the WWTP facility in the near future plans to take advantage of the economy and efficiencies presented by increased quantities onsite of these substances above the threshold quantiities of 2,500 pounds for chlorine gas and 5,000 pounds for sulfur dioxide, this RMP is now submitted under Predictive Filing.  The facility will be purchasing cylinders of chlorine a"

A total of 10,000 pounds or more of each of these substances could be stored onsite at any one time in the future.\n\n\nWorst Case Release Scenario and Alternative Release Scenario for Chlorine and Sulfur Dioxide Gases\n\nThe worst case scenario for chlorine and sulfur dioxide involves the release of 2,000 pounds of these substances from a cylinder that has been damaged while transferring from the delivery truck to the loading dock in the storage building.  It is assumed that all 2,000 pounds are the substances are released in 10 minutes at a rate of 200 pounds per minute with no mitigation.  Assuming a wind speed of 1.5 meters per second and an atmospheric class F, the end point for Chlorine is 1.3 miles and 1.1 miles for Sulphur Dioxide from the WWTP facility.  The potential population affected within this urban area is approximately 21,000.  \n\nThe alternative scenario involves the same factors except that chlorine and sulfur dioxide is released from a valve failure inside of the processing room at the storage building.  The building is enclosed except for small exhaust vents at the floor level.  The building provides a mitigation factor of 55% and the release rates are 110 pounds per minute.  The end point distance from the facility is 0.2 miles.  The potential population affected within this urban area is approximately 400.  \n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe Columbus WWTP is covered by the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know (EPCRA) program and the OSHA Process Management Plan requirements.  The identified hazards from controlled chemicals at the facility are represented by potential releases of chlorine gas and sulfur dioxide gas from storage cylinders during unloading, overpressurization of process equipment, and failure of piping, valves, and other process equipment.  The facility has the following process controls in use:"

      "SummaryText": "relief valves, manual shutoff valves, alarms, procedures and rupture disks.  When the outer doors are closed, the chlorine and sulfur dioxide storage building provides some passive mitigation.  Pursuant to U.S. EPA RMP guidance, this is assumed to reduce the rate of chlorine and sulfur dioxide gases to the environmental by 55%.  Chlorine and sulfur dioxide leaks can be detected through the use of chlorine and sulfur dioxide detectors in the storage building.\n\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nThe Columbus WWTP has no record of any accidental releases of hazardous chemicals during the past 5 years.\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nThe Columbus WWTP has developed an Emergency Action Plan (EAP) to cover procedures in the event of a release of hazardous chemicals from its facility.  The EAP is included in the Bartholemew County Local Emergency Planning Commission emergency response and contingency plan.  The WWTP employees are trained on-the-job by senior staff at hiring with periodic updated training on a regular basis.  Employees receive training on responding to emergency releases of hazardous chemicals .\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Safety\n\nThe Columbus WWTP maintenance and operational staff will be trained by senior staff members in the contents of the Risk Management Plan.    There are no organizational changes planned at this time.  The increased storage of chlorine and sulfur dioxide at the facility will not affect any signicant changes in the established safety and training program."
