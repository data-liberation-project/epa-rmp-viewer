      "SummaryText": "In this distribution & manufacturing facility, we handle chlorine, which is considered hazardous by the EPA. The same properties that make chlorine valuable as a commodity also make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions during handling to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to our own personal health as well as that of our community. It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and State rules and regulations. Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle chlorine, the safety devices inherent in the design of this facility, the safe operating procedures that we use, and the training and experience of our personnel. Our emergency response program is based upon the Chlorine Institute's Pamphlet 64, Emergency Response Plan for Chlorine Facilities. The emergency response plan includes procedures for notification of the local fire and police departments who will assist in notification of any potentially affected neighbors. Wehave conducted chlorine response training at our facility for several HAZMAT teams in our area and we have over 20 of our own employees who are trained emergency responders. We utilize a chlorine railcar valve closure system which automatically closes all railcar valves during an emergency.\nWe utilize liquid chlorine to manufacture Sodium Hypochlorite which is used across the country to disinfect wastewater and to produce clean drinking water for all and have had no reportable chlorine releases in the last five years.\nShould there be any questions or concerns regarding the safe handling of chlorine at our facility, please contact our Operation's Manager Brad Budner at 630-243-2279 or our Safety Manager Dave Celovsky at 630-243-2260."
