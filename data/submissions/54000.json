Anhydrous ammonia is the only regulated substance present at the Pompano Beach, Florida facility.  The entire ammonia inventory is attributed to its use as a refrigerant.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies \nAssociated Grocers of Florida, Inc. is committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  Our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, and maintenance demonstrates this commitment, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, our highly trained refrigeration personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  We are also completely coordinated with Pompano Beach Fire Department which provides additional emergency response expertise.\n\nWorst Case Release Scenario and the Alternative Release Scenario\nWorst case and alternate release scenarios were developed using the methodology given in the EPA\u00bfs \u00bfRisk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration\u00bf.  The details of the chosen scenarios are located within the Risk Management Program that is located on site.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Program\nAssociated Grocers of Florida, Inc. has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR Part 68 of the EPA.  In addition, our facility is subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nAssociated Grocers of Florida, Inc. currently maintains a detailed record"

The analyses are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of 5 years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered process, Associated Grocers of Florida, Inc. maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved with the process.\n\nTraining\nAssociated Grocers of Florida, Inc. has a training program in place to train employees who are operating the process or are associated with the process.  Refresher training will be provided at least every three (3) years and more frequently as needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nAssociated Grocers of Florida, Inc. conducts documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations by a qualified refrigeration technician.  Training is provided to the personnel as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified during maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nManagement of Change\nWritten procedures are in place at Associated Grocers of Florida, Inc. to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures.  Process operators, maintenance personnel and all other employees whose job tasks are affected by a change in a process are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the changes.\n\nPre-startup Reviews\nPre-start up safety reviews relat"

These audits are carried out at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\nIncident Investigation\nAssociated Grocers of Florida, Inc. promptly investigates incidents that could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\n\nEmployee Participation\nAssociated Grocers of Florida, Inc. believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.  Company employees are encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  In addition, our employees have access to all information collected as part of the facility's compliance with the RMP Rule including information resulting from process hazard analyses.\n\nContractors\nOn occasion, our company hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities.
