With their help we have devised an Emergency Action Plan, a Hazard Communications Standard, and a Safety  & Health Program.  The Emergency Action Plan was first implemented on October 1, 2000.  The Emergency Coordinato has evaluated this elevator, identified know potential emergency situations, and developed and written procedures to deal with those identified situations.  The Plan includes (A) Immediate site and Overall area maps;(b) individual floor plans for all buildings with the entrances and exits marked; and A? Maps and diagrams showing all emergency escape routes and exits. The employees do training semi-annually on their specific tasks.The local Fire Departmetn, Law Enforcement and Emergency Medical Team has been invited to visit the elevator at least annually to become familiar wth the layout of the complex.
