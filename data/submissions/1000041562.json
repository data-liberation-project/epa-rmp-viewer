To achieve this end, FMI strives to operate its facilities in compliance with applicable federal, state, and local safety, health, and environmental regulations. \n\n\n\nFMI implements its emergency response policies to comply with the overall corporate policy of providing its workers with a safe workplace and of minimizing risk to the public. The safety of emergency and non-affected personnel is the highest priority; therefore, all procedures must be implemented in the appropriate manner (e.g., safely executed rescue, and medical activities). Protection of the environment is also a high priority. Once the issues of life, safety, and the environment are addressed, the secondary issues of property conservation and business recovery may be considered.\n\n\n\nFacility Description\n\n\n\nThe Inglewood Field is located at 5640 South Fairfax Ave in metropolitan Los Angeles, seven miles west-southwest of downtown Los Angeles. The field covers most of the Baldwin Hills. These hills project above the surrounding coastal plain by 300-400 feet. The Field is located in an unincorporated portion of Los Angeles County, except for a small northwest portion which lies within Culver City. \n\n\n\nThe gas plant is situated near the north end of the Field. The Field is bordered in this area by the Kenneth Hahn State Recreational Area. The nearest public roadway, La Cienega Boulevard, runs through the middle of the Inglewood Field in a north-south direction. The Kenneth Hahn State Recreational Area is approximately 900 feet (.17 mile) to the north. The State Recreation Area is considered a public receptor under the RMP regulation. \n\n\n\nThe gas plant is designed to convert sweet field gas into pipeline quality sales gas and natural gas liqu"

The objective of the regulation is to prevent unwanted releases of hazardous chemicals. To control these types of hazards, FMI has developed the necessary expertise, experiences, judgement, and proactive initiative within its workforce to properly implement and maintain an effective prevention program. Through compliance with the regulations and standards and with the guidance of the Certified Unified Program Agency (CUPA), the FMI Inglewood Gas Plant has implemented the requirements of the Prevention Program 3. \n\n\n\nAn effective program requires a systematic approach to evaluating the entire chemical process. Using this approach, the following components were considered in the evaluation in accordance with Title 19 CCR Section 2745.6 and 40 CFR part 68. \n\n\n\nThe twelve elements that make up the \n\nPrevention Program 3 are:\n\n\n\n1.

The various lines of defense that have been incorporated into the design and operation of the process to prevent or mitigate the release of hazardous chemicals have been evaluated and strengthened to assure their effectiveness at each level. FMI uses the proactive identification, evaluation, and mitigation for prevention of chemical releases that could occur as a result of failures in process, procedures, or equipment. The elements of the FMI's accidental release prevention program are summarized as follows:\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information - This includes complete and accurate written information concerning process chemicals, process technology, and process equipment essential to the company's PSM program and to a process hazard analysis. The process safety information includes information pertaining to the hazards of flammable compressed gases and the technology and equipment of the NGL system.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA) - Is an organized and systematic effort to identify and analyze the significance of potential hazards associated with the processing or handling of flammable or toxic materials. The PHA provides information that will assist the company and its employees in making decisions for improving safety and reducing the consequences of unwanted or unplanned releases of flammable or toxic materials. The PHA has been updated and can be found in Appendix J. \n\n\n\nOperating Procedures - As part of the PSM program, all procedures for operating and maintaining the process equipment are documented and accessible to employees whose work involves this equipment.

The company utilizes an established training program that ensures the training and competency of employees, whose jobs require them to perform work, which affect the processing system. \n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity - Under the PSM program, equipment used to process, store, or handle flammable or toxic materials has to be designed, constructed, installed, and maintained to minimize the release of such chemicals. As required, elements of the mechanical integrity program include identifying and categorizing equipment and instrumentation as faulty or potentially faulty, inspections and tests and their frequency; maintenance procedures; training of maintenance personnel; criteria for acceptable test results; and documentation of manufacturer recommendations for equipment and instrumentation.\n\n\n\nManagement of Change - Contemplated changes to a process must be evaluated thoroughly to fully assess their impact on employee safety and health and to determine needed changes \n\nto operating procedures. The company has established and implemented procedures to manage changes (except for \"replacements in kind\") to process chemicals, technology equipment and procedures, and changes to facilities that affect the existing manufacturing system.\n\n\n\nPre-Startup Safety Review - As one of the requirements of CalARP/RMP, FMI is required to perform a pre-startup safety review for new facilities, and for modified facilities when the modification is significant enough to require a change in the process safety information. A PHA will be performed prior to start up for new processes that require a hazardous material above the regulatory threshold.

An audit is a technique used to gather sufficient facts and information, including statistical information, to verify compliance with the CalARP standards. The audit includes an evaluation of the design and effectiveness of the system and a field inspection of the safety and health conditions and practices to verify that the program elements are effectively implemented.\n\n\n\nIncident Investigation - A crucial part of FMI's program is a thorough investigation of incidents to identify the chain of events and causes so that corrective measures can be developed and implemented. Accordingly, FMI has an incident investigation program that requires the investigation of each incident that resulted in, or could have reasonably resulted in, release of a flammable or toxic material.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation Plan - FMI has developed written procedures to include employees in the development, implementation, and management of these program elements.\n\n\n\nHot Work & Safe Work Practices \n\n- FMI has established safe work practices in place to ensure worker and process safety. Details of both hot work and safe work practices are detailed in the PSM. \n\n\n\nContractor Safety - FMI, in following OSHA's PSM Guidelines, requires that a contractor's safety program be evaluated, that contractor employees be trained regarding potential process hazards and emergency procedures, and that appropriate records are maintained. Contractors who perform work in and around processes that involve flammable gases or liquids are certified by FMI to accomplish the desired job tasks without compromising the safety and health of any employee at the facility.\n\n\n\nExternal Events Analysis Information - Pursuant to the requirements of California Health & Safety Code, Title 19, Division 2, Chapter 4.5, ?2745.7(q); the following "

      "SummaryText": " the design and operation of the process to prevent or mitigate the release of hazardous chemicals have been evaluated and strengthened to assure their effectiveness at each level. FMI uses the proactive identification, evaluation and mitigation for prevention of chemical releases that could occur as a result of failures in process, procedures or equipment. \n\n\n\nRelief and/or safety valves;\n\nAutomatic Fire Extinguishing System;\n\nGas Detectors;\n\nFire Protection System;\n\nEmergency Shutdown Systems (ESD);\n\nGas Leak Alarms;\n\nEmergency Release Containment System; and\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program Summary\n\n\n\nFMI has developed written emergency response procedures to address all elements that may be encountered during planning, responding or following up to an emergency at the Inglewood facility. Application of the emergency response procedures ensures compliance with Cal/OSHA CCR Title 8, Section 5189 Process Safety Management (PSM) of Acutely Hazardous Materials and the emergency response element of the PSM. The basic concept of FMI's emergency procedures are to provide a comprehensive approach for managing emergencies. The four elements of this approach are prevention, preparedness, response, and recovery.\n\n\n\nThe Emergency Response Action Plan (ERAP) is designed to be applicable to any type of emergency that may affect FMI and based on the concept that the elements of emergency response are similar, regardless of the hazard. It contains pages from the Integrated Contingency Plan (ICP). The ERAP contains the following sections:\n\n\n\n1. Facility Information;\n\n2. Notifications;\n\n3. Initial Response Actions;\n\n4. Evacuation Plans/Emergency Shutdown Procedures;\n\n5. Oil Pipeline Route; and\n\n6. Ballona Creek Boom and Staging Locations.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nFMI enforces continuous improvements to safety and health and tracks training to ensure commitment to safe working practices and the protection of the employees and the environment.\n\n\n\nFinally, because the P"
