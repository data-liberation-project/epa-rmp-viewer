This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training and consideration of safety in the design, operation, and maintenance of the sulfur dioxide process.  Sun-Maid Ripperdan - Facility's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substance.\n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nSun-Maid Ripperdan - Facility is located at 27400 Avenue 6, Madera, California.  The regulated substance managed at the facility is sulfur dioxide.  At most, nine (9) one-ton cylinders are kept on-site for a total of 18,000 pounds (lbs.).  \n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nAs part of the implementation of this CalARP Program, key Prevention Program elements were documented and implemented by Sun-Maid Ripperdan - Facility to manage process safety issues associated with the use of sulfur dioxide.  Furthermore, common industry standards, policies, and procedures are currently utilized to ensure safe practices are being performed.\n\nThe facility is limited to a maximum intended inventory of sulfur dioxide of nine (9) one-ton cylinders (2,000 lbs. each) are kept on-site for a total of 18,000 lbs.  The regulated substance is over the 500-lb. state threshold for CalARP Program.  As a result, the sulfur dioxide covered process is subject to CalARP Program 3.\n\n\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT SUMMARY/OFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\n\n\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario Results Summary\n\nScenario Description: One worst-case analysis has been defined and modeled for the sulfur dioxide process.  The results can be found in the Hazard Assessment documentation located in the 2020 CalARP/RMP/PSM Program 3 - Five Year Update Binder.\n\n\n\nAlternative Release Scenario Results Summary\n\nScenario Description: An alternative release scenario was modeled.  The results can "

In addition to the safety practices of the company and plant personnel to make this worst-case event non-credible, it should also be recognized that there are inherent analysis assumptions that make the results of the atmospheric dispersion analysis appear worse than what would actually be expected during such event.\n\nIn addition to the use of conservative analysis assumptions that over-predict the effects of a potential release, other characteristics of the facility and site serve to minimize the potential risks associated with a sulfur dioxide release:\n\n?There are process valves to permit isolation of any leaks in place.\n\n?The system undergoes scheduled maintenance to reduce the likelihood of catastrophic failures.\n\n?Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) is used by facility personnel, as necessary\n\n?Well-designed Relief System and Relief Valves \n\n?Gas Detection Systems and Alarms\n\n?Safety Showers/Eyewash Stations\n\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nFor any accidental release meeting the five-year accident history reporting criteria of 19 CCR ?2750.9, the owner or operator shall submit the data required under ?2745.5, and ?2745.7 with respect to that accident within six months of the release or by the time the RMP is updated under ?2745.10, whichever is earlier.  19 CCR ?2750.9 states:\n\nThe owner or operator shall include in the five-year accident history all accidental releases from covered processes that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in"

This facility will rely upon the local emergency hazardous materials response team and the local Fire Department for responses to uncontrolled releases of sulfur dioxide.  In accordance with 19 CCR ?2765.1, the facility is not required to have an Emergency Response Plan in place.  However, it is required to have appropriate mechanisms in place for notifying emergency responders when there is a need for response.  These mechanisms are described below. \n\n \n\nThe Facility submitted a Hazardous Material Inventory (HMI) Business Plan via California Environmental Reporting System (CERS) in November 27, 2019.  The Facility has procedures in place to evacuate the facility and notify responders when there is a need for a response.  A current copy of the Emergency Action Plan (EAP) can be found with the Safety Manager.\n\n\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nSeveral studies have been conducted to examine mitigation measures to improve safety at the facility.  These studies include the following: Hazard Review and Hazard Assessment, performed on July 8, 2020.  In addition, a Compliance Audit was performed on October 5, 2018.  \n\nAny outstanding recommendations from these studies will have been addressed by January 2023\n\n\n\nEXTERNAL EVENTS ASSESSMENT\n\n\n\nPursuant to the requirements of California Code of Regulations, Title 19, Division 2, Chapter 4.5, Section ?2745.6 (l), general events external to the plant that can conceivably cause a release of sulfur dioxide were addressed by the July 8, 2020 for the sulfur dioxide covered process.
