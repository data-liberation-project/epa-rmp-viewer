Ammonia is stored in pressure vessels, piping, evaporators and miscellaneous equipment.   The maximum amount of ammonia stored in any one vessel is approximately 8,000 pounds.\n\nThe Crete facility meets Program 3 eligibility requirements of the RMP Rule because the facility is subject to the OSHA PSM standard.  \n\nThe prevention program implemented at the Crete facility was developed to meet OSHA PSM 29 CFR 1910.119 requirements.  In accordance with 40 CFR 68.175 the following is a summary of the prevention program in place at the Crete facility.\n\nMost recent process hazard analysis:  Completed February 2010\nOperating procedures: Last reviewed February 2010\nTraining programs: Last reviewed January 2010\nMaintenance procedures: Last reviewed January 2010\nManagement of change procedures: Last reviewed January 2010\nCompliance audit:  Last conducted January 2010\nEmployee participation plans:  Last reviewed January 2010\nHot work permit procedures:  Last reviewed December 2009\nContractor safety procedures:  Last reviewed December 2009\nContractor safety performance:  Last evaluated December 2009\n\nThe Crete facility has an emergency response program in place which outlines the actions to be taken for a facility evacuation, ammonia release, or natural disaster.  A training schedule has also been established to train employees on the emergency response program.  The Crete Fire Department and Police Department have been designated as the responding agencies.  Evacuation procedures are in place for an ammonia release with meeting locations outlined.  \n\nWithin the last 5 years, no accidental releases of ammonia, which resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage has occurred on site, or known deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage, have occurred"
