The purpose of the plan is to establish policies and procedures for protecting the health and safety of employees, contractors, and visitors, and to comply with all applicable federal and state regulations.  Training of employees and contractors includes providing a copy of the plan upon initial employment at Lamb Weston Delhi and reviewing it for their specific assignment, annual refresher training for current employees, and review for all whenever the plan is changed.  In addition, plant evacuation drills are conducted on a regular basis. \r\n\r\nThe plan is comprehensive enough to deal with all types of emergencies specific to the Lamb Weston Delhi facility and defines the following:\r\n\r\n\u00bf\tHow to conduct activities in a manner that protects the safety of employees, the public, and the environment\r\n\t\r\n\u00bf\tPreferred means for reporting fires, hazardous materials incidents, medical, and any other emergencies\r\n\t\r\n\u00bf\tEmergency escape procedures and emergency escape route assignments\r\n\t\r\n\u00bf\tProcedures to account for all employees including contractors and visitors\r\n\t\r\n\u00bf\tNames of agencies and persons to contact for further assistance, information, or explanation of the plan\r\n\t\r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\n\r\nThe Lamb Weston Delhi facility takes seriously its responsibility for the safety of its employees, neighbors, and community.

ConAgra Foods Lamb Weston is committed to providing its employees and the surrounding community with a safe and healthy environment.  The Risk Management Program is an integral part of our strong commitment to sustainable development, which means development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.  Sustainable Development requires reductions in the generation of wastes and pollutants, protection of clean air and clean water, sustainable protection of the land, and the wise use of energy.  It requires employee commitment, strategic thinking, and innovation, the involvement of our suppliers, new technology and enhanced production processes.  \r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF FACILITY AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\r\n\r\nThe Lamb Weston processing facility in Delhi, Louisiana processes raw sweet potatoes into finished consumer frozen potato products.  The plant site consists of a main processing plant, primary water treatment facility, and refrigerated cold storage.  Activities are conducted at this site during all months of the year.\r\n\r\nThe potato processing cycle includes a wide array of steps.  The plant purchases the majority of its potatoes from local growers.  Since potatoes have a single growing season, they must be held under controlled storage conditions.  Prior to processing, the potatoes are separated by size and processing specifications.  The inspected, washed, peeled, and hand-trimmed potatoes are cut, blanched and fried.  The final products are frozen, packaged and prepared for shipping.\r\n\r\nThe freezing process where finished products are conveyed through the freezer to be quickly cooled and frozen is made possible by refrigeration systems containing anhydrous ammonia, an EPA-regulated chemical.

The OSHA-PSM and the EPA-RMP plans work together to assure that potential on-site hazards and off-site consequences are identified and controlled to the best of our ability, and that the processes are meeting health and safety objectives.\r\n\r\nThe RMP Prevention Program is comprised of the 13 elements of OSHA's PSM program: Employee Participation, Process Safety Information, Process Hazard Analysis, Management of Change, Pre-Startup Safety Review, Operating Procedures, Hot Work Permits, Employee Training, Incident Investigation, Mechanical Integrity, Emergency Planning & Response, Contractor Safety, and Audits.  \r\n\r\nEmployee participation brought together people that knew and understood the system, from practical experience as well as their technical knowledge, to develop the Plan.  Process safety information is a collection of data that allows us to identify and understand the hazards posed by our inventory.  Representatives from our skilled work force and management, who understood the process being analyzed including the engineering behind the covered process, conducted the process hazard analysis.  This analysis identifies potential process failures that could result in an uncontrolled release of ammonia.   \r\n\r\nIn order to safely manage changes that need to be made to the processes containing ammonia, a system of checks and balances has been established.  This system will evaluate safety prior to the work being done, and provide a solid review of the system to assure that once started, it will run as designed.
