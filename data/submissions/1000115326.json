The incident investigation is started promptly but no later than 48 hours after the event. The LADWP promptly addresses and resolves all recommendations and implements the recommendations in a timely manner to prevent an incident recurrence. All incident investigation reports are retained on LADWP file for at least a period of five years from the date the reports are completed.\n\nFive-year Accident History Summary\n\nNo accidental releases of ammonia gas or solution that meet the reporting requirement of the EPA's RMP have occurred at this facility for the past five years.\n\nEmergency Response Program Summary\n\nThe HGS facility is a non-responding facility, which means that the facility employees will not respond to aqueous ammonia accidental release.  Instead, the facility has coordinated with local response agencies to respond to any aqueous ammonia release than may occur at the HGS facility.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nAs part of the Risk Management Program update, a hazard review was performed in May 2024 for the ammonia handling system. The hazard review was performed using the Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) technique and covered both equipment and procedures used for the ammonia handling system. Although the review has not identified any equipment and procedural changes to improve ammonia safety at this point, the hazard review will be completed again in the future i"

For each internal audit, the audit team completes a Compliance Audit Certification Page and a Compliance Audit Checklist. The Compliance Audit Certification Page provides process identification, the dates of the audit, team members, and certification by the audit leader and the Plant Manager.

They are consistent with the ammonia safety information. Written operating procedures included in the facility's Operation and Maintenance Manual include: \n\n- Delivery of Ammonia\n- Initial Startup Procedure\n- Normal Operation\n- Normal Shutdown\n- Temporary Operations (Does not exist, protocol to conduct Normal Shutdown)\n- Emergency Operations (Does not exist, protocol to conduct Normal Shutdown)\n- Emergency Shutdown\n- Startup Following Emergency Shutdown\n\nTraining \n\nLADWP ensures that each employee presently operating the ammonia process, and each employee newly assigned to this process, has been trained or tested for competence on the topics listed below that pertain to their duties.

All spills are conveyed to a wastewater sump for treatment prior to discharge. Flashing lights and audible alarms at the tanks and in the main control room are activated when the ammonia gas monitors detect the gas concentration above 20 parts per million in the surrounding area.\n\nEmission Control\n\nAmmonia solution is pumped from storage tanks to two evaporator and air mixing chamber systems, one for each HRSG. These systems are located outside of the Power House building, along the southern wall at the southwestern corner. Heated air is provided to the air-mixing chamber by dilution air fans and heaters. The air/water vapor/ammonia mixture is then piped to the Ammonia Injection Grid (AIG) in the HRSG using an arrangement of nozzles to assure an even distribution throughout the flue gas.  The flue gas enters the SCR bed where the catalyst promotes the reaction.  Flow control valves operated as a function of combustion turbine load, the turbine exhaust flow rate, and the final stack exhaust nitrogen oxide concentrations control the feed rate of the ammonia solution.\n\nChemical Feed\n\nAmmonia solution from the storage tanks is automatically fed to a 200-gallon dilution tank where the solution is further diluted to 0.3%. The diluted solution is pumped to the boiler feed water system at a flow rate of up to 3 gallon per hour and 300-psig, based on the specific conductivity measurements of the feed water at the boiler feed pump discharge.

The truck parks within a sloped containment area, which drains to a sump in the adjacent containment dike. The solution unloading to the storage tanks is done through a quick fill connection.

Instead, the facility has coordinated with local response agencies (City of Los Angeles Fire Department) to respond to any ammonia release that may occur at the HGS.\n\nGeneral Description of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substance\n\nHGS is located in Wilmington, California. The HGS is a gas-fired electricity generating facility that supplies electrical power to the LADWP system. The facility is managed and operated around the clock. There is a minimum crew of three operators and one shift supervisor. On a normal day shift, there are approximately 67 on-site personnel including Operations, Technical, Maintenance, Clerical, and Warehouse staff.\n\nThe facility consists of two main natural gas or distillate fired combustion turbines. These combustion turbines exhaust hot gases through two Heat Recovery Steam Generators (HRSG) to produce steam to drive a conventional 80 MW steam turbine. The HGS facility also installed five additional simple cycle natural gas fired turbines in 2001. These combustion turbines are capable of generating about 47 MW each of power.\n\nThe main combustion turbines and the five simple cycle turbines installed in 2001 are equipped with selective catalytic reduction (SCR) units to control emissions of oxides of nitrogen (NOx), a combustion byproduct that is a precursor to ozone. In the presence of a catalyst housed in the SCR, ammonia (NH3) gas, a reducing agent, is injected into the flue gas to react with NOx to form nitrogen gas (N2) and water vapor (H2O) according to the following chemical reactions:\n      \n   4 NH3   +   6 NO --> 5  N2   +   6 H2O\n   8 NH3   +   6 NO2 --> 7  N2   +   12 H2O\n   \nAmmonia Process Description\n\nThe ammonia solution storage and supply system (ammonia process) has the dual function of injecting ammonia for NOx emissions control in each heat recovery steam generator and exhaust from five simple cycle combustion turbines and also for pH control of the boiler"

The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (LADWP) also uses ammonia for reducing the emissions of oxides of nitrogen from its Harbor Generating Station (HGS). Storing and handling large quantities of ammonia can create hazardous situations. LADWP prioritizes safety, as well as safe ammonia storage and handling. The LADWP HGS ammonia handling process is subject to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program and Plan and also to the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program. The facilities subject to the EPA and CalARP regulations are required to prepare and update Risk Management Plans (RMPs). The RMP is to include policies and procedures followed to safely operate the facility and the actions which will be taken by the facility in an event of an emergency.
