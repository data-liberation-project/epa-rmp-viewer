Pictsweet's safety and environmental policies are administered by the Plant Manager, Plant Engineer, and Human Resources Manager, who conduct periodic inspections of the facility to ensure compliance, and oversee the entire safety and environmental programs, including the PSM/RMP/CalARP Program. \r\n\r\nIn the event of an ammonia related emergency, it is the policy of Pictsweet to alert the in-house Emergency Response Team and respond to the emergency. If an ammonia release could potentially impact the local community, evacuation will be handled by the fire department.\r\n\r\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\r\n\r\nThe Pictsweet facility is located at 732 S. Hanson Way in Santa Maria, California, which is located approximately 0.6 miles south of Highway 166 and 2.4 miles west of Highway 101. The area immediately surrounding the facility is rural with a mixture of commercial, agricultural, and residential areas. \r\n\r\nThe primary business of Pictsweet is to process, freeze, and store vegetables. In order to conduct operations, the facility maintains a refrigeration system containing approximately 94,276 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.  The refrigeration system, consisting of piping, valves, and equipment, cycles ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, and then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration for the processing and storage of frozen vegetables.  Typical operating conditions range from 3\" Hg on the low pressure side of the system to 150 psig on the high side.\r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\n\r\nA"

Some of the specific activities in the prevention program include:\r\n\u00bf\tProcess safety information is provided to all applicable employees upon hire and is accessible at all times.\r\n\u00bf\tIn depth process hazard analyses are completed every five years by qualified personnel using techniques approved under the PSM standard.\r\n\u00bf\tWritten operating procedures (kept up to date) are used for training and guiding the work of operators.\r\n\u00bf\tTraining is provided to all employees upon hire, and refresher training is given at least every three years or upon request.\r\n\u00bf\tOperators, mechanics, and contractor personnel are qualified, trained in the general hazards in the facility, and informed of any temporary situations affecting safety.\r\n\u00bf\tPre-startup safety reviews are conducted to insure that conditions for safe operation have been satisfied prior to starting new or modified equipment.\r\n\u00bf\tA program is in place to maintain the mechanical integrity of the process, which includes written procedures, training requirements, equipment deficiency requests from employees, work orders, scheduled maintenance, and documentation.\r\n\u00bf\tA hot work permit system assures that work is done safely and properly.\r\n\u00bf\tA management of change system is in place to ensure that changes are managed safely.\r\n\u00bf\tIncidents are investigated and actions are taken as part of a continuous improvement effort.\r\n\u00bf\tRoutine in-house audits are conducted to assure that safe practices are being followed.\r\n\r\nThis systematic approach to proces"

The training, qualifications, and safety awareness of our operations, maintenance, and management personnel are a key element in reducing and mitigating accidents. \r\n\r\nIn addition, the Pictsweet ammonia refrigeration system has many safety features.  Much of the safety of the system is inherent in the policies and procedures that govern the operation of the system.  It is important to note that the refrigeration system has been designed with several safety features to prevent the accidental release of ammonia. For example, the compressors are equipped with safety mechanisms that will cause the units to shut down if operating conditions exceed designated safety limits.  Also, level indicators, alarms, and switches are installed in key points within the system to monitor the supply of liquid ammonia and to ensure that a vessel is not overfilled.  Pressure relief valves on all pressure vessels protect the equipment from overpressurization.\r\n\r\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nAn investigation into the facility's accident history conducted at the time of the Process Hazard Analysis Revalidation (July 2-3, 2013) revealed that there have been five \"near misses\" at the facility over the past five years (July 2008 - July 2013).  On February 2, 2009, facility personnel discovered a pinhole leak in a Plate Freezer. On July 22, 2009, while performing maintenance on Plate Freezer #4A, the suction line interfered with the frame and broke off at the plate. On November 8, 2009, facility personnel discovered a pinhole leak in Coil #2 at IQF #4. On July 19, 2012, boxes of product were on the floor under the suction hose connection to Plate Freezer #3A. When the plates were lowered, the suction hose connection cracked. On January 24, 2013, facility personnel discovered a packing leak from a globe valve on the discharge line to the condensers.\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\r\n\r\nThe facility has an Emerge"

This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year. This Plan was reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM/RMP/CalARP regulations.  \r\n\r\nPictsweet personnel circulate throughout the plant, taking note of unusual conditions in any portion of the system. In the event that an ammonia leak is discovered, the person nearest to the leak will alert any personnel in the immediate area who are unaware of the danger, the Plant Engineer, and the Plant Services Manager. The Incident Commander will determine what procedures and personnel are necessary to remedy the problem. Emergency agencies will also be notified as necessary as outlined in the Emergency Response Plan and displayed in Table 4.\r\n\r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\n\r\nThe Process Hazard Analysis Revalidation, performed on July 2-3, 2013, generated mitigation measures (recommendations) to improve safety at the Pictsweet facility located in Santa Maria, California.  The mitigation measures include additional training, key maintenance related tests/inspection, and enhanced emergency response policies and procedures.  The Pictsweet safety committee is planning to complete several items, including the recommendations, over the next year, as a continual effort to provide a safe work environment for their employees.  These changes include the following items:\r\n\r\n1. Continue to train all employees in the facility Safety Plan/Programs.\r\n2.
