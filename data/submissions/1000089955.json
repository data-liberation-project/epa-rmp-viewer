Employees participate on Process Hazards Analysis (PHA) teams and have access to all hazard and operability (HAZOP) information and recommendations. This information along with updated Operation Manuals are available in assigned locations throughout the facility. Operation manuals are developed, updated, and reviewed by Operations personnel and the Training Department. These Operation Manuals assist employees in refresher training and Operator Recertification Programs.\n\n\n\nSafety meetings are held on a regular basis for Operations, Maintenance, Administration, and Contract personnel. Topics chosen are relevant to respective personnel assigned duties, and general and specific information is provided as informational instruments to enhance employee participation in facility-wide safety performance.\n\n\n\nPROCESS SAFETY INFORMATION\n\n\n\nShintech keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe process operations. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information. Specific departments within Shintech are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.\n\n\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in safety data sheets. For specific process areas, Shintech has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) in the operation manuals for each process unit.

Procedures are maintained current by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made to the process. In addition, the Shintech operating procedures provide guidance on how to respond to events that result in exceeding safe operating limits for specific process or equipment parameters. The written operating procedures are readily available to operators in the process units and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\n\n\nTRAINING\n\n\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, Shintech has implemented a training program for all employees involved in operating a process. New employees receive basic training in Shintech operations. After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks. After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration, etc.) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently. In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures in order to maintain skills and knowledge at an acceptable level. As required per 40 CFR 68.71, this refresher training is conducted every three years or more often if determined to be necessary. Operators are given the opportunity to take part in more frequent refresher training if desired. This training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\n\n\nCONTRACTORS\n\n\n\nShintech uses contractors to supplement its work force during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.

This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, etc. This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to enhance safety features in the process.\n\n\n\nPROCESS HAZARD ANALYSIS\n\n\n\nShintech has a comprehensive PHA program to recognize and control hazards associated with the process. Within this program, the existing covered processes and potential future processes are systematically examined.\n\n\n\nShintech primarily uses the HAZOP analysis technique to perform these evaluations. HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques available. The analyses are conducted using a team of personnel who exhibit operating, maintenance, and process engineering experience and expertise. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as recommends accident prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are warranted.\n\n\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not deviate significantly from the original design safety features, Shintech periodically updates and revalidates its PHAs. These periodic reviews will be conducted at least every five years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating. The results and recommendations from these updates are documented and retained.\n\n\n\nOPERATING PROCEDURES\n\n\n\nShintech maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process. These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent trai"

In addition, Shintech evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor. Shintech personnel monitor contractor performance to evaluate the level at which contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\n\n\nPRE-STARTUP SAFETY REVIEWS\n\n\n\nShintech conducts a pre-startup safety review for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information. This review provides that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service. This review provides one additional check to corroborate that construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready. The review team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness. A review involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function.\n\n\n\nMECHANICAL INTEGRITY\n\n\n\nShintech uses established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition.

This practice assesses suitability of new equipment for its intended use and establishes that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.\n\n\n\nMANAGEMENT OF CHANGE\n\n\n\nShintech has a comprehensive system to manage process changes. This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented. Changes are reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards, and (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change. Affected chemical hazard information, process technology information, equipment information, and procedures are updated to incorporate these changes. All affected employees are informed of, and trained in, the change prior to start-up of the"

The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident. The investigation team, which can include contractors, will document its findings, develop recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forward these results to Shintech's management for resolution. Corrective actions will be taken in response to the investigation team's findings, and recommendations will be tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each finding or recommendation will be documented, and the investigation results will be reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings. Incident investigation reports will be retained for at least five years so that the reports can be reviewed during future PHAs and PHA revalidations. \n\n\n\nCOMPLIANCE AUDITS\n\n\n\nShintech will periodically conduct audits to confirm the procedures and practices required by the chemical accident prevention program are being implemented. Compliance audits are conducted at least every three years. The findings are forwarded to Shintech management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are retained.\n\n\n\nHOT WORK PERMITS\n\n\n\nThe facility's hot work procedure requires that detailed permitting activities take place before, during, and after any job that has the potential to provide a source of ignition. The permit is followed through to completion of the work and those permits are maintained on site. The facility implements other work permits as necessary to assure safe "

Examples of these include (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous materials before process piping or equipment is opened, (4) a permit and procedure to control welding and other spark-producing activities, and (5) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space. These procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to foster that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\n\n\n\nCHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nThe processes at the facility have hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation. The accident prevention program summarized previously is applied to the facility. Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios of releases of RMP regulated chemicals caused by equipment failures or human errors.\n\n\n\nIn addition to the accident prevention program activities, Shintech has many safety features to help prevent the accidental releases of regulated substances in the facility. These safety features help to prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human error. These features include but are not limited to: \n\n\n\n*Operating parameter monitors with alarms\n\n*Process relief systems\n\n*Isolation valves (manual or automated)\n\n*Release detection\n\n*Area ambient air monitoring system\n\n*Automated control systems\n\n*Process relief valves to prevent overpressure damage to equipment\n\n*Scrubbers to neutralize chemical releases\n\n*Manual and automatic valves to permit isolation of vessels\n\n*Automated shutdown systems for specific "

A fundamental part of this commitment is the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances in and around the facility. Within the past five years, there has not been a release of a regulated substance from a regulated process that has resulted in any off-site impacts. In accordance with the requirements of 40 CFR 68.42, information relating to any accidental release that results in death, injury, significant property damage, or known off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage will be documented for the facility and provided in future RMP submittals.\n\n\n\nShintech will hold a public meeting to provide information required under 40 CFR 68.42(b), no later than 90 days after any RMP reportable accident resulting in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or know offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage. \n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\n\n\n\nShintech maintains a written Emergency Response Plan (ERP), which aims to protect employees, public health, and the environment. The purpose of the ERP is to minimize potential adverse impacts on the facility and surrounding areas in the event of an emergency. The plan consists of procedures for responding to such emergencies as fires, explosions, hazardous gas or liquid releases, natural disasters, and terrorist threats. The plan addresses all aspects of emergency response including coordination with mutual aid organizations, timely notification of authorities, maintenance of proper documentation, and guidelines"
