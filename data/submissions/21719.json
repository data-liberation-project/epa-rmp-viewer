This\n\ncommitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training\n\npersonnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of our\n\nprocesses. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of\n\nregulated substances. However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will respond to control\n\nand contain the release.\n\n\n\nThe Bridgeport gas plant, located 3< miles west of Bridgeport, Texas, operates a variety of\n\nprocesses to produce pipeline quality natural gas and natural gas liquids (such as ethane, propane\n\nand butane). The processes used include glycol dehydration, amine sweetening to remove CO2,\n\npropane refrigeration, fractionation, cryogenic processing and related utilities. Some of the\n\nchemicals produced or used include methane, ethane, propane, butane, triethylene glycol and\n\ndiethanolamine.\n\n\n\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS RESULTS\n\n\n\nNo H2S is stored, used or processed at the facility. There are no toxic chemicals stored at the\n\nBridgeport gas plant above the EPA Threshold Quantity. The threshold quantity is the level set by\n\nEPA for each toxic or flammable chemical which if stored at the site requires compliance with the\n\nEPA's Risk Management Program regulations. Generally, if the amount of a substance stored on-site is less than the threshold quantity, there is little danger to the public.\n\n\n\nThere are several flammable substances stored at the site above the 10,000 pound threshold\n\nquantity for flammables. Examples of flammables at the site include methane, ethane, propane and\n\nbutane. The worst-case scenario associated with a release of flammable materials is a vapor cloud\n\nexplosion (VCE) involving the full inventory of the 75,000 gallon storage tank containing\n\npropane. Based on EPA analysis, the distance away from t"

      "SummaryText": "he plant affected in this worst-case\n\nscenario would be approximately 0.55 miles. \n\n\n\nA more probable release scenario would involve the release of propane from a transfer line during\n\nloading operations. Based on loading a truck in one hour, we would release approximately 1500\n\ngallons in 10 minutes, at which time our operators would detect and isolate the line or gas\n\ndetection would shut down the plant. The affected distance based on EPA guidance is\n\napproximately 0.15 miles, or approximately 790 feet. \n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe Bridgeport gas plant has a very active accident prevention program in place, primarily based\n\non the OSHA Process Safety Management regulations. A summary of some of the accident\n\nprevention programs that are in place follows.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\n\n\nThe Bridgeport gas plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain\n\nsafe operation of the processes. These documents include material safety data sheets for all\n\nchemicals on-site, up-to-date process and instrumentation drawings, equipment data sheets on all\n\nvessels and equipment and process parameter safety limits. This information, in combination with\n\nwritten procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and\n\nmaintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure\n\nthat safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\n\n\nThe Bridgeport gas plant has a very comprehensive program to ensure that hazards associated\n\nwith the various processes are identified and controlled. Each process is systematically examined\n\nto identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards. The\n\nHAZOP analysis technique and the what-if/checklist methods are used to perform these\n\nevaluations. The analyses are conducted using a team of people with operating, maintenance,\n\nengineering and safety experience. T"

All\n\napproved recommendations from the PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed. \n\n\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate\n\nsignificantly from the original design and to ensure that new technology is used where\n\nappropriate, the Bridgeport gas plant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis\n\nresults. These periodic reviews will be conducted at least every 5 years.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\n\n\nThe Bridgeport gas plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process\n\noperations. These procedures are used as reference by experienced operators, and provide a basis\n\nfor consistent training of new operators. These procedures are periodically reviewed and certified\n\nas current and accurate.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\n\n\nOur employees at the Bridgeport plant have an average experience of 18-20 years. This level of\n\nexperience provides a great level of expertise throughout the facility at all times of the day.\n\nOngoing training is accomplished through routine safety meetings, scheduled training in new\n\nprocesses and refresher training on operating procedures. \n\n\n\nContractors\n\n\n\nThe Bridgeport gas plant uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of\n\nincreased maintenance or to assist with specialized projects. Contractors are advised about safety\n\nand health hazards, emergency response requirements and safe work practices prior to their\n\nbeginning work. Gas plant personnel routinely monitor contractor performance to ensure that\n\ncontractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\n\n\nThe Bridgeport gas plant has well-established practices and procedures to maintain our equipment\n\nin a safe operating condition.

The following is a description of existing safety features applicable to prevention\n\nof accidental releases of specific regulated substances in the facility.\n\n\n\nThe Bridgeport gas plant has safety features on many units to help (1) contain/control a release,\n\n(2) quickly detect a release, and (3) reduce the consequences of a release. The following types of\n\nsafety features are used in the covered process\n\n\n\nRelease Detection\n\n\n\n1.   Hydrocarbon detection sensors around critical areas.\n\n\n\nRelease Containment/Control\n\n\n\n1.   Process relief valves that discharge to a flare to capture and incinerate episodic releases.\n\n2.   Valves (both manual and automatic) to permit isolation of the process.\n\n3.   Automated shutdown systems for specific process parameters (such as high pressure or\n\n     high level in a vessel).\n\n4.   Curbing or diking to contain liquid releases.\n\n5.   Atmospheric relief devices.\n\n\n\nRelease Mitigation\n\n\n\n1.   Fire suppression and extinguishing systems. We have two main types of fire suppression\n\n     - monitors with water spray nozzles to cool equipment in case of fire and numerous fire\n\n     extinguishers of several sizes throughout the facility. In gas plants, the control of fire is\n\n     more dependent on restricting sources of fuel than on putting out the fire.\n\n2.   Spill response team. The Bridgeport plant has quick access to spill containment material.\n\n     We have a team of employees who are trained and qualified to clean up spills from our\n\n     facility in the unlikely event that they occur.\n\n\n\nACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nThe Bridgeport plant has not had an incident over the past five years "

The program consists of procedures for responding to a release,\n\nincluding the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.\n\nThe procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first-aid and medical\n\ntreatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation,\n\nnotification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs. In addition,\n\nthe Bridgeport gas plant has procedures that address maintenance, inspection and testing of\n\nemergency response equipment, as well as instructions that address the use of emergency\n\nresponse equipment. Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their\n\nspecific emergency response duties. The emergency response program is updated when necessary,\n\nbased on modifications made to gas plant processes or other plant facilities\n\n\n\nThe overall emergency response program for the Bridgeport gas plant is coordinated with the\n\nlocal emergency response organizations and the emergency planning committee. This coordination\n\nprovides a means to notify the public in case of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating\n\nquick response to an incident. The Bridgeport facility recently had a simulated emergency drill,\n\nwith participation from the local emergency planning coordinator of the county and numerous\n\nlocal response agencies. Not only did we learn more about their capability, but they became more\n\nfamiliar with our operations and how to respond in case of an incident.\n\n\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n\n\nThe Bridgeport gas plant has had very safe operations over its history. However, the facility\n\ncontinually looks for improvements, both to the process and to safety issues at the facility. The\n\nf"
