The accidental release prevention and emergency response policy includes working with the surrounding community and local emergency response agencies to promote a spirit of cooperation and teamwork, to orchestrate an effective contingency plan in the unlikely event of a process incident occurring at the facility. The emergency response plan includes procedures for notifying the Holyoke Fire Department, if necessary.\r\n\r\n(b) The Stationary Source and Substance Handled: The Holyoke Water Treatment Facility is a stationary source operating for the purpose of treating surface water for use in households, businesses, and industries within the Holyoke and surrounding communities.  Chlorine, which is a regulated, toxic substance, is used as part of the treatment process. \r\n\r\n(c) General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps:  The City of Holyoke has implemented a comprehensive program to safely manage chlorine at the Holyoke Water Treatment Facility located at 600 Westfield Road in Holyoke, Massachusetts.\r\n\r\nThe Holyoke Water Treatment Facility is a public utility, which is not subject to OSHA standards enforced through the federal Department of Labor.  However, applicability to OSHA standards for public utilities in the State of Massachusetts beca"

Based on the Risk Management Program, Program Level applicability provisions, the covered process at the Holyoke Water Treatment Facility meets the criteria of a Program Level 3 process.\r\n\r\nThe Holyoke Water Treatment Facility has developed an accidental release prevention program and implemented chemical-specific prevention steps to manage the covered process.  The program includes both a documented compliance manual and administrative procedures to manage the program.  Specific elements of the program include, but are not limited to:\r\n\r\n\u00bf A documented management system\r\n\u00bf Completion of routine hazard assessments, including an offsite consequence analysis\r\n\u00bf Assembly and retention of chlorine safety information and other process safety information\r\n\u00bf A process hazard analysis program to evaluate the controls and safeguards of the process\r\n\u00bf Written standard operating procedures for chlorine management and operations\r\n\u00bf A written training program for the risk management program, inclusive of applicable operating, maintenance, and emergency response procedures\r\n\u00bf A chlorine system, mechanical integrity program\r\n\u00bf A management of change process to evaluate process changes\r\n\u00bf A pre-start-up safety review program to review applicable process changes\r\n\u00bf A system for routine compliance audits, inclusive of third-party audits, as applicable\r\n\u00bf A written incident investigation program\r\n\u00bf A written employee participation program to involve applicable employees in the program\r\n\u00bf A hot work permit program, inclusive of hot work permits\r\n\u00bf A contractor selection and evaluation program \r\n\u00bf A written emergency response program\r\n\u00bf A documented Risk Management Plan\r\n\r\nIn addition to the covered process, acci"

The plan addresses fires, explosions, spills or releases of hazardous chemicals (including chlorine), severe weather, and other potential emergency conditions. The plan details response actions by facility personnel for such emergencies, safety and emergency equipment, communication responsibilities, and coordination with off-site responders, as well as notification of local, state, and federal agencies.\r\n\r\nThe Emergency Response Plan includes emergency response to chlorine releases.
