At approximately 11:00 am on the 14th of August the fire was rapidly moving north due to strong winds.  Chelan County Fire Department, City of Chelan Fire Department and DNR teams were unable to control the fire and notified Chelan Fruit Co-Op they must evacuate the area immediately.  The instructions were passed down through Supervisors and all employees left the facility.  Refrigeration team members isolated the HPRs, as per ammonia safety training, and evacuated.  The fire destroyed 5 buildings and damaged administrative offices.  Approximately 62,000 lbs of ammonia was released during the fire from the 5 buildings.  There were no reports or incidents related to the loss of ammonia.  The strong winds, heat and high humidity allowed the ammonia to dissipate (and burn off) with no adverse consequences. \r\n\r\nIn addition to the operating procedures, Chelan Fruit has established Emergency Response Guidelines for releases involving ammonia.  These procedures are part of the ongoing training.  Chelan Fruit coordinates its response efforts with Chelan County Fire District 7, Washington State Patrol, Chelan County Sheriff and Chelan County Emergency Management.\r\n\r\nTraining on ammonia safety and detailed mechanical integrity will be a major ongoing process at Chelan Fruit.  Review and update of the emergency plan will be done annually and drills and emergency evacuation practices will be executed,also.  Training will be required for all employees who work around the ammonia system, including fork lift personnel."

The only changes made since the last submission was in personnel.  The new CEO is Mark Stennis and the new Refrigeration Manager is John Slater.  John worked on the refrigeration team since 2006, and received Management Training under prior Refrigeration Manager, Mike Davis, for one year.\r\n\r\nFacility is a fruit processing and cold storage facility located outside the City of Chelan, Chelan County, State of Washington.\r\n\r\nThe regulated substance, anhydrous ammonia, is used as a refrigerant.  There is approximately 30,259 pounds of ammonia in the facility.  \r\n\r\nChelan Fruit Cooperative's accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates technologies, procedures, and management practices.  It is the policy of Chelan Fruit to adhere to all applicable federal and state safety and environmental regulations. The prevention plan meets all the requirements of OSHA's PSM (Process Safety Management) regulations.\r\n\r\nRefrigeration personnel do not respond to large ammonia releases and have not received training in accordance with 29 CFR 1920.120. Actions to prevent a major release shall be attempted only by refrigeration personnel from an area that is not threatened by release.  Other employees will be evacuated or sheltered-in-place as appropriate. An emergency plan has been developed covering notification to public safety agencies and the public.  An evacuation plan for the plant has also been developed and all employees receive training on this plan.  The plan has been reviewed with the local fire department.\r\n\r\nAmmonia is considered hazardous by EPA and is listed on the Extremely Hazardous Substance list.  Chemical properties of ammonia make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling ammonia in order to:\r\n\r\n\u00bf\tPrevent unnecessary human exposure\r\n\u00bf\tReduce the threat to our personnel"
