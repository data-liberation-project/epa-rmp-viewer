Three of the processes contain anhydrous ammonia above the threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds.  The fourth process is a hydrogen production and storage system.  RAI owns, operates, and controls hydrogen production, handling and storage equipment that is interconnected with a hydrogen storage system owned, operated, and controlled by Praxair, Inc. (Praxair).   More specifically, Praxairs storage system is located on the RAI site and is inside a fenced area.  Piping from Praxairs hydrogen storage system passes across a chain link fence and into RAIs process.  \n\n\n\nThis RMP is for the three processes containing ammonia and the one containing hydrogen.\n\n\n\nThe processes/descriptions are as follows:\n\n\n\nRefinery C Ammonia:  This process includes an ammonia storage tank and associated piping.  The ammonia is consumed in the processes in Refinery C.  .  \n\n\n\nCo-Generation Ammonia:  This process includes an ammonia storage tank and associated piping.  The ammonia is used in a Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) system for NOx control in the facilities Co-Generation plant.\n\n\n\nCFB Ammonia:  This process includes an ammonia storage tank and associated piping.  The ammonia is used in a Selective Non-Catalytic Reduction (SNCR) system for NOx control in the facilities Circulating Fluidized Bed (CFB) Boiler.  \n\n\n\nHydrogen:  This process includes hydrogen production, handling and storage equipment.   \n\n\n\n2.     ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY POLICIES\n\n\n\nRAI recognizes management's responsibility in protecting its employees, equipment, property, and the environment.  The safety and health of all personnel are very important.  The control of accidental releases has been and will continue to be the basic responsibility of all RAI personnel who manage and operate equipment associated with covered processes.\n\n\n\nThe RAI PSM/RMP program assigns and documents the speci"

The RAI PSM/RMP program focuses attention on \"Making PSM/RMP the way we manage our covered processes.\"\n\n\n\nRAI believes that Employee Participation is the key to a successful PSM/RMP program.  Operating level employees \"Team with Management\" to operate processes safely.  Managers and Operators together assume major responsibility for operating the Hazardous Material process safely.\n\n\n\nThe RAI Emergency Response Program has been developed in cooperation, and with the support of the Keokuk Fire Department.  All RAI employees have received emergency response training.  \n\n\n\n3.     REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\n\n\nAmmonia is a common industrial chemical with applications in a large number of industries such as Agriculture, Water Treatment, Food Storage Warehouses, Pharmaceuticals, Heat Treating and many, many more.  Ammonia has been listed by both EPA and OSHA as an Extremely Hazardous Substance.\n\nHydrogen is also a common industrial chemical with applications in a large number of industries such as food preparation and as a lighter than air gas for lifting weather balloons.  Hydrogen has been listed by both EPA and OSHA as an Extremely Hazardous Substance.\n\n\n\n4.     SUMMARY OF WORST CASE AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\n\n\nAccidental release modeling studies have been conducted as required by PSM/RMP regulations and the information developed has been used in the preparation of the offsite consequence analyses.\n\n\n\n5.     DESCRIPTION OF THE RAI ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nRAI considers the PSM/RMP manuals to be \"living\" documents that are updated and revised regularly to maintain their viability and usefulness.\n\n\n\nRAI conducts regular PROCESS HAZARD ANALYSES of its covered processes to assure the continued safe operation of facility equipment.

Operators of equipment associated with covered processes participate in the development of the SOP's.\n\n\n\nRAI emphas and insists on EMPLOYEE PARTICIPATION from their covered process operators in all aspects of the development, implementation, and integration of their PSM/RMP program and provides specific training for these employees.   TRAINING:  Orientation Training (both classroom and On-the-Job) is provided to employees before Ammonia or Hydrogen related work assignments are given.  Renewal training, including documented training tests are provided annually.\n\n\n\nRAI has developed a PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE Inspection system to routinely inspect and maintain equipment to prevent or mitigate a release that may develop from poorly maintained process equipment as well as to identify potential mechanical hazards.\n\n\n\nRAI conducts AUDITS of the RMP/PSM programs Tri-Annually to improve Safety Performance as well as to verify compliance with the PSM/RMP Regulations. \n\n\n\nSome of the changes made to improve safety include enclosing the Hydrogen plant, installation of additional security cameras, additional heat tracing, and moving to a more user-friendly system for managing and accessing PSM documents.\n\n\n\n\n\n6.
