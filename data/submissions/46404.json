      "SummaryText": "Introduction.  Facilities that use or store more than 10,000 pounds of ethylene oxide are required to prepare and submit a Risk Management Plan (RMP) to the US EPA.  The RMP consists of several elements, including an evaluation of potential accident scenarios and a comprehensive program to prevent accidental releases of regulated substances.\n\nFacility Identification and Regulated Substance.  Midwest Sterilization Corporation (MSC) operates a contract sterilization facility located at Laredo, Texas.  The facility is engaged in the sterilization of medical devices using ethylene oxide.  Ethylene oxide is listed as a regulated toxic substance under US EPA's Risk Management Program regulations (40 CFR 68).\n\nPolicies to Protect Health, Safety, and the Environment.  Risk management and safety are important concerns at MSC.  This RMP formalizes and documents these activities.  MSC is committed to conducting its operations in a safe and responsible manner and to reducing risks to human health and the environment.\n\nPrevention Program.  An accidental release prevention program is in place at MSC to minimize the risk of hazardous chemical releases in accordance with the US EPA RMP Level 3 requirements (40 CFR 68).  The prevention program provides a structured approach to preventing accidents.  Some of the specific elements in the prevention program include:\n\n    Process safety information that is accessible to employees at all times.\n    A hazard review conducted as part of the preparation of RMP compliance.\n    Process controls to prevent unsafe conditions.\n    Written operating procedures used for training and guiding the work of operators.\n    Training provided to all employees that operate the process.\n    A program to properly maintain the process equipment.\n    Incident investigation and corrective procedures to continuously improve the process.\n    Routine audits to assure that safe practices are being followed.\n    A preventive maintenance program to help ensure equipm"

      "SummaryText": "ent is in proper working condition.\n\nThe ethylene oxide storage and distribution process, subject to the RMP at MSC, is designed with extensive safeguards to protect against the accidental release of ethylene oxide.  Examples of safety equipment in place include pressure relief devices, leak detection and alarm systems, equipment grounding system, explosion proof electrical systems, and intrinsically safe emission control equipment.\n\nIn addition, process operators receive extensive training in the safe operation of the process, and are required to follow detailed operating procedures to help ensure safety.  MSC has also implemented a mechanical integrity program to monitor the physical condition of process equipment, and replace or repair equipment before it fails.\n\nIn the unlikely event of a spill or release of ethylene oxide, MSC has coordinated the planned response actions with local emergency response agencies to minimize the potential impacts of a fire or release from the facility.\n\nFive Year Accident History.  Accidents occurring during the past five years meeting the following requirements must be included in the RMP:\n\n    The release must be from a covered process and involve a regulated substance held above its threshold quantity.\n    The release must have caused at least one of the following:\n\n        1. Onsite deaths, injuries, or significant property damage.\n        2. Known offsite deaths, injuries, property damage, environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place.\n\nMSC has not had any accidental releases from the ethylene oxide storage and distribution process within the last five years that meet the above specified requirements.\n\nEmergency Response Plan.  The RMP regulations require that \"response actions be coordinated with local emergency planning and response agencies\" (40 CFR 68.90(b)(3)).  Emergency response activities at MSC are coordinated with the Laredo Fire Department and the Local Emergency Planning Committee.\n\nPlanned Changes to I"

      "SummaryText": "mprove Safety.  Safety and emergency preparedness are a part of MSC's everyday acitvities.  Exposure risks to employees and the public have been minimized through ongoing compliance with regulatory requirements.  At this time, no further improvement opportunities have been identified.\n\nChemical-Specific Safety.  Ethylene oxide is stored and distributed in a secure area that is temperature controlled, dry, well-ventilated, and away from incompatible chemicals and ignition sources.  Storage containers are grounded and have pressure relief valves.  Lower explosive limit (LEL) sensors are located in the storage and distribution areas that will alarm in the event of a major leak from ethylene oxide cylinders or the process."
