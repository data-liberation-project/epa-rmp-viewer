This program addresses items related to the operation of ammonia based refrigeration systems including but not limited to the handling of the chemical, operator training, equipment selection and maintenance, contractor qualifications, preventative maintenance programs, routine and emergency operating procedures and emergency planning and response.  P&O Cold Logistics also has an emergency action plan in effect, which is designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n  1.)  To save lives.\n  2.)  To minimize and avoid injuries.\n  3.)  To protect the environment.\n  4.)  To minimize property damage.\n\n\nAmmonia has a strong pungent odor which is detectable at very low concentration levels when released to the atmosphere.  The refrigeration system is designed such that under normal operating conditions, no ammonia is released to the atmosphere.  However, unforseen circumstances or system upset could lead to leakage of a portion of the ammonia from the system.  Given the strong odor of ammonia, even a small quantity of released ammonia will be detected at some distance from the source of the leak.  Ammonia is detectable by its odor at levels well below that which will raise health concerns.\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nConstruction of the ammonia refrigeration system expansion project at P&O Cold Logistics was completed in October 2001.  The facility is located on a 28 acre site, southeast of the intersection of North Broadway and Barbours Cut Streets in the city of La Porte, Texas.  The complex includes a large cold storage warehouse building with auxiliary office space.  The  warehouse is refrigerated using anhydrous ammonia as the refrigerant.  The system was constructed in accordance with all applicable federal, st"

The majority of the system is located in the machine room including vessels and compressors.  The condensers are mounted on the roof, and all of the evaporators are located in their respective cold areas or rooftop penthouses.\n\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT SUMMARY\n\n*  Worst Case Release Result Summary\n\n      Scenario Description:  Release of the maximum quantity of ammonia that can be stored in the largest vessel - 14,472 pounds in 10 minutes.  The worst case scenario is very unlikely as it assumes the total and catastrophic failure of a vessel containing ammonia in its most volatile state.  Since this vessel is enclosed by the machine room, passive mitigation effects were taken into consideration when determining the release rate to the outside atmosphere.  The most pessimistic meteorological conditions were used: 1.5 meters per second wind speed, and F stability.  The Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration reference tables were used to determine the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 200 ppm in urban conditions.  This release reaches off site and may impact population receptors.  No environmental receptors were affected by this potential release.\n\nNote: Item 2.5 is rounded to two significant figures and 2.6 is rounded to one significant figure per EPA's instructions.\n\n*  Alternative Release Result Summary\n\n     Scenario Description: A release of ammonia from resulting from a 1/4 inch diameter hole in a pipe.  The release rate of ammonia due to the pressure of the tank is 122 pounds per minute (Note: Item 3.5 is rounded to two significant figures and 3.6 is rounded to one significant figure per EPA's instructions).  This release could occur due to a gasket rupture, pinhole leak, flange seal leak, valve bonnet leak, etc.  In addition, this release could occur outside, t"

This release reaches off site and may impact other commercial/industrial neighbors.  No environmental receptors were affected by this potential release. \n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe P&O Cold Logistics ammonia refrigeration system has many safety features.  Much of the safety of the system is inherent in the policies and procedures that govern the operation of the system. \n\nThe Process Safety Management program ensures that all security and safety procedures are addressed.  Staff are trained in operation, maintenance and emergency procedures related to the operation of the ammonia refrigeration system.  All refrigeration equipment and ammonia vessels are equipped with automatic pressure safety relief devices to prevent pressure build-up beyond safe equipment operation levels.  A preventative maintenance program assures that equipment is maintained an serviced on a regular schedule and that worn, ageing, or defective components are replaced as required to maintain equipment in good operating condition.  Controls and safety devices are tested regularly to ensure proper operation.\n\nIn addition to the 1997 Uniform Mechanical Code, the facility will operate in accordance with the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) guidelines. \n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nWithin the past five years (October 1996 - October 2001), the facility has not had an accidental release of ammonia causing personnel injury or with off site consequences.\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe P&O Cold Logistics has a Response Plan for On-Site Emergency Operations.

The facility has several trained personnel to assist in an orderly evacuation as well as to diagnose the alarm condition.  \n\nThe Response Plan for On-Site Emergency Operations includes the facility emergency coordinators, the staff alerting list, emergency notification list, and the hazardous material agency notification and procedures.  This Plan then proceeds to detail the procedures for employees and management in the event of a fire, evacuation, compressor room shut down, blackout, and ammonia release/clean-up.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThe Process Hazard Analysis and Hazard Assessment (Off-Site Consequence Analysis) provided mitigation measures to improve safety at the P&O Cold Logistics facility.  Many of the recommendations will be implemented prior to completion of the expansion project with the remaining being completed by 4/1/2002. \n\nA01  Check PSV replacement schedule to determine if PSVs for existing equipment should be replaced as part of the expansion project.\n\nR01  Consider using an outside alarm company to monitor the system for ammonia leaks, high levels in vessels, and other ammonia refrigeration system alarm conditions.\n\nR02  Consider programming the ammonia detection and computer control system as follows for the engine room ammonia sensor (per Chapter 11 of the 1997 Uniform Mechanical Code):\n1.  Alarm at 25 ppm (PEL);\n2.  Energize Emergency Ventilation System at 50% IDLH (150 ppm); and\n3.  De-energize electrical power to engine room at 25% LEL (40,000 ppm) or less.\n\nR03  Update the Operating Procedures to incorporate operating the spring loaded valve and globe valve in series.

Also consider isolating the vessels prior to leaving in the event of a hurricane warning.\n\nR42  There will be a keyed bypass for manual defrost which could be done by a non-operator person."
