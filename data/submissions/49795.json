      "SummaryText": "STATIONARY SOURCE DESCRIPTION\nThe Badlands Gas Plant is owned and operated by Hiland Partners. The facility is a mechanical refrigeration gas processing plant with front end hydrogen sulfide removal (via solid media), amine treating (to remove carbon dioxide), tail end nitrogen removal (via a cold box), and product storage. The facility receives natural gas via high pressure and low pressure gas gathering systems. The inlet streams are commingled within the plant, and the hydrocarbon liquids (propane and BG mix---primarily butane and pentanes) are removed from the gas and sold as products. The products are trucked from the plant and the residue gas (methane) is transported via pipeline to the field compressors as fuel, with the surplus going to sales.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION\nThe operating personnel of the Badlands Gas Plant are committed to protecting the health and safety of company employees, contractors working at the facility, residents near the plant, and the environment. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested and the emphasis placed on safety by Hiland Partners in the design, construction, operation, and maintenance of this and other facilities. There are both administrative and engineering controls in place at the plant to minimize the risk of an uncontrolled release of a hazardous substance.\n\nThis facility is regulated by 29 CFR 1910.119 (Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals), 29 CFR 1910.38 (Employee Emergency Plans), 29 CFR 1910.120 (Hazardous Waste and Emergency Response), 40 CFR 112 (Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasure Plans), as well as other federal, state and local regulations developed to reduce the risk of release of hazardous chemicals. Strict compliance with these regulations by plant operating personnel ensures the risk of release is kept to a minimum.\n\nSafe work practices are in place to ensure safe operations consistent with industry practice and that meet regulatory requirements.

      "SummaryText": "practices include site control, lockout/tagout, line breaking, confined space entry, and hot work procedures.\n\nWORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO\nIn accordance with the EPA's Risk Management Program (40 CFR Part 68), the plant's inventory of chemicals was evaluated to determine if any regulated flammable or toxic substances were present in quantities above the threshold amount. It was found that the stored quantities of the natural gas liquids propane and BG mix (primarily butanes and pentanes) exceeded the threshold value of 10,000 lb. These flammables are stored in common area and comprise a single covered process. No toxic substances exist at the plant in quantities that exceed the threshold.\n\nThe worst-case scenario for this facility would be a vapor cloud explosion of the total quantity of stored flammables (over 600,000 lb). Using EPA's RMP-Comp program, the estimated distance to an overpressure endpoint of 1 psi from this explosion was found to be 0.7 miles. The nearest distance to a receptor of any kind is 0.8 miles. Since no receptor falls within the endpoint distance, and since there have been no accidents with offsite consequences due to a release of either of these flammables during the past five years, the Badlands Plant qualifies for Program Level 1 of the Risk Management Program.\n\nThis type of scenario is very unlikely to occur. All pressure vessels are carefully inspected and pressure tested before they are put into service, and the rigorous mechanical integrity program followed by the plant ensures that all process equipment is properly maintained and inspected on a regular basis. \n\nALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO\nNo alternative release scenario was necessary to investigate since the facility qualifies for Program Level 1.\n\n5-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nThere have been no releases of hazardous substances at the Badlands Gas Plant over the last five years that resulted in offsite effects.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\nThe Badlands Gas Plant maintains a written emergen"

The employees are trained for emergency response per OSHA HAZWOPER Standard 1910.120(q). Plant emergency response actions are coordinated with the local emergency response agencies, including the Rhame and Bowman fire departments. Annual emergency response training of the employees and meetings with the local emergency response agencies are conducted to assure communication processes are maintained. In addition, the plant conducts drills that involve the local emergency response agencies.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\nPlant personnel are continually developing new ways to improve the safety of the facility. Input from operating personnel regarding plant safety is always sought during safety meetings."
