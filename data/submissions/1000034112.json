California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program - Title 19 CCR, Chapter 4.5\n\n? Federal EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) - Title 40 CFR ?68\n\n? California Process Safety Management (PSM) Program, Title 8 CCR ?5189\n\n? Federal Process Safety Management (PSM) Program, Title 29 CFR ?1910.119\n\n\n\nHereafter this program will be referred to as the RMP-PSM program.\n\n\n\nThis program is intended to be a \"living document\". As such, the information, procedures, policies, and documentation that make up this program must be made easily accessible and updated as\n\nnecessary. To accomplish this, Giumarra Vineyards Winery has elected to use PSMWriter, software developed and distributed by Resource Compliance, Inc. This software will assist us with\n\nupdating, maintaining, scheduling, and tracking RMP-PSM related activities.\n\n\n\n1.1 GIUMARRA VINEYARDS WINERY, RISK & PROCESS SAFETY MANAGEMENT PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThis is to inform all interested persons, including employees, that Giumarra Vineyards Winery has updated/developed their unified RMP-PSM Program. This program has been prepared to\n\naddress the risks involved in operating and maintaining the following processes which have the presence of hazardous chemicals above threshold quantities:\n\n\n\nProcess Name Process Chemical Process Quantity(lbs.)\n\n\n\nP11 - Aqueous Ammonia System Aqueous Ammonia 29.4% Aq. NH3 Solution 38,000\n\nP13 - Sulfur Dioxide Injection Storage Sulfur Dioxide 26,000\n\n\n\nOur RMP-PSM program promotes overall plant, worker, and public safety. The program enables our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of\n\nhazardous chemicals. Overall, the program is designed to prevent accidental fatalities, injuries, and illnesses and avoid physical property damage.\n\n\n\nGiumarra Vineyards Winery has an exemplary safety record, one that we are quite proud of.

Prepared a unified program based on the PSM plan to meet CalARP and RMP obligations as well\n\n2. Organized the program so that it meshes closely with general Giumarra Vineyards Winery business practices\n\n3. Utilized PSMWriter software to ensure that all necessary Giumarra Vineyards Winery employees have access to relevant information (SOPs, PHAs, audits, etc.)\n\n\n\nThe RMP-PSM program sets forth rules, procedures and practices that will help our employees protect themselves and our neighbors.\n\n\n\n1.2 PROCESS DESCRIPTIONS\n\n\n\nThe Giumarra Vineyards, Winery facility is a processing facility for grape juice concentrate products. The facility has two ammonia processes that provide refrigeration capacity to multiple product\n\nchillers, an aqueous ammonia storage tank which is part of a carbon filter regeneration process, and a sulfur-dioxide injection process for grape juice.\n\n\n\n1.3 GENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE & CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\n1.3.1 GENERAL\n\n\n\nWe inform our employees engaged in process operations of the dangers of an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia in annual safety meetings. During these meeting we also discuss\n\npreventative measures, such as evacuation, in order to be prepared for a release.\n\n\n\nGiumarra Vineyards Winery has also conducted an off-site consequence analysis of worst-case and alternative release scenarios for the ammonia refrigeration process. These are for the\n\npurposes of informing the public in the event of an accidental release. The results of the analyses are reported in the body of the program.\n\n\n\n1.3.3 SULFUR-DIOXIDE\n\n\n\nThe sulfur-dioxide injection process at the Giumarra Vineyards, Winery facility is an integral part of the juicing process for grapes. Injection of the grapes takes place during the initial crush which\n\noperates four months out of the year. The process involves two (2) ton containers with a maximum intended inventory"

It is extremely important that this process is maintained and operated in a safe and efficient manner. Giumarra Vineyards is committed to making sure that employees are made\n\naware of the potential danger of exposure to sulfur-dioxide.\n\n\n\nOur refrigeration personnel also monitor the sulfur-dioxide injection process and keep an active log of all associated procedures and transactions. In addition, the process is checked frequently\n\nduring the season by the outside contractor that supplies the SO2 containers. Snowden also assists in performing the annual mechanical integrity review of our system/process equipment.\n\n\n\n1.3.4 AQUEOUS AMMONIA\n\nThe aqueous ammonia process at the Giumarra Vineyards, Winery facility is an integral part of the grape juice concentrate manufacturing process and operates year round. The ammonia\n\nconcentration in the solution is 29.4% and the Storage Tank has a 5,000 gal capacity. As with the ammonia systems management is committed to making sure that employees are made aware of\n\nthe potential danger of an aqueous ammonia leak.\n\n\n\nGiumarra Vineyards personnel monitor the aqueous ammonia process and storage tank. In addition, the tank is checked by the vendor supplying the aqueous ammonia. The vender also assists\n\nin performing the annual mechanical integrity review of our aqueous ammonia equipment.\n\n\n\n1.4 FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nGiumarra Vineyards Winery has had no accidental release within the last five (5) years.\n\n\n\n1.5 EMERGENCY ACTION AND RESPONSE PLAN\n\n\n\nGiumarra Vineyards Winery's emergency action and response program has been developed to satisfy the following requirements:\n\n\n\n? California \"Emergency Action Plan\" - Title 8 CCR ?3220\n\n? Federal \"Emergency Action Plan\" - Title 29 CFR ?1910.38\n\n?

Once the action item has been\n\ncompleted, the resolution can be documented using PSMWriter as well. A list of current or past due action items can be accessed at any time by those with access to PSMWriter.\n\n\n\nIn addition to utilizing PSMWriter to create, schedule, track, and document events, Giumarra Vineyards Winery has also entered into a contract with Resource Compliance to obtain help with\n\nRMP-PSM program implementation.
