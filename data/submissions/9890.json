Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies:\n\nAt this facility, we manufacture gaseous and liquid hydrogen.  Hydrogen, in the amounts handled by our facility, is considered hazardous by the EPA.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and state rules and regulations.  Air Products manages the safety of the regulated processes by means of operating procedures, equipment testing and inspections,  safety devices (e.g., alarms, shutdowns, instrumentation, relief devices) inherent in the design of this facility and other controls and systems designed to prevent accidental releases of hazardous chemicals.  Safe work practices and training of our personnel supplement the inherent safe design of the plant.\n\nOur emergency response program is based upon OSHA\u0012s HAZWOPER regulation.  The emergency response plan includes procedures for the notification of the local fire authority and Hazardous Materials unit so that appropriate measures can be taken by local emergency responders to control accidental releases.\n\nThis document has been prepared in accordance with the EPA\u0012s Risk Management Plan regulation (40 CFR, Part 68). The substances and processes considered during the preparation of this RMP and the scenarios described were selected based on criteria established in the regulation.\n\n2.  The stationary source and regulated substances handled:\n\nThe primary purpose of this facility is the manufacturing of gaseous and liquid hydrogen. Gaseous hydrogen is used by our customer in their manufacturing process. Gaseous hydrogen is produced in the reformer process (See Reformer Process below) and transmitted to the customer via pipeline. The pipeline is connected to a 20,000 gallon liquid hydrogen backup tank that supplies the pipeline when the reformer is off-line.\n\nLiquid hydrogen is also produced from the hydrogen gas taken from the re"

The liquid hydrogen is stored in two 70,000 gallon liquid hydrogen tanks. Liquid hydrogen is loaded into highway tankers and shipped to various off-site customers.\n\nREFORMER PROCESS: Hydrocarbon based gases (natural gas or methane) are received by our plant via pipeline and used as our feedstock.  The feed stock is then compressed and cracked in our reformer (furnace).  By exposing the feedstock to a catalyst in the presence of heat (approximately 1,500 degrees F.) and steam, a chemical reaction takes place that converts the feedstock into hydrogen, carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide.  The carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide is then separated from the hydrogen in adsorbers.  The pure hydrogen is then compressed and delivered to customers or the hydrogen liquifier via pipe. \n\nThe regulated substance handled at this facility is the flammable mixture.  The maximum amount of this substance at this facility is:\n\n7 112,000 pounds of flammable mixture containing approximately 93% hydrogen and 3% methane\n\n3.  The worst-case release scenario(s) and the alternative release scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distance for each reported scenario:\n\nThe worst-case scenario, as defined by the EPA, associated with a release of flammable substances in the hydrogen process at this facility is a vapor cloud explosion (VCE) involving a maximum inventory of a liquid hydrogen tank containing a pure flammable substance.  A full storage tank with an inventory of 41,400 pounds is assumed to be released and ignite, resulting in a VCE.  The maximum distance to the EPA defined endpoint (1 psi overpressure) affects off-site receptors. Although we have active controls directed at preventing such releases and controlling the consequences, no credit for active mitigation measures were taken into account in evaluating th"

The entire inventory of the pipe and connecting vessels of 7,900 pounds of a pure flammable substance is assumed to be released.  The maximum distance to the EPA defined flammable endpoint of 100% LFL (Low Flammability Limit) affects off-site receptors.\n\n4.  The general accidental release prevention program and specific prevention steps:\n\nThe facility developed prevention program elements  based on the Federal EPA\u0012s Accidental Release Prevention Plan, the California Accidental Release Prevention Program (CalARP), and OSHA\u0012s Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation.  This facility was designed and constructed to comply  with applicable state and industry codes.\n\n5.  Five-year accident history:\n\nThere have been no accidents involving or accidental releases of flammable gas that resulted in any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage in the past five years.\n\n6.  The emergency response program:\n\nThe facility\u0012s emergency response program is based upon OSHA\u0012s HAZWOPER standard.  At this site, employees are trained to recognize emergencies and initiate emergency response from outside agencies.  They have been trained to OSHA\u0012s First Responder Awareness Level.  The employees receive annual refresher training in their role in the emergency plan.  Emergency response activities have also been coordinated with the Sacramento County Hazmat Team and Fire Department for emergencies related to the hydrogen process.  Periodic drills are conducted with agencies to review the effectiveness of our emergency procedures. \n\n7.  Planned changes to improve safety:\n\nThe facility resolves recommendations from PHAs and Incident Investigations, some of which may"
