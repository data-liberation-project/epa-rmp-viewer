The facility is owned by Dole and was previously operated by Dole Berry Company.  Dole ceased operations & decommissioned the refrigerating system in 2014.  Dandy Cooling Company is leasing a portion of the overall site and cooling facilities on a short-term basis.  The overall site occupies 176.6 Acres; with a total building area of 52,084 square feet (two buildings), including one building \"A\" with 18,150 square feet devoted to cold storage.   The facility \"Building A\" and surrounding areas was designed for fresh produce pressure cooling, cold storage and shipping, and is the portion being leased by Dandy Cooling Company. The facility is being re-commissioned to provide refrigeration effect for the removal of field heat from freshly harvested vegetables (primarily celery), and subsequent short-term refrigerated storage until it is shipped. Dandy is improving the location with a new Tram and Hydro-Vac vacuum tube pre-cooling unit.  The improvement is being constructed under permit by the County of Ventura Resource Management Agency, according to the codes and standards currently in effect.  The existing refrigeration was designed and installed according to the Codes & Standards in effect circa 2000.      \n\n\n\nThe product that comes to the facility for vacuum pre-cooling and short-term storage is on site generally for four days from harvesting.

The refrigeration process' Control, Monitoring and Alarm System includes a backup power supply (UPS) and manual backup systems (kill switches). The system initiates notifications, alarms, equipment shutdown and pump-down of the affected area according to the location, nature and severity of the problem.

Special self-closing valves were installed as a solution to this issue.  If a release were to develop during the oil-draining task, the mechanic simply releases the handle of the self-closing valve and flow is terminated.  These types of valves are utilized when oil must be drained from the refrigerating system.\n\n\n\nOther Release Prevention Steps:\n\n\n\n-  Pressure relief valves are piped to a common header that terminates at an Ammonia-Water Diffusion Tank. \n\n-  The refrigeration process is equipped with automatic safety cutouts via compressor microprocessor controls.  The cutouts are programmed to shut-down equipment prior to out-of-tolerance conditions being met.  -  Safety cutouts are included in the Maintenance Program and shall be regularly tested for proper actuation.
