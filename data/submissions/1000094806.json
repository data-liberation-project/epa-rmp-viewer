The facility is in the process of being expanded and will be capable of producing 61,000 barrels per day (BPD) of renewable diesel. The feedstock consists mainly of refined animal fats, recycled cooking oil, and corn oil. \r\n\r\nThe existing facility includes an Ecofining unit (DGD Ecofining Unit), which utilizes a UOP-licensed technology that uses Hydrotreating and Isomerization processes to convert the fats/oil feedstock into Green Diesel; a Pretreatment Unit, which removes metals and other contaminants from the feedstock; a small wastewater treating unit; rail and truck unloading facility; and tank farm area.  Within the existing facility, only the Ecofining Unit is a covered process under PSM and RMP regulations.\r\n\r\nAs part of the new expansion project, DGD will add another Ecofining unit (DGD II Ecofining Unit) and a Renewable Gasoline Unit (RGU), which processes the light end streams from both Ecofining Units to separate into liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), light naphtha, heavy naphtha, and refinery fuel gas.
