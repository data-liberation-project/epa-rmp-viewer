EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\n\nPecan Pipeline owns and operates a natural gas processing plant located in Montague County, Bowie City, Texas, herein referred to as Kripple Kreek Gas Plant (KKGP).  Pecan Pipeline is a wholly owned subsidiary of EOG Resources, Inc.  The current Risk Management Plan (RMP) was resisted on January 23, 2009 and submitted as Pecan Pipeline. This report provides the supporting documentation for the 5 year RMP renewal submittal. \n\n\n\nThe Kripple Kreek Gas Plant (KKGP), KKGP facility is a natural gas processing facility which includes fixed and skid mounted natural gas processing equipment and natural gas liquids storage tanks.  The plant contains several regulated flammable substances including: propane, butane, ethane, methane, pentane, isobutene [Butane, 2-methyl-], and Isopentane [Propane, 2-methyl-]. These substances are listed in Tables 3-4  of the 40 CFR 68.130.  This installation does not have any regulated toxic substances with an amount greater than the threshold quantity specified in 40 CFR 68.130 .\n\n\n\nSince this plant is dedicated to manufacture several products related to natural gas, it has several storage tanks that are used for the abovementioned products.  The largest tank in this facility, the one that constitutes the worst case scenario for the release of flammable substances that could cause a vapor cloud explosion (VCE), has a capacity of 75,331 pounds of a hydrocarbon - flammable mixture of gases.  This tank is identified as Product Surge Tank and it is located in the process area.  The following flammable substances, and their concentrations {lbs.}, are present in this mixture: ethane {34,857 lbs, 45.21%}, propane {26,666 lbs, 34.58%}, butane {7,924 lbs, 10.28%}, and traces of isobutene, isopentene, hexane, methane and pentane.\n\n\n\nUnder the authority of section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act, the Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions require facilities that produ"

Covered facilities were initially required to comply with the rule in 1999, and the rule has been amended on several occasions since then, most recently in 2004. Flammable substances are regulated under Title 40, Part 68 of the Code of Federal Regulations (40 CFR 68), more commonly known as the Risk Management Program (RMP) rule. RMPs must be prepared for processes that store in excess of the thresholds set forth by 40 CFR 68.130.  The threshold for the gases that compose the hydrocarbon - flammable mixture of gases are the following: propane {10,000 lbs} and ethane {10,000 lbs}. Based on the above threshold quantities, only these two flammables substances are subjected to comply with the requirements of the Chemical Accident Prevention rule and must prepare an RMP. \n\n\n\n1.2. RMP REQUIREMENTS\n\n\n\nAll facilities subject to the RMP rule must complete a hazard assessment analysis for the regulated chemical. In addition, the recent (5-year) accident history and emergency response plan must be reviewed. Based on these assessments, the facility will be classified within one of three program levels.\n\n\n\n>    Program 1 - no offsite receptor impacted (potentially and in last five years)\n\n>    Program 2 - offsite impacts and not subject to Occupational Safety and Health Administration Process Safety Management Standard (OSHA PSM)\n\n>    Program 3 - offsite impacts and subject to OSHA PSM    \n\n\n\nAll programs require submittal of an RMP. For Program 2 and 3 processes, two additional tasks are required: a release prevention program and an emergency response program. The following sections provide a brief summary of the hazard assessment, accident history, prevention program, emergency response, and subsequent RMP program level determination for the KKGP facility.\n\n\n\n1.3.

The rupture of one tank was identified to be the worst-case release scenario since it will result the largest spill surface area. For the worst-case release scenario, the maximum distance to the level of concern is 0.30 miles. Details on the hazard assessment are provided in Section 2.\n\n\n\n1.4. RECEPTORS IMPACTED\n\n\n\nOnce the impact distance of the worst-case release scenario is examined, the impact on off-site receptors must be considered. If public receptors   or environmental receptors   are impacted, additional analysis is required. The distance from the storage tanks to the fence line is approximately 290 ft. (0.05 miles). Therefore, the level of concern (0.30 miles) extends past the fence line to off-site locations, and any unrestricted areas within this region must be evaluated to determine if public or environmental receptors are impacted. There are no environmental receptors within the impact radius. Details on the receptors impacted are provided in Section 2.5.\n\n\n\n1.5. ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nThere are no accidents to report for either the five year accident history (40 CFR ?68.42) or for determining Program 1 applicability (40 CFR ?68.10(b)(1)).\n\n\n\n1.6. EMERGENCY RESPONSE\n\n\n\nA facility emergency response plan for the KKGP facility is in place and has been coordinated with local emergency planning and response organizations as required by 40 CFR ?68.10(b)(3).  Specifically, this plan has been coordinated with the City of Bowie Fire Department.\n\n\n\n1.7. PROGRAM LEVEL\n\n\n\nFlammable substance storage at the KKGP facility qualifies as a Program 3 process since, based on the offsite consequence analysis, the maximum distance to the level of concern impacts public receptors and the process is subject to the OSHA process safety management standard (29 CFR ?1910.19).  \n\n\n\n1.8.

Five years from the date of renewal submittal of the RMP.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2. HAZARD ASSESSMENT \n\nSince the KKGP facility is subject to RMP, a hazard assessment must be performed. The first step of the hazard assessment is a worst-case analysis to determine the maximum potentially affected area. Should offsite receptors be impacted in the worst-case analysis, additional alternative case analyses are required.\n\n\n\n2.1. WORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO ANALYSIS\n\n\n\nA \"worst-case release\" is defined under 40 CFR ?68.3 as:\n\n\n\n\"... the release of the largest quantity of a regulated substance from a vessel or process line failure that results in the greatest distance to an endpoint defined in 40 CFR ?68.22(a).\"\n\n\n\nThe worst-case scenario quantity is determined in 40 CFR ?68.25(b) as the greatest amount in any single vessel or pipe used in a covered process, taking into account administrative controls that limit the maximum quantity.\n\n\n\nThe term \"process\" is defined in 40 CFR ?68.3 as:\n\n\n\n\"... any activity involving a regulated substance including any use, storage, manufacturing, handling, or on-site movement of such substances, or combination of these activities. For the purposes of this definition, any group of vessels that are interconnected, or separate vessels that are located such that a regulated substance could be involved in a potential release, shall be considered a single process.\"\n\n\n\nThe definition of \"process\" is broad and can be interpreted"

EOG needs to confirm the above.\n\n\n\n2.1.1. PRODUCT SURGE TANK\n\n\n\nThe Product Surge Tank is the largest process units at the site with a capacity of 77,109 pounds.  Although this tank has a capacity of approximately 35,000 us gallons it has been operationally constrained to operate at only 45% of its capacity, at just 15,750 pounds. \n\n\n\n\n\n2.2. METEOROLOGICAL CONDITIONS\n\n\n\nThe meteorological parameters for the worst case scenario are defined by 40 CFR ?68.22(b) as having a wind speed of 1.5 m/s and the atmospheric stability Class F. Per 40 CFR ?68.22(c), the highest daily maximum temperature for the past three years are used.

The release rate was calculated using the method in the OCA Guidance, but since the OCA guidance tables and numbers are not updated, RMP*Comp was used for the hazard assessment analysis.    \n\n\n\n2.4.

OFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS: POPULATION AND ENVIRONMENT\n\n\n\nAfter the distance to the toxic endpoint has been determined, the offsite impacts on population, public receptors, and environmental receptors should be analyzed as required by the RMP rule. The population within a circle centered at the point of release and a radius equal to the distance to the toxic endpoint should be estimated to two significant digits. In addition, all types of public receptors (schools, residences, hospitals, prisons, public recreation areas or arenas, major commercial or industrial areas) and environmental receptors (national or state parks, forests, or monuments; officially designated wildlife sanctuaries, preserves, or refuges; federal wilderness areas) within this distance should be identified.\n\n\n\nMARPLOT (Mapping Applications for Response, Planning, and Local Operational Tasks, Version 4.3.2) was used to estimate the potentially affected population within the distance to the toxic endpoint and to identify public receptors. MARPLOT provides databases from the Bureau of Census, and other federal agencies. The demographic information in MARPLOT is based on the 2010 Census.\n\n\n\nMARPLOT indicates that for an area 1 miles from the worst-case release source the following: \"No population records found for the selected area.\" Although the impact radius for which the OCA needs to be perform is of 0.6 miles in the best interest to do not consider the distance between the sources and the property fence the a radius of 1 miles was used instead.  The impact area on a MARPLOT map is demonstrated in Figure 1 in appendix D. Google Earth (Version 7.1.1) was used to find the public receptors within the impact radius for the worst case scenario.

ALTERNATIVE SCENARIO RELEASE ANALYSIS \n\n\n\nEOG Resources operates a refrigeration systems that has a propane accumulator tank with an approximate capacity of 12,012 gallons of propane.  Since this tank uses 100% Propane it was assumed a rupture in the tank shell that caused an opening of approximately one (1) square inch at the bottom of the tank.  To make conditions worst, it was assumed that orifice is located at the bottom of the tank and that it has a liquid column of 21.5 feet above the opening under discussion.\n\n\n\nThis alternative scenario was evaluated using the dispersion modeling analysis RMP*Comp program (Version 2.01 to determine the distance to the overpressure endpoint of 1 pound per square inch is reached for this substance as specified under the RMP Rule.  For the above scenario, this distance is less than 0.1 miles (< 1.6 kilometers).\n\n\n\n \n\n3. FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENTAL HISTORY\n\n\n\nPer the requirements of the RMP rule, KKGP must include a five-year accident history in the Risk Management Plan. The five-year accident history involves an examination of the effects of any accidental releases of one or more of the regulated substances from a covered process in the five years prior to the submission of the Risk Management Plan. To be reportable, the release must have caused at least one of the following:\n\n\n\n\n\n1.    On-s"

PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n\n\nKKGP has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR Part 68. The following section briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that are in place at KKGP facility.\n\n\n\n4.1. SAFETY INFORMATION\n\n\n\nKKGP maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters, and equipment designs associated with all processes.  All chemical substances present at the Site are identified and Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) are available for each employee to review.  Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) are shown in Appendix E. \n\n\n\n4.2. HAZARD REVIEW\n\n\n\nKKGP will conduct comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with processes are identified and controlled efficiently. KKGP uses PSM HAZOP procedures to conduct hazard evaluations and studies.  The studies will be undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at an interval of five years. Any findings related to the hazard analyses are addressed in a timely manner.\n\n\n\n4.3. OPERATING PROCEDURES\n\n\n\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activates within the covered processes, KKGP facility maintains written operating procedures. These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown, and startup after a turnaround. This information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\n\n\n4.4. TRAINING\n\n\n\nKKGP has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are op"

Refresher training is provided at least every three years and more frequently as needed.\n\n\n\n4.5. MAINTENANCE\n\n\n\nThe facility carries out highly documented inspections and maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations. Process equipment examined during these checks includes, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls, and pumps. Inspection and maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices. Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed. Any equipment deficiencies identified by these checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\n\n\n4.6. COMPLIANCE AUDITS\n\n\n\nKKGP facility conducts PSM audits every three years and any corrective actions required as a result of audits will be undertaken in a safe prompt manner.\n\n\n\n4.7. INCIDENT INVESTIGATION\n\n\n\nKKGP promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in or could reasonably have resulted in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance. These investigations are undertaken to identify the circumstances leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions needed to prevent the incident from reoccurring. All reports are retained for a minimum of five years.\n\n\n\n4.8. EMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN\n\n\n\nKKGP maintains a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental release of hazardous materials. The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas. To ensure proper functioning, the emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and services. In addition, the plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within the processes that would require a modif"
