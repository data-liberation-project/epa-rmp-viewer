This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, gas plant trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\r\n \r\n DESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\r\n \r\n The CHEVRON McKittrick 17Z Gas Plant, located near McKittrick, California, operates a variety of processes to produce petroleum products (e.g., natural gas, propane, natural gasoline) from natural gas. The McKittrick 17Z Gas Plant has several regulated flammables, such as propane and natural gasoline. Additionally, the McKittrick 17Z Gas Plant uses  sodium hypochlorite, ethylene glycol and ethyl mercaptan, which are also regulated substances but these chemicals are under threshold limits.\r\n \r\n \r\n GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\r\n \r\n The following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the plant. Because processes at the gas plant that are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) Risk Management Program (RMP) regulation are also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) process safety management (PSM) standard. This summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program. It is our policy at the  McKittrick 17Z Gas Plant to adhere to all Federal, State and Local laws. If emergency were to occur, it is part of our training and a"

Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team.  Employees have access to all information created as part of the gas plant accident prevention program.  Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the gas plant and addresses each accident prevention program element.  In addition, the gas plant has a number of initiatives under way that address process safety and employee safety issue.  These initiatives include forming teams to promote both process and personal safety.  The teams typically have members from various areas of the plant, including operations, maintenance, engineering, and plant management.  Also all plant operators are encouraged to participate in company Safety Suggestion program to provide operator's input to improve safety in plant operations, to be involve in the Near Miss program which provides operator's personal situation in preventing accidents, and Behavioral Based Safety Training program which gives operators an opportunity to observe other operators in work situations and discuss safety suggestion for at risk behavior or commend operator's safe conduct.\r\n \r\n Process Safety Information\r\n \r\n The CHEVRON McKittrick 17Z Gas Plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information"

A table summarizing the reference documents and their location is readily available as part of the written employee participation plan to help employees locate any necessary process safety information.\r\nChemical specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/ exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs).  This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  For specific process areas, the gas plant has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) in a Key Process Parameter Document. The gas plant ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\r\n \r\n The gas plant also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment. This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\r\n \r\n Process Hazard Analysis (PHA)\r\n \r\n The CHEVRON McKittrick 17Z Gas Plant has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards."

HAZOP analysis and the \"What If\" methodology are recognized to be one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques. The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures.  The team then makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\r\n \r\n The PHA team findings are forwarded to local and/or corporate management for resolution. Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\r\n \r\n To help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the plant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.  Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\r\n \r\n  Operating Procedures\r\n \r\n The CHEVRON McKittrick 17Z Gas Plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary ope"

These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  These procedures are periodically reviewed through Job Safety Analysis (JSA) program by two or more operators to analyzed tasks, to identify possible hazards, to ensure safeguards in place and follow through with recommendations and modifications to improve job safety. Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) are certified as current and accurate annually.  The procedures are also kept current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process. Upper and lower operating limits and consequence of deviation and how to correct deviation on most of the critical equipment most particularly the fractionation section are incorporated in the written standard operating procedures. This information is readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their tasks.\r\n \r\n \r\n Training\r\n \r\n To complement the written procedures for process operations, the McKittrick 17Z Gas Plant has implemented a refresher training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  New employees receive basic training in gas plant operations if they are not already familiar with such operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate (e.g., through oral and skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently. In addition, all operators periodically read and revalidate the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  \r\n \r\n Contractors\r\n \r\n The CHEVRON McKittrick 17Z Gas Plant uses cont"

Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the gas plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform gas plant personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.  This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work and the issuance of work permits that include general work permit, confined space entry permit and hot work permit for any welding work.  In addition, the  McKittrick 17Z Gas Plant evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor.  Gas plant personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations. This is documented in our Be Safe BBS database, however locations are not identified specifically.\r\n \r\n Pre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSR)\r\n \r\n The Chevron McKittrick 17Z Gas Plant conducts a PSSR for any new unit or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready.
