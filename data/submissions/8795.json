      "SummaryText": "Teledyne Continental Motors (TCM) - Turbine Engines (Teledyne) manufactures turbine engines for flight vehicles.  Teledyne has two ammonia refrigeration systems that are referred to as the east bunker and west bunker ammonia refrigeration systems.  Each ammonia refrigeration system can be classified as an air cooling system.  Both ammonia refrigeration systems are designed to cool air from ambient temperature to -65 degrees Fahreneheit  to simulate atmospheric conditions for testing the turbine engines.  The air is cooled in stages by passing through the \"east and west bunkers\" before flowing to a testing tunnel.  The east bunker and west bunker ammonia refrigeration systems contain approximately 6,000 pounds and 7,000 pounds of ammonia charge, respectively.\n  \nThe safety and health of all employees is a primary concern at Teledyne.  It is the responsiblity of management at all levels and each employee, regardless of position or job classification.  Teledyne will continue or initiate, where necessary, positive and forceful actions to verify adequate employee health and safety by supplementing minimum established standards.  These actions include:  conducting systematic safety audits to identify unsafe conditions or practices and compliance with applicable laws, provide appropriate training in safety and health practices, provide appropriate physical and mechanical safeguards, and investigate accidents and near-misses to identify causes and prevent recurrence.  Teledyne's objective is to prevent unwanted releases of ammonia into locations that could potentially expose employees and others to serious hazards.  An effective program requires a systematic approach to evaluating the entire system.  Workplace and process safety are major concerns to management and employees alike.  The prevention and mitigation of unwanted releases of ammonia into locations that could expose employees and residents to serious hazards is of primary concern.   \n\nTeledyne has developed this p"

      "SummaryText": "rogram in accordance with OSHA Title 29 CFR 1910.119, and the USEPA Title 40 CFR Part 68.  The program is designed to inform all employees of the hazards of ammonia, procedures for the safe use of ammonia, and the steps taken for the safety of employees in the event of a release or spill (i.e., emergency action plan(29 CFR 1910.38), management of change procedures, preventative maintenance program, employee training, etc.).  In addition, Teledyne has developed a site wide written safety program that includes written rules, procedures, and responsiblities for the following:  general safety, personal protective equipment, handling of explosives, chemical safety, material handling, environmental, machinery, equipment and processes, compressed gases, fire safety, laboratory safety, office safety, and hazard control system.  \n\nTeledyne has performed a worst case release scenario and an alternative release scenario to determine the potential impact of an ammonia release on the surrounding community.  The worst case release scenario would impact approximately a 0.5 mile radius from the facility and the alternative release scenario would impact approximately a 0.1 mile radius from the facility.  Therefore, each scenario has a potential offsite impact.  The worst case release scenario looked at a potential release from the high pressure receiver which contains approximately 7,000 pounds of ammonia.  In the worst case release scenario, the building was used as passive mitigation.  The alternative release scenario dealt with a leak from the high pressure receiver which contains approximately 1,500 pounds of ammonia during operation.  USEPA's RMP Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration reference tables and equations were used in determining the worst case and alternative release scenarios offsite impacts.  A release of either nature is unlikely due to the following:  Teledyne employees perform routine visual inspections and maintenance on all components which comprise each system."

      "SummaryText": "The worst case scenario is unlikely when the system is not operating and the ammonia is \"locked\" in the high pressure receiver by the king valve.  During operation, all system parameters are monitored by a computer system.  The computer monitors temperatures, pressures, liquid levels in the pressure receivers, etc. and will automatically shutdown the system if any process conditions exceed the normal operating ranges and/or setpoints.  The high pressure receiver also has liquid level cut outs which would minimize the amount of ammonia released and includes liquid level sight glasses which are inspected periodically and must remain within a safe operating range or the system is shutdown.  The high pressure receiver is monitored for pressure and will result in an automatic system shutdown if a high pressure situation is reached.  The high pressure receiver has solenoid valves which control the flow to the high pressure receiver and will open and close dependant upon the liquid levels detected and thereby minimize the potential of a release.  The high pressure receiver also has pressure relief valves which will vent to the roof if a high pressure situation is encountered.\n\nTeledyne has had no accidental releases of ammonia in the past five years.  \n\nTeledyne has developed an emergency action plan in compliance with OSHA 29 CFR 1910.119 (n), OSHA 29 CFR 1910.38, and USEPA 40 CFR 68.90.  Teledyne has coordinated all emergency response activities with the Toledo Fire Department and the Toledo Fire Department will perform all HAZMAT activities at the facility.  The emergency action plan establishes the procedures necessary to follow in case of an ammonia release as well as the order of notification for off-site responders.  Employees will receive the training required to recoginize an ammonia release and to intiate the emergency action plan procedures by notifying the proper authorities.

Teledyne's emergency action plan includes:  pre-emergency planning and coordination with outside parties (e.g., the Toledo Fire Department), drills and preparedness acitivities to respond to a potential ammonia release, employees roles, lines of authority, training and communication, emergency recognition and prevention, safe distances and places of refuge, site security and control, evacuation routes and procedures, emergency medical treatment and first aid, emergency alerting and response procedures, and critique of response and follow-up reports to improve the efficiency and execution of the emergency action plan.\n\nThere are changes currently on going at the facility that will improve the safety and minimization of a potential release.  Teledyne, at present, is installing larger exhaust fans for the west bunker ammonia refrigeration system engine room.  Teledyne also has plans to surround the high pressure receiver for the west bunker ammonia refrigeration system with thick plexiglass barriers to protect it against a potential impact from adjacent equipment potential failures."
