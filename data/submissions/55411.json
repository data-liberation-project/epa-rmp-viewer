To satisfy this requirement, Sunridge Nurseries has instituted a program that \n\nincludes: good management practices, up-to-date operating procedures, regularly-scheduled \n\nequipment inspection and maintenance, hazard analysis, and the proper safety training for our \n\nemployees.\n\n\n\nRegulated Substances:\n\nThe only regulated substance held by Sunridge Nurseries is annhydrous ammonia (CAS# 7664-41-7) \n\nfor use in our cold storage refrigeration units.  The total amount held by the receiver tank is \n\n1647 gallons, or 28048.41 pounds.\n\n\n\nRelease Prevention/Emergency Response:\n\nWith this program, it is the intention of Sunridge Nurseries to fully comply with the Emergency \n\nPlanning and Community Right-to-Know ACT (EPCRA), SS302.  Sundridge Nurseries has instituted an \n\nEmergency Action Plan that instructs employees on their actions in case of an accidental or \n\nunauthorized release of anhydrous ammonia.  Training on these procedures is given upon the \n\ninitial hire of an employee and at least annually thereafter.  Additionally, daily visual inspec-\n\ntions will be made of all compressor pressure and temperature readings.  Once every six months\n\na visual inspection will be made of all process piping and equipment.  Repairs to the equipment\n\nwill only be made using parts approved for use in conjunction with anhydrous ammonnia by the \n\nmanufacturer.  \n\n\n\nFive Year Accident History:\n\nThis facility was newly constructed in 1994 and has not had any unauthorized or accidental \n\nreleases to date.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response:\n\nIn the event of an unauthorized or accidental release at this facility, the priority of onsite\n\nemployees is to evacuate the area.  Steve Maniaci, Abel Martinez, or other designated supervisors\n\nwill call the Kern County Fire Department (9-1-1) and Hal Crumly, Inc.  Sunridge Nurseries does not maintain an\n\nemergency on-site responder. "
