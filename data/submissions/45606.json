      "SummaryText": "Hercules Incorporated - Franklin Virginia\nRisk Management Plan \nExecutive Summary\n\nThe Hercules Incorporated Franklin Facility (Facility) is located approximately three miles southwest of the City of Franklin in Southampton County.  The Facility adjoins an Eastman Chemical Company facility and a GEO Specialty Chemicals, Inc. facility; however, Hercules owns the land on which the Eastman and GEO are located.  The combined site encompasses 120 acres, of which approximately 30 acres are developed.  The topography surrounding the Facility is classified as rural.  The Facility consists of one major process area and one support operation.  These areas generally operate 24 hours per day, 365 days per year.  The Facility stores one regulated substance, phosphorous trichloride (PCl3), in quantities above the Risk Management Plan (RMP) threshold.  PCl3 is an RMP Toxic substance.  There are no RMP Flammable substances onsite.\n\nThe Facility believes it is important to note that there have been no reportable accidents in this process during the last five years.\n\nThe Facility receives PCl3 in tank trucks.  It is unloaded from the trucks into either a 12,000-gallon tank or one of two 6,000-gallon tanks.  The tanks are located in an enclosed building.  This is designed to contain all the material from a catastrophic tank failure.  From the storage tanks, PCl3 is pumped to the reactors.  The process boundaries include truck unloading, PCl3 piping, storage tanks, and reactors.  The worse case scenario for PCl3 is considered to be a line leak during transfer of PCl3 from the storage tank to the reactor. The transfer pump is automatically shutdown on a set time.  The amount estimated to be released is 1,440 pounds.  The toxic endpoint is estimated to be 0.028 mg/l.  The distance to the endpoint is 0.41 miles.  There are three residences within this area with an estimated population of 4.  Public receptors in this area are residences, nearby industry, a boat landing, and a church.  The "

      "SummaryText": "Facility conducted a HAZOP for this process area in 2004.\n\nThe alternate release scenario for PCl3 involves an instantaneous release of the 12,000-gallon (156,700-pound) PCl3 storage tank located within the enclosed building.  There is a dike and enclosure in place around the storage tank within the building that will contain and mitigate a release.  The entire contents of the storage tank would be confined within the dike, forming a liquid pool.  The enclosure area remains dry at all times, because PCl3 reacts with water to form hydrogen chloride (HCl) gas.  Therefore, the generation of HCl is minimized in the event of a release.  The toxic endpoint is estimated to be 0.028 mg/l PCl3.  The distance to the endpoint is 0.11 miles.  There are no residences or other public receptors within this distance.\n\nThis process fits in the Category 3 Program.  Many of the elements of the required prevention program have been implemented Facility-wide, including the Management of Change.  The program includes other items such as process controls, mitigation systems in use, and the use of monitoring systems.\n\nAs required, this process is covered under the Facility's Emergency Response Plan as well as other regulatory required Response Plans.  The Facility also has an Integrated Contingency Plan.  The Franklin-Southampton-Isle of Wight (FSI) Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) Hazardous Material Plan incorporates the Facility's plans into their response plans.  The Facility's Environmental Supervisor is an active member of the LEPC."
