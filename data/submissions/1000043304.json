Each of the following sections provides a general overview of the requirements and defines the design attributes, documentation, and actions that are established to comply with those requirements.  In most instances, Smithfield (Clayton Division) has already developed measures and systems that provide compliance with 40 CFR Part 68 rules as a result of other regulatory programs and requirements.  This document does not replicate that information but rather provides cross-references to the applicable existing documentation.  In those instances where information was developed specifically to comply with the Part 68 requirements, that information is contained in this document.\r\n\r\n1.1. \tCorporate Commitment to Safety\r\n\r\nSmithfield (Clayton Division) is committed in providing to all employees a work environment that is free from recognized health and safety hazards.  Accordingly, our goal is achieving and sustaining a Zero Accident Tolerance through communication, information, and training.  To this end, we are dedicated to the concept that all employees receive the proper orientation and are provided with the means necessary to ensure the environment remains as safe and healthful as possible.\r\n\r\n1.1.1. \tIt is the policy of Smithfield (Clayton Division) to:\r\n\r\n1.1.1.1 \tProvide safe working conditions, proper tools, and personal protective equipment.\r\n\r\n1.1.1.2 \tComply with all federal, state, and local occupational health, safety, and environmental laws and regulations.\r\n\r\n1.1.1.3 \tProvide and sustain a high level of commitment to ensure all employees have a safe and healthy work environment in which to wo"

In this effort our highest priority will be the proactive pursuit of cost-effective process changes that reduce or eliminate the use and/or generation of hazardous toxics at the endpoint of service.  Where hazardous toxics cannot be eliminated, improving controls to handle these substances will be explored and implemented wherever possible.\r\n\r\n1.1.4. \tSmithfield (Clayton Division) has prepared a facility safety policy and procedures program specifically tailored for the facility. In addition, a Process Safety Management Program has also been established and implemented regarding the ammonia refrigeration system process.  It is the responsibility of the designated facility personnel to carry out these programs.\r\n\r\n1.1.5. \tThe first duty of Smithfield (Clayton Division) employees is to exercise care in the performance of his/her work tasks to prevent an accident to him/herself, co-workers, the general public or equipment.

Products are received and shipped via truck on a regular basis.\r\n\r\n1.2.1. \tThe substance regulated under the Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions (40 CFR 68) that is located on site, in various locations and quantities is anhydrous ammonia.\r\n\r\n1.2.2. \tAnhydrous Ammonia is utilized on site for the Process System. Approximately 34,000 pounds of ammonia is used as the refrigerant in the system.  The ammonia is contained and used in various vessels, compressors, piping, and evaporators used throughout the refrigeration process.  A single machine room houses the majority of the refrigeration machinery, vessels, piping and motor control centers.\r\n\r\n1.3. \tWorst Case Release Scenario\r\n\r\n1.3.1. \tAs stipulated in EPA guidelines, 40 CFR Part 68.25(b)(1) the worst-case release scenario was calculated and the results are on file at the Smithfield (Clayton Division) facility. \r\n\r\n1.4. \tAlternate Case Release Scenario\r\n\r\n1.4.1. \tThe alternative release scenario was also calculated according to the EPA guidelines and is on file at the facility. \r\n\r\n1.5. \tEmergency Response Program\r\n\r\n1.5.1. \tSmithfield (Clayton Division) is equipped with an emergency information system.
