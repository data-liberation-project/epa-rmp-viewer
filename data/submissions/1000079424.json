We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public, as well as protection of the environment.\r\n\r\nThe Enterprise Kutz Terminal and Storage is owned by Enterprise Terminals & Storage, LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Mapletree, LLC and operated by Enterprise Products Operating,LLC.  We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help provide for the safety of our employees and the public, as well as protection of the environment.  This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including:\r\n\r\n* A description of our facility and use of substances required by EPA's RMP regulation and the processes involved\r\n* A summary of results from our assessment of the potential offsite consequences from accidental chemical releases\r\n* Emergency Response Programs\r\n* General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\n* A five-year accident history for accidental releases of chemicals at the Kutz Terminal that are regulated by EPAA\u00bfs RMP rule.  \r\n\r\nFacility Description\r\n\r\nThe Kutz Terminal is a natural gas liquid (NGL) pipeline system, mixed NGL storage and unloading facility.  The tank storage facility is covered by Federal Regulation 40 CFR Part 68.   We have entered the facility as an RMP Program Level 1 facility since there are no receptors within the calculated worst case distance.  Additionally, there have been no incidents with offsite conseequences in the last five years,"

This pipeline contains mixed NGL (natural gasoline,iso-pentane, normal pentane, normal butane, iso-butane, propane and ethane).  The Kutz storage tank is a single pressure vessel that receives mixed NGL from the transport truck unloading docks at the site.  This tank is used as a holding tank for subsequent injection of the mixed liquid product into the mixed NGL pipeline.  The tank level is administratively controlled to hold and not exceed 90% of its capacity.\r\n\r\nIn our process we use the following hazardous materials that the EPA has identified as having the potential to cause significant offsite consequence in the event of a substantial accidental release:\r\n\r\nToxics\r\n\r\nNo toxic materials to report.\r\n\r\nFlammables\r\n\r\nMixed NGL is received from transport trucks and is delivered into the storage tank.  This material from the tank is pumped into the mixed NGL product pipeline for transportation to the other facilities for fractionation.\r\n\r\nKey Offsite Consequence Analysis Scenarios\r\n\r\nThe EPA's RMP rule requires that we provide information about the worst-case scenario(s) and alternative release scenario(s) for our facility.  The following are brief summaries of these scenarios, including information about the key administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the exposure distances for each scenario.\r\n\r\nWorst Case Release Scenario - Regulated Toxic Chemical\r\n\r\nThere are no regulated toxic chemicals to report for the Hobbs Terminal.\r\n\r\nAlternate Release Scenario(s) - Regulated Toxic Chemical\r\n\r\nThere are no regulated toxic chemicals to report for the Hobbs Terminal.\r\n\r\nWorse Case Scenario - Regulated Flammable Chemicals\r\n\r\nThis simulation involves the rupture or failure of the storage tank"

The process at the facility is regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) regulation (Program 1).  Release prevention is provided through the use of written operating procedures, employee training in written procedures, including normal operation and emergency release procedures, and in the design of safety and release prevention equipment installed at the terminal site.  In addition, a written safety program designed to comply with all applicable OSHA safety performance regulations is strictly enforced at all Enterprise facilities, including the Kutz Terminal and Storage facility.  As part of the Enterprise safety program, the terminal utilizes procedures that are included in the Enterprise program, but may not specifically be required at non-PSM and/or RMP Program 1 facilities (e.g. Safe work practice training; safe work permitting and hot work permitting).\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program\r\n\r\nEnterprise maintains an"

The program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.  Furthermore, the plan is coordinated with the New Mexico State Police, District 10, which includes the San Juan County Sheriff's Department, the local Bloomfield Police department, Fire Department, and Emergency Medical Service.\r\n\r\nIn the event of an accidental release, local Enterprise personnel are trained to sound the alarm, shut off the source from a safe location or activate the emergency shutdown system, contact Enterprise Operations Control and secure the area.  Enterprise Operations Control in turn notifies San Juan Emergency Management, the New Mexico State Police and local Fire Departments.  Remote activation can also be accomplished from the Operations Control center which is based in Houston, Texas.  In addition, there are local gas detection systems that alarm locally and in Houston Control.  If these detectors annunciate, the facility can be shutdown remotely from Houston Control or locally by operations personnel.    \r\n\r\nAccident History\r\n\r\nRecords are kept for all significant accidental chemical releases that occur at our facility.
