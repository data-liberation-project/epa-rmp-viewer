      "SummaryText": " of the community and to consider these concerns when designing and implementing process safety systems.\n\nThe AlliedSignal Elizabeth Plant is a fluoropolymer resin manufacturing facility located on North Avenue near the Elizabeth Seaport. The plant employs 47 people, and operates 24 hours per day, seven days a week. The product that the facility manufactures is a plastic resin that has excellent moisture barrier properties. The resin pellets manufactured at the Elizabeth plant are shipped to another AlliedSignal plant where they are extruded into a clear film. This film is then used primarily in the manufacture of pill blister packs used to package individual doses of medication by pharmaceutical companies. The facility's Aclon resin manufacturing process consists of polymerizing a mixture of trifluorochloroethylene and vinylidene fluoride. Both of these chemicals are listed in the RMP Rule's list of regulated substances under the flammable section. The AlliedSignal Elizabeth Plant's storage and use of trifluorochloroethylene and vinylidene fluoride exceeds the RMP Rule's threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds and therefore the Aclon Process is covered under the RMP Rule.\n\nIn accordance with the requirements of the RMP rule, a description of the following seven elements is provided for the AlliedSignal Elizabeth Plant.\n\n1. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:\n\nIt is the policy of the AlliedSignal Elizabeth Plant to operate a safe and environmentally sound facility by identifying and controlling health, safety and environmental risks related to its operations; by designing its processes to protect people, property, and the environment; by conducting audits and continually reviewing and improving programs for safety, health and environmental excellence; and by establishing processes to assure that all laws and regulations applicable to its operations and products are known and observed.

The Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled:\n\nThe AlliedSignal Elizabeth Plant uses trifluorochloroethylene and vinylidene fluoride in the manufacture of Aclon plastic resin. Both materials are stored and handled in quantities that exceed the threshold quantities specified in the RMP rule. The site's stationary source of trifluorochloroethylene consists of bulk storage and process distribution equipment located on the eastern side of the Polymers building. Trifluorochloroethylene is received on site via a tank truck and unloaded by trained plant operators to an aboveground storage tank. The maximum capacity of the trifluorochloroethylene tank is 100,000 pounds. The site's stationary source of vinylidene fluoride consists of bulk storage and process distribution equipment that is also located on the eastern side of the Polymers building. Vinylidene fluoride is received on site via a tube trailer. The tube trailer also serves as the bulk storage tank. The vinylidene fluoride tube trailer consists of three individual cylinders for a total storage capacity of 12,000 pounds. Both the trifluorochloroethylene and vinylidene fluoride are hard piped to the Aclon process reactors located inside the Polymers building.\n\n3. Worst Case"

      "SummaryText": " and Alternative Release Scenarios:\n\nThe worst case scenario for the Elizabeth plant is the failure of the trifluorochloroethylene bulk storage tank resulting in the release of 100,000 pounds of material and vapor cloud explosion. The consequence analysis performed in accordance with the RMP rule indicates that the effects of the explosion are limited to within the confines of the fence line of the plant. No public or environmental receptors outside of our property line would be affected.  No alternative release scenarios were performed for trifluorochloroethylene since the worst case scenario does not cross the plant's fence line. \n\nAs a result of the offsite consequence analysis findings for trifluorochloroethylene and vinylidene fluoride, the AlliedSignal Elizabeth Plant meets the eligibility requirements for Program 1 status under the RMP rule.\n\n4. General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps:\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program at the AlliedSignal Elizabeth Plant for both the trifluorochloroethylene and vinylidene fluoride consists of the following elements:\nA. An established Process Safety Management System for oversight and control of the Aclon Process.\nB.  Development and implementation of accurate standard operating procedures for safe operation and maintenance of the process.\nC. An ongoing mechanical integrity program that insures critical process equipment is designed, constructed, installed, tested and maintained in accordance to applicable standards and codes. \nD. Performance of Process Hazard Analysis with prompt resolution of any recommendations.\nE.  The use of safety shutdowns, excess flow valves, pressure relief valves, interlocks, gas detection systems, process monitoring and distributed control systems.\nF.  Management of Change procedures.\nG.  Incident investigation procedures.\nH.  Pre-startup safety reviews.\nI.   Annual operator classroom training and written testing.\nJ. Leak detection sensor"

Only trained AlliedSignal employees handle trifluorochloroethylene and vinylidene fluoride.\n\nChemical Specific Prevention Steps:\n\nA. Developing an understanding among the operators for the hazardous properties of both trifluorochloroethylene and vinylidene fluoride, the process chemistry and safe operational limits such as temperatures, pressures, and flows.\nB.  Understanding the consequences of unsafe chemical handling, process deviations and inadvertent mixing of incompatible chemicals.\nC. Knowledge of the requirements, capabilities and limitations of both personal protective and emergency response equipment.\nD. Designing the process technology and equipment based on a thorough understanding of the hazards of trifluorochloroethylene and vinylidene Fluoride.\n\n5. Five Year Accident History:\n\nNo accidental releases covered by the RMP regulation of either trifluorochloroethylene or vinylidene Fluoride have occurred at the AlliedSignal Elizabeth Plant in the previous 5 years.\n\n6. The Emergency Response Program:\n\nThe AlliedSignal Elizabeth Plant has an emergency preparedness planning and response program designed to deal with accidental releases and other unplanned events associated with trifluorochloroethylene and vinylidene fluoride. The site has a written Emergency Action Plan that addresses various types of contingencies including specific actions in response to scenarios involving the release of hazardous materials. The plan provides for both internal site and external community emergency notification with established calling procedures. The plan addresses emergency health care, evacuation and assembly areas, emergency responsibilities, response and control procedures, and emergency response equipment. The plan also provides for an incident command system to direct and coordinate response activities. The plan has been coordi"

The AlliedSignal Elizabeth Plant maintains its own professionally trained Emergency Response Team that is knowledgeable and prepared to respond to incidents involving the release of hazardous materials. Plant emergency response drills are conducted at least two times per year to insure readiness. Post drill critiques are conducted to identify any deficiencies observed in the implementation of the emergency action plan.\n\n7. Planned Changes to Improve Safety:\n\nA Process Hazard Analysis of the AlliedSignal Elizabeth Plant's Aclon process was completed in March of 1998. In addition, an audit of the Aclon process was conducted in June of 1998 by the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection.  As a result of these systematic safety reviews, several action items were identified and implemented to improve upon the existing safeguards of the Aclon process and to further reduce the potential for an accidental release of hazardous materials. Process Hazard Analysis are reviewed and revalidated every five years. The New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection conducts a comprehensive safety review of the Aclon process every year and findings are used for continuous safety improvement and risk reduction."
