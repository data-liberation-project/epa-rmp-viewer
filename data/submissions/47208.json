These procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\nTRAINING\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the Anchorage Chemical Terminal has implemented a comprehensive training program for all associates involved in operating a process.  New associates receive basic training in plant operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with an experienced operator to learn process specific duties and tasks.  After employees demonstrate (i.e., through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  In addition, all operations personnel periodically receive refresher training to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  All of this training is documented for each operator.\nCONTRACTORS\nThe Anchorage Chemical Terminal uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner; (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills; (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace; (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency; (5) understand and follow site safety rules; and (6) inform plant personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.
