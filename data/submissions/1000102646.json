These principles are an integral part of our vision and values.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES \n\nAt Plant David M. Ratcliffe, we are committed to operating and maintaining all of our porcesses in a safe and responsible manner.  We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety or our employees, contractors, and the public as well as protection of the environment.  We strive for the goal of no accidents, injuries, unsafe work practices, or unsafe conditions.\n\nREGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nAt David M. Ratcliffe, we produce electricity from natural gas.  In this process, anhydrous ammonia is used to control NOx through selective catalytic reduction.  \n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nAt Plant David M. Ratcliffe, we take a systematic, proactive approach to preventing accidental releases.  This approach to prevention is implemented through programs that incorporate requirements of the EPA Risk Management Plan, the OSHA Process Safety Mangagement standard, and the American Chemistry Council Responsible Care iniative.  In addition to these programs, we have implemented chemical-specific safety features to help monitor, detect, and mitigate accidental releases such as gas detectors, redundant instrumentation and controls, water curtains, and personal protective equipment.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY \n\nThis facility has not experienced an operating accident during the past five years per the reporting criteria. \n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN\n\nAt Plant David M.

      "SummaryText": "rious federal, state, and local regulatory requirements for emergency response planning.  Our written program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, contractors, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.  The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance up to 250 ppm, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs.  The overall emergency response program for the facility is coordinated with an external Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC)\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nAt Plant David M. Ratcliffe, we strive to improve the safety of our operations through periodic safety audits, incident investigations, process hazard analysis, and the solicitation of safety suggestions from employees."
