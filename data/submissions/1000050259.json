      "SummaryText": "Gehl Foods, LLC is committed to being a responsible member of the community by giving top priority to operating in a safe and environmentally sound manner. Gehl Foods, LLC (Main Street facility) is a food processing plant which produces dairy products, for the retail and service markets. Ammonia, a regulated toxic substance, is used in the refrigeration system at this facility. The ammonia is contained in a closed loop system. Gehl Foods, LLC believe that ammonia provides the safest and most efficient cooling choice for our operation.\n\n\n\n\n\nA. Accident Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nGehl Foods, LLC (Main Street facility) uses many precautionary measures to prevent or minimize the accidental release of ammonia from the refrigeration system. These precautions include built in safety systems that will generate alarms or automatically shut down the refrigeration system if design limitations are exceeded (eg. Pressures, temperatures, or vessel operating levels). These safety systems in conjunction with PLC automated control ensure that the system operates within safe limits minimizing the likelihood of an ammonia release. A comprehensive Preventative Maintenance program is used to ensure the on-going mechanical integrity of all equipment in the refrigeration system. Refrigeration Operators are trained to maintenance and operating procedures to minimize the chance of human error and to maintain a well informed and qualified group of refrigeration personnel.\n\n\n\n\n\nB. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nThere is one Ammonia Refrigeration System at Gehl Foods, LLC (Main Street facility). Ammonia is the only substance handled at the Main State facility covered by the Accidental Release Prevention Regulations.  The system contains approximately 25,000 lbs of ammonia.\n\n\n\n\n\nC. Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\n\n\nGehl Foods, LLC (Main Street facility) has an accidental release prevention program that complies with OSHA's Process Safety "

      "SummaryText": "Management standard and the EPA's Risk Management Program regulation. The prevention program consists of the following elements:\n\n\n\n- Employee Participation\n\n- Process Safety Information\n\n- Process Hazard Analysis\n\n- Standard Operating Procedures\n\n- Training\n\n- Contractor\n\n- Pre-startup Safety Review\n\n- Mechanical Integrity (Preventative Maintenance Program)\n\n- Hot Work Permit (Non-routine Work Authorizations)\n\n- Management of Change\n\n- Incident Investigation\n\n- Compliance Audit\n\n- Trade Secret Statement\n\n\n\n\n\nD. Five-Year Accident History\n\n\n\nThere have been no ammonia-related accidents at Gehl Foods, LLC (Main Street facility) in the last five years that resulted in significant on-site or offsite consequences.  \n\n\n\n\n\nE. Emergency Response Program\n\n\n\nAn emergency action plan has been implemented at Gehl Foods, LLC (Main Street facility). This program contains procedures describing how the facility will respond to ammonia releases and other emergencies, including evacuation procedures. This program has been coordinated with the Germantown fire department through emergency planning, onsite tours, and discussions.\n\n\n\n\n\nF. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nAll ammonia releases, regardless of size, are investigated following incident investigation procedures. The objective is to identify recommendations that will prevent these releases from re-occurring. Safety improvements are made to equipment and procedures using this technique to continually improve the safety of the ammonia refrigeration system at Gehl Foods, LLC (Main Street facility). These procedures in conjunction with Process Hazard Analysis findings, Audit findings, and continuous scrutiny of the system following Mechanical Integrity procedures result in continuous upgrades to minimize the likelihood of ammonia releases.\n\n\n\n\n\n"
