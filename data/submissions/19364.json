      "SummaryText": "In this industrial fuel gas facility (Matheson Tri-Gas, Fort Worth, TX), we handle propylene which is considered hazardous by EPA, OSHA, etc.  The same properties that makes propylene valuable as a fuel gas also makes it necessary to observe certain safety precautions when handling and storing this flammable product.  Overall, the prevention of unnecessary human exposures, reducing the threat to our own personal health as well as our coworkers, and reducing the threat to nearby members of the community is the main goal of incorporating this risk management plan into our daily operations.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal and state rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle and store propylene, combined with the safety devices in the design of the propylene system, with safe operting procedures that we utilize, along with the training of our personnel.\n\nThe primary purpose of this facility is to sell industrial gases.  The main process affected by the RMP Regulations is the repackaging of propylene into cylinders which are stored until sold to end customer.  Propylene is stored in an approved storage vessel until needed to fill smaller cylinders.  The Texas Railroad Commission inspects and approves all LP Gas systems, and ensures that all personnel associated with the filling of LP Gas is licensed and certified by the commission.  Standard operating procedures for the filling of smaller cylinders, as well as the proper safe operating procedures of the propylene system are the prevention program for this facility (Level 2).  Maintenance is conducted as needed by a Licensed LP Gas Repairman in accordance with the Texas Railroad Commission's LP Gas regulations.  The maximum amount of propylene that can be stored on-site is 30,960 pounds.  \n\nThe employees at Matheson Tri-Gas (Fort Worth South) conduct proper cylinder filling procedures, as well as Standard Operting Procedures when using the Propylene system.  This means "

      "SummaryText": "that they utilize these procedures on a daily basis to aid in the prevention of a release of propylene during operational periods.  Lock-out / Tag-out procedures are utilized by the Licensed LP Gas Repairmen to aid in the prevention of a release.  All LP gas \"Pumpers\" are licensed by the Texas Railroad Commission for the use of LP Gas Cyloinder filling operations.  These operators are knowledgeable in the start-up and shut-down procedures of the propylene system.\n\nOur emrgency response (action) plan was developed with the assistance of Environmental Data Services, Inc., the Tarrant County LEPC, and the Fort Worth Fire Department.  If a flammable gas release occurs at the 5932 South Freeway location, personnel at the facility will be notified of a release.  LP Gas operators will try to stop the release using manual shutdown procedures.  If this mitigation does not work, notification to the Territory Manager, and 911 (Fort Worth Fire Dept.) will be made for an emergency response.\n\nThe worst case scenario for this facility would be the loss of the propylene storage vessel, resulting in a flammabe release of 30,960 pounds of propylene into the atmosphere.  Passive mitigation was not considered for this scenario.  Active mitigation in the form of excess flow valves would help reduce the release, but in worst case, the release could result in a vapor cloud explosion of 0.25 mile radius.  Within this 0.25 mile radius, there are approximatley 2000 persons affected with approximately 600 households.   These population numbers were baed on Landview III software.\n\nAlternate releases were determined for the 5932 South Freeway location for propylene.  The alternate release for propyene would be a transfere hose failure on the propyene filling system.  If this were to occur, the excess flow valve would close, and prevent any further loss of propylene into the environment.  The result could be a release of up-to 500 pounds of propylene.  This release could result in a distance to "

Safe handling and operational procedures by Trigas, Inc. aid in the prevention of releases of propylene from this location.  Access to this facility is restricted to personnel associated with Trigas, Inc.\n\nThis industrial fuel gas distributor complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule, and with all applicable state/federal codes and regulations."
