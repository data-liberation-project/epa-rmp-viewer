The Facility Policy:\n\nThe owners, management, and employees of Great Plains Cooperative, Lahoma OK are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, and other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2.    Facility Information:\n\n?    The primary activity at the facility is the storage of fertilizers for sale to farmers.\n?    Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for the direct application of fertilizers for crop production nutrients.\n?    The maximum quantity stored at this location woulbe 180,000 pounds in our 12,000 and30,000 gallon tanks.  The maximum quanity in our 12,000 gallon tank is 50,000 pounds and the maximum quanity in our 30,000 gallon tank is 130,000 pounds. \n3.    The worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario:\n\na.    The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tan released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 130,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards. . The distance to the endpoint is 2.4 (This distance is rounded to two significant digits.) miles.\n\nb.    The alternative release scenario based on the five-year accident history (or the most likely potential incident) is a release from a break in a transfer hose.  The distance to the endpoint is 0.83 miles.\n\n4.    The accidental release prevention program:\n\nThe facility has referred to the provisions of ?Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, Kk-611.1?, published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc., and the standards of the U.S. O"

Planned Changes to Improve Safety:\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
