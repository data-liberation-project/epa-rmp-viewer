Safety meetings include training on regulatory requirements and plant specific issues.  Testing is conducted in safety meetings to insure the information is understood.\n\nPlant operators are members of the BEST team (the Bucks Emergency Services Team).  They are trained in the specifics of incident command, emergency response, and medical response.  The plant conducts weekly tests of the plant alarm system and conducts emergency response drills.\n\nThe US Amines Bucks plant complies with RMP and OSHA 1910.119, (the OSHA Process Safety Regulation) through our Process Safety Management Program.  The Bucks plant manages all plant processes per our Process Safety Management program.  The program meets all of the RMP and OSHA requirements such as:\n*  Develop and implement a risk management system.\n*  Conduct hazard assessments of all processes.\n*  Implement accident prevention requirements.\n*  Develop an emergency response program that is coordinated with\n    local agencies.\n*  Track and analyze incidents to prevent reoccurrence.\n\nThe RMP regulation has an additional requirement to develop worst case and alternate case scenarios and make them available to the public.  A summary of these studies is presented below:\n\nWorst Case Scenarios:\nThe Worst Case Scenarios are meant to represent the worst possible incident. There has never been a Worst Case Scenario type event in the 30-year history of the Bucks plant.  The EPA has provided a procedure for calculating the quantity of chemical that could be released and the distance it could travel for a Worst Case Scenario:\n  1. Assume that your largest tank of listed chemical breaks open and spills all of its contents in 10 minutes.\n  2. Determine the maximum distance where there is concern for the public being exposed, based on the EPA supplied exposure data.\n  3.

Additionally, RMP requires each site to determine a less severe scenario that could potentially impact the public.  These are called the Alternate Release Scenarios.

Safety devices such as pressure relief valves and shutdown systems are inspected and tested on a regular basis.\n3. A thermographic camera allows us to check for temperature deviations in equipment, check for electrical faults, and verify levels.\n4. Glass level gauges have been replaced with metal, magnetically-coupled gauges.\n\nSafety Systems: Protective Safety Net\n1. All storage tanks and process vessels are protected against over-pressure by safety relief valves, much like the safety relief valve on your home water heater.\n2. Process safety systems are programmed in our process control computers.  If a designated level, pressure, temperature, or other parameter goes out of range, the process will shut down automatically.\n3. Oxygen analyzers protect the integrity of key equipment including various boiler, compressor, and reactor operations.\n4. All plant modifications and procedure changes undergo a management of change process that involves operations, maintenance, engineering, and management review.\n\nPrepared: For Emergency Response\n1. All plant operators are trained in emergency response, fire fighting, and must pass a physical agility test.\n2. The plant has an extensive fire fighting system with monitor nozzles, hoses, foam generating capability, and water reservoir. \n3. The plant has a portable emergency command vehicle complete with air monitoring equipment, radio and cellular phone systems, emergency response, and decontamination materials.\n4. The plant alarm system is tested weekly to ensure that employees know how to use it.\n5. Emergency response personnel are trained in first aid and CPR."

Like our community neighbors, the people who work at the Bucks site want a clean, safe environment, with no illnesses or injuries at work, home, or play.  That is why US Amines has a zero incident goal.  We are committed to reducing emissions and continuously improving our performance toward zero injuries and zero environmental incidents.\n\nThe amines plant began operations in 1974.  We manufacture amines in five product groups.  We also operate an on-site fertilizer plant owned by IB Nitrogen that is not covered by RMP.  We have about 45 site employees and 15 resident contractors.\n\nThe US Amines product groups are:\n     Isopropylamines\n     Propylamines\n     Cyclohexylamines\n     Ethylamines\n     Butylamines\nThese products are used by other chemical companies to make herbicides, insecticides, and pharmaceuticals.\n\nThe IB Nitrogen product is:\n     Isobutylidene diurea\nThis product is a slow-release specialty fertilizer used on golf courses and turf farms.  It is also used in plant nurseries for growing ornamentals such as azaleas and poinsettias.\n\nThe US Amines Bucks Plant participates in a local community advisory panel and works with other area industrial facilities to promote safety in our operations.  The LeMoyne Community Advisory Panel and the LeMoyne Industrial Park companies are recognized by local, state, and national organizations for outstanding cooperation.  This continued partnership ensures that the community where we all live and work will be a safe place now and in the future.\n\nPlant Organization:\n\nThe plant has a site director (plant manager) who oversees all plant activities.
