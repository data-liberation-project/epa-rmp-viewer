      "SummaryText": "Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Procedures.\n\nSal Chemical is committed to continuous improvement in the chemical industry's responsible distribution and management of chemicals.  As part of that commitment, we make health safety and environmental considerations a priority in our planning for all existing and new operations, products, processes and facilities.  A June 1, 2004, duty assignment of an experienced 8 year employee, Jason Mattern, to health safety and environmental issues is an example.  \n\nDescription of the Facility and Regulated Substances.  \n\nSal Chemical's operations include warehousing, repackaging, and distribution.  Sal Chemical maintains an inventory of chlorine that exceeds the EPA's threshold and occassionally inventory hydrofluoric acid (HF70%) in quantities that exceed the RMP quantity regulation.  Sal may have up to 51,000# of chlorine stored outdoors.  Maximum inventory of 70% HF is 10,000#.  HF is stored in drums inside a 10,000 square foot warehouse.  Neither products are repackaged; they are only stored, inventoried, and shipped to the customer in the origional containers.  The chlorine storage and distribution operation is regulated by OSHA's PSM rule and therefore is a Program 3 process.  HF storage is a program 1.  A worst case release of HF would be 350# released inside a 10,000 Foot building.  The release rate to the outside air is .21 pounds per minute.  The distance to the toxic endpoint of .016mg/L for this release is .1 mile, which would not reach a public receptor.  The distance to the toxic endpoint was estimated using epa's rmpcomp model and the population data was assessed from the US census bureau's internet database.  The worst case release of chlorine at the facility would be a catastrophic release of 2000# of chlorine from a one ton container over a 10 minute period.  The extent of the release was calculated without taking credit for any mitigating factors, which is in accordance with epa requirements"

      "SummaryText": "for calculation the effects of a worst case relesase.  The distance to the toxic endpoint of .0087 mg/L is 1.3 miles, which would potentially imact a residential population of 2700.  epa's model rmpcomp, was used in estimating the distance to the toxic endpoint.  The us census bureau internet site was used to determine the population.  The alternative release scenario for chlorine is a one ton container leak from a one half inch diameter hole, resulting in a leak of 620 pounds per minute of liquid chlorine.  It is estimated that the leak could continue for 60 minutes before being stopped.  Although unlikely to occur, this release scenario is more likely to occur than the worst case scenario described above.  This release would be mitigated by Sal Chemical's storage and inspection program.  The containers are stored away from vehicular traffic, and the containers are inspected daily.  The distance to the toxic endpoint for this scenario is .4 mile, which would potentially impact a residential population of 30.  the release rate was derived from epa's rmp guidance for wastewater treatment plants, and the distance to the toxic endpoint was calculated uning RMP comp.  The residential population was estimated from the us census bureau's internet site.  \n\nGeneral accidental release prevention program and chemical specific prevention steps.  \n\nSal is an active member of the National Association of Chemical Distributors (NACD) and applies the NACD's strict principals for safe distribution of chemical.  Sal Chemical also uses elements of an OSHA PSM program for chlorine operations.  The PSM program contains 12 elements, including a hazard analysis, standard operating procedures, employee training, compliance audits, incident investigations, and management of change. In addition to the psm program, Sal Chemical's chlorine manufacturer provides training to sal employees on safe chlorine management every 1-2 years.  \n\nFive Year Accident History.  \n\nSal Chemical has had no accid"

The Weirton Fire Department annualy inspects Sal Chemical and comments on the site layout and updates first responder information.  Additionally, SalChemical's HS&E mamanger is a memember of the Brooke-Hancock County LEPC.  \n\nPlanned changes to improve safety.  \n\nSal Chemical plans to continue its membership in the NACD and uphold the NACD's principles for safe and chemical distribution.  Sal Chemical will also continue providing training to its employees on the safe handling of regulated substances.  The assignment of Jason, as described above further shows the comittment to safety for the emloyees, community and environment.  The health and safety manual is up for the annual review in August of 2004."
