Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at Willacy Co-op in San Perlita, Texas are strongly committed to employee, public, and\nenvironmental safety.  This commitment is an inherent part of our comprehensive accidental release\nprevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance,\nand employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement\nappropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  We coordinate our\nresponse efforts with the Raymondville Fire Department, which provides additional emergency\nresponse expertise.\n\n  2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities include support services for crop production.  We have anhydrous\nammonia stored in one 12,000-gallon tank, two 6,000-gallon tanks, and two 1,000-gallon nurse tanks\nat our facility in San Perlita, Texas (Figure 1).  The maximum amount stored is 22,100 gallons (\n113,726.6 pounds) including the capacity of the on-site nurse tanks.   The largest single storage\nvessel at our facility contains 52,489.2 pounds at  85% standard maximum storage capacity.\n\n  3. Worst Case Release and Alternative Release Scenarios\nWe utilized RMP Comp for the worst case and alternate case scenarios of the required offsite\nconsequence analysis for our facility.  The following details these scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario involves a catastrophic release of the entire contents of one of the \nlargest single anhydrous ammonia storage tanks (52,489.2 pounds) in gaseous form over a 10-minute\nperiod.  We anticipated that administrative controls or mitigation would not effect the release rate. \nAt Class F a"

Radius2 x 3.14 = area of circle.\n3.4 miles2 x 3.14 x 141 people = approximately 5,118 people within 3.4 mile radius of the site. \n\nThe alternative release scenario involves a release from vehicular collision with the tank resulting\nin a pipe break and the release of anhydrous ammonia through a 1\" dia. hole in the anhydrous\nammonia product line.  Vehicular collision (RMP Hazard Review, Section 8.4) was selected as the\nmost probable causal agent for an alternative release scenario.  The scenario involves the release of \n5,000 pounds of ammonia in a gaseous form over a period of two minutes.  Active mitigation\n(emergency shutoff) limited the release to two minutes.  Under neutral weather conditions, the\nmaximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L of ammonia is 1.2 miles (Figure 3).

The following sections briefly describe the elements\nof the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nWillacy Co-op, San Perlita maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the\nchemical hazards, operating parameters, and equipment designs associated with all processes\n(Appendix D).\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are\nidentified and controlled effec"

Maintenance checks are conducted by qualified personnel with previous\ntraining in maintenance practices.  Examples of process equipment that would receive maintenance\nchecks include:  pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency\nshutdown systems, controls, and pumps.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance\nchecks are corrected in a safe and timely manner (Appendix C).\n\nManagement of Change\nWritten procedures are in place at Willacy Co-op, San Perlita to manage changes in process\nchemicals, technology, equipment, and procedures.  Process operators, maintenance personnel or\nother employees whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly\nnotified of the modification and offered training to deal with it.\n\nPre-startup Reviews\nWillacy Co-op, San Perlita routinely conducts pre-startup safety reviews related to new processes\nand modifications in established processes.
