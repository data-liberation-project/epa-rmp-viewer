This facility is implementing an electronic preventive maintenance system. This system uses a real time database to track preventive maintenance, training and inspection dates and issue reminders to responsible groups.\n\nThe emergency response procedures at this facility ensure emergency response coverage 24 hours - 7 days per week.  There are also adequate provisions for coordination with outside agencies, such as with the Hamilton Township  Fire Department), in the event of an emergency.\n\n\n2.0    Process Description and Regulated Substances\nKraft distributes Kraft food products at the Columbus Ohio facility.  The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for the primary process at this facility is 49312.   Kraft has one regulated substance under 40 CFR 68 at the Columbus, Ohio plant  ammonia. The storage area of the plant is refrigerated by ammonia to keep the products fresh and wholesome.  Ammonia has been widely used as a refrigerant in the food industry for decades.\n\nThe ammonia threshold for triggering applicability to 40 CFR 68 is 10,000 pounds. The quantity of ammonia stored on-site is approximately  18,104 pounds.\n\n    Ammonia is classified as a Group 2 Refrigerant per ASHRAE Standard 34-1989. Its distinctive, pungent odor is very noticeable to most people, even in small quantities. Ammonia is flammable in a very narrow and high range of concentration with a high ignition temperature.  It is not poisonous, but it can be corrosive to human tissue.  Ammonia is readily absorbed into the moisture of the skin and, at high concentrations, can cause  burns. The potential risks to people exposed to an accidental ammonia release include irritation of respiratory tract, burning of skin and oth"

USEPA requires companies to use models for worst-case and alternate release scenarios for each regulated chemical.  Given the safety precautions at the facility, both scenarios are unlikely to occur. If a release occurred, however, the alternative scenario would be more likely.  \n\n    The ammonia release scenario was modeled using SLAB (June 1990 version) to obtain the distance to the ERPG-2 endpoint.   The Emergency Response Planning Guideline, Level 2, ERPG-2, was developed by the American Industrial Hygiene Association.  It refers to the level of ammonia that individuals could be exposed to for up to one hour without being subjected to irreversible or other serious health effects that could make it difficult for them to leave the affected area.\n\n\n4.0    General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n    This facility is regulated under PSM and has developed an OSHA PSM program     for their ammonia refrigeration system.Ammonia falls under the RMP Program 3     prevention program which is identical to the OSHA PSM program.\n    \n    There are several key aspects of the prevention program:\n\n1.    In order to protect piping and evaporators from being impacted by heavy machinery or facility personnel the piping and evaporators have been located on the roof of the facility.\n\n2.    The facility maintains good training and employee awareness of operating procedures.\n\n3.    The ammonia system is a new installation that places the compressor room in an isolated area, which is controlled by state of the art warning and control devices.  Only authorized personnel are allowed in the compressor room.\n\n4.    The facility is equipt with ammo"

The ammonia system controls can be monitored at home through a     personal computer.\n\n    8.    All relief valves located inside the machine room are piping to a common     header that releases to atmosphere.\n    \n    9.    A contractor inspects the ammonia detection and fire equipment on a     quarterly basis.\n\n\n\n 5.0    Five-year Accident History\n\nThe review of this facility's accident history includes the following range of dates: June 22, 1994 - June 21, 1999, must be at least 5 years. To date, there have been no accidental spills or releases ammonia at the Columbus facility.\n\n\n\n6.0    Emergency Response Program\n\nThe Columbus facility has developed an emergency response program in which facility employees are divided into various management teams authorized the commit resources and personnel in the event of an emergency.  There are back-up personnel in the event that the primary incident response personnel cannot be contacted.  The emergency response plan includes information about the  proper procedures, outside resources available, as well as corporate support.  There are also specific procedures to follow in the event of a fire, or ammonia emergency.  \n\n\nDepartment will be called to provide back-up emergency responders and equipment. At the discretion of the Incident Commander, the Hamilton Township Fire The Hamilton Township Fire Department will be called for all fire related emergencies.  In all cases where the fire department is called, an ambulance will also be called to the scene.                                \n\nAs mentioned earlier, this facility has developed an emergency response plan, including, but not limited to, steps to address the following topics: \n            \n7 accidental discharge o"
