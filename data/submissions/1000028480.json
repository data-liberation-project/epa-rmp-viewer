      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\n\n\n\nFantom Materials, Inc. is a manufacturing and research company that specializes in the development of advanced ceramic and other structured materials.  At this time, the primary product involves the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) of silicon carbide onto graphite substrates to produce an extremely rigid and durable material with many commercial uses.  The CVD process uses Methyltrichlorosilane (MTS) as a feedstock and smaller quantities of inorganic acids and bases, organic solvents, and oils in the process.  The primary hazard with MTS is the evolution of hydrochloric acid (HCl) vapors when exposed to water or humid air.\n\n\n\nPlant production and storage containment facilities are located in a small industrial park within the city limits of Lihue, Hawaii. The production plant is a two-story warehouse of approximately 3,600 square feet.  The MTS storage containment unit consists of two separate concrete bunkers specifically designed for this purpose.  Each bunker is approximately 780 square feet and are located immediately adjacent to the Production Plant.  Included in this containment unit are HCl and combustible gas detection sensors, along with emergency foam suppression and HCl vapor scrubber systems.  The quantity of MTS stored on location will range from 5,000 - 50,000 pounds, depending on production requirements.  MTS is contained and dispensed from 120-gallon pressure-rated portable tanks.  \n\n\n\nThe Fantom Materials Emergency Response Plan (ERP) establishes functions and responsibilities for all employees with respect to detailed response procedures.  This includes early notification to our immediate neighbors, as well as our local emergency response network, including the fire department, the local Civil Defense Agency and the State of Hawaii Department of Health.  It is the objective of Trex Hawaii to handle all possible situations where the safety of its employees, the community, or the environment may be at risk due to the hazards that "

All communication begins, and is coordinated through, the Emergency Coordinator (EC).  The EC is supported by two alternates to ensure this critical function is in place at all times.  Facility E-Stop \"push-button\" mechanisms are installed across all critical process control equipment areas providing the option to immediately shut down plant operations in the event of an emergency.\n\n\n\nSituations that are within the expertise and training of the Fantom Materials spill response personnel will be handled in-house, however if any situation arises that cannot be managed safely by facility personnel, procedures require that local emergency responders be called in to assist in the management of the situation.  In general, clean up of spills of MTS will be handled by the Fantom Materials Spill Response Team, however if large releases of MTS product are identified, then the County Hazmat emergency response team will be called in to respond.\n\n\n\nA fully integrated gas detection system provides direct support to our ERP by monitoring air quality in all MTS processing areas, providing both a low-level and high-level alarm response.  This system automatically alerts key members of management by cell phone whenever alarms are activated.  Both audible and visual alarms placed strategically throughout the facility alert all employees of any released gases, or conditions that pose a threat to their safety.  The gas detection system central console relays data to the plant Program Logic Control (PLC) system, providing the precise location and severity of any released gases or unsafe conditions.  In addition, an automated AAAF foam suppression system located inside the MTS Containment Unit provides an immediate blanket covering over any released.  This covering minimizes the release o"

Key elements within this plan include:\n\n-  a comprehensive Process Safety Information reference system \n\n-  detailed Standard Operation Procedures for all equipment operations\n\n-  continuous training in both operator and safety disciplines\n\n-  a formal line-item constraints review process prior to equipment startup\n\n-  formalized mechanical integrity testing and maintenance programs\n\n-  a formalized management of change procedure to address change impact prior to change implementation\n\n-  a formalized Emergency Response Plan coordinated with local emergency planning and response agencies\n\n\n\nThere have been no accidents to report during this 5-year resubmission period of 6/11/07 - 6/11/12.\n\n\n\nTraining programs at Fantom Materials include site-specific instruction and operational technique drills directly related to CVD processing.  8-hour HAZWOPER 1st Responder and SCBA equipment training is on-going, along with monthly drills to keep the response team sharp and proficient in the use response equipment.  New employees receive a comprehensive 2-hour classroom training session in addition to site-specific on the job safety awareness instruction from both management and their peers.  Annual Safety training for all employees includes Hazard Communication, Respirator & PPE, Lock out-Tag out, Fall Protection and the ABCs of Fire Extinguisher operations.\n\n\n\nFuture enhancements to plant operations include the full integration of plant PLC data processing, providing real-time monitoring of all critical process control parameters.  Trending of data to provide early warning of equipment discrepancies plays a vital role in process safety management.  Training program improvements will continue to be a high priority as we standardize operations go"
