The ammonia is stored at the sight in a liquid form.\n    A worst case scenario and an alternative release scenario were calculated using EPA Risk Management program guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration.  The worst case scenario requires the companies to calculate the worst possible situation without regard to the probability of this happening.  The alternative situation requires the companies to calculate the more probable situation.  The end points for the Stayton Plant is 1.7 miles worst case and 0.1 miles for the alternative case.\n    NORPAC complies with rules, regulations and recommendations from OSHA, ASME, AIIR, EPA, DEQ, PSM, etc.  NORPAC also keeps full time refrigeration engineering personnel monitoring the system 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.   This personnel receive on the job training as well as off-site training dealing in maintenance and safety of the equipment and the process.\n    NORPAC has not had a release resulting in an off site consequence  in the last 25 years  \n    NORPAC has set up emergency evacuation plans for the plants.  These plans would go into effect with the local emergency responders.\n    NORPAC uses safety committees, on the job training, safety seminars and safety training to identify and improve overall safety at the facility."
