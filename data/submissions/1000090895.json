The oil pots receive liquid ammonia and oil from the recirculators and vent ammonia vapor back to the recirculators. The oil still receives liquid ammonia and oil from the recirculator and intercooler. The oil pots and oil still are equipped with spring-return oil drain valves which are used to drain oil from the systems as needed.

The compressors receive low pressure vapor from the recirculators (west system), suction accumulator, or intercooler (east system), and discharge high pressure vapor to the evaporative condensers. The compressors are equipped with high discharge pressure cutouts to shut the equipment off if the pressure exceeds the setpoint. Under normal conditions, the compressors contain both high and low pressure vapor ammonia.\n\n\n\nEvaporative Condensers\n\nThe purpose of the evaporative condensers is to reject the heat absorbed in the evaporators to the atmosphere. The evaporative condensers receive high pressure, superheated vapor from the compressors and supply high pressure liquid to the high pressure receivers/thermosyphon vessel. The condensers use air and water to cool the warm ammonia as it passes through a series of tubes within the condenser. As the cooling medium of air and water draws the heat from the vapor, the refrigerant condenses into a liquid and flows to the high pressure receivers/thermosyphon vessel.

The auto-purgers consist of the following components: water bubbler, foul gas line, liquid line, suction line, water line, drain line, and remote purge point solenoid valves. The auto-purgers remove non-condensable gases by refrigerating the foul gas so that the ammonia vapor condenses to liquid and can be returned to the systems.

The relief valve discharge piping is terminated at the bottom of the ammonia diffusion tank. The ammonia diffusion tank is 13.3' dia. x 30' high (31,316.5 gallon capacity). At a water level of 21'-0\", the tank contains 21,921.5 gallons of water which exceeds the quantity recommended by ANSI/IIAR 2-2014 Addendum A ?15.5.3 which is based on 1 gallon of water per pound of ammonia released through the largest relief valve in the system in 60 minutes. Under normal conditions, the ammonia diffusion tank contains water.\n\n\n\nScrew Compressor Safety Devices\n\nEach screw compressor has numerous safety devices to protect the compressor and the associated equipment. The following list summarizes the safety devices built into each screw compressor package:\n\nHigh Discharge Pressure Cutout - The high discharge pressure cutout, will shut down the compressor if the discharge pressure equals or exceeds the setpoint.\n\nLow Suction Pressure Cutout - The low suction pressure cutout will shut down the compressor if the suction pressure is equal to or less than the setpoint.\n\nOil Pressure Cutout - The oil pressure cutout will shut down the compressor if the oil pressure equals or deviates below the setpoint.\n\nHigh Oil Temperature Cutout - The high oil temperature cutout will shut down the compressor if the oil temperature equals or exceeds the setpoint.\n\nLow Oil Temperature Cutout - The low oil temperature cutout will shut down the compressor if the oil temperature equals or falls below the setpoint"
