Risk Management Program.\n\nPOLICY ON SAFETY AND ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION\n\nArchimica is committed to operating our facilities safely and in compliance with all applicable regulations.   Archimica considers the management of Environmental, Safety and Health considerations to be an integral component of our business.  All employees are expected to assume responsibility for process safety consistent with their function and level of authority. \n\nFACILITY OVERVIEW AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nArchimica Inc. produces materials for use in pharmaceuticals.  These materials include both intermediate chemicals that are used to produce pharmaceutical active ingredients and the active ingredients themselves.  \n\nThis facility has been in continuous operation since 1947.  It was previously operated under the name Syntex Agribusiness, Inc. and Clariant LSM (Missouri) Inc.  The facility is located on 66 acres and employs approximately 100 people including many scientists and engineers.  The facility operations are regulated by the FDA, OSHA, DEA, EPA, MDNR and other Federal, State and local agencies.\n\nTitanium Tetrachloride (TiCl4) is a raw material used in the manufacture of a pharmaceutical intermediate.  The EPA Risk Management Planning Threshold Quantity for TiCl4 is 2500 lbs. \n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION - TITANIUM TETRACHLORIDE\n\nTitanium Tetrachloride is delivered to Archimica in a bulk tank container (iso-container).  It is then transfered from this container into the manufacturing process using enclosed piping and hoses.  The maximum intended site inventory for TiCl4 in the manufacturing process is 30,864 lbs.  Therefore, this process is subject to Risk Management Plan requirements for titanium tetrachloride and Program 3 elements are applied.\n\nTitanium tetrachloride is stored on-site in the ISO-container used to ship the material to the "

The ISO-container is staged in a 12 ft x 36 ft containment berm adjacent to the process manufacturing building where it will be used.  The unloading hose and piping is connected to the container.  The connections to the container are then pressure tested before material is transferred to the manufacturing process.  The system is equiped with pressure relief systems and remotely operated shut-off valves.    \n\nACCIDENT PREVENTION PROGRAMS\n\nArchimica has mature safety programs that meet OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) and EPA's Risk Management Plan (RMP) requirements.  The success of these prevention programs is reflected in Archimica's long history of handling PSM/RMP chemicals safely.  Archimica's prevention programs are include technology-, personnel-, and facilities-related elements.\n\nTechnology-related elements include safety systems in the processes (control systems, alarms, interlocks, monitoring systems), process hazards analysis (PHA), operating procedures and safe practices, and management of change (MOC).  These elements are utilized to manage all physical, procedural, and technical changes made on this site.  A plant-wide database is used for tracking MOCs.\n\nFacilities-related elements that significantly contribute to the success of the prevention program include the mechanical integrity program and the pre-startup safety reviews (PSSR). The mechanical integrity program assures compliance with Good Engineering Practices (GEPs), proper equipment preventative maintenance, and equipment quality assurance.  \n\nPersonnel-related elements include formal training and incident investigation.  Both of these programs utilize database systems to maintain and organize records so that site personnel are able to track plant performance in these areas.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nIn accordance with RMP reporting requirements, Archimica is pleased to report that there "

      "SummaryText": "have been no accidental releases from Archimica that have resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site.  There have also been no offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\nEMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS\n\nArchimica Inc. has established a complete integrated contingency response plan to define the procedures and activities necessary to manage chemical incidents.  All operators and maintenance mechanics who participate in emergency response must complete a 24-hour certified hazardous material training course and undergo periodic additional training and exercises.  All shift supervisors complete certified emergency response incident command training.\n\nArchimica works with the Local Emergency Planning Committee and Emergency Management Office to support community emergency planning activities.  Joint emergency response exercises have been conducted with the Springfield Fire Department at the Archimica facility to assure the fire department Hazardous Material Teams are familiar with the Archimica site and can work effectively with the Archimica HazMat teams.\n\nRELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nThe worst case scenario assumes the instantaneous spill of the maximum planned contents of the shipping container.  The spilled material forms a pool in the containment basin where it evaporates.  The evaporation rate under worst case atmospheric conditions was estimated to be 5.25 lb/minute.\n\nThe alternative scenario assumes a flange leak in the transfer line.  This leak is assumed to release material at a rate of 5 kg/minute for 30 minutes, at which the remotely operated shutoff valve is closed stopping the leak.\n\nBoth release scenarios were modeled using ALOHA version 5.4.1.2.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nArchimica believes continuous improvement of all environmental and safety systems is crucial to the ongoing success of the company.  Several ongoing safety programs are in place to assure means of improving site "
