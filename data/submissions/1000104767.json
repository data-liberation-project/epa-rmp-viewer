MBS also has procedures for coordinating response with local response agencies.\n\nA vent is located in the TDI bulk storage room that would minimize the build-up of, TDI vapors and decrease the potential for release of vapors into other areas of the facility in the event of a small leak within the room. The TDI day tank room has an active exhaust that passes through a carbon scrubber before being vented out of the facility. Sensor systems were installed in the bulk storage and day tank storage that monitor TDI levels in the rooms. Remote displays allow employees to check for levels of TDI down to 1 part per billion (ppb) prior to entering the storage areas. If levels rise above 1 ppb, site alarms will activate, and site evacuation will occur. Our maintenance department has a preventative maintenance program that includes critical TDI safety and testing of equipment."

Our goals are to promote and strengthen mutual understanding and deepen trust in what we do.\n\nMaster Builders Solutions Construction Systems in Brighton, Colorado was most recently known as BASF Construction Chemicals. It has the primary activity of producing adhesives and caulks for use in the construction industry. Toluene diisocyanate (TDI) is the regulated substance stored and used within the plant.\n\nTDI is received in 45,000-pound tank trucks and transferred to a 64,000-pound holding tank within the building. The handling of TDI in the MBS process is controlled by a Distributed Control System (DCS). Prior to use in manufacturing, TDI is pumped from the bulk storage tank into one of four 2350-pound capacity day tanks. TDI is then pumped from the day tanks to mixer heads in the intermediate area, reacting and consuming the material. This activation procedure is controlled through a DCS which will shut down operations and sound an alarm if outside close tolerances.\n\nMBS has specific standard operating procedures and training in the offloading of tankers to bulk storage. The TDI off-loading SOP specifies that a trained MBS employee wearing proper PPE will be present during the entire offload procedure, including transfer hose hookup, product transfer, offload and during removal of the transfer hose. Any leak or rupture will be observed, and proper steps taken to shut down transfer to minimize TDI loss. An isocyanate emergency stop is located at the offload station that automatically stops the offload operation when activated.\n\nMBS has a comprehensive contingency (emergency response) plan that includes procedures for chemical spills/releases, medical emergencies, natural disasters, and environmental issues. This plan identifies the Incident Commander and Emergency Response Team members, Management Team and their responsibilities and tr"
