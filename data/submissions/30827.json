Although, no strict municipal policy is in place beyond state and federal regulations, this facility incorporates employee safety concerns in their safety decision-making process as evidenced by the facility's safety record and past safety inspections conducted at the plant.\n\nThe Jasper Municipal Water Filtration Plant (as the name implies) is the local municipal water treatment facility for the City of Jasper.  The plant uses chlorine for the disinfection of the treated potable water before it is pumped into the distribution system. Normally, two to four one-ton chlorine cylinders are stored at the plant.\n\nThe facility is located in a rural setting adjacent to the City of Jasper and is surrounded by mature stands of trees to the north, southwest, and west, with rolling hills to the east and southeast. Based on the large obstacles to wind flow, this setting was considered to be urban in nature. EPA's RMP*Comp software program was used for all scenarios to determine the distance to the toxic endpoint (3 mg/l for chlorine).\n\nThe worst-case scenario for this facility assumes that liquid chlorine is completely released from 1 one-ton (2,000 lbs) cylinder over a period of 1.4 minutes due to the rupture of one of the 3/4 relief plugs.  The toxic endpoint for this urban site is 1.3 miles based on an atmospheric stability class of F and wind speed of 1.5 meters per second. There would be an offsite impact with this worst-case scenario.  Although, the chlorine cylinders are kept in an enclosed room (passive mitigation process), the cylinders are initially delivered and handled outside prior to being placed on the scale. The relief plugs are"

      "SummaryText": "located under a hood on the end of each cylinder for protection. During the replacement of empty and full cylinders, the procedure is only conducted by highly-trained personnel with two observers present, which makes this scenario highly unlikely.  \n\nThe alternate release scenario for this facility is the most likely event to occur that would result in a release of chlorine to a toxic endpoint. At this facility, the most likely event would be a blown cylinder valve 1/8 fuse plug.  However, this event would be mitigated by the fact that it most likely would occur inside an enclosed room where chlorine sensors are present.  The release rate and distance to an endpoint in an urban setting for a liquid chlorine release through this plug are 100 lbs/min and 0.2 miles, respectively.\n  \nThis facility is subject to EPCRA 302 with regards to chlorine.  In addition, this facility ensures compliance with safety information requirements under NFPA 820 (for wastewater/water treatment plants), OSHA (29 CFR 1910.111) and local building codes.  The following practices are conducted as part of this facility's prevention program: (1) Annual classroom training on how to handle chlorine and associated releases, (2) monthly toolbox safety meetings (on how to use Safety Equipment, etc.) and (3) on-the-job training with experienced personnel.\n\nNo accidents have been recorded at this facility wthin the last five years due to the stability and training of the workforce at the plant.\n\nThe plant's emergency response plan includes general procedures, emergency alarms, evacuation sites, procedures for emergency shutdown of operations, identified hazards and who responds and how, control of workplace hazards, and maintenance of emergency equipment with emergency telephone listing (public entities, etc.).   There is close coordination of emergency response measures with the City and County emergency response committees.\n\nThe following changes to improve safety are planned for this facility:\n\n1)"
