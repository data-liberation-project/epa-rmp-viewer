The main purpose of the manual is to provide operation and\nmaintenance personnel detailed standard procedures to reduce employee\nand public risk to injury, death or property damage from accidental\nchemical releases.  The manual includes the following elements and\ncomplies with requirements set forth in 40 CFR 68 Chemical Accident\nPrevention Provisions.\n\nA.   Management\nB.   Safety Information\nC.

Incident Investigation\n\nDetailed procedures for the Accidental Release Prevention Program were\ndeveloped and are undergoing implementation and integration into\nroutine operation and maintenance practices at the VCWWTP.  Historical\nand future significant efforts focus on the following areas:\n\nA.   Development of a safety information database essential for the\n     successful implementation of other procedures, including\n     operation, maintenance, training, compliance audits, incident\n     investigation, and emergency planning and response.\n\nB.   Implementation of corrective actions recommended during the most\n     recent hazard review completed on April 21, 2009.  This effort is\n     one of the most important steps for preventi"

      "SummaryText": "ERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN\n\nCFWWD personnel do not respond to uncontrolled releases of chemicals\nfrom any regulated process at the VCWWTP.  Plant employees are limited\nto responding only to incidental releases covered by maintenance\nprocedures.  Appropriate procedures have been developed and are in\nplace that provide clear instructions on 1) how to determine if a leak\nis considered an incidental release, and 2) how to notify local\nemergency responders in the event of an uncontrolled release.  Current\nprocedures were reviewed and revised to meet regulatory requirements,\nsuch as emergency notification, evacuation, training, documentation,\navailability, etc., under 29 CFR 1910.38(a).  Regulated processes at\nthe VCWWTP are not included in the community emergency response plan\ndeveloped under 42 U.S.C. 11003.  The local emergency responder is\nthe Emergency Management Office in association with the City of Fort\nWorth Fire Department.  Adequate safety information regarding\nregulated processes has been provided to the Emergency Management\nOffice who has developed and implemented specific emergency response\nplans, provided suitable training, and conducted necessary drills in\nemergency response for regulated chemical releases from regulated\nprocesses.  Although it will not be the responsibility of the plant\nemployees to evacuate offsite areas, addresses and telephone numbers\nof major public receptors inside a one (1) mile radius are provided in\nthe plan.  The CFWWD will work closely with the Emergency Management\nOffice and document coordination activities and communications.\n\n6    ON-GOING AND UP-COMING SAFETY IMPROVEMENTS\n\nTo improve the safety of regulated facilities at the VCWWTP, the\nfollowing plant expansion, process modification and facility upgrade\nprojects are under construction or are scheduled to begin soon:\n\nA.
