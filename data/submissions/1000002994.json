To comply with the\nrequirements in 40 CFR 68 Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions, the\nCITY OF FORT WORTH WATER DEPARTMENT (CFWWD) developed a Risk\nManagement Program (RMProgram) for the VCWWTP including Management\nSystem, Hazard Assessment, Accidental Release Prevention Program, and\nEmergency Response Plan.  The RMProgram main goal is to reduce the\nemployee and public risk of injury, death or damage from accidental\nrelease of chemicals.\n\n1    MANAGEMENT SYSTEM\n\nThe CFW has the overall responsibility for implementing and\nintegrating the ARPProgram into their organization.  In accordance\nwith the Management System, the CFWWD Director is designated as the\nRMProgram Director, and the Assistant Water Director in charge of\nProduction is the RMProgram Manager.  Other qualified individuals are\nassigned responsibility for implementing each individual requirement\nset forth in the Accidental Release Prevention Program and/or\nEmergency Response Plan.  The RMProgram participants include the\nfollowing positions:\n\nA.   RMProgram Director\nB.   RMProgram Assistant Director\nC.   RMProgram Manager\nD.   Hazard Assessment/Offsite Consequence Analysis Update Officer\nE.   Safety Information Officer\nF.   Hazard Review Update Officer\nG.   Operations Manager\nH.   Training Supervisor\nI.

Storage, transfer and use of sulfur dioxide in dechlorination\n     system\n\nChlorine gas is stored as pressurized liquid in three (3) side-by-side\ntanks located outdoors.  Maximum liquid chlorine inventory in each\ntank is 60,000 lbs.   The maximum process quantity is 180,000 lbs.,\nignoring negligible quantities in the piping.\n\nSulfur Dioxide gas is stored as a pressurized liquid in two (2) side-\nby-side tanks located outdoors.

Plant employees are limited\nto responding only to incidental releases covered by maintenance\nprocedures.  Appropriate procedures have been developed and are in\nplace that provide clear instructions on 1) how to determine if a leak\nis considered an incidental release, and 2) how to notify local\nemergency responders in the event of an uncontrolled release.  Current\nprocedures were reviewed and revised to meet regulatory requirements,\nsuch as emergency notification, evacuation, training, documentation,\navailability, etc., under 29 CFR 1910.38(a).  Regulated processes at\nthe VCWWTP are not included in the community emergency response plan\ndeveloped under 42 U.S.C. 11003.  The local emergency responder is\nthe Emergency Management Office in association with the City of Fort\nWorth Fire Department.  Adequate safety information regarding\nregulated processes has been provided to the Emergency Management\nOffice who has developed and implemented specific emergency response\nplans, provided suitable training, and conducted necessary drills in\nemergency response for regulated chemical releases from regulated\nprocesses.  Although it will not be the responsibility of the plant\nemployees to evacuate offsite areas, addresses and telephone numbers\nof major public receptors inside a one (1) mile radius are provided in\nthe plan.
