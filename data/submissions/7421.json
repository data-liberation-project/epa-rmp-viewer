The Board is committed to the safety of its employees, citizens and community resources. As such, the Board considers preparing and implementing this Risk Management Plan (RMP) to be another opportunity to continue addressing its policy to implement safe procedures.\n\nThe primary function of this facility is to treat wastewater. Two chemicals, Chlorine and Sulphur di-oxide, used at this facility have been identified as toxic as per Section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act. These chemicals are routinely used in wastewater treatment to achieve chlorination/dechlorination. Currently, 6,000 pounds of Chlorine and 8,000 pounds of Sulfur di-oxide are stored/used  in 1-ton (2,000 pounds) cylinders. Although these quantities are slightly above the threshold limits, this facility is required to comply with the RMP Rule (40 CFR 68). Based on existing criteria it is classified under Program 2 of the RMP Rule. \n\nThe Worst-case scenario for a release of either chemical at this facility appears to be a radius of 1.3 miles. In the case of an Alternative release it appears to be a radius of 0.1 mile. Both these scenarious were estimated as per EPA's \"RMP Guidance for Waste Water Treatment Plants\". Due to passive mitigation (enclosures) and active mitigation (emergency shutdown systems) already in place, the alternative release distance is considerably less than the worst-case and almost confined to the facility boundaries.\n\nThe facility is subjected to an annual safety inspection by the Fire Department and an independent insurance company to identify any shortcomings. Incidently, during the last five years the facility did not have any reportable accidents or releases. To prevent employee exposure and facilitate prompt action, any required emergency response will be coordinated and conducted by the Mobile County Emergency Management Agency which is th"

Two safety related changes were identified. Both changes, an audible alarm to notify operators of a release and posting of additional warning signs around the chemical building, have been implemented as suggested. \n\nThe Board is committed to safety and welcomes any suggestions/modifications to this plan or to better address safety in the operation and maintenance of this facility."
