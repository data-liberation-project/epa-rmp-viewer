The facilities at this site includes what is known as the Comanche Tap plants I, II & III; the Cox City plant and a propane truck loading terminal.  The plant(s) receives natural gas with some condensed hydrocarbon liquids (i.e. condensate) from production wells by pipeline system.  The plant separates ethane, propane, butanes, and higher molecular weight hydrocarbon components from natural gas by liquefying them at cryogenic temperatures. The natural gas minus these liquefied components (called residue gas) is delivered back into the pipeline system for ultimate use as fuel.  The natural gas liquids (NGL's or Raw Mix) are sold separately for petrochemical feedstock, fuel, and other uses.  The NGL's are delivered into a Koch Company pipeline connected to the plant.
