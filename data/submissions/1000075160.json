Reviewing operating procedures is an element of the Management of Change (MoC) procedure.  In addition, the accuracy of all operating procedures are recertified annually.\r\n\r\nTraining\r\n\r\nThe Smiley Hub has implemented a comprehensive training program to prepare potential process operators to safely and efficiently operate the facility.  Operators-in-training are taught an overview of the process, operating procedures, lock out/tag out, consequences of deviation, emergency response and operating parameters.  After an initial training phase, each candidate is paired with a senior operator for a minimum of 90 days to learn process specific tasks and duties.  The operator-in-training may remain paired with a senior operator beyond the 90 days if necessary, until they can demonstrate enough proficiency to satisfy the Operations Foreman.  The final step in becoming an operator is passing a rigorous written exam called the Compressor Operator Signoff (COS).  After all these requirements have been met, the new Operator can work independently.  New Operators are monitored by the Operations foremen.  Education is an ongoing process and as such, all operators receive periodic training related to their job duties.  In addition to all of this instruction, formal refresher training is conducted every three years. Each step of the operator training course is documented and becomes a permanent part of the employee's file.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, process maintenance personnel receive detailed training in each of the maintenance procedures as well as knowledge to diagnose and repair the process equipment.  They must demonstrate a proficiency in their field of maintenance.  Only after the foreman of their discipline deem"

Documentation of the individual's training and a record of their competence is kept as part of their personal training file.  Like the Operators, maintenance personnel receive ongoing training in their field and a formal refresher every three years.\r\n\r\nContractors\r\n\r\nThe Smiley Hub uses contractors to supplement its workforce for construction, maintenance and testing.  To ensure that these contractors meet the safety and workplace standard, Smiley personnel complete contractor evaluation forms at regular intervals.  These completed forms are evaluated by safety and management to determine compliance with the established policies, procedures and guidelines.  Contractors must maintain an acceptable score on these reviews to continue working at the facility.  In addition, the Safety Group reviews the contractor's written safety program, its implementation, training and accident history to ensure that it complies with the Smiley Hub requirements.\r\n\r\nThe Smiley Hub provides contractors with:\r\n 1.  A process overview\r\n 2.  Safety orientation and ensures their understanding through testing.\r\n 3.  Information about health and safety hazards.\r\n 4.  Emergency evacuation procedures and mustering location.\r\n 5.  All site specific safe work practices.\r\n\r\nPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\r\n\r\nThe Smiley Hub conducted a Pre-startup Safety Review (PSSR) before commencing initial process operations.  The records of those PSSRs are maintained at the facility.  In addition a PSSR is conducted anytime a change is made that effects the Process Safety Information or before startup after a turnaround.  The records of those PSSRs are maintained as part of the MOC process.  Smiley uses a standardized corporate PSSR checklist.  The PSSR serves to ensure that:\r\n 1.  Appropriate training has been conducted.\r\n 2.  Equipment, instruments, safety equipment and other elements are properly installed.\r\n 3.  Va"

      "SummaryText": "o all covered processes. This system requires that changes such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including operating conditions of the process), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented. Changes are reviewed to (1) determine that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change. Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, equipment information, and operating procedures are updated prior to incorporating these changes. In addition, operating and maintenance personnel and affected contractors are provided any necessary training on the change.\r\n\r\nIncident Investigation\r\n\r\nThe Smiley Hub promptly investigates all incidents related to a covered process that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury. The goal of each investigation is to determine the factors that may have led to the incident, and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident. The investigation team documents its recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to Smiley Hub management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's recommendations are tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the recommendations. Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years so that the reports can be reviewed during future and revalidated PHAs.\r\n\r\nCompliance Audits\r\n\r\nTo determine that the Accident Prevention Program is functioning properly, the Smiley Hub conducts compliance audits every three years.  Smiley Hub employs a third party to conduct the audit to ensure impart"

In addition, the final report is available at the Control Room for reference.\r\n\r\nAll audit findings are corrected in a timely fashion based upon priority ranking.  A record of all findings and the actions taken to resolve them is maintained at the hub for the two most recent audits. \r\n\r\nCHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\n\r\nThe Smiley Hub has safety features to manage potential hazards, contain and control a spill, detect a release, mitigate the consequences of a release and ensure the continued safe operation of the process.  These features include:\r\n 1.  Monitoring and control with SCADA software.\r\n 2.  Management, surveillance and control by trained onsite operational personnel.\r\n 3.  Offsite monitoring and shutdown capabilities.\r\n 4.  Hazardous chemical and gas level detection, alarm and automatic shutdown.\r\n\r\nContainment and control features include:\r\n 1.  Pressure relief devices to avoid over pressurizing.\r\n 2.  Valves that control and/or isolate part or all of the process.\r\n 3.  Interlocks and shutdowns for specific process parameters.\r\n 4.  Curbing and/or diking to contain spills.\r\n\r\nActive and Passive mitigation features:\r\n 1.  Fire extinguishing equipment.\r\n 2.  Established and documented emergency procedures.\r\n 3.
