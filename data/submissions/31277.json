The state of the art ammonia facility is designed and operated by current CDO standards. Seabrook Brothers and Sons, Inc. have and will continue to maintain Process Safety Management as a high priority.\n\n\nFacility Description:\n\nSeabrook operates an ammonia refrigeration system at their Seabrook facility. Ammonia refrigeration is a major constituent in the processing of frozen vegetables. Refrigeration is accomplished with a closed loop two-stage system utilizing compressors, evaporators and condensers.\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps:\n\nSeabrook is presently regulated by New Jersey TCPA, OSHA PSM and EPA 112r which incorporate all of the philosophies and criteria for Process Safety Management. Since 1989 Seabrook Brothers and Sons have managed the facility with an approved Risk Management Program (RMP). The RMP is audited on a yearly basis and which will continue even though EPA only requires a three-year cycle.\n\n\nFive -Year Accident History:\n\nWe have had no accidental releases of ammonia.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program:\n\nThe Emergency Response Program consists of the following elements:\n\n\tOn-Site Emergency Response Team,\n\tGovernmental Responders,\n\tEmergency Notification,\n\tProcedures and measures for emergency response after an accidental release,\nSite evacuation plans;\nTreatment of exposed personnel,\nSite Re-entry,\nEmergency medical treatment,\nEmergency Response Equipment and supplies,\nAnnual Training, and\nAnnual Drills.\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:\n\nSeabrook has paricipated in multiple Hazard Analysis and Quantitative Risk"
