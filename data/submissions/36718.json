Such as:  (Gloves, Goggles, Gas Masks, Rain Suits, etc.)    Employees that handle NH3 are required to attend an Annual Training Meeting that is performed by an outside Professional experienced in NH3.  The Emergency Responder #\u00bfs are displayed in a highly visible area so that customers and employee\u00bfs can easily spot them.    Some additional safety practices include:  1) Removing key from the ignition and unhooking the nurse tank from the vehicle when filling nurse tanks.  2) We have installed \u00bfTri Pods\u00bf on all  load out hoses.  \u00bfTri-Pods\u00bf are NH3 approved couplers that are designed to snap apart when someone pulls away with hoses hooked up.  This eliminates structure damage, broken hoses or pipes in event that someone pulls away when the hoses are still hooked up.  \n\nOur Facility and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nEver Green Co-op\u00bfs is a Farmer Owned Cooperative.  Located on a Farm NW of Tower City, ND.  We buy and sell fertilizer, seed, chemical and offer custom application of fertilizer and chemical. \nThe regulated kind and quantity of fertilizer we handle consist of:  \n\n     1)  Liquid fertilizer \u00bf 500 tons \n\n     2)  NH3 \u00bf 2000 tons \n\n     3)  Dry Fertilizer \u00bf 3800 tons \n\n     4)  Micro Nutrients \u00bf 200 tons\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nWe have had no accident or accidental releases in the past five years\n\nThe Emergency Response Program\n\nAnnually we send our Tier II reports to our two local Fire Departments \u00bf Tower City, ND Fire Dept., and Valley City, ND Fire Dept.  In this report is a map of our facility along with the phone numbers of the Managers and/or the people in charge.  This report also includes a list of hazardous materials stored at this facility.
