Ammonia is one of the ten hazardous chemicals most commonly involved in a release. To prevent and mitigate an Ammonia release, to improve facility safety, and benefit the community and the environment, Shamrock Foods Company has developed policies and programs to prevent an accidental release.  They include management commitment to safety, risk management plans, standard operating procedures, safety programs, preventative maintenance programs, contractor safety, and training. The most common causes of an Ammonia release are related to Operations and Maintenance failures, Equipment Failures and/or Process Failures; consequently Shamrock Foods Company has emphasized preventative maintenance, scheduling replacement of parts such as valves and gaskets, and training of maintenance employees in safe operations.\n\nAn Emergency Action Plan has been submitted to the Maricopa County Local Emergency Planning Committee.  All employees are trained on relevant response procedures.  There are written procedures for the use, inspection, maintenance and testing of emergency response equipment.  The plan also includes evacuation routes, protective actions for uninvolved employees, a method of accounting for employees, and a list of personal protective equipment for response and mitigation equipment. The Emergency Action Plan also includes a procedure for informing the public and emergency response agencies in case of a release.   \n\n2.  The stationary source and regulated substances handled.\n\nThe Shamrock AS/RS Distribution Center is located at 2929 West Virginia Phoenix, Arizona, \n\nThe regulated substance handled at this distribution facility is anhydrous ammonia.  There is approximately 36,194 lbs. of Ammonia on site.  Ammonia is considered an Acutely Hazardous Material and the amount maintained on site by Shamrock AS/RS Distribution Center exceeds"

The release would extend beyond the property boundary.\n\nAlternative Scenario - The RMP regulations require that an alternate scenario be determined that is more likely to occur than the worst case scenario.  The alternate release is also required to reach an endpoint offsite, unless no such scenario exists. Shamrock Foods Company, in the HazOp study conducted to satisfy the Risk Management and Prevention Program, identified a most likely scenario as a one pound release of liquid Ammonia. This release occurs due to the small cylinder, that is being loaded, being disconnected prior to securing the liquid valve. This release scenario satisfies the criteria for the Alternate Toxic Gas Release.\n\nThe distance to the endpoint of 200 ppm ERPG-2 Type for the alternate case scenario is 1.0 miles.  This release would extend beyond the facility boundary.\n\nAll employees are trained on relevant response procedures.  There are written procedures for the use, inspection, maintenance and testing of emergency response equipment.  The plan also includes evacuation routes, protective actions for uninvolved employees, a method of accounting for employees, and a list of personal protective equipment for response and mitigation equipment.\n\n4.The general accidental release prevention program and the specific prevention steps.\n\nThis accidental release prevention program uses recommended guidelines of the International Institute of Ammonia , applicable state codes and federal regulations.

Shamrock AS/ RS Distribution Center has developed a prevention program that includes safety information, a Hazard and Operability Study, operating procedures, training, maintenance, compliance audits and incident investigations.\n\n5.Five-year accidental history.\n\nAS/RS Distribution Center has had one accidental release involving Ammonia during the last 5 years at this facility.  The Ammonia accident involved a gasket rupture which was reparied immediately and there were no adverse impacts as a result of the incident.  The incident happened on July 28, 1999.  Approximately 75 lbs of Ammonia was released and contained within 30 minutes of the beginning of the accident.\n\n6.The emergency response program.\n\nIn addition to the Emergency Action Plan described in paragraph 1, plans for evacuation to ensure that the evacuation procedure is adequately addressed and the needs for drills will be assessed. This emergency response program was established in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.38(a) and includes procedures for handling small releases. \n\n7.Planned changes to improve safety.\n\nThis facility is in the process of conducting an independent audit  to ensure that all elements of the program are being met as required and documented."
