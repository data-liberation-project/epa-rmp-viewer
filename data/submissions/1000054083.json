(Elmer's) is a manufacturing facility located in Statesville, North Carolina. As a result of the polystyrene foam manufacturing process, isopentane is stored at the facility in quantities that exceed the 10,000 pound threshold quantity specified by the EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) regulation. The facility has one covered process that is subject to Program Level 2 requirements under the EPA RMP regulation.  Elmer's maintains an underground storage tank of isopentane which is used in the production of polystyrene foam products. \n\n\n\nElmer's is not subject to OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) per the exemption allowed in 29 CFR 1910.119(a)(1)(ii)(B) which provides execptions for flammable liquids stored in atmospheric tanks or transferred which are kept below their normal boiling point without the benefit of chilling or refrigeration.  The isopentane storage tank is atmospheric and due to recent process changes to pump design, the tank nor vapor return lines are aided by cooling or refrigeration to maintain temperatures below the normal boiling point.\n\n\n\nIsopentane is delivered to the facility via tank truck. The tank truck is unloaded into an underground storage tank using gravity flow.  A vapor recovery system prevents the release of isopentane vapors to the atmosphere during the transfer. Isopentane is pumped from the storage tank to the pump room where the pressure is increased so it can be injected into one of the two extruders.\n\n\n\nSince the original 1999 RMP submission, the facility has been issued a Title V permit.\n\n\n\nB. Accidental Release Prevention & Emergency Response Policies of Elmer's\n\n\n\nElmer's is committed to protecting facility personnel, the public and the environment from any workplace and accidental release hazards.  Appropriate responses to releases of regulated chemicals are documented in the Plant Safety Manual (i.e. HA"

Safety, environmental protection, and RMP plans programs are implemented and coordinated with Iredell Emergency Management for emergency planning and response efforts.\n\n\n\nC. Five-year Accident History\n\n\n\nUnder the EPA RMP regulations, an accidental release is defined as a release of a regulated substance that \"resulted in deaths, injuries or significant property damage on-site, or known off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\"  Within the past 5 years, the facility has had no accidents or releases that meet the definition of 40 CFR 68.42.\n\n\n\nD. General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nThe Elmer's facility complies with the RMP regulation requirements for its Program 2 covered process. The facility also complies with all applicable state and local codes and regulations.\n\n\n\nE. Emergency Response Program\n\n\n\nEmployees at the Elmer's facility will only respond to incidental releases of isopentane where the release can be absorbed, neutralized, or otherwise controlled at the time of release by employees in the immediate release area, or by maintenance personnel. For non-incidental releases Elmer's will rely on outside responders, therefore, they do not have to comply with OSHA 1910.120 and do not have to develop and Emergency Response Program under 40 CFR 68.95. \n\n\n\nF. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nElmer's believes that the existing Incident Plans are adequate. \n\n"
