Facility Policy.\n\n\n\nThe owners, management and employees of Golden Furrow Fertilizer, Inc. are committed to the\n\nprevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the\n\nfacility is prepared to work with the local fire department, Schuyler County LEPC, and/or other authorities, to\n\nmitigate and minimize the impacts of the release to the people and the environment.\n\n\n\n2. Facility Information.\n\n\n\nThe primary activity at the facility is the distribution of products to farmers. The fertilizer product,\n\nanhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application as a nutrient for crop\n\nproduction. Anhydrous ammonia is stored in tanks designed for this purpose.\n\n\n\n3. The Worst-Case Release Scenario and the Alternate Release Scenario\n\n\n\nAn analysis of the potential off-site consequences of hypothetical worst-case and alternative-case accidental\n\nreleases have been addressed in our Hazard Assessment and information is in our Risk Management\n\nProgram.\n\n\n\n4. Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\n\n\nThe facility is in compliance with the provisions of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health\n\nAdministration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia\" and our state\n\nregulations covering anhydrous ammonia. The OSHA standard is referenced in this RMP Registration Form;\n\nsee Section 8.3 (b).\n\n\n\n5. Five-Year Accident History.\n\n\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that have caused\n\nany deaths, injuries or significant property damage at the facility; nor to our knowledge, has there been any\n\naccidental releases resulting in off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, property damage, or environmental\n\ndamage.\n\n\n\n6. Emergency Action Plan.\n\n\n\nThe facility has:\n\n\n\na. A written emergency action plan, in accord"
