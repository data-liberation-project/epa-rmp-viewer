We do no mixing, filling or other processes involving exposed product.  If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to initiate our Emergency Action Plan which includes notification of the appropriate regulatory agencies as well as our 3rd party emergency services company.  Emergency evacuation of the community would be coordinated by the Plainfield Fire Department.  The Plainfield Fire Department is aware of the potential hazards at our facility, our emergency response plan and their role in responding to emergencies.  We do have  an Emergency Action Plan, Risk Management Plan and Process  Safety Management Plan in place and our employees are trained on each.  This facility undergoes annual internal Safety Audits with results reported to management including corrective actions.  We also conduct annual safety training with our staff."
