This commitment is inherent in its comprehensive accidental release prevention program, which covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. If such a release does occur, the facility will be evacuated and Ottawa County LEPC and the Jamestown Fire Department will be contacted for emergency response.\n\n\n\n2 The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nOur facility's primary activities encompass Cheese Manufacturing. The plant is located at 3426 Quincy Street in Hudsonville, Michigan.  We have one regulated substance, Ammonia, at our facility, which is used to provide refrigeration for the manufacturing of cheese.\n\n\n\n3 The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set forth by the EPA under 40 CFR part 68. Only one of the processes at our facility are subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119. Our facility is also subject to EPCRA Section 302 notification requirements. Landview software was used to determine the population potentially affected if the WCS were actually to occur.\n\n\n\nThe following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nKent Quality Foods maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes. \n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our pr"

The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of (five years or when changes dictate). Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner. Operating Procedures\n\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Kent Quality Foods maintains written operating procedures. These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround. The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\nKent Quality Foods has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with those processes. Refresher training is provided at least every three years and more frequently if needed. \n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nKent Quality Foods carries out documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations. Process equipment examined by these checks includes, among others, pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed. Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\n\n\nManagement of Change\n\nWritten procedures are in place at Kent Quality Foods to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures.

These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\n\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nKent Quality Foods conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented. These audits are carried out at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\n\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nKent Quality Foods promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance. These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident, as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring. All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nKent Quality Foods truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort. Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements. In addition, our employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP rule, including information resulting from process hazard\n\nanalyses in particular. \n\n\n\nContractors\n\nOn occasion, our company hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities.  Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of the contractor's safety performance is carried out. Kent Quality Foods has a strict policy of informing the contractors of known p"

Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.\n\n\n\n4 Five-year Accident History\n\nThere have been no reportable accidents in the last 5 years.\n\n\n\n5 Emergency Response Plan\n\nKent Quality Foods carries a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials. The plan addresses emergency actions, medical treatment, evacuations, and notification of local emergency response agencies and the public.\n\nIn addition, the plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within our processes that would require a modified emergency response. Ottawa County is the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) with which our emergency plan has been coordinated and verified.\n\n\n\n6 Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nKent Quality Foods expects to improve safety performance by continuing to work through action items from the most recent Process Hazard Analysis. All recommendations during the inspection and audits were designed to improve the safety performance of the ammonia refrigeration process as well as ensure facility employees work in a safe environment with no hazards.  \n\n"
