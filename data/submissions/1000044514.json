These petroleum products are received and shipped by pipeline, railcars, and trucks and stored mainly in underground salt dome caverns.  Above ground bullet tanks, in much smaller capacity, are also used for the LPG storage.  \n\nThis facility is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with NFPA-58 codes for the storage and handling of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG).  The storage wells are maintained, operated, and tested in accordance with the New Mexico Oil Conservation Department regulation applicable to underground LPG storage.  In addition, the facility complies with EPA RMP rule, OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard and all state and local codes and regulations that are applicable.  \n\nIn the event of an emergency dealing with accidental release and security breach, our policy is to notify the New Mexico State Police and New Mexico Oil Conservation Department.  Any emergency dealing with a fire, our policy is to dispatch State Police and Local Fire Department.  The appropriate action will be taken to resolve the emergency.  The action plan may include one agency or many agencies.  The employees of this facility are trained to respond to each of the emergencies as a First Responder and Technician.\n\nThis facility has never had an accident with the LPG that has caused death, injuries, evacuation, or property damage.\"  The end-point of the worst case release scenario from the regulated LPG does not cover any public receptor.  Therefore, the site qualifies as a Program Level 1 site per RMP rule 40 CFR 68.12 (b) with the following certification.  \n\n\"Based on the criteria in 40 CFR 68.10, the distance to the specified endpoint for the worst-case accidental release scenario for the LPG storage processes are less than the distance to the nea"

Within the past five years, the processes at this site have had no accidental release that caused offsite impacts provided in the risk management program rule (40 CFR 68.10(b)(1)). No additional measures are necessary to prevent offsite impacts from accidental releases.  In the event of fire, explosion, or a release of a regulated substance from the processes, entry within the distance to the specified endpoints may pose a danger to public emergency responders.
