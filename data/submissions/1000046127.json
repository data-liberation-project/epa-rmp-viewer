KTR's prevention solutions include both technology as well as an active business unit that is qualified to monitor and manage the refrigeration and PSM program. \r\nThe revised Process Safety Management (PSM) program and Risk Management Plan (RMP)are living documents, defining the administrative and operational processes to be utilized during and after the facility's turnover, April 1, 2015.  KTR also reserves the right to modify and adapt its PSM and RMP plans as appropriate to address changes in our business processes, as well as things deemed ineffective. The overall intent of these programs is to minimize or eliminate the following potential threats for achieving a safe work place and zero refrigerant releases:\r\n-\tHuman error in operating or maintaining ammonia refrigeration systems. \r\n-\tHuman error when working around or near ammonia refrigeration system components.\r\n-\tLack of knowledge regarding ammonia refrigeration systems and their inherent hazards.\r\n-\tInappropriate response to incidents involving ammonia refrigeration systems.\r\n-\tUnanticipated mechanical failures associated with refrigeration system components.\r\n-\tUnsafe situations inadvertently created by multiple changes over time to ammonia refrigeration systems and other facility equipment or operations which may impact the refrigeration systems.\r\n\r\nThe PSM Program serves as a reference manual to provide building team members specific procedures for implementing the program.  In general, element guidelines describe the following:\r\n-\tFunctions of individual elements.\r\n-\tRepeatable processes to be followed.\r\n-\tUtilization of employee resources.\r\n-\tContingency plans for emergencies.\r\n-\tMeasures to be used for evaluating the effectiveness of the program."

Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, KTR has proactively partnered with Phoenix Fire Department to insure that properly trained and equipped hazmat responders are available to control and mitigate the effects of a release.

The facility is now operated by KTR Arizona LLC after the lease with the former tenant expired on April 1, 2015. The facility was built in 3 phases, 1977, 1983 and 1995 for Fry's Foods Inc, a division of the Kroger Company.  The facility was most recently operated by Atlas Cold Storage Holdings until May 2006.  The facility was then bought under a purchase option from Dillon Real Estate Company (a subsidiary of the Kroger Companies) by Atlas Cold Storage Holdings on May 12, 2006 and sold on the same day to KTR Arizona LLC. KTR initiated and contracted for a number of renovation projects impacting facility refrigeration systems between September 2006 and March 2007 as part of a lease agreement with the former tenant to prepare the facility for current operations.  These projects included the following:\r\n-\tRenovation of the Perishable Building Engine Room. \r\n-\tModifications to refrigeration piping and evaporators north of Perishable Building Engine Room.\r\n-\tModifications to refrigeration piping and evaporators south of Perishable Building Engine Room. \r\n-\tRemoval of ice making equipment from the Freezer Building.\r\n-\tReplacement of the Freezer Building refrigeration system evaporative condensers.\r\n-\tMajor Compressor overhauls and repairs for the Freezer Building refrigeration system.\r\n\r\nOn August 15, 2014, the former tenant ceased distribution operations within the cold storage facility. Alarm systems and security remain in place. Daily refrigeration operations and mechanical integrity operations are conducted by a third party refrigeration vendor, APEX.
