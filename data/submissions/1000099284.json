We have a strong commitment to operate our facility in a safe and responsible manner.\n\n\n\nAmmonia is used at our facility as the cooling medium in our refrigeration system.  Similar to the function Freon plays in a home or car air conditioning system, ammonia is used to cool the air in our industrial freezers and product coolers.  The ammonia is contained in a closed loop system; it is designed to remain inside the piping and vessels in our facility.  We believe that ammonia provides the safest and most efficient cooling choice for our operation.\n\n\n\n\n\nA. Describe the Accident Release Prevention and Emergency Policies\n\n\n\nThe Eggo Company takes many precautions to prevent or minimize accidental releases of ammonia from the refrigeration system.  Any release from the ammonia system is detected by sensors which set off alarms, activate the emergency ventilation systems, close emergency isolation valves, and shut down certain machinery room equipment. We also have a preventive maintenance program designed to maintain the on-going integrity of the systems, and a training program designed to ensure that the systems are operated by qualified personnel.\n\n\n\nThe Facility and Utilities Supervisor is responsible for the management of these ammonia safety programs.\n\n\n\n\n\nB.   Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nThe Eggo Company's San Jose plant produces waffles for sale to the public.  Ammonia is the only substance covered by the Accidental Release Prevention Regulations handled at the San Jose plant.\n\n\n\n\n\nC.   Description of the Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\n\n\nThe facility has an accident release prevention program that complies with Occupational Safety and Health Act's Process Safety Management Standard and EPA's Risk Management Program Regulation.  The prevention program consists of the following elements:\n\n\n\n- Employee Par"

Five-Year Accident History\n\n\n\nTwo ammonia-related accidents occurred at the San Jose plant over the past five years that resulted in significant on-site or offsite consequences. In 2017, a contractor was injured when cutting into an ammonia line.  Training and procedures were improved based on this accident. In 2021, a contractor damaged a service valve located on an ammonia strainer while using a scissors lift. Local residents were asked to shelter-in-place following this incident. Training and the emergency response plan were improved based on this incident.\n\n\n\n\n\nE.   Description of the Emergency Action Plan\n\n\n\nAn emergency action plan has been implemented at the San Jose Plant.  This plan contains procedures describing how the facility will respond to ammonia spills and other emergencies, including evacuation procedures.  The plant maintains an emergency response team trained at the HAZWOPER Operations level and responds in a defensive fashion to contain the release from a safe distance, but relies on outside emergency response (HAZMAT) personnel if response activities at the HAZWOPER Technician level are necessary.\n\n\n\n\n\nF. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nThe Eggo Company is committed to operating our ammonia refrigeration system in a safe and responsible manner.  We are continually evaluating our equipment and procedures to meet this objective.  The facility is currently upgrading the emergency ventilation systems in both refrigeration engine rooms."
