We maintain this process to deal with the risks involved with the storage, handling, and use of Anhydrous Ammonia in our facility.\n\n\n\nOur goal is to promote overall worker, public, and plant safety. The Prairie Farms Holland, IN Facility is located at 304 W. Main St. Holland, IN. We manufacture dairy products. The facility has processing tanks, piping, packaging equipment, raw materials warehousing, finished goods refrigerated storage, an Ammonia Refrigeration Engine Room, boilers, and miscellaneous utilities. \n\n\n\nThe facility refrigeration system required for our production process necessitates the submission of this Risk Management Plan. The refrigeration system contains approximately 14,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia. This surpasses the threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds outlined in Process Safety Management and Risk Management Program regulations.\n\n\n\nA Worst and Alternate Case Scenario were calculated for this Risk Management Plan.  A Worst Case Scenario was used with a liquid release totaling roughly 5500 pounds over ten minutes with a release radius of .84 mile. An Alternate Case Scenario was used with a vapor release totaling roughly 550 pounds over ten minutes with a release radius of .27 mile.\n\n\n\nAccidental release prevention and emergency response policies.\n\n\n\nPrairie Farms - Holland has implemented numerous policies and procedures to enable our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences of significant releases of Anhydrous Ammonia as well as other hazardous substances, fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents.

Our safety programs prevent accidents because they focus on the rules, procedures, and practices, which govern individual processes, activities, or pieces of equipment. These rules are detailed and improved as necessary. They are also communicated to and accepted by all employees at our facility.\n\n\n\nThe Prairie Farms has developed and implemented a Process Safety / Risk Management Program and has organized the information and polices pertaining to the process into a complete library. \n\n\n\nVolume 1 of the PSM/RMP Library incorporates several policies. Many policies are included in Volume 1, the remaining are referenced from other training manuals maintained in the facility.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation Guidelines: This policy outlines the commitment between management and employees to establish a program for a successful (safe) program.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information: This includes information on the ammonia inventory at the facility, applicable codes, design standards, and information pertaining to the hazards of ammonia (referenced from the IIAR ammonia Data Book).\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis Program: This program outlines a thorough, orderly, systematic approach for identifying, evaluating, and controlling potential hazards within a process involving potentially hazardous chemicals such as ammonia.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures: develop, implement, and maintain clearly written, detailed procedures, guidelines, rules, and practices for the safe operation of the ammonia refrigeration process during all operating phases. The operating procedures provide all employees involved in the operation and maintenance of the ammonia refrigeration process with the written information and precautions necessary to safety perform their tasks in a consistent manner.\n\n\n\nContractor Qualification Guidelines: This guideline has been established to verify that the contractors working in the facility are qualified to w"

The purpose of an MI program is to maintain process equipment so that a catastrophic release of ammonia is avoided or properly contained. The emphasis should be on preventive maintenance rather than breakdown maintenance.\n\n\n\nMany more specific programs and policies (Hot Work, Employee Ttraining, etc..) have been developed.\n\n\n\nProcedures for conducting Compliance Audits, Mechanical Integrity Inspections, and Process Hazard Analyses have also been developed.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis 5 Year Re-validation was completed on January 06, 2017.  The PHA highlighted some deficiencies in the system. These items were addressed as part of the continuous improvement of the facility.

The facility has established annual retraining for all personnel in Emergency Action Procedures for Ammonia with in the Emergency Action Plan.\n\nIn the event of an ammonia leak, associates should report the leak immediately to a supervisor.
