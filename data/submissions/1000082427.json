We maintain this process to deal with the risks involved with the storage, handling, and use of Anhydrous Ammonia in our facility.\r\n\r\nOur goal is to promote overall worker, public, and plant safety. The Prairie Farms Holland, IN Facility is located at 304 W. Main St. Holland, IN. We manufacture dairy products. The facility has processing tanks, piping, packaging equipment, raw materials warehousing, finished goods refrigerated storage, an Ammonia Refrigeration Engine Room, boilers, and miscellaneous utilities. \r\n\r\nThe facility refrigeration system required for our production process necessitates the submission of this Risk Management Plan. The refrigeration system contains approximately 14,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia. This surpasses the threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds outlined in Process Safety Management and Risk Management Program regulations.\r\n\r\nA Worst and Alternate Case Scenario were calculated for this Risk Management Plan.  A Worst Case Scenario was used with a liquid release totaling roughly 5500 pounds over ten minutes with a release radius of .84 mile. An Alternate Case Scenario was used with a vapor release totaling roughly 550 pounds over ten minutes with a release radius of .27 mile.\r\n\r\nAccidental release prevention and emergency response policies.\r\n\r\nPrairie Farms - Holland has implemented numerous policies and procedures to enable our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences of significant releases of Anhydrous Ammonia as well as other hazardous substances, fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents.
