COLUMBIA REACH PACK IS OPTIMISTIC THAT THE GENERAL PUBLIC CAN BE ASSURED THAT WE ARE STRIVING TO PROVIDE A SAFE FACILITY. \n\nRECENT UPDATES TO ENSURE SAFETY AT COLUMBIA REACH INCLUDE THE INSTALLATION OF WIND SOCKS OUTSIDE OF THE FACILITY TO ALERT OUTDOOR WORKERS OF THE WIND DIRECTION IN THE EVENT OF AN AMMONIA LEAK SO THAT THEY MAY BE AWARE OF THE DIRECTION OF THE TOXIC CLOUD IN ORDER TO AVOID IT.  SECONDLY,  WORKERS HAVE BEEN INSTRUCTED TO USE AIR HORNS LOCATED IN VARIOUS AREAS OF THE FACILITY TO NOTIFY OTHER WORKERS IN THE EVENT OF A LEAK.  WORKERS HAVE BEEN INSTRUCTED TO ASSEMBLE IN THE CAFETERIA IF SUCH AN EVENT OCCURS.\n\nPLEASE NOTE THAT THERE ARE TWO WORST CASE SCENARIOS FOR AMMONIA LISTED.  FACILITY HAS CAPACITY TO HOLD 25,000 POUNDS BUT OPERATES ON 12,500 POUNDS."
