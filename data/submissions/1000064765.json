The facility is covered by the rule because it stores Toluene Diisocyanate, (20% Toluene-2,6-diisocyanate, 80-100% Toluene-2,4-diisocyanate)  in excess of the regulatory 10,000 pound threshold in the Malcom Warehouse and uses this chemical in processing polyurethane products.   Toluene Diisocyanate, (20% Toluene-2,6-diisocyanate, 80-100% Toluene-2,4-diisocyanate) are received in approved DOT drums, (55 gallon drums), and is used in polyurethane production.  The drums are moved from the warehouse to the processing area, Plant 1.  The quantity in Plant 1 will not exceed 10 drums at a time during processing.  The material will be stored in the Malcom warehouse at ambient temperature.   The maximum quantity in the warehouse will not exceed 100 drums or 55100 pounds. \n\n\n\nAccident History:\n\nBASF Malcom has not had any releases from the process that resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, responses or restoration activities within the last 3 years of ownership.\n\n\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis:  Worst Case Using PHAST Modeling\n\nAmbient air temperature at 102 deg F, 58% relative humidity, Stability class F, Release inside a building into containment. \n\n\n\nAn offsite consequence analysis was conducted on a worst-case release scenario and an alternative release scenario involving Toluene Diisocyanate, (20% Toluene-2,6-diisocyanate, 80-100% Toluene-2,4-diisocyanate). PHAST Modeling  was used to determine the worst-case release scenario using toluene-2, 4-diisocyanate and toluene-2,6-diisocyanate as the mixed isomer. \n\n\n\nAn evaluation was completed which identified the worst case to be the bottom valve on Reactor 15 failed releasing a"

The estimated distance to the toxic endpoint was determined to be 0.01 miles, retaining the spill to inside the building.   The population within the threat zone was determined to be approximately 15 people working inside the building.   There would be no threat to the residences or commercial/industrial within the boundary of the spill. \n\n\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis:  Alternate Case Calculated using the EPA RMP*Comp \n\nAmbient air temperature at 80 deg F, 58% relative humidity, Stability class D, Release inside a building, building considered containment, no drains to storm or sanitary. \n\n\n\n\n\nTwo alternative release scenarios were examined. An alternative release scenario examined 1 -55 gallon drum being punctured in the Malcom Warehouse. Approximately 551 pounds of TDI unspecified isomers would be released inside an enclosed building.  The estimated distance to the toxic endpoint was determined 0.1 miles, retaining the spill to inside the building. The population within the threat zone was determined to be approximately 1 person working inside the building.   There would be no threat to the residences or commercial/industrial within the boundary of the spill. \n\n\n\n \n\nThe additional alternative release scenario examined 1-55 gallon drum being punctured in Plant 1 Processing area.  Approximately 551 pounds of TDI would be released inside an enclosed building.   The estimated distance to the toxic endpoint was determined to be 0.1 miles.  The population within the threat zone was determined to be approximately 15 people working in the building.  There would be no threat to the residences or commercial/industrial within the boundary of the spill. The calculations are the same for both alternative release scenarios. \n\n\n\nBecause Malcom is a Level 1, Alternative Scenarios are not required in the system. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
