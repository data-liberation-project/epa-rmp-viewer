Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at Oxarc, Inc. are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities are cylinder gas distribution and a retain welding supply store.  We have 1 regulated substances present at our facility.  This substance is Chlorine.  Chlorine is for resale only and is not used within our facility.                                         .\n\nThe maximum inventory of Chlorine at our facility is 3750.00 pounds.\n\n3.    The Worst Case Release Scenario and the Alternative Release Scenario, including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used the EPA's OCA Guidance Reference Tables or Equations.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from Chlorine Cylinder Storage.  In this scenario 3750 lb. of Chlorine is released.  The toxic liquid released is assumed to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to evaporate over 10 minutes.  The released quantity has been calcualted at 100% on the maximum quantity on hand.  At Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s windspeed, the maximum distance of 7.4 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.0087 mg/L"

      "SummaryText": ".\n\nThe alternative release scenario for Chlorine involves a release from a single Chlorine cylinder.  The scenario involves the release of 150 pounds of Chlorine.  Toxic liquid is assumed to be released to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to have evaporated after 10 minutes.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.0087 mg/L of Chlorine is 0.31 miles.\n\n4.    The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nOur facility has taken  steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.    The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nOxarc, Inc. maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.   The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in  process operations and are constantly evaluated.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner. \n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Oxarc, Inc. maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nTraining\nOxarc, Inc. has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the o"

Refresher training is provided at least every yearly and more frequently as needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nOxarc, Inc. carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nManagement of Change\nWritten procedures are in place at Oxarc, Inc. to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures.    Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification.\n\nPre-startup Reviews\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at Oxarc, Inc..   These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits\nOxarc, Inc.will conduct audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented.    These audits are carried out at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\nIncident Investigation\nOxarc, Inc. promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.
