Pleasant, TX Prepared Foods facility is complying with OSHA's Process Safety Management Standard (PSM) Title 29 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 1910.119 and EPA's Risk Management Program regulations (RMP) Title 40 CFR Part 68, to deal with the risks involved with the storage, handling, and processing of hazardous chemicals. In this way we promote overall plant, employee and public safety.\n\n\n\nThese programs help this facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of toxic substances as well as fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents. Overall, these programs help prevent accidental fatalities, injuries and illnesses and avoid physical property damage.  Our safety programs are applied to any activity involving hazardous chemicals including any use, storage, manufacturing, handling, or the on-site movement of such chemicals, or combination of these activities. This facility has two refrigeration systems tied together with a common line using Anhydrous Ammonia as the refrigerant. The amount of Anhydrous Ammonia contained in both systems is above the EPA threshold reporting quantity required to comply with the RMP standards.  \n\n\n\nPilgrim's Pride is committed to the safety of its employees and the surrounding community. This commitment includes both human health and the protection of the environment. Safety is ensured through careful preventative measures and emergency planning. The intent of our release prevention policy is to minimize all potential risks that could possibly lead to an accidental ammonia release. This program focuses primarily on the safe operation and the mechanical integrity of the process equipment. Our safety programs help to prevent accidents because they focus on rules, procedures, and practices which govern individual processes, activities or pieces of equipment. These rule"

      "SummaryText": "s are detailed and improved as necessary. They are also communicated to and accepted by all employees at the facility.\n\n\n\nThis facility's emergency response program is based on the OSHA requirements for Emergency Action Plans (OSHA 29 CFR 1910.38 and 1910.119) and HAZWOPER (OSHA 29 CFR 1910.120). This program includes an emergency response notification plan, emergency response drills and drill evaluations. We have trained employees for emergency response and maintain a written emergency response plan. This plan is coordinated with the local Fire Department and ensures that employees are trained on the proper response to an emergency situation.\n\n\n\nThis facility experienced an RMP reportable release of Ammonia on January 9, 2018.  The release resulted in one employee having an OSHA recordable injury.  An ammonia gauge was removed from a gauge valve while the gauge valve was not completely closed.  The employee was sent to the hospital due to chemical burns on his right hand.  Because of this incident, a new procedure was written on how to properly close a gauge valve and to remove a gauge. All operators were trained on the proper procedure for isolating valves and how to properly remove a gauge.\n\n\n\nThis facility has implemented the use of Ammonia Process Safety Management Inc. (APSM), a powerful online tool to enable comprehensive and company-wide standardization of PSM and RMP compliance related elements.  Pilgrim's Pride and this facility will use this system to manage its compliance programs in an easily accessible online format that is also consistent, efficient, and provides effective control from the top down to enhance collaboration, efficiency, reporting and accuracy."
