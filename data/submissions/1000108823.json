This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work.  In addition, the Jayhawk Gas Plant evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor.  Facility personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\nPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\n\nThe Jayhawk Gas Plant conducts a PSSR for any new facility or facility modification. The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready.  The PSSR review team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness.  A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves as a quality assurance function by requiring that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nThe Jayhawk Gas Plant has well-established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition.  The basic aspects of this program include: (1) conducting training, (2) developing w"

The EAP has been put in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment.  The EAP consists of procedures to address actions taken in the event that there is a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address all requirements of an Emergency Action Plan, including proper first and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs.  In addition, the facility has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of alarms and emergency equipment.  Employees receive training on their duties within the EAP as well as their duties for maintaining emergency equipment such as alarms, shutdowns, fire extinguishers, and monitoring equipment.  The Emergency action Plan is updated, when necessary, based on modifications made to facility processes.  The EAP changes are administered through the MOC process, which includes informing and/or training affected personnel in the changes.  Periodic drills or tabletop excercises are conducted to test the action plan.\n\nThe overall emergency action plan for the Jayhawk Gas Plant is coordinated with the Grant County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) annually.

Compliance audits are conducted at least every 3 years.  Both hourly and staff personnel participate as audit team members.  The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to facility management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are retained.  \n\nCHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe processes at the Jayhawk Gas Plant have hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation.  The following is a description of existing safety features applicable to prevention of accidental releases of regulated substances in the facility.  \n\nUniversal Prevention Activities\n\nThe accident prevention program summarized previously is applied to all PSM-covered processes at the Jayhawk Gas Plant.  Collectively, these prevention program activities prevent or mitigate potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human errors.\n\nSpecialized Safety Features\n\nThe Jayhawk Gas Plant has safety features on many units to help (1) contain/control a release, (2) quickly detect a release, and (3) reduce the consequences of (mitigate) a release.  The following types of safety features are used in the covered process:\n\nRelease Detection\n\n1. Hydrocarbon detectors with alarms\n\nRelease Containment/Control\n\n1.  Process relief valves.\n\n2.  Valves to permit isolation of the process (manual and automated).\n\n3.  Automated shutdown systems for specific process parameters (e.g., high temperature)\n\n4.

This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented.  Changes are reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and to (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.  Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures, are updated to incorporate these changes.  In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on the change.  \n\nIncident Investigation\n\nThe Jayhawk Gas Plant promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury.  The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts, and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to facility management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until they are complete.

In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process.\n\nMaintenance personnel receive training on (1) an overview of the process, (2) safety and health hazards, (3) applicable maintenance procedures, (4) emergency response plans, and (5) applicable safe work practices to help ensure that they can perform their jobs in a safe manner.  Job plans/written procedures help ensure that work is performed in a consistent manner and provide a basis for training.  Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels).  If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service (if possible), or a management of change team will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment.\n\nAnother integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance.  The Jayhawk Gas Plant incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs.  This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.\n\nSafe Work Practices\n\nThe Jayhawk Gas Plant has long-standing safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety.  Examples of these include, (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) a lockout/tag out procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous substances before process piping or equipment is opened, (4) a permit and procedure to control ignition-producing activities (i.e., hot work) and (5) a permit an"

These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.  The procedures are kept current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.\n\nIn addition, the Jayhawk Gas Plant maintains key process parameter documents that provide guidance on how to respond to upper or lower limit accidences for specific process or equipment parameters.  This information, along with written operating procedures, is readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\nTraining\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the Jayhawk Gas Plant has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  New employees receive basic training in facility operations if they are not already familiar with such operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conduced at least every 3 years.  All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\nContractors\n\nThe Jayhawk Gas Plant uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.

HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to local management for resolution.  Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned that highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the facility periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operative.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.  Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.  \n\nOperating Procedures\n\nThe Jayhawk Gas Plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergenc"

The reference documents are maintained on file at the facility to provide open access.\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDS\u00bfs).  This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  For the process, the facility has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) in key process parameter documents.  The facility ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\n\nThe facility also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment.  This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\nThe Jayhawk Gas Plant has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the process are identified and controlled.

      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY JAYHAWK GAS PLANT\n\nThe Jayhawk Gas Plant has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, facility trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe Jayhawk Gas Plant, located in Grant County, Kansas, operates a variety of processes to produce petroleum products (e.g., natural gas, propane, butane, condensate) from natural gas. The Jayhawk Gas Plant has several regulated flammables, such as propane and flammable mixtures.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place for the process at the facility. Because the process at the facility that are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) risk management program (RMP) regulation are also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) process safety management (PSM) standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nThe Jayhawk Gas Plant encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team.  Employees have access to all information created as part of the facility accident prevention program.  Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee"
