              "Description": "PREVENTION PROGRAM DESCRIPTION\n\n\n\nThe Americold hazardous material release Prevention Program in place for compliance with 40 CFR 68 RMP is based on the OSHA Process Safety Management Standard 29 CFR 1910.119 in conjunction with industry guidelines of the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration, IIAR. The first element in the safe function of ammonia refrigeration equipment is in the design itself.  All components in the refrigeration system are designed and installed in compliance with the industry standards of ANSI/IIAR ASHRAE, ASME and jurisdictional codes in effect at the time of construction.  In order for this system to function safely and effectively over a long period of time, maintenance and inspections are conducted on a scheduled basis to assure system integrity and functional efficiency. Maintenance and system monitoring is accomplished by employees that are trained to follow safe work procedures when operating the equipment. Also built into the system are automated engineered safeguards that continually monitor the operating equipment to maintain pressures, temperatures, liquid levels and detection of accidental releases.  In the event of a system upset, warning systems are in place 24/7 to alert operators of operational deviations before they become emergencies.\n\n\n\nOperator training is among the most important elements of the release prevention program.  Initially the prevention program began with the gathering of equipment information and employee involvement in the process hazard analysis PHA study.  The PHA methodology used for the study is the hazards and operability (Hazop) study.  The PHA team used this method to identify whether hazards exist and then identify the actions necessary to correct them.   Other areas of training include development of operating and maintenance procedures and safe work practices, process safety compliance audits, emergency response hands-on practice in mock spill drills and the use of personal protection equipment.   \n\n\n\nOperators receive emergency responder training in order to understand how to evaluate and manage emergency situations safely and effectively.  Release prevention begins with mitigating even the smallest of leaks that occur operationally.  These are take very seriously to avoid failures that contribute to more serious releases.  Lock-out/tag-out, pump out procedures and line opening,  procedures are very important for preventing further hazards when making even minor repairs on the system.  Employees in general also receive training for ammonia awareness for knowledge of ammonia hazards, exposure prevention and what to do in the event exposure would occur.   The emergency procedures established for the facility includes and emergency action and fire prevention  plan. \n\nFor continued improvement of the release prevention plan, internal safety audits are conducted that include reviews of safe work procedures, siting evaluations and recommendations for any deficiencies identified that affect the safety of the ammonia refrigeration process.\n\n",

Its standard industrial classification is SIC 4222.  The North American industrial classification system designation is NAICS 49312.  This facility stores and distributes a variety of refrigerated food products for its customers. The refrigeration process, consisting of piping, valves, vessels, air units and compressor equipment utilizes anhydrous ammonia, a natural refrigerant for the industrial refrigeration system. Changes in pressure through the refrigeration cycle relate directly to changes in temperature of the refrigerant. For example, lowering the pressure of a refrigerant lowers its temperature. Low pressure, (cold) The ammonia refrigerant absorbs heat through storage room air units.  Removal of the heat from the room provides the refrigeration affect.  Removal of ambient heat from products in turn reduces the spoilage and allows for extended storage of food products.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia (CAS #7664-41-7) Refrigerant grade, pure anhydrous ammonia is the chemical in the process.  In low concentrations ammonia is easily detectable and has a pungent odor that makes it ideal as a refrigerant because of this self alarming characteristic. \n\nThe ammonia inventory at the Americold Zumbrota facility is above the Threshold Planning Quantity of 10,000 lbs.  Ammonia is listed and reportable as an extremely hazardous substance, an EHS on the SARA Title III list of lists.  Due to"
