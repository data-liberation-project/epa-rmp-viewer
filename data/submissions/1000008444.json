We vow to promote a safe environment for our facilities, employees and the public. By implementing this program it enables our facilities to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences of significant releases, fires and or explosions from anhydrous ammonia. Our PSM program provides guidelines, procedures, and practices which help governs individual processes, activities, and equipment. These guidelines are reviewed as necessary. They are also communicated to and accepted by employees at the facilities involved in the covered process.\n\nDescription of  Process\n\nThe Southeastern Freezer (#9), and Kings Delight #4 are cold storage, and poultry processing facilities. They use anhydrous ammonia in an industrial refrigeration system to maintain temperatures in three cold storage freezers and one spiral freezer. The refrigeration system also has 7 blast cells for freezing. In the poultry processing facility the anhydrous ammonia is used to maintain temperatures in the processing areas. There are a total of twenty-three ACUs. There are four systems on site having a total of 59,000 lbs. of anhydrous ammonia. The facility maintains a full time refrigeration maintenance staff that conducts multiple service inspections on a daily basis. In addition there is a computer control system that monitors temperatures, pressures, and the atmosphere for leaks. Any irregular condition will result in the activation of an automated paging system to contact refrigeration personnel. \n\nAccident History\n\nThere have been no reportable releases in the past five years.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nThe facilityA?s emergency response program is ba"
