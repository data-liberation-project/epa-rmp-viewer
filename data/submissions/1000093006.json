The same properties that make propane valuable as a fuel also make it necessary to practice certain safety\nprecautions in handling to prevent leaks, spills and accidents. First and foremost in our operations are the efforts undertaken to\nensure employee and contractor safety while on site as well as minimize the risk exposure for the surrounding communities. It is\nour company policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state and local rules and regulations.\n\nAs a corporation, AmeriGas staffs a professional Safety Department at our Corporate Headquarters in King of Prussia,\nPennsylvania. AmeriGas also has seven Regional Logistics Managers, a Terminal Operations Manager, a Safety and Technology\nManager and a Supply and Logistics Safety Manager strategically located throughout the United States. These safety professionals\nare able to immediately respond to a serious incident and provide technical expertise to emergency response agencies as needed\nat the scene of the incident. AmeriGas also maintains an around the clock Emergency Communications Center, which handles all\nafter-hours and emergency calls from around the country. Located in Rocklin, California, the ECC has the ability to contact\nAmeriGas field personnel as well as Chemtrec on any type of incident encountered at any AmeriGas location or by AmeriGas\ncustomers.\n\nThe primary purpose of the facility is to store and distribute propane to retail and wholesale customers.
