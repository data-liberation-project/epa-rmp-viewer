The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) promulgated the Risk Management Program (RMP) regulations as required in the 1990 Amendments to the Clean Air Act.  The goal of the RMP is to prevent accidental releases of substances that can cause serious harm to the public and the environment from short-term exposures and to mitigate the severity of releases that do occur.  The RMP regulations apply to facilities that handle, manufacture, use, or store toxic and flammable substances above specified threshold quantities. In addition to the RMP regulations, both the State of Washington and Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regulate facilities with certain acutely hazardous materials under Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations, as defined in Washington Administrative Code (WAC), Chapter 296?67, and CFR Title 29, Part 1910, Section 119, respectively.  As the PSM regulations contain similar requirements to the RMP requirements, Kelso?s RMP/PSM was developed with consideration to both.\n\nFoster Farms prepared the RMP/PSM to satisfy regulatory requirements and to demonstrate a commitment to evaluate and improve the anhydrous ammonia handling system and practices at the facility.  Foster Farms incorporated many state-of-the-art safety features into the ammonia refrigeration system at the facility as part of the origi"

Foster Farms will continue to improve ammonia handling safety through the implementation of the prevention program elements of the RMP/PSM.  In the unlikely event that a chemical release does occur at the facility, Foster Farms personnel are trained in the appropriate response measures and do not rely on support services provided by the local fire department and/or hazardous materials response team for mitigation of the release.  Foster Farms will rely on community responders for medical assistance and public evacuation or protection in place, if necessary. \n\nThe Foster Farms facility is located at 1700 South 13th Avenue in Kelso, Washington.  The surrounding area consists of industrial and commercial businesses.  The facility is in an industrial park that is generally bordered by Interstate 5 on the northeast and the Kelso Airport on the southwest.  The Cowlitz River, residential, and commercial development are located northwest of the industrial park.\n\nThe facility was constructed in 1998 for Foster Farms.  Operations at the facility consist of the slaughter, processing, storage, and packaging of poultry products.  The facility is surrounded by chain-link fencing and has a secured entrance that is staffed by security personnel 24 hours per day, 365 days per year.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is used in a refrigeration system at the facility.  The refrigeration system, which is a closed system provides cooling for production areas, product, water chilling, and ice making.  A central computer system monitors and controls the refrigeration system.  The desired temperatures are maintained by controlling the flow of ammonia with manually and electrically operated valves, float switches, transfer pumps, and compressor controls.  \n\nThe RMP/PSM regulations require a review of the five-year accident history at the regulated facility.  Foster Farms reported no reportable accidental releases at the facility within the past five years."

      "SummaryText": "\n\nThe RMP/PSM regulations require a review of the accidental release prevention program and chemical specific prevention steps used by the facility.  Foster Farms has incorporated many safety features in the ammonia refrigeration system to prevent system failures and to mitigate potential releases.  The predominant safety concern with closed-loop ammonia systems is an inadvertent buildup of pressure exceeding pressure ratings or capacities of equipment due to ammonia expansion.  The Foster Farms ammonia system is continuously monitored by automated control system that shut down components if deviations from normal operating conditions occur.  The major pressure vessels in the system are connected to a diffusion panel.  Ammonia from the vessels can be mixed with water (neutralized) to prevent over-pressurization of the vessels.  Further, all pressure vessels in the system are equipped with pressure relief valves.\n\nOther safety features at the facility include: \n?    emergency shutdown systems\n?    component specific safety shutdowns\n?    an ammonia leak detection system is installed that will close ammonia supply valves if a leak is detected\n?    pressure relief valves on all vessels, compressors, and several other areas in the system where trapped ammonia could build pressure\n?    all pressure relief valves discharge to a water filled tank where the ammonia is neutralized\n?    all major vessels are connected to a fire diffusion panel\n?    most ammonia pipes, valves and components are labeled\n?    pressure relief valves are replaced at least every five years\n?    a fire sprinkler system is installed in the plant\n?    a central computer system monitors the refrigeration system and alarms when safety set-points are exceeded\n?    ammonia system can be monitored and controlled remotely through the central computer system\n?    facility is fully sprinklered for fire protection\n?    engine room is ventilated\n?    operators receive ongoing training in operations, maintenance and emergency response\n?    a formal prevent"

Administrative controls include, but are not limited to, formal training programs for system operators and mechanics, emergency training, a hot work permit program, a lock-out/tag-out program, a contractor safety program, incident investigation program, mechanical integrity program, management of change program, pre start-up safety review program, and a RMP/PSM auditing and inspection program.  Written standard operating procedures (SOPs) have been prepared for the ammonia system at the facility.  The SOPs provide a basis for site specific operator training and a ready reference for operating and trouble-shooting the systems.\n\nFoster Farms is committed to maintaining the mechanical integrity of the ammonia refrigeration system.  A preventive maintenance system is being utilized to manage the maintenance of the refrigeration system.  Preventive maintenance at the facility includes daily, weekly, and periodic inspection; calibration; testing; and overhaul of ammonia system equipment.  The system is utilized to track equipment performance and to create reports that are used by maintenance personnel to monitor the frequency of repairs and deviations from normal operating parameters.\n\nChanges to improve safety at the facility are ongoing.  The majority of the mitigation measures suggested by the process hazard analysis team have already been implemented.  \n\nFoster Farms will respond to all suggested mitigation measures.

As such, this document and related attachments and program elements will evolve as Foster Farm continues their ongoing focus and dedication of risk minimization and safety improvement for their employees and surrounding community.  Foster Farms will submit revised information if a change occurs that is considered significant and requires resubmission under the regulations. However, minor improvements/modifications to the RMP/PSM and related attachments and program elements will be incorporated consistent with Foster Farms? internal review practices and Foster Farms will maintain the most current versions on site.  Thus, the most current version RMP/PSM and related documents and elements maintained on site may vary slightly from the information in submittals made to EPA and other regulatory agencies."
