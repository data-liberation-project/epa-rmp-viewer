Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies We at Brenntag Mid-South, Inc. are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety. This is evidenced through our Core Values found in the Brenntag Cornerstone. The six (6) elements or core values of Brenntag Cornerstone are: SAFETY FIRST, LEADERSHIP & ACCOUNTABILITY, EMPLOYEE INVOLVEMENT AND\n\nOWNERSHIP, COMMITMENT TO EXCELLENCE, CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT AND WORLD CLASS VALUE CREATION. As stated by Mr. William A. Filder, President & CEO of Brenntag North America and Latin America; \"Nothing we do can ever become more important than our safety performance.\" and \"There is not business goal worth asking people to sacrifice what they value most in life.\" This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program in place that covers areas such as design, installation,\n\noperating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, we are completely coordinated with DURHAM FIRE DEPARTMENT which provides highly trained emergency response personnel to control and mitigate the effects of a release.\n\n\n\n2.The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nOur facility's primary activities encompass Chemical distribution.  We have 4 regulated substances present at our facility.  These substances include Ammonium Hydroxide (Ammonia aqueous solution), Chlorine,  Formaldehyde (solution),and Ehtylenediamine.  Only Ammonium Hydroxide (ammonia aq. solution) is unloaded, repackaged and containerized at this facility.  The other RMP regulated substances are packaged elsewhere and are simply stored and warehoused for distribution.\n\n\n\n\n\n3.To perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used the EPA"

This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with Federal, State, and Local regulations. Brenntag is also ISO 9000-2001 certified. The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nBrenntag Mid-South, Inc. maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses is Checklist.   Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.  \n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Brenntag Southeast Inc maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\nBrenntag Mid-South, Inc. has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.
