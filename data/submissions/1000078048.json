The following details the prevention program elements at the Dallas Water Utilities Elm Fork Water Treatment Plant that apply to this process.\r\n\r\n4.1\tSafety Information\r\n\r\nThe Dallas Water Utilities Elm Fork Water Treatment Plant maintains a variety of technical documents that are used to help ensure safe operation of the Dallas Water Utilities Elm Fork Water Treatment Plant processes.  Safety data sheets (SDSs) document the physical and chemical properties of hazardous substances handled at the Dallas Water Utilities Elm Fork Water Treatment Plant, including the chlorine and ammonia processes.  The engineering design documents include the operating parameters, the design basis and configuration of the equipment in each covered process, and references to applicable codes and standards.\r\n\r\n4.2\tHazard Review\r\n\r\nThe Dallas Water Utilities Elm Fork Water Treatment Plant performs and periodically updates hazard reviews of the covered processes to help identify and control process hazards.  Checklists are used to guide the hazard review.  These checklists include items to help ensure the Dallas Water Utilities Elm Fork Water Treatment Plant operates and maintains the equipment in a manner consistent with the applicable design specifications, codes, standards, and regulations.\r\n\r\n4.3\tOperating Procedures\r\n\r\nThe Dallas Water Utilities Elm Fork Water Treatment Plant develops and maintains operating procedures to define how tasks related to process operations should be performed.  The operating procedures are used to:\r\n\r\n1. train employees and contractors, and\r\n2. serve as reference guides for appropriate actions to take during both normal and abnormal process conditions.\r\n\r\n4.4\tTraining\r\n\r\nThe Dallas Water Utilities Elm Fork Water Treatment Plant trains personnel in the operating procedures to help ensure safe and effective performance of their assigned tasks. A record of all training is maintained to help ensure new and refresher training is"
