Our Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nWe at Rhodia, Inc., Baton Rouge, LA, are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, hazard analysis, installation, operating procedures, mechanical integrity, management of change, incident investigation and employee training associated with the processes at our Baton Rouge facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. The Rhodia Baton Rouge site has also established an Emergency Response Team, consisting of plant personnel, that is well trained and prepared to respond to emergency situations.\n\n2.  Our Facility and the Regulated Substances handled\n\nOur Baton Rouge facility produces Sulfuric Acid, Oleum, Hydroquinone, Catechol, Vanillin and Ethyl Vanillin. Our facility's manufacturing activities encompass Sulfuric Acid Regeneration from Spent Acid, Oleum Production, Diphenols Ethers Production and Hazardous Waste Incineration. The RMP-covered processes at our facility together could handle various regulated substances. These substances, in alphabetical order, are Acetaldehyde, Acrylonitrile, Allyl Alcohol, Carbon Disulfide, Epichlorohydrin, Ethyl Chloride, Ethyl Ether, Ethyl Mercaptan, Hydrazine, Hydrogen Sulfide, Isopentane, Isopropylamine, Methyl Chloride, Methyl Mercaptan, Oleum, Propionitrile, Propylene Oxide, Toluene Di-Isocyanate, Vinyl Acetate, a Flammable mixture of 1-Butylene, Propylene & Propane, and a Flammable mixture of alkyl amines.  \n\n\n3.

The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our facility.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nRhodia, Inc., Baton Rouge Facility maintains detailed records of safety information that describes the properties and hazards of the chemicals used in our manufacturing units, the process technology employed, safe operating parameters and safety instrumented systems, and equipment specifications and design basis associated with all processes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nOur facility conducts comprehensive analytical studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodologies used to carry out these analyses are What-If and HazOp, incorporating Layers-of-Protection Analysis (LOPA).  The studies are undertaken by a cross-functional team of qualified personnel with expertise in PHA methodology, engineering, process operations, and equipment maintenance, and are revalidated at a periodic interval of five years.  Any recommendations related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Rhodia, Inc., Baton Rouge Facility maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is periodically reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nTraining\n\nRhodia, Inc., Baton Rouge Facility has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Refresher training is provided at least eve"

Process equipment examined by these inspections includes, among others, pressure vessels, storage tanks, heat exchangers, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps. Process equipment that are in contact with the hazardous RMP-listed chemicals receive priority for inspections. Maintenance functions are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance inspections are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nManagement of Change\n\nWritten procedures are in place at Rhodia, Inc., Baton Rouge Facility to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures.  Proposed changes are implemented after they have been justified and reviewed for potential hazards that are addressed prior to implementing the change.  Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of the change and why it is necessary, and offered training to understand and work with the modification.\n\nPre-startup Safety Reviews\n\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to significant modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at the Rhodia, Inc., Baton Rouge Facility.  The extent of review is based on the complexity of the modification.  These reviews are conducted by a cross-functional team to confirm that construction, equipment, instrumentation, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup, and that all action-items from the safety review for the change have been addressed, prior to placing equipment into op"
