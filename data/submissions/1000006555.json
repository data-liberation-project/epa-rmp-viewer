ONEOK North System\u00c2\u00bfs management philosophy goals are achieved through the implementation of the Environmental Health and Safety Management Systems, by the personal commitments of employees and contractors, and by open communication with employees, customers, neighbors, and regulators.  \n\nThe purpose of this Risk Management Plan (RMPlan) is to provide information about operations at the facility, programs to prevent accidental chemical releases, emergency response plans in the event an accidental release should occur, the five-year accident history of the facility, and planned changes to improve safety at the facility.\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nThe Lemont Storage Facility is owned and operated by ONEOK North System, L.L.C.  At the facility, normal butane, isobutane, propane, and natural gasoline are received via pipeline and stored in above ground storage tanks or underground storage caverns until they are transferred, via pipeline to the customer.  Additionally, propane is transferred via pipeline to our local truck terminal to be loaded on trucks for distribution.  Propane, normal butane, isobutene, and natural gasoline (reported as an RMP flammable mixture) are the only flammable RMP substances stored at the facility.  There are no RMP toxic substances present at the facility in amounts greater than threshold quantity.  The facility is classified as Program Level 3 under the regulation. \n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response programs in place a"

The Operations Supervisor is responsible for coordinating the emergency actions.  A specific Emergency Response Plan for the facility is in place and that plan has been coordinated with local officials, along with evacuation procedures, periodic drilling, and training.
