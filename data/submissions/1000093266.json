CRP also utilizes a preventative maintenance program for its system components.  As part of this program, maintenance personnel inspect the chlorine systems' operating parameters and monitoring system according to the PSM Mechanical Integrity program preventative maintenance (PM) schedule.  \r\n\r\nFive-year Accident History\r\nThere have been no additional accidents involving chlorine at this facility that have resulted in death(s), injuries, first aids, property damage, evacuations, environmental damage or sheltering in place.\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program\r\nCRP has implemented an Emergency Response Plan in accordance with the OSHA PSM standard.  The facility has a trained emergency response team that will respond in the event of a hazardous material release, fire or other emergency situation.  The Emergency Response Plan contains specific information regarding Emergency Response organization and procedures (including chlorine release scenarios), as well as incident notification, mitigation, and incident preparedness.  In addition, CRP training program includes annual refreshers.  The facility has also developed an Emergency Action Plan (EAP) to address other emergency responses related tp incidents such as bomb threats, spills or releases of hazardous materials, evacuation, and tornadoes or dangerous weather conditions.\r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\r\nCRP continues to optimize the process to minimize the use of chlorine and continues to optimize the site safety programs to ensure effectiveness."

The rule requires facilities to provide an executive summary of the following information:\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\nCommonwealth Rolled Products (CRP) has developed and implemented a process safety management (PSM) plan as part of their accidental release/emergency response program.  These programs involve a range of senior management personnel, including the senior plant management, Health, Safety, and Environmental (HSE) manager and staff, maintenance, production, and other ancillary employees.  Additionally, CRP conducts regular safety meetings and training involving many levels of personnel.  CRP's policies and procedures are outlined in the respective plans. It is CRP's policy to inspect, maintain and operate equipment and facilities in a manner to prevent accidents, including release of hazardous materials; and to train employees in prevention, as well as to prepare them to respond rapidly and effectively should an accident occur.\r\n\r\nStationary Sources and Regulated Substances Handled\r\nThe facility uses chlorine in the aluminum purification process.  Chlorine is stored in liquid form under pressure in one-ton containers.  Chlorine gas from the containers is piped to the aluminum melting furnaces where it is injected in molten aluminum to remove impurities.  \r\n\r\nThere is one system that utilizes chlorine exceeding the RMP threshold for chlorine. The South Casting system inventory exceeds the RMP threshold for chlorine of 2,500 pounds in a single process. The maximum intended inventory is 16,000 pounds (8 full one-ton containers) in the South chlorine building at one time.\r\n\r\nGeneral Accident Release Prevention Progr"
