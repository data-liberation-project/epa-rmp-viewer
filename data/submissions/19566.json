Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nWe at Southchem Inc are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental  release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the  processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n \n \n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n    \nOur facility's primary activities encompass Chemical distribution.  We have 5 regulated substances present at our facility.  These substances include Hydrogen     Fluoride(Hydrofluoric Acid], Ammonia (aqueous), Formaldehyde (solution), Chlorine and Sulfur Dioxide (anhydrous).  Ammonia (aqueous),and Formaldehyde  (solution) are repackaged and stored for distribution.  Hydrogen Fluoride (Hydrofluoric Acid), Chlorine, and Sulfur Dioxide (anhydrous) are only stored for  distribution.                              \n \nThe maximum inventory of Hydrogen Fluoride (Hydrofluoric Acid) at our facility is 33,264.00 lbs. while Ammonia (aqueous), Formaldehyde (solution), Chlorine and Sulfur Dioxide (anhydrous) are present at our facility in quantities of 24915.62 lbs.,24776.31 lbs.,18750.00 lbs. and 10350.00 lbs. respectively.\n \n3.    The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for  each reported scenario. To perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used the EPA's OCA Guidance Reference Tables or Equations and the EPA's RMP*Comp(TM).  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from Ammonia "

The toxic liquid released is assumed to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to evaporate over 10 minutes.  The released quantity has been limited by a system of administrative controls.  Passive mitigation systems such as dike(s) are also taken into account to calculate the scenario.  These mitigation systems have the effect of limiting the spread of product.  At Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s wind speed, the maximum distance of 0.8 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L.\n \n \nThe alternative release scenario for Chlorine involves a release from Chlorine storage.  The scenario involves the release of a 150 lb cylinder.  Toxic liquid is assumed to be released to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to have evaporated after 1 minute.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.0087 mg/L  is 0.2 miles.\n \nThe alternative release scenario for Sulfur Dioxide (anhydrous) involves a release from Sulfur Dioxide storage.  The scenario involves the release of a 150 lbs. cylinder.  Toxic liquid is assumed to be released to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to have evaporated after 1 minute.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.0078 mg/L  is 0.2 miles.\n \n The alternative release scenario for Hydrogen fluoride/Hydrofluoric acid (conc 50% or greater) involves a release from Hydrofluoric acid storage.  The scenario involves the release of 378 lb. Toxic liquid is assumed to be released to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.

The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps.\n\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-58 Standard, 1967 Edition, since Southchem aquired the building in 1981.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n \nProcess Safety Information\nSouthchem Inc maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n \nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses is Checklist.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of 3 years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.  The most rece"

These procedures address various modes of     operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The     information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\n\nTraining\nSouthchem Inc has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Refresher training is provided at least every  year and more frequently as needed.\n \nMechanical Integrity\nSouthchem Inc carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.
