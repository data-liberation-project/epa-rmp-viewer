An alarm system is enabled for all other times when no refrigeration personnel are on-site.  There are security personnel on-site during these off times.  They call one of three or four maintenance staff for responding to equipment faults.  Equipment faults are monitored via a central computer system tied into the equipment?s critical data.  Temperatures, pressures, and levels are some of the data that is monitored.  Automatic shutoff valves are in place and will actuate upon a major fault in the system.  Pressure relief valves are installedon all necessary equipment.  Mechanical Integrity guidelines and procedures are implemented and followed.  All other aspects of the PSM program are implemented and followed.",
