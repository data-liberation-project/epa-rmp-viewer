Because the Facility is regulated under RMP Program Level 1, it is not subject to the RMP Prevention Program required under 40 CFR 68. However, the Facility is subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration\u2019s (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Program. The Gibson Plant\u2019s PSM Plan is kept on-site as a separate document.\n\n1.4 68.155(e) Five-Year Accident History\nThe Gibson Plant has had no accidental releases of NGL occur that resulted in deaths, injuries or significant property damage on-site, or off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or any environmental impact for the period of five (5) years prior to June 2018.\n\n1.5 68.155(f) Emergency Response Program Because the Gibson Plant is regulated under RMP Program Level 1, it is not subject to the RMP Prevention Program required under 40 CFR 68. However, the Facility does maintain a written Emergency Action Plan (EAP) that provide guidance for emergencies expected at the Facility. In addition, operating procedures and \nequipment design codes and standards associated with the operations at the Facility are maintained. Furthermore, the Facility has coordinated the emergency response plan with the Terrebonne Parish Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and the East Gibson Volunteer Fire Department. The East Gibson Volunteer Fire Department is designated as the first responder in the event of NGL release.\nA site map, SDSs and a list of chemicals kept on-site are maintained at the Facility, along with their PSM Plan, which is either kept on-site as a separate document or on company\u2019 intranet.\n\n1.6 68.155(g) Safety Improvements\nMainten"

The address for the facility is 5609 Bayou Black Drive, Gibson, LA 70356.  The Gibson Plant (\u201cGibson Plant\u201d or \u201cFacility\u201d) utilizes more than the threshold quantity of a \u201cregulated  flammable substance (10,000 pounds) in the processing of natural gas, where natural gas liquids (NGL) are  extracted from the inlet gas using cryogenic process and being delivered to the pipeline for further market  distribution. This Facility may be subject to the Risk Management Plan (RMP) requirements codified in Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations Part 68 (40 CFR 68) administered by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).\nThe Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Plan (RMP) rule defines three program levels  based on processes\u2019 relative potential for public impacts and the level of efforts needed to prevent accidents. For each Program level, the rule defines requirements that reflect the level of risk and effort associated with the processes at that level. \nThe Program levels are as follows (from RMP Chapter 2):\nProgram 1: Processes which would not affect the public in the case of a worst-case release (in the language of Part 68, processes \u201cwith no public receptors within the distance to an endpoint from a worst-case release\u201d) and with no accidents with specific offsite consequences within the past five years are eligible for Program 1, which imposes limited hazard assessment requirements and minimal prevention and emergency response requirements. \nProgram 2: Processes not eligible for Program 1 or subject to Program 3 are placed in Program 2, which imposes streamlined prevention program requirements, as well as additional hazard assessment, management, and emergency response requirements. \nProgram 3: Processes not eligible for Program 1 and either subject to OSHA's PSM standard under federal or state OSHA programs"
