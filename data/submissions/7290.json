Kieffer, President/General Manager\n\nRisk Management Plan - EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n1.    The Facility Policy\n\nThe owners, management and employees of the Farmers Cooperative Company are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire company, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n\n2.    Facility Information\n\n- The primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to     farmers.\n\n- Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application. \n\n- The maximum quantity stored would be 182,000 pounds in our two-12,000 gallon     storage tanks and one-18,000 gallon storage tank.  The maximum quantity handled would     be the unloading of a semi trailer holding 42,000 pounds.\n\n\n3.    The worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario.\n\na.  The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage     tank released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The  maximum quantity released would be 79,000     pounds, which represents the volume of the storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited     by design standards.  The distance to the endpoint is 1.89 miles.\n\nb.  The alternative release scenario based on the most likely potential incident is a release     from a break in a transfer hose.  The distance to the endpoint is .83 miles.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.    The accidental release prevention program.\n\n     The facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage     and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by The American National     Standards Institute, Inc., and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health     Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111 \"Storage and handling of anh"

The Five-year Accident History\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that:\n\n-  have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility;  or\n\n-  to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in     place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n\n6.    The emergency response program\n\nThe facility has:\n\na.  a written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.38;\n\nb.  provided the state and local authorities the emergency planing and community right-to-     know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).\n\nc.  a written emergency response program, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR     1910.120, including pre-emergency planning and employee training.\n\n\n7.    Planned changes to improve safety.\n\n     Safety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are     performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no additional specific     anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nexecsumr.wpd\n"
