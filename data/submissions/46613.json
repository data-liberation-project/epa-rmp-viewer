      "SummaryText": "ACCIDENTAL RELEASE AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\nThe approach of the WWTP to chemical safety is prevention. This is accomplished by ensuring all personnel are properly trained in operational and safety procedures for any chemicals used by plant personnel. The WWTP also conducts regular facility and equipment self-inspections to ensure proper function. A policy of preventive maintenance is also followed to keep equipment in good working order. The City Council has identified safety as a prime concern and has established a safety policy by pass ordinances requiring all departments to establish and maintain safety programs. To help with this, a Safety Council has been established and meets on a regular basis (usually quarterly).\n\nFACILITY AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\nThe City of Fort Walton Beach Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP) has the capacity to treat up to 11.5 million gallons per day (MGD) of wastewater per day with an average flow of 4.5 MGD.  Wastewater enters the Facility from two (2) main pump stations located off-site. The wastewater enters the plant at the headworks, where it is aerated and de-gritted in the aeration chamber. From there the wastewater enters two (2) primary clarifiers for primary sedimentation. The wastewater then undergoes biological treatment by passing through a series of Rotating Biological Contactors (RBCs), on its way to the two (2) secondary clarifiers for further sedimentation. The wastewater then undergoes disinfection before being discharged into a 20 MG holding pond. From the pond the wastewater is either broadcast onto the plant?s 450 acre sprayfield or, with further treatment, pumped to a 2 MG holding tank located at the City Golf Course for broadcast. The Wastewater Treatment Plant has one independent chlorine injection system, which is used during the disinfection phase of wastewater treatment.  The system has one (1) one-ton container of chlorine on line and one (1) one-ton cylinder on standby at any one time.  The WWTP operat"

The WWTP normally maintains a maximum of 6 one-ton cylinders at the site at any one time.  All full and empty cylinders are stored outdoors on a loading dock with a roof to shield the cylinders from the sun.  During chlorine deliveries, the delivery truck backs up to the unloading area and unloads the cylinders using the WWTP?s crane.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n  The procedures/policies in this section are drawn, in part, from such rules and regulations as 40 CFR 68, 29 CFR 1910.119, the OSHA PSM and other federal, state and local ordinances.\nAll employees presently involved in operating chlorine related aspects of the treatment process, and prior to being involved in operating a newly assigned process, undergo training specific to their job tasks.  The training includes an overview of the specific process and the operating procedures involved.  The training also includes emphasis on the specific safety and health hazards, emergency operations including shutdown, and safe work practices applicable to the employee's job tasks.\nEach employee is provided with written operating procedures containing clear instructions for safely conducting activities involved in his/her specific job tasks. The written procedures are readily accessible to employees who work on or maintain a process.  Furthermore, the operating procedures are reviewed as often as necessary to assure that they reflect current operating practice. This includes changes that result from modifications to process chemicals, technology, and equipment, and modifications to adjacent or ancillary facilities.  The WWTP certifies annually that these operating procedures are current and accurate. \n  Written operating procedures for safe work practices that address the control of hazards are also pr"

These safe work practices also address control over entrance into a WWTP by maintenance, contractor, laboratory, or other support personnel.  The safe work practices apply to employees and contractor employees.\nThe WWTP has developed and implemented a maintenance program (MP) to ensure the continued integrity of all of the equipment used to process, store or handle chlorine.  Chlorine is the only highly hazardous chemical used at the Facility.  The purpose of this MP is to reduce the risk of chlorine releases as a result of equipment failure and/or poor equipment maintenance. However, the Facility recognizes that a properly established program can have numerous other cost and production benefits beyond that of increasing safety. It is important to note that the Facility does have specific maintenance employees to perform mechanical integrity.  The Facility employees will be performing maintenance as needed and have developed an MP that will:\nMinimize accidents, releases and water treatment delays caused by improper maintenance of equipment;\nMinimize the number of pieces of equipment down for repair;\nStabilize the work load of the maintenance department; and\nReduce expenses by preventing excessive wear and breakdown, and by prolonging the life of the equipment.\n\nIn order to accomplish these goals, the MP has six major components designed to improve employee and process efficiency and safety, thereby reducing the risk of a chlorine release:\nEquipment identification - Identification of all covered process equipment;\nPeriodic inspection and maintenance   Scheduling and performance is based on equipment age, past experience, and manufacturers' specifications and recommendations;\nEmployee training - Maintenance employee training is provided to ensure the continuation of a trained, knowledgeable workforce;\nCorrective action - Requires inspection fol"

No Fort Walton Beach Wastewater Treatment Plant personnel will respond if there is a chlorine gas release.  Since the WWTP has chosen not to respond to accidental releases itself, the Fort Walton Beach WWTP has coordinated with local planning and response agencies, and established mechanisms for notifying emergency responders when the need for a response occurs (40 CFR 68.90). The WWTP?s role in a major chlorine incident is primarily limited to notification and evacuation of plant personnel. As previously stated, minor leaks and major leaks will be handled by the fire department.  Rescue of injured or disabled personnel are restricted to fire department employees aided by plant personnel where necessary.  Evacuations outside of the plant are performed by the fire, and/or police departments in coordination with the emergency management agency.  \n  The State of Florida statutes require all spills or releases to the environment must be reported to the Department of Environmental Protection.  The plant manager should make this call as soon as possible after the time of release.  A spill form will be completed for use in mailing the report.  A spill report letter should be mailed within 24 hours of the release.\nIf 10 lbs. or more of chlorine is released to the environment, the National Response Center (NRC) (1 800 424 8802) must also be contacted.  It is the responsibility of the Manager and Assistant Manager of the WWTP to contact the NRC.\n  "

The purpose of these drills is to familiarize local emergency response agencies with the facilities and to test on-site emergency response procedures. For all chlorine emergency incidents and drills, a critique of the response is completed.  The critique consists of at least one meeting with all of the WWTP responders attending.  A review of the entire incident and response is conducted and problems that arose during the incident are addressed and solutions sought.\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\nThe WWTP is scheduled for a major upgrade within the very near future in which all systems and equipment will be repaired or replaced. The initial phases of this have been completed and work should begin soon."
