Devon's policy is to implement reasonable\n\ncontrols to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does\n\noccur, facility trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n\n\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nNatural gas (methane) and associated condensate (pentane) is collected from the surrounding\n\nfield and where the condensate is separated and sent to eventually be sold for domestic\n\nconsumption. This gas contains impurities and must be brought into specification before residue\n\ncompanies will purchase this gas.\n\n\n\nGeneral Accident Release Prevention and Program Information\n\n\n\nHicks Lanier No. 1 is regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) risk\n\nmanagement program (RMP).

Hicks\n\nLanier No. 1 is classified as a \"normally unoccupied remote facility\" as per the definition found\n\nin 29 CFR 1910.119(b) and thus is not applicable to PSM requirements according to 29 CFR\n\n1910.119(a)(2)(iii). However, should this status change, Hicks Lanier No. 1 must be reevaluated\n\nfor PSM applicability.\n\n\n\nDevon Energy, encourages employees to participate in safety and accident prevention.\n\nEmployees have access to facility accident prevention program.\n\n\n\nDevon Energy, keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe\n\noperation of the processes.
