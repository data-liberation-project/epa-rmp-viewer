These resources include safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of the process at MidMar East Gas Plant (MidMar East) and training of operations personnel and contractors.  Coronado Midstream implements reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  Coronado places emphasis on prevention, prompt detection, and expeditious correction of unsafe conditions by periodically conducting internal inspections and regularly training responsible personnel.  Should a release occur, trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release, and/or mitigate any off-site consequences. \n\n\n\n\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nMidMar East, located in Martin County, Texas is owned and operated by Coronado Midstream LLC.  MidMar East is a natural gas processing plant comprised of natural gas liquid recovery, natural gas liquids fractionation, and natural gas treatment and compression equipment.  The natural gas liquid recovery equipment is designed to recover natural gas liquids from the inlet gas.  Produced gas and liquids are delivered to the facility from gathering systems and pipelines.  MidMar East produces natural gas, natural gas liquids, and stabilized condensate.  The MidMar East equipment operates to separate, stabilize, treat (as necessary to remove hydrogen sulfide and carbon dioxide), compress (gas), dehydrate (gas), store (natural gas liquids and stabilized condensate), and transfer the materials described above to sales.  Natural gas and natural gas liquids are transported by pipeline from the facility, and stabilized condensate is transporte"

No toxic substance is present above a threshold quantity in the process.  MidMar East is subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation and is classified as a Program 1 process per the U.S. EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Risk Management Program (RMP). \n\n\n\n\n\nGeneral Accident Release Prevention Program and Chemical-specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nImplementation of appropriate administrative and technological safeguards in the process ensures the safety of workers and the surrounding community.  MidMar East has been designed using current equipment design codes and standards with appropriate safety controls.  The process design includes control systems to maintain operating parameters, such as temperature, pressure, flow, and level within allowable limits.  Written operating procedures for the process are developed, maintained, and periodically reviewed for safe operations.  Personnel operating the process are trained on the operating procedures to familiarize them with the consequences of exceeding allowable safety and operability limits and steps to correct deviation from normal operating parameters.  Additionally, MidMar East has developed maintenance procedures to maintain equipment integrity.  \n\n\n\nCoronado has implemented safe work practices to help ensure worker and process safety at MidMar East.  Examples of these include:  (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel; (2) a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance; (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous substances before process piping and equipment is opened; (4) a permit and pr"

These procedures, along with training of involved personnel, form a system to ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.  \n\n\n\n*          Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nHazards in the process at MidMar East are continually managed to ensure safe operations.  The existing safety features to prevent accidental releases of regulated substances in the facility are described below.\n\n\n\n**                    Uniform Prevention Activities\n\n\n\nThe accident prevention program is applied throughout the RMP-covered process at MidMar East.  These prevention programs are designed and implemented to prevent potential accidental release scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human errors.\n\n\n\n**                    Specialized Safety Features\n\n\n\nMidMar East is designed, constructed, operated, and maintained with safety features to help prevent or control a release, to quickly detect a release, and reduce the consequence of a release.  The following types of safety features are used in the covered process: \n\n\n\nI.     Release Detection\n\n            Hydrocarbon LEL detectors and alarms\n\n            Fire detectors and alarms\n\n            H2S detectors and alarms\n\nII.    Release Containment and Control\n\n            Process relief valves that discharge to a flare to capture and incinerate episodic releases\n\n            Valves to permit isolation of the process (manual and automated)\n\n            Automatic shutdown systems for specific process parameters (e.g., high temperature)\n\n            Curbs or dikes to contain liquid releases\n\n            Redundant equipment and instrumentation (e.g., uninterruptible power supply for process control system)\n\n            Tandem seals on hydrocarbon liquid pumps, where feasible\n\n            Atmospheric relief devices\n\n            To"

Procedures for a fire or explosion and notification of local emergency response agencies in the event of an accidental release are included.  Employees are trained on the emergency procedures.  The emergency procedures are updated as needed for modifications made to the facility.  Changes to the emergency procedures are administered through the Management of Change process.\n\nThe overall emergency program for MidMar East is coordinated with the Martin County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  Coordination includes periodic meetings of the committee, which includes MidMar East representatives, local emergency response officials, and local government officials.  MidMar East has 24/7 communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and with emergency response organizations (e.g., Volunteer Fire Department and the County Sheriff's office).  This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating response to an incident.  \n\n\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nMidMar East tracks and resolves all PHA recommendations.  All personnel, employees, and contractors are encouraged to notify their supervisor of any changes or modifications to MidMar East that could result in improved safety.  Plans to improve the safety include:  1)   Revisions to Operating Procedures to reflect changes to the process and provide clear instruction for operator response; 2)   Installation of additional process controls; and, 3)   Installation of process area detection systems.\n\n"
