(CORCO) owns and operates a Petroleum Bulk Storage Terminal for Lease (NAICS Code  49319) at its facilities located between the Municipalities of Guayanilla and Pe??uelas, Puerto Rico.  One of the commodities managed by CORCO is Liquefied Petroleum Gas or LPG, of which Propane (CAS No. 74-98-6) is its main component.  LPG or propane is received from ocean going vessel at its Marine Terminal located at the Bah?-a de Guayanilla, stored at its stationary storage facilites located within its South Tank Farm, and loaded into trucks at its truck loading rack.  CORCO handles Propane - a flammable substance - above regulatory treshold levels its South Tank Farm. The volumes handled at the Marine Terminal's pipes do not reach the LPG threshold of 10,000 lbs.  Release scenarios and offsite consequence analyses have been defined by referring to \"Risk Management Program Guidance for Propane Storage Facilities (40 CFR Part 68)\" - EPA 550-B-00-001, updated on March 2009.  CORCO is subject to Prevention Program 3.  As part of these requirements, CORCO has Process Safety Information available to its employees, contractors and visitors.  No processing is done onsite.  Drawings and technical data is available at its \"Mechanical Files Room\". A Process Hazards Analysis was completed on May, 2009. Standard Operating Procedures supplemented by special instructions from supervisory personnel are available at the different control rooms. Safety and emergency response procedures are currently under revision and address most important safety issues. The LHG Operation Manual developed to comply with US Coast Guard's requirements for our Marine Terminal governs most of our activities at that facility.  Most of the training to operators is on-the-job by senior personnel.  Inspection of equipment and piping is done as per applicable technical codes and standards.  Pressure vessels are inspected once per year as required by Puerto Rico regulations.  In most"

LPG facilities in Puerto Rico are also inspected by the governmental Public Service Commission.  Audits of compliance with applicable requirements under 40 CFR Part 68 are conducted once every three years since 1999, or whenever significant changes to facilities or to regulations make necessary a revision of this RMP.  The investigation of incidents and the issuance of hot work permits is done as per written procedures. Representatives of the different operating groups of our employees have participated in PHAs.  Contractors are subject to CORCO's safety procedures and practices.  CORCO mostly relies on its internal resources to respond to releases, but is also an active member of a mutual aid organization named CIMAO.  Its main emergency response procedures are included in its Facility Response Plan and the LHG Emergency Manual, each developed to comply with applicable regulatory requirements."
