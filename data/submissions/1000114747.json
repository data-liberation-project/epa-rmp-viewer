      "SummaryText": "Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nThe Grace SHAC Plant in Norco, LA is strongly committed to employee, public and environmental\nsafety. This commitment is demonstrated by a comprehensive accidental release prevention\nprogram that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and\nemployee training. It is company and site policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent\npossible releases of regulated substances. The facility is a non-responding source, meaning it relies on local emergency responders in the event of an accidental release. The SHAC Plant is located inside of the Shell West Site Chemical Facility, on land owned by Shell Chemical LP. In the unlikely event of a release, emergency response services for the manufacturing complex, including the SHAC Plant, are provided by Shell.\n\nStationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nGrace purchased the Norco SHAC Plant from the Dow Chemical Company in December 2013. The\nfacility's primary activity is catalyst manufacturing. The facility's annual capacity is production of\n1,000,000 pounds of catalyst. The material produced at this facility is sold to customers in the United\nStates and abroad. The catalyst is used by our customers primarily in the manufacturing of\npolypropylene resin. The site has one RMP-regulated toxic substance - titanium tetrachloride (TiCl4)\nand one RMP-regulated flammable substance - isopentane. The maximum inventory present at our\nfacility is 950,000 pounds of TiCl4 and 440,000 pounds of isopentane. Both substances are located within the manufacturing process area and contained in tankage.\n\nThe facility has recently installed an unloading arm and new foam deluge system for TiCl4 unloading to reduce the risk and exposure of a potential release involving TiCl4.\n\nThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nOur facility has taken necessary steps to comply with the accidental relea"

The facility is also subject to the Emergency\nPlanning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA) Section 302 notification requirements. The\nfollowing sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at\nthe SHAC Plant.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nGrace's SHAC Plant maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical\nhazards, process technology, and equipment information. This information is documented,\nmaintained up to date, and available for operating personnel associated with the facility.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nProcess Hazard Analyses are conducted or revalidated at least every five years to identify major\nprocess hazard scenarios and to recommend corrective actions needed to prevent their occurrence.\n\nOperating Procedures\nGrace's SHAC Plant maintains written operating procedures for the purposes of safely conducting\nactivities within the covered processes. These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown, and startup after a turnaround. The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nTraining\nGrace's SHAC Plant has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these\nprocess"

Equipment examined by these checks include; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls, and pumps. Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices. Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed. Equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nManagement of Change\nA management of change (MOC) process is in place at Grace's SHAC Plant to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures. Process operators, maintenance\npersonnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process\nconditions are promptly made aware of and provided training addressing the modification.\n\nPre-startup Reviews\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes or to modifications to the facility are conducted as a regular practice at Grace's SHAC Plant. These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits\nGrace's SHAC Plant conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under regulatory rules are being implemented. These audits are carried out at least every 3 years and corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner. Third party audits are also utilized to provide independent assessment of site regulatory compliance programs.\n\nIncident Investigation\nGrace's SHAC Plant promptly investigates incidents that result in, or could reasonably result in, a\ncatastrophic release of a regulated substance.

In addition, our employees have access to information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP rule, including information resulting from process hazard analyses in particular. There is a site procedure for Employee Participation and a Plant Safety Committee has been established with monthly meetings.\n\nContractors\nOur company hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities. Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is carried out. Grace's SHAC Plant has a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related the contractor's work and the facility. Contractors are also informed of the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.\n\nFive-year Accident History\nGrace's SHAC Plant has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases. There have\nbeen no accidental releases during the previous five-year period that met the reporting criteria under\nthe RMP rule.\n\nEmergency Response Plan\nGrace's SHAC Plant maintains a written emergency action plan to protect worker and public\nsafety as well as the environment. The plan consists of procedures for addressing releases of hazardous substances, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.

Emergency response for the manufacturing complex, including the SHAC Plant, is\nprovided by Shell. Therefore, Grace\u0092s SHAC Plant is considered a non-responding source under EPA's RMP program. The Shell Chemical Plant maintains a trained emergency squad to handle fires, explosions, toxic vapor and releases, spills, and medical emergencies. The Shell Plant squad trains and drills with local emergency responders to enhance their skills and tactics for responding to an accidental chemical release. Critiques are held on drills and actual events. In addition to the plant emergency squad, St. Charles Parish Emergency Operations Center (EOC) is notified immediately when an incident occurs. The EOC determines the community impact and takes the appropriate action to protect the community. Additional resources are also available through mutual aid organizations if needed.\n\nThe Grace emergency action plan provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations. Detailed\nemergency action plans are developed and coordinated with the St. Charles Parish EOC and the community.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\nOn-going programs, such as process hazard analysis reevaluations, continually aim to improve\nprocess safety.
