      "SummaryText": "The City of Aspen stores and maintains liquid chlorine on site.  In addressing the potential for unanticipated release, gas monitoring has been installed in all areas where chlorine gas is present or utilized for the treatment processes. Chlorine gas  monitoring is tied to specific chlorine alarms notifying operators and City/County communications center.\nSeparate gas monitoring has been installed in the storage facility that is designed to automatically start a chlorine scrubber when chlorine gas is detected. Off site personnel can also start the chlorine scrubber remotely.  \nPotential threats have been addressed with a security system and emergency inventory of disinfection product.  \nThere are six on site personnel that have attended 40 hour training for chlorine emergency rtesponse.  The initial emergency response plan was drafted in 1996 with 6 updates to the plan incorporating additional mitigation equipment.  The emergency response plan outlines response equipment available to staff, protocol for deliveries, protocol for response, and emergency personnel in the event of a release."
