Bulk and packaged products are received via transport trucks and stored for the eventual sale to farmers. This facility has an excellent safety record with no deaths or serious injuries to plant personnel or contractors due to the RMP covered process. There has only been 1 accident that resulted in an off site consequence of extremely minimal damage.\r\n\r\nB.\t Accidental Release Prevention Policies and Program\r\nThis Dodge City Coop strives to meet or exceed compliance with state anhydrous ammonia regulations. Training is provided for each new hire and re-hire employee involved in the process and also and every three years as required by federal regulations. The anhydrous ammonia tanks and associated equipment are inspected annually following recommended industry and engineering frequencies. Pressurized tanks and plumbing are tested according to the standards for the pressure vessel testing.  The facility strives to meet current industry accepted standards.\r\n\r\nC.\tEmergency Response Policies and Programs\r\n\r\nEach employee involved in the process is trained to be familiar with the emergency response policies and procedures through safety reviews and other safety meetings. Dodge City Coop has an Emergency Action Plan, covered in 29CFR 1910.38, which covers accidental releases, natural disasters, security incidents and other emergency practices and procedures. The Emergency Action Plan for this facility is reviewed and updated on an annual basis as part of a comprehensive review process. The Emergency Action Plan for this facility includes specific instructions for the employees regarding the response to an emergency. The procedures provided in the Emergency Action Plan are shared with all employees and followed in the event of an emergency.

Considerations have been taken with Hodgeman County and the LEPC in the event of a worst-case scenario release.\r\n\r\nE.\tFive Year Accident History\r\n\r\nThis facility has an excellent safety record with no deaths or serious injuries to any of its employees as a result of the RMP covered process. Only one accidental release has occurred.  This release was off site and in the middle of a field.  A customer tipped over a tank and our employees assisted in righting the tank.  In doing so, the pressure relief valve was damaged and ammonia was released that resulted in crop damage.  This very well may not have been our need to report as the ammonia in the tank was no longer in our possession nor on our property at the time of release, however we made the report as a good steward to agriculture.  The Dodge City Coop has extensive programs and procedures in place to maintain this record.\r\n\r\nF.\tPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\r\n\r\nManagement of the Dodge City Coop continuously look for ways to enhance the safety of this location. Annual equipment inspections are conducted.  Environmental Safety & Health audits are conducted every three years with a detailed description of the findings.  The Dodge City Coop will continually strive to comply with most current industry accepted practices, not just what the current legislative requirement states.  \r\n\r\nG.\tSummary\r\n\r\nThe employees of the Dodge City Coop are extremely proud of our safety record and vast improvements made in both environmental stewardship and safety. We believe with our programs and policies in place and with the continued efforts of our personnel, we will maintain our safety record and our safe facility"
