Bulk and packaged products are received via transport trucks and stored for the eventual sale to farmers. This facility has an excellent safety record with no deaths or serious injuries to plant personnel or contractors due to the RMP covered process. There has only been 1 accident that resulted in an off site consequence of extremely minimal damage.\n\n\n\nB.     Accidental Release Prevention Policies and Program\n\nThis Dodge City Coop strives to meet or exceed compliance with state anhydrous ammonia regulations. Training is provided for each new hire and re-hire employee involved in the process and also and every three years as required by federal regulations.

Worse-Case Scenario / Alternative-Case Scenario\n\n\n\nThis facility has developed a worse-case and an alternative-case scenario however it has been withheld from this Executive Summary as security-sensitive information as requested by EPA.  Considerations have been taken with Hodgeman County and the LEPC in the event of a worst-case scenario release.\n\n\n\nE.    Five Year Accident History\n\n\n\nThis facility has an excellent safety record with no deaths or serious injuries to any of its employees as a result of the RMP covered process. Only one accidental release has occurred.  This release was off site and in the middle of a field.  A customer tipped over a tank and our employees assisted in righting the tank.  In doing so, the pressure relief valve was damaged and ammonia was released that resulted in crop damage.  This very well may not have been our need to report as the ammonia in the tank was no longer in our possession nor on our property at the time of release, however we made the report as a good steward to agriculture.  The Dodge City Coop has extensive programs and procedures in place to maintain this record.\n\n\n\nF.    Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nManagement of the Dodge City Coop continuously look for ways to enhance the safety of this location. Annual equipment inspections are conducted.  Environmental Safety & Health audits are conducted every three years with a detailed description of the findings.  The Dodge City Coop will continually strive to comply with most current industry accepted practices, not just what the current legislative requirement states.  \n\n\n\nG.    Summary\n\n\n\nThe employees of the Dodge City Coop are extremely proud of our safety record and vast improvements made in both environmental stewardship and safety. We believe with our programs and policies in place and with the continued efforts of our personnel, we will maintain our safety record and our safe facility "
