Accurate and complete process safety information enables the North Little Rock Terminal employees involved in operating and maintaining the terminal to identify and understand the hazards of the process.  Process safety information is used to conduct process hazard analysis on the existing process or a proposed modification to a process.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA):  The North Little Rock Terminal is committed to performing a detailed hazard analysis of each covered process to identify, evaluate, and control hazards involved in the processes.  Each process is systematically examined to identify potential hazards, controls in place to manage these hazards, and recommend additional controls, as appropriate.  The North Little Rock Terminal uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) and check list PHA methodologies, which are conducted by a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience, engineering expertise and PHA facilitator training.  The PHA team identifies and evaluates potential hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and / or mitigation measures.  As a minimum the North Little Rock Terminal performs periodic PHA reviews or revalidations every 5 years as long as the process is operating.  PHA findings and recommendations and their resolution are documented.  The North Little Rock Terminal has implemented a system to address and resolve all PHA findings and recommendations in a timely manner through a written schedule.  All PHA findings and recommendation resolutions are communicated to all effected employees.  All recommendations must be resolved and documented by management.\n\nOperating Procedures (OP):  The North Little Rock Terminal has developed and implemented written operating procedures that describe the tasks that terminal operators and transport drivers must perform, the safe process operating parameters that must be maintained, and safe"

The North Little Rock Terminal written operating procedures state the operating limits including the consequences of deviation and the steps required to correct or avoid the deviation.  The North Little Rock Terminal written operating procedures describe all the process safety systems and their functions.  The North Little Rock Terminal written operating procedures are reviewed and certified annually for current practices and accuracy.\n\nSafe Work Practices and Procedures:  The North Little Rock Terminal has developed and implemented safe work practices in accordance with the OSHA 29 CFR Part 1910 requirements that include methods for controlling plant entry, presence and exit of support personnel, and lockout/ tagout procedures to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, hot work procedures and permits for work with the potential for generating ignition sources in the presence of flammable or combustible material, and confined space entry permits and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry is allowed into a permit required confined space.\n\nTraining:  The North Little Rock Terminal has developed and implemented formal operator and maintenance training programs.  Initial training insures that new or reassigned personnel are trained in an overview of the process and operating procedures.  Refresher training is performed at least every three (3) years to ensure that the operator understands and adheres to the current operating procedures of the process.
