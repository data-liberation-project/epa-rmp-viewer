The accidental release plan serves to comply with Federal RMP regulations at 40 CFR 68.12(d)(3) that require the implementation of a Risk Management Program consisting of a) a site management system to administer the accidental release plan, b) a system to prevent process hazards (pursuant to Process Level 3 regulations from 40 CFR 68.65 to 68.87), and an Emergency Response Plan (40 CFR 68.93, 95, and 96).  The hazards-prevention system also meets OSHA Process Safety Management regulations at 29 CFR 1910.119(a) through (p) and Chemours' internal process safety standard designated PSM-S21.

The facilities are situated on a 1500-acre site; however, only about 200 acres are developed. The remainder of the property is set aside as a wildlife habitat and location of the employee recreation area. We manufacture titanium dioxide (TiO2), under the trade name TiPure as our primary product.  Titanium dioxide is manufactured via the chloride-ilmenite process in which titanium dioxide ore is chlorinated to titanium tetrachloride (TiCl4); the TiCl4 is subsequently re-oxidized to refined TiO2. \n\n\n\nRMP-COVERED CHEMICALS are Chlorine and Titanium Tetrachloride.\n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nIn the past five years, there have been no RMP-reportable accidents at the site. Our on site medical department or first aid responders treated the injured and all returned to work. We conduct formal incident investigations to identify and correct the root cause for all safety incidents.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nJohnsonville's emergency response program is contained in our Emergency Manual and managed by the site's Emergency Response Coordinator. It consolidates the various regulations for emergency response planning.   "
