This policy covers all aspects of process safety and risk management including the prevention program in Subpart D of 40 CFR 68 as well as the Emergency Response requirements of 68.95.\n\n68.155(b) - Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\nThe Chemours Johnsonville Plant is a stationary source of air emissions that produces Titanium Dioxide under NAICS 325180.  Regulated substances on site are chlorine (CAS No. 7782-50-5) and titanium chloride (CAS No. 7550-45-0).\n\n68.155(c) - Prevention Program\nThe site has a Process Safety and Risk Management Program that meets the requirements of 40 CFR 68 Subpart D.  The program is updated as needed to ensure it reflects actual conditions on site.  Chemical specific prevention steps for chlorine and titanium chloride are found in the site's Chlorine Manual and the site's Titanium Tetrachloride Manual.  Each of these manuals is an extensive list of measures to prevent releases.  The site audits compliance against the internal compliance obligations in these manuals once every three years.\n\n68.155(d) 5-Year Accident History\nThe impact of all chlorine and titanium dioxide releases is determined during the incident investigation (68.81).  Over the last 5 years (8/8/2018 to 8/8/2023) there have been no incidents that cause death, injuries or significant property damage on site.  Similarly, there have been no incidents that cause off-site deaths, injuries, property damage, environmental damage evacuations or sheltering in place.  68.42(a).\n\n68.155(e) Emergency Response \nThe site maintains an extensive Emergency Response Manual as required by 68.95.  The site Emergency Response Coordinator meets with the local LEPC annually to coordinate activities as required by 68.93.  Documentation of these coordination meetings is available.\n\n68."
