      "SummaryText": "Hickory Springs Manufacturing Company and its subsidiary operations are committed to operating and maintaining it's facilities and processes in a safe and responsible manner, which provides safe conditions for company employees, the surrounding community and their environment.  Our PTI facility manufactures flexible polyethylene foam products.  \r\n\r\nThe main ingredient used in the flexible polyethylene foam process is isobutane.  Our isobutane inventory is maintained above 10,000 pounds.  In accordance with the provisions of 40CFR68 (risk management program regulations - RMP), the worst case scenario was defined as the rupture of and immediate vapor cloud explosion of the contents of the isobutane tank.  The impact of this explosion was evaluated using EPA's Aloha and Marplot software and resulted in an area of concern which extends 0.33 miles from the storage tank, which is beyond the facility property boundary and does affect public receptors.  One alternate release scenario which was a bleve was evaluated using EPA's Aloha and Marplot software.  The bleve resulted in an area concern which extends 0.50 miles from the storage vessel which is beyond the facility property boundary and does affect public receptors.   The isobutane system is designed, installed and maintained with the NFPA58 state law and the companies insurance carrier.\r\n\r\nIn the event of an accidental release of a flammable substance, the facility's Plant Emergency Organization policy requires immediate notification of the proper authorities and evacuation of the affected area.  Facility personnel will only take defensive measures prior to evacuation.  This facilities emergency response and contingency plan has been coordinated with the LEPC, local fire departments and the Hickory  Fire Department Fire Marshall.  All employees responsible for the handling and control of hazardous substances are provided with initial and refresher training in proper procedures as required by the EPA, OSHA and DOT stand"
