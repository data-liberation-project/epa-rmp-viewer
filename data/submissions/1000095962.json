To this end, we have formal policies and procedures in place through our Safety Manual and our Risk Management Plan. We have committed senior management resources for the ongoing development, implementation and integration of the program elements into our overall operations.\r\n\r\nThe WWTP provides primary treatment, flocculation, clarification, secondary treatment, and disinfection for customers in the City of Youngstown and other portions of Mahoning and Trumbull Counties. The facility is designed to process an average wastewater flow of 35 million gallons per day (MGD) with a maximum of 90 MGD. The WWTP uses UV as a primary means of disinfection for up to 80 million gallons per day (MGD). Chlorine is used to chlorinate the wastewater that exceeds 80 MGD. Sulfur dioxide is used to dechlorinate wastewater in excess of 80 MGD.\r\n\r\nThe facility has implemented Prevention Program 3 requirements that includes the following elements: Process Safety Information, Process Hazard Analyses, Operating Procedures, Training, Mechanical Integrity, Pre-startup Review, Compliance Audits, Incident Investigation, Employee Participation, Hot Work Permit, and Contractors. Operating and maintenance procedures are key to operating the system in a safe manner and these are routinely reviewed and updated. The maintenance of key equipment such as automatic shutdown systems, sensors, and alarm systems is critical to the ongoing safety of our process.\r\n\r\nThe facility has had no accidental releases of chlorine or sulfur dioxide in the past five years.\r\n\r\nThe facility is a non-responding facility and has coordinated its emergency response with the Mahoning County HazMat Team as responders in the event of a chlorine or sulfur dioxide emergency. The facility has developed chlorine and sulfur dioxide emergency procedures include"

The continual review and update of operating and maintenance procedures is performed to improve the overall safety of the system."
