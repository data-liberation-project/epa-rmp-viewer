The Facility Policy\n\n\tMFA Incorporated, and the employees of the MFA Agri Services in Bernie are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the Bernie Fire Department, and other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information\n\n\tThe primary activity at the facility is the storage of anhydrous ammonia nurse tank wagons. The nurse tanks are then used in the application process of anhydrous ammonia as a crop nutrient.\n\n\tThe maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia stored would be 6,288 pounds in a 1,450-gallon nurse tank. The facility has two\n1,450 gallon nurse tanks that when filled will hold approximately 12,577 pounds.  There are also, twenty-five 1,000 gallon nurse tanks that when filled would hold approximately 108,375 pounds.  Therefore the facility has a total storage capacity of approximately 120,952 pounds.\n\n3. The worst-case and alternative release scenario.\n\n\ta. The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of the 2 largest nurse tanks plus one additional thousand-gallon nurse tank, released as a gas over 10 minutes. The maximum quantity released would be 16,912 pounds, which represents the volume of the 3 nurse tanks at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is .9 miles.\n\tb. The alternative release scenario based on the most likely potential incident is a release from the failure of a 1 transfer hose or valve.  This release is assumed to last approximately 2 minutes before automatic or manual shut-off stops the flow. The maximum quantity release would be 2,901 pounds. The distance to the end"

The Accidental Release Prevention Program.\n\n\tThe facility has implemented the provisions of Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1, 1981, published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc., the Missouri Anhydrous Ammonia regulations and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, Storage and handling of Anhydrous Ammonia.\n\n5. The Five-year Accident History\n\n\tThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that: have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n6. The Emergency Response Program.\n\n\tThe facility has;\n\n\ta. a written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA\n\t   Standard, 29 CFR 1910.38;\n\n\tb. provided State and Local authorities with the emergency\n\t   planning and community right-to-know information as\n\t   required under SARA Title III (EPCRA);\n\n\tc. a written emergency response program, in accordance with\n\t   OSHA Standard, 29 CFR 1910.120, including pre-emergency\n\t   planning and employee training.\n\n7. Planned changes to improve safety.\n\n\tSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility. Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions. There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time.\n\n\n\n\t5/15/03"
