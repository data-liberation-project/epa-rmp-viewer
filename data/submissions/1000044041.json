The Facility Policy\n\n\n\nThe owners, management, and employees of Hintzsche Fertilizer are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the Maple Park Fire Department, Kane Co. LEPC or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n\n\n2. Stationary Sources and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers, farm chemicals and related agricultural products, for sale to the farmer.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct aplication as a crop nutrient and also used for blending in a mixing operation to make a mixed-grade fertilizer for application.\n\n\n\nThe maximum quantity of Anhydrous Ammonia stored would be 11000 gallons (or 51,405lbs.) in our One storage tank.\n\n\n\n3. The Worst-Case Release Scenario and the Alternative Release Scenario are not disclosed for security reasons.  If additional information is required please contact the management of this facility.\n\n\n\nWorse-Case:  The worse-case scenario is not disclosed.\n\n\n\nAlternative Case:  The alternative release scenario is not disclosed\n\n\n\n4. The Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\n\n\nThis facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by The American National Standards, Institute, Inc., and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\".\n\n\n\n5. The Five-year Accident History\n\n\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of Anhydrous Ammonia (from our fixed sources) in the past five years that: have caused deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at this facility; nor to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations"

The Emergency Response Program\n\n\n\nThis facility has a current Emergency Action Plan ( in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.38) in place and has coordinated this program with  the Maple Park Fire Department and with the Kane Co. LEPC.  We train our staff on the elements found in our response program  and have invited the fire department to visit our facility in order to provide them with a working knowledge of our plant's layout and our storage facility. This facility has provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).\n\n\n\n7. Planned Changes to Improve Safety.\n\n\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
