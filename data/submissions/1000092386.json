EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThe Escanaba Paper Company (EPC) is committed to operating in a manner that is safe for employees, the public, and the environment.  As part of this commitment, EPCA has established a system to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility.  Two components of this system are a Process Safety Management (PSM) program that helps manage the risk and that complies with the requirements of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regulation 29 CFR 1910.119, Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals; and a risk management program (RMP) that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulation 40 CFR part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule).  One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit a risk management plan (RMPlan) describing the risk management program at EPC.  This document is intended to satisfy the RMP requirements of the rule and to provide the public with a description of our risk management program.    \r\n\r\nThe process safety and risk management program at EPC consists of three elements:\r\n\r\n\t1.  \tA hazard assessment to help understand (a) the potential off-site consequences of hypothetical accidental releases and (b) accidents that have occurred during the last five years associated with the use of substances regulated by the RMP rule (regulated substances) - see topics 1.3 and 1.5\r\n\r\n\t2.  \tA prevention program to help maintain and safely operate the processes containing more than a threshold quantity of a regulated substance (covered processes) - see topic 1.4\r\n\r\n\t3. \tAn emergency response program to help respond to accidental releases of regulated substances from covered processes - see topic 1.6\r\n\r\nInformation further describing these elements is provided in this RMP plan.\r\n\r\nAlthough the risk managem"

In fact, EPC has a comprehensive safety program in place establishing many levels of safeguard against release of a hazardous substance and resultant injuries or damage from such a release.\r\n\r\nEPC limits the use of hazardous substances.  Prior to using a hazardous substance, less hazardous alternatives are considered.  When a hazardous substance is used at EPC, consideration is given to the potential for this substance to adversely affect employees, the public, as well as the environment and steps are taken to prevent any such effects.\r\n\r\nEPC prevents releases of the hazardous substances used at the facility.  When a hazardous substance is used at EPC, the equipment is carefully designed, built, and operated to reduce the likelihood of an accidental release.  Industry and government standards are closely adhered to in the design, construction, and operation of the equipment.\r\n\r\nEPC limits damage from a release, if such a release occurs.  EPC trains employees to respond to an accidental release, reducing the consequences of a release should one occur.  In addition, EPC works with the local emergency planning committee (LEPC) to help ensure that injuries and/or environmental damage will be minimized if a release does occur. \r\n\r\nThe safety program at EPC consists of a number of elements, only, some of which are required by the RMP rule.  This RMP plan is primarily intended to describe those parts of the safety program at EPC that are required by the RMP rule. \r\n\r\n1.1 Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n\r\nEPC is committed to the safety and health of our employees, contractors, the public, and to the preservation of the environment, through the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances.

The off-site consequence analysis consists of evaluating both worst-case release scenarios and alternative release scenarios.  EPC does not expect a worst case release scenario to ever occur.  The alternative release scenarios were selected to help the local emergency planning committee improve the community emergency response plan.  An alternative release scenario represents a release that (1) although unlikely, is more probable than a worst-case release scenario and (2) could result in a potential off-site consequence.\r\n\r\nThe main objective of performing the off-site consequence analysis is to determine the distance at which certain effects might occur to the public because of an accidental release (called the endpoint distance).  The following effects could occur at the endpoint distance.  At distances less than the endpoint distance, the effects would be greater; at distances greater than the endpoint distance, the effects would be less.\r\n\r\nWhen considering the release of a toxic substance, most people at the endpoint distance would be able to walk away from the exposure without any long-term health consequences, although some short term consequences (e.g., strong eye or throat irritation) are likely.  Some people who are particularly susceptible to the substance released could be incapacitated.\r\n\r\nThe RMP rule requires specific requirements for the worst case and alternative release scenarios that must be reported by EPC.

Pre-Startup Review. EPC performs a safety review of a new or modified process before the process is placed into service to help ensure that the process has been prepared to operate safely.  This review confirms that:  \r\n\r\nY\tconstruction and equipment are in accordance with design specifications\r\nY\tadequate safety, operating, maintenance, and emergency procedures are in place\r\nY\temployee training has been completed\r\nY\tmanagement of change requirements have been completed if an existing covered process has been modified\r\nY\tmanagement of change requirements and Process Hazard Analyses has been performed for a new process\r\n\r\nA pre-startup review checklist is completed to document the review and to ensure that appropriate issues have been addressed.  A pre-startup review checklist is included with the management of change form.  \r\n\r\n9. Compliance Audit. EPC audits covered processes to be certain that the Process Safety Management program is effectively addressing the safety issues of our operations.  EPC assembles an audit team that includes personnel knowledgeable in the Process Safety Management regulations as well as the process.  This team evaluates whether the Process Safety Management program satisfies the requirements of 29 CFR 1910.119 and whether the prevention program is sufficient to help ensure safe operation of the process.  The results of the audit are documented, recommendations are resolved, and appropriate process enhancements are implemented.  The same audit procedures will be used to"

Incident investigations. EPC will investigate all incidents that could have reasonably resulted in a serious injury to personnel, the public, or the environment so that similar accidents can be prevented.  Employees are trained to identify and report any incident requiring investigation. An investigation team will be assembled, and the investigation is initiated within 48 hours of the incident.  The results of the investigation are documented, recommendations are resolved, and appropriate process or equipment enhancements are implemented.  Incident reports remain on file in the Safety Department.\r\n\r\n11. Hot Work Permits. EPC established a hot work permit program to control spark or flame producing activities that could result in fires or explosions.  EPC reviewed OSHA's fire prevention and protection requirements in 29 CFR 1910.252(a) and created a Hot Work Permit form and policy to comply with these requirements.  Personnel who are to perform hot work are required to fill out the Hot Work Permit form.  The shift supervisor reviews the completed form before work can begin.  The Hot Work Permits are assigned a number by the Loss Prevention Officer and are monitored until the job is complete.  The Loss Prevention Department retains copies of the completed permits.  Training in the use of the Hot Work Permit is included in the EPC safe work practices training programs that are conducted on a periodic basis.\r\n\r\n12. Contractors. EPC established a program to help ensure that contractor activities at our facility are performed in a safe manner.  The program reviews the safety record of all contractors to help ensure that EPC only hires contractors who can safely perform the desired job tasks.  EPC explains to the contract supervisors the hazards of the process on which th"

EPC requires that the contractor supervisors' train each of their employees who will work at EPC before that worker begins work at the EPC site.  EPC periodically reviews contractor-training documents, and work performance to help ensure that safe practices are followed.  \r\n\r\n13.Trade Secrets. EPC will provide all information necessary to comply with 29 CFR 1910.119 without regard to possible trade secret status of such information.  \r\n\r\n1.4.3 Chemical-specific Prevention Steps  \r\n\r\nIn addition to the required prevention program elements, EPC has implemented safety features specific to the hazardous substances used at EPC.  The following paragraphs describe some of these safety features.\r\n\r\nAnhydrous Ammonia.  Industry standards are followed at EPC to help ensure safe handling of anhydrous ammonia.  The ammonia vendor supplies ammonia via Department of Transportation (DOT)-approved tank truck and follows DOT standards when loading the anhydrous ammonia storage tank.  The storage tank design and construction are consistent with American National Standards Institute (ANSI) standards for the storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia.  Employees who perform operations involving ammonia receive training emphasizing safe handling procedures for ammonia developed by EPC.\r\n\r\nChlorine.  Chlorine is supplied in DOT-approved 1-ton containers.  Chlorine is fed through a short length of piping to an eductor, where it is absorbed into process water for use in the water treatment unit.  The length of piping containing chlorine is kept to a minimum to reduce the likelihood of a release.  If release occurs downstream of the regulator at the cylinder, the regulator will close and only the quantity in the piping will be released.  Chlorine detectors and alarms are provided in most areas containing chlorine.  Chlorine 90-ton railcars have been eliminated from our operation.  Employees who per"

      "SummaryText": "form operations involving chlorine receive training emphasizing safe handling procedures for chlorine developed by EPC.       \r\n\r\nChlorine Dioxide.  Chlorine dioxide is produced at the EPC facility and stored as a dilute aqueous solution to avoid the necessity of transporting large quantities of the solution.  Chlorine dioxide is produced in the chlorine dioxide generator and piped to an absorber column, where a chlorine dioxide solution (1.2 wt%) is generated.  Storing this substance as a solution helps to reduce the consequences of a release.  A diked area around the storage tank further reduces the consequences of a release.\r\n\r\n1.5 Five-Year Accident History\r\n\r\nThere have been no accidental releases of a regulated chemical during the last five years.    \r\n\r\n1.6 Emergency Response Program\r\n\r\nEPC has established a written emergency response program to help safely respond to accidental releases of hazardous substances.  The emergency response plan includes procedures for:\r\n\r\nY\tinforming the local public safety department and the public about accidental releases that could reasonably result in off-site consequences\r\nY\tproviding proper first aid and emergency medical treatment to treat accidental human exposure to hazardous substances at EPC\r\nY\tcontrolling and containing accidental releases of hazardous substances, including the use of emergency response equipment\r\nY\tinspecting and maintaining emergency response equipment\r\nY\treviewing and updating the emergency response plan\r\n\r\nEPC maintains an emergency response team trained in these emergency response procedures.  All EPC personnel are trained in evacuation procedures.  EPC periodically conducts emergency response drills, including annual drills coordinated with the local emergency planning coordinator.\r\n\r\nThe written emergency response plan complies with other federal contingency plan regulations (e.g., the OSHA regulations 29 CFR 1910.38(a), 29 CFR 1910.120(a)) and has been communicated to local emergency response"
