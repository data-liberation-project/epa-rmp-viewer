In our processes, we use the following chemicals that EPA has identified as having the potential to cause significant off site consequences in the event of a substantial accidental release:\n\nToxics:  Methyl Chloride, Phosphorous Trichloride\nFlammables:  Dimethylamine (anhydrous), Methylamine (anhydrous)\n\nOur accidental release prevention programs and our contingency planning efforts help us to effectively manage the hazards that are posed to our employees, the public, and the environment by our use of these chemicals.\n\nKey Off Site Consequence Analysis Scenarios\nEPA's RMP rule requires that we provide information about worst-case release scenarios and alternative release scenarios for our facility.

The estimated distance to the toxic end point (0.82 mg/l) is 3.2 miles according to EPA's RMP*Comp model.\n\nWorst-Case Scenario - Regulated Flammable Chemicals\nThe worst-case scenario selected is a storage tank rupture that releases the entire contents of 150,000 pounds of anhydrous Dimethylamine (DMA).  DMA is used in the production of amine products at the facility.  This is the largest storage tank of Dimethylamine and the release is contained within a concrete dike.
