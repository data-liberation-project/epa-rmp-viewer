Computerized controls, which can be operated remotely from a company laptop-modem system or from the manufacturers location in Yakima\r\n? Suction trap hi-level float\r\n? High discharge pressure shut down\r\n? Low suction pressure shut down\r\n? High discharge temperature shut down\r\n? Oil pressure failure shut down\r\n? High amperes shut down\r\n?

It is the policy of RR to adhere to all applicable federal and state safety and environmental regulations.\r\n\r\n\tRR refrigeration personnel do respond to ammonia releases and have received training in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.120, in addition to training specifically for ammonia.  An emergency plan has been developed covering notification to public safety agencies and the public.  An evacuation plan for the plant has also been developed and all employees receive training on this plan.\r\n\r\nAt RR anhydrous ammonia is used on-site. Ammonia is considered hazardous by EPA and is listed on the Extremely Hazardous Substance ( EHS ) list.  Chemical properties of ammonia make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling ammonia in order to:\r\n\r\n? Prevent unnecessary human exposure to the EHS\r\n\r\n? Reduce the threat of exposure to our personnel\r\n\r\n? Reduce the threat to the community and the surrounding ecosystem\r\n\r\n\r\nB.\tFacility and Regulated Substance Handled\r\n\r\nRR is a fruit processing and cold storage facility, located approximately one mile south-south east of Royal City, which is located in Grant county and within the state of Washington.\r\n\r\nThe regulated substance used at RR is anhydrous ammonia.  Chemical Abstract Number ( CAS ) # 7664-41-7.  The substance is used as a refrigerant.\r\n\r\nThere is approximately 9,600 pounds of anhydrous ammonia in the system as of this writing, but RR hopes to increase the total quantity to 13,500 pounds this summer.  The close proximity of this planned increase, directs me towards the safer course and with this in mind I used the greater of the two quantities ( 13,500 ) to calculate the Worst-Case Scenario and the Alternative Release Scenario. \r\n\r\nRR uses other haza"

However, RR believes in the concept set forth in the \u00bfGeneral Duty Clause\u00bf of the Clean Air Act.  To this effect, RR plans to established policies, procedures and training to reduce the risk of an accidental hazardous substance release for the safety of its employees and surrounding areas.\r\n\r\n\r\nC.\tWorst-Case and Alternative Scenarios\r\n\r\nThe off-site consequence analysis considers two ammonia release scenarios identified as \u00bfworst case\u00bf and \u00bfalternative\u00bf scenarios.  The worst case scenario is defined by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), which states that \u00bfthe owner or operator shall assume that the maximum quantity in the largest vessel is released.  The alternative scenario is defined as \u00bfmore likely to occur than the worst case scenario\u00bf.\r\n\r\nWorst-Case Scenario - Failure of the largest vessel would release 13,500 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.  The release would occur inside the compressor room; its walls are in direct contact with the outside, however the effects of building mitigation were not considered.  \r\n\r\nThe distance to the toxic end-point of 0.14 mg/L is 2 miles.  The \u00bfrisk radius\u00bf extends past the boundaries of the plant, into public receptor areas. Distance was determined by use of RMP-COMP\u00bf version 1.07.\r\n\r\nAlternative Release Scenario \u00bf Several alternative scenarios were modeled, using ALOHA\u00bf, version 5.3, however a release from the bottom (liquid space) of the receiver, under normal operating conditions, was chosen.  This alternative scenario provided the greatest risk radius of .1 miles.  There was no building mitigation used for this scenario.  It was, however, assumed that the safeties and computer control would limit the release to the amount in the receiver.\r\n\r\nBoth the \u00bfworst-case\u00bf and \u00bfalternative\u00bf scenarios are unlikely due to the safeties on the system such as temperature and pressure cutouts, computer controls and pressure"
