F458 and F445 are used as serving tanks that charge reactors. After reacting with other compounds in the reactor, BF3 is neutralized with caustic upon entering the reactor.\n\n\n\nThe processes at the Plant have hazards that are managed to ensure continued safe operation. Plant has safety features on many units to help (1) contain/control a release, (2) quickly detect a release, and, (3) reduce (mitigate) the consequences of a release. The following types of safety features are used in various processes:\n\n1. Release detection - sensors with audible alarms, video surveillance, operator rounds\n\n2. Release containment/controls - pressure relief valves, excess flow check valves, dikes, deluge\n\n3. Release mitigation - SOP, training, PPE",

Firestone is subject to regulation under 40 CFR 68, Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions (CAPP).  At the facility, Firestone has the following substances at quantities that are regulated substances for Accidental Release Prevention (ARP) under Subpart F of CAPP: 1,3-Butadiene, 2-Butene cis, 2-Butene-trans, and Boron Trifluoride.\n\n\n\nFacilities holding more than a threshold quantity of a regulated substance in a process are required to comply with EPA's Risk Management Program regulations. The regulations require owners or operators of covered facilities to implement a risk management program and to submit an RMP to the EPA.\n\n\n\nThe Lake Charles Plant includes a Program 3 process that is regulated under the ARP Program.\n\n- The facility stores both flammable and toxic substances above threshold quantities which are defined in Tables 1through 4 of 40 CFR 68.130,\n\n- A worst-case release of the flammable substance would affect public receptors,\n\n- A worst-case release of the toxic substance would affect public receptors; and \n\n- It is a staffed facility that is subject to Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\n\n\nIt is Firestone's policy to meet or exceed all safety, health, and environmental regulations and industrial standards that apply to our facility. Over the years, Firestone has invested significant resources into compliance with the OSHA Process Safety Management and related OSHA standards and have expanded its programs to meet the requirements of the EPA's Risk Management Plan (RMP) Rule. These programs help maintain low levels of risks to our employees, contractors, the community, and the environment.  This is achieved through: (1) min"
