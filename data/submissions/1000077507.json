The purpose of the plan is to review the storage and handling of chloroform at the facility in order to ensure that safe and compliant procedures and programs are in place and that effective precautions are taken to prevent an accidental release of chloroform that could affect CITGO personnel, the public, or the environment.   This revised and updated plan is being submitted on April 9, 2019, which is within five years of the last updated plan.\n\n\n\nThe CITGO Louisville Terminal meets the requirements for a Program Level 2 facility.  Therefore, the revised plan includes a review and update of the off-site consequence analysis (OCA) for both the worst-case and alternate case scenarios, the site prevention programs (safety information, hazard review, training, maintenance, compliance audits, incident investigation procedures, and operating procedures), and the site emergency response procedures.  A worst case flammable scenario is not applicable because the site does not store any of the listed flammable chemicals above the program thresholds.\n\n\n\nFACILITY DESCRIPTION AND OPERATIONS (SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE)\n\n\n\nCITGO Petroleum Corporation owns and operates the Louisville Terminal, a bulk petroleum terminal located on the far west side of Louisville near the Ohio River.  The facility's primary operation is to receive gasoline and other fuels by barge and pipeline, transfer them into bulk storage tanks, and then fill over-the-road tanker trucks through use of a loading rack.  The facility operates 24/7 and has two full-time employees.\n\n\n\nChloroform is also delivered to the Louisville Terminal by barge.  The chloroform is transferred from the supply barge via pipeline to three"

The chloroform is received by CITGO and delievered to Chemours FC, LLC in accordance with a signed contract between the two companies.\n\n\n\nChloroform is a regulated hazardous substance as defined and listed in 40 CFR 68 with a storage threshold of 20,000 pounds.   The three chloroform storage tanks have working capacities of 340, 956 gallons (Tank 9), 374,514 gallons (Tank 10), and 374,010 gallons (Tank 11) for a total capacity of 1,089,480 gallons and an on-site maximum storage of 13,538,968 pounds.\n\n\n\nRELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM OVERVIEW\n\n\n\nCITGO has historically taken many precautions and actions to prevent the release of hazardous materials from its operations.  These include: (1) careful design and use of appropriate standards for tank and piping systems; (2) design and use of appropriate secondary containment for all storage tanks; (3) high level alarms, overfill alarms, chloroform detectors, and remote motor operated shutoff valves; (4) the development of safe operating procedures for loading chloroform tanks and transferring chloroform off-site to the end user; (5) classroom and on-the-job training designed to prepare personnel for safe operation and emergency response situations; (6) preventive maintenance programs which include periodic inspections and integrity testing of storage tanks and associated equipment; (7) complete perimeter fencing to prevent vandalism and unauthorized entry or use of equipment; and (8) a careful review and process hazard assessment that was conducted in preparation for the updating of the site's RMP.  Specific details about these preventive measures are identified and discussed in separate sections of the RMP.

The ICP addresses full compliance with the prevention activities and emergency response procedures from all applicable regulations (i.e., certain applicable sections of the Resource Recovery and Conservation Act (RCRA),  EPA's Oil Pollution Prevention Regulations found in 40 CFR 112, United States Coast Guard (USCG) Facility Response Plan (33 CFR Part 154), Department of Transportation/Research and Special Programs Administration (DOT/RSPA) Facility Response Plan (49 CFR Part 194), Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Emergency Action Plans (29 CFR 1910.138(a), and OSHA Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response (HAZWOPER) regulations found in 29 CFR 1910.120.  \n\n\n\nThe ICP is coordinated with local emergency management agencies in Louisville.  All terminal employees are trained to the OSHA \"Hazardous Material Technician\" level, and the Terminal Manager has received Incident Command training.  In the event of a major spill or release, all terminal employees are trained to exercise proper \"Site Control\" measures and assist in making emergency notifications to local, state, federal, and corporate emergency contacts.  These emergency notifications include: (1) Terminal Manager; (2) State and Local Emergency Response Agencies; (3) Primary Response Contractor (if needed); (4) CITGO Corporate Hotline; (5) EPA's National Response Center (NRC); and (6) CITGO's Regional Environmental and Safety Manager.
