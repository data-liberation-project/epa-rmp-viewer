The actual working capacity is 169,000 pounds, and is administratively controlled through operating procedures and level alarms.  An earthen dike around the tank along with a sump will contain the full contents of the tank and will limit the exposed surface area of a pool of VAM and thus reduce the release rate.  The EPA Offsite Consequence Analysis Guide was used to determine that this release would result in offsite impact.  The worst case release scenario is highly unlikely due to several factors which include a mechanical integrity program to maintain the vessel integrity, operator presence in the field to watch for leaks or spills, and a system to pump any fluid found in the diked area to another vessel.\n\nThe WCS for an RMP listed flammable chemical at the Pasadena facility, as defined by the EPA, is a catastrophic failure of one of the pressure swing adsorption vessel, releasing (3,800 pounds) of gaseous hydrogen which is assumed to form a vapor cloud and ignite resulting in a vapor cloud explosion (VCE). ).  The maximum distance to the EPA-defined end point (1 psi overpressure) for this event reaches no receptors off-site.  Although we have active controls directed at preventing such releases, no credit for active or passive mitigation measures were taken into account in evaluating this WCS.\n\nThe alternate release scenario (ARS) for VAM at our facility is the overpressure of a PVOH polymerization reactor due to a power failure and a subsequent release of VAM vapors from the emergency vent recovery vessel. Based on a three minute release, this scenario could result in the release of 7500 pounds of VAM.  The EPA Offsite Consequence Analysis Guide was used to determine that this type of incident would result in offsite impact if no active or passive mitigation was used.

Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies:\n\nThe PVOH plant must maintain greater than 15,000 pounds of vinyl acetate monomer to safely and efficiently manufacture polyvinyl alcohol.  In the quantities handled by our facility, vinyl acetate monomer is considered to be a toxic liquid by the EPA.  In addition, hydrogen, in the amount handled by the facility, exceeds the threshold quantity set by the EPA for a flammable gas.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local rules and regulations as well as our own environmental, health, and safety standards.  Air Products manages the safety of our facility by designing for safe operation, operating the plant safely, maintaining the plant, and by auditing our operations. \n\nOur accident prevention program is based on OSHA\u0012s Process Safety Management regulation and our emergency response program is based on OSHA\u0012s HAZWOPER regulation including an Advanced  Interior / Exterior Fire Brigade per NFPA 600.

The substances and processes considered during the preparation of this RMP and the scenarios described were selected based on criteria established in the regulation.\n\n2.  The facility and the regulated substances handled:\n\nOur facilities are located on Highway 225 in Pasadena, Texas.  To produce polyvinyl alcohol, vinyl acetate liquid is polymerized in reactors to form polyvinyl acetate.  The polyvinyl acetate is then converted to polyvinyl alcohol as a wet solid material which is processed and dried into a granular or powder-like material.  The product is shipped by railcar and bulk trucks to industrial customers for applications such as coating fibers in the textile industry and making water-based adhesives.  Vinyl acetate monomer is present on site in the storage tank, piping and processing unit to maintain continuous and efficient production of polyvinyl alcohol.  \n\nHydrogen is used by our customers in their manufacturing processes.  To produce gaseous hydrogen, natural gas is received by our plant via pipeline and used as our feedstock.  The feedstock is mixed with steam and sent to the reformer furnace.  In the reformer furnace, the feedstock and steam are heated in the presence of a catalyst, where a chemical reaction takes place that converts the mixture into hydrogen, carbon monoxide, and carbon dioxide.  The carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide are then separated from the hydrogen in adsorbers.  The pure hydrogen is then delivered to the customer via our pipeline.  \n\n3.
