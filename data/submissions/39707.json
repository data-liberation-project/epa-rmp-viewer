      "SummaryText": "Effingham Equity is committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  Our prevention program includes the use of proper equipment, regular inspections and maintenance and training for all employeees that work with the material.  Should an accidental release occur, the facility has oriented the Altamont Volunteer Fire Dept. and the Effingham County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  These steps have been taken to assure a quick response to any release and minimize the impact of the release in our community and environment.\n\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage of anhydrous ammonia for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a crop nutrient.  \n\nThe facility has developed a worst case and alternate scenario, however it has been withheld from this Executive Summary as security sensitive information as request by the EPA.\n\nEffingham Equity complies with all rules and regulations relating to storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia including the Illinois Department of Agriculture regulations as well as OSHA 29 CFR- 1910.111 regarding proper storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia.\n\nEffingham Equity has a written emergency action plan in accordance with OSHA standard 29 CFR- 1910.38.  Emergency Planning and Community Right to Know information is provided to the Illinois Emergency Management Agency, LEPC, and the local fire department as required by SARA Tilte III of EPCRA.  \n\nImproving safety at Effingham Equity is an on-going process.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of equipment, safe practices and operations.  There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
