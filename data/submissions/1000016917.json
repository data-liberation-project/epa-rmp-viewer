Title 40, CFR Part 68, designates that we will deal with the risk involved with the storage, handling, and processing of hazardous chemicals.In being compliant, we promote overall safety for the processing plant, our employees and the surrounding public. These programs enable our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences of significant releases of hazardous materials, as well as minmize the potential of fire, explosion, or other types of catastropic accidents. Overall, these activities prevent accidental fatalities, injuries, and illnesses to employees, and avoid physical property damages.\n\nOur safety programs are applied to activities involving hazardous chemicals including the use, storage, handling, or on-site movement of these chemicals, or the combination of these activities. Any group of vessels which are interconnected, and separate vessels, which contain a hazardous material which could be involved in a potential release shall be considered a single process.\n\nThe safety programs that we have initiated prevent accidents because they focus on rules, procedures, and practices which control the use of processes, activities, and pieces of equipment. The rules are reviewed and improved as needed. They are also communicated to, and accepted by all employees of the facility.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is used as a refrigerant at Case Farms. We use the refrigerant for keeping the plant processing areas at a constant temperature, preserving product, chilling water, and making ice for use in product shipping.\n\nAs a worst case scenario, Case Farms chose a failure of the high pressure receiver containing 11842 pounds of ammonia, which, if released when full, would result in a nine(9) minute release. Under worst case weather conditions, ammonia could travel 1.2 miles before dispersing enough"

That situation is unlikely because worst case weather is uncommon, the vessel is located in a restricted area of the facility, and the vessel has guards in place to protect it from impact: industry standards for the manufacture and quality control of pressure vessels: ammonia is not corrosive in this application: Pressure safety valves limit operating pressures in the vessel; the accident prevention procedures are in place at Case Farms, including the mechanical integrity reviews, inspection and testing, and replacement of equipment when needed. There are also alarms in place to evacuate personnel if the process upsets, and an emergency response plan, with equipment, is in place at this facility.\n\nFor alternate-case release scenarios, Case Farms chose the failure of a transfer hose unloading, resulting in a release of 71 pounds of ammonia over a period of 10 minutes. Under common weather conditions, ammonia could travel 0.11 miles before dispersing enough to no longer pose a hazard to the public. Transfer hose failure was selected because it is a temporary connection and constructed of materials other than steel. This event is unlikely,because the truck has emergency equipment such as an excess flow valve on the tank truck, and safety valves to isolate the transfer hose. Case Farms accident prevention program is in place, including sop's requiring someone present at all times during unloading.There is also an emergency response plan and equipment in place for such emergencies.\n\nCase Farms will comply with a Program 3 Prevention Program. This will help to provide a safer environment for employees and the community, and make the refrigeration systems more efficient.All elements of the prevention program have been implemented.\n\nCase Farms emergency response plan is based on the OSHA requirements for Emergency Action Plans (29CFR 1910.38 nand 1910.119) and HAZWOPER (29 CFR 1910.120). We have trained employees for emergency respo"
