The Facility Plan\n  The owners, management, and employees of Maczuk Industries are committed to the prevention of any\naccidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared\nto work with the local fire company, or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact\nof the release to people and the enviroment.\n2. Facility Information\n  The primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers.\nAndhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed.  The maximum quantity stored would be\n142896 lbs in our 30000 gallon storage tank.\n3. The Worst-case and Alternative Release scenario.\n  A. The worst case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank over\na 10 minute period.  The maximum quantity released would be 142896 pounds which represents the \nvolume of the storage tank at 87 percent capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to\nend point (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 4.4 miles.\n  B.  the alternative release scenario based on the most likely potential accident is a release from a\ntransfer hose.  The distance to endpoint is .3 miles.\n4. The accidental release prevention program.\n  The facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of\nAnhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\" published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc., and the\nstandards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29CFR910.111,\n\"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia.\"\n5. The Five Year History\n  There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that have\ncaused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor to our knowledge, have\nresulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuation, sheltering in place, property damage, or\nenviromental damage.\n6. The Emergency Response Program\n  Maczuk Industries ha"
