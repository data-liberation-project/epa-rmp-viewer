This policy is outlined in the Standard Operations Procedures (SOP's) and the Employee Training Program. Nevertheless, equipment and safety measures are taken to handle an emergency in case one happens.\n\nThe Checkpoint facility in Ponce handles toxic chemicals. Among them there is Chlorine CAS 7782-50-5, Hydrochloric Acid CAS 7647-01-0, Phosphoric Acid CAS 7664-38-2 and Methyl Ethyl Ketone CAS 78-93-3. The Chlorine gas is used in quantities that exceed the limit requiring the preparation of a Risk Management Plan (RMP).\n\nIn general, the Checkpoint Plant plan to prevent accidents includes: dikes with capacity to contain a spill from each and every process tank with chemicals, closed rooms to store flammable liquids and scrubber systems to ventilate equipment and process storage tanks. Specifically, for the Chlorine gas there are two trains of scrubbers with Caustic Soda to neutralize any leaks or ventilate from the process. If there is a leak, the Chlorine gas will be detected by automatic electronic detectors, set point 1 ppm, strategically located in the Plant. The electronic sensors send an alarm to both the Chemical Plant control room and the Security Guard control room. In the case of a fire in the Press Room, where Metil Ethyl Ketone is handled Checkpoint has installed an automatic Carbon Dioxide fire control system. The fire control system is automatically activated by heat sensors.\n\nCheckpoint has not registered an accident that causes a Chlorine leak to the environment in the last 5 years. More than that, the chemical plant started operations in March 1998 and in the history of those 10 years of operation there has been no accident that causes a Chlorine leak to the"
