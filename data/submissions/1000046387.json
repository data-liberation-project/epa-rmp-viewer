Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\nWe at Dow Chemical Pennsauken Site are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.\r\nThis commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers\r\nareas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with\r\nthe processes at our facility. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of\r\nregulated substances.\r\n\r\n2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\r\nOur facility's primary activities encompass manufacturing rigid polyurethane foam board insulation. A blowing agent is required to manufacture the foam board insulation.  The blowing agent used (80% CYCLO / 20% ISOPENTANE BLEND) is regulated material.\r\n    \r\n3. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements\r\nset out under 40 CFR Part 68 of the Environmental Protection Agency. Additionally, the facility was designed\r\nand constructed in accordance with NFPA-58 Standard, 1998 Edition. The following sections briefly describe\r\nthe elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\nDow Chemical Pennsauken Site maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical\r\nhazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis\r\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are\r\nidentified and controlled. The checklist technique is used to complete these analyses. The studies\r\nare undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and\r\nare revalidated at a regul"

These procedures address various modes of operation such as\r\ninitial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations,\r\nnormal shutdown and startup after a turnaround. The information is regularly reviewed and is readily\r\naccessible to operators involved in the processes.\r\n\r\nTraining\r\nDow Chemical Pennsauken Site has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who\r\nare operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.\r\nRefresher training is provided at least every year and more frequently as needed.\r\n\r\nMechanical Integrity\r\nDow Chemical Pennsauken Site carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to\r\nensure proper operations. Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure\r\nvessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and\r\npumps. Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in\r\nmaintenance practices. Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed. Any\r\nequipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\r\n\r\nManagement of Change\r\nWritten procedures are in place at Dow Chemical Pennsauken Site to manage changes in process chemicals,\r\ntechnology, equipment and procedures.  Process operators, maintenance personnel or any\r\nother employee whose job tasks are affected by modifications in process conditions will be promptly notified\r\nof the modification and will be offered the appropriate training.\r\n\r\nPre-startup Reviews\r\nPre-start up"

However, equipment and facility safety\r\ninspections and process hazard analyses (PHA) are completed periodically to ensure that facility safety is not\r\ncompromised. All inspection findings and PHAs are reviewed and addressed in a timely manner.\r\n\r\n4. Five-year Accident History\r\nDow Chemical Pennsauken Site has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last 5\r\nyears.

Emergency Response Plan\r\nThe Dow Chemical Pennsauken Site carries a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental\r\nreleases of hazardous materials. The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first\r\naid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as\r\nwell as post-incident decontamination of affected areas.\r\nTo ensure proper functioning, our emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced.
