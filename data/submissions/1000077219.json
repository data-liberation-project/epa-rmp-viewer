The purpose of the PSSR is to see that safety features, procedures, personnel and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service. This review provides one additional check that construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready. A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\r\n\r\nMechanical Integrity\r\n\r\nThe Wilson Creek Gas Plant has established practices and procedures to maintain process equipment, pressure vessels, piping systems, relief systems, controls, pumps and compressors in a safe operating condition. The basic aspects of this program include: (1) conducting training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting identified deficiencies, (5) applying quality assurance measures. In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process.\r\n\r\nMaintenance personnel receive training on (1) an overview of the process, (2) safety and health hazards, (3) applicable maintenance procedures, (4) emergency response plans, and (5) applicable safe work practices to help ensure that they can perform their jobs in a safe manner. Written procedures provide that work is performed in a consistent manner and serve as basis for training.

This may require that a management of change team review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary.\r\n\r\nAn integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance. The Wilson Creek Gas Plant incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs. This helps determine that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.\r\n\r\nSafe Work Practices\r\n\r\nThe Wilson Creek Gas Plant has safe work practices in place to help provide worker and process safety. Examples of these include (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) an Isolation of Hazardous Energy (IHE) or lockout/tagout procedure to isolate energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous substances before process piping or equipment is opened, (4) a permit and procedure to control spark-producing activities (i.e., hot work), and (5) a permit and procedure to verify that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space. These procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help perform operations and maintenance activities safely.\r\n\r\nManagement of Change\r\n\r\nThe Wilson Creek Gas Plant has a comprehensive system to manage changes to all covered processes. This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented. Changes are reviewed to (1) determine that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.

The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident. The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to facility management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings. Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years so that the reports can be reviewed during future PHAs and PHA revalidation.\r\n\r\nCompliance Audits\r\n\r\nTo help determine that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, the Wilson Creek Gas Plant periodically conducts an audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented. Compliance audits are conducted at least every 3 years. Both hourly and staff personnel participate in these audits. The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to facility management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until they are complete.

This commitment is demonstrated by our efforts in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, facility trained personnel will evaluate the situation, take actions within the capabilities of the facility, and/or notify the necessary outside agencies\r\n  \r\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES:\t \r\n\r\nThe Wilson Creek Gas Plant is located in Rio Blanco County, Colorado, operates a process to produce a petroleum product called NGL from natural gas.  The Wilson Creek Gas Plant NGL storage site has regulated flammables, including propane, butane and pentane. H2S is also present in the inlet gas but at concentrations below 1%.  \r\n\r\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM: \r\n\r\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the Wilson Creek Gas Plant.

These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information. \r\n\r\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response exposure treatment considerations, is provided in Safety Data Sheets (SDSs). For specific process areas, the facility has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) in the Operating Procedures. The facility maintains the process within these limits by using process controls and monitoring instruments, trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems). \r\n\r\nThe facility also maintains files that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment. This information includes: material of construction, design and construction of process equipment. This information, in combination with procedures and equipment operating history, provides a basis for inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes so safety features in the process are not compromised. \r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\r\n\r\nThe Wilson Creek Gas Plant has a comprehensive program to identify and control hazards associated with the various processes.

Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team. The approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed.

New employees receive basic training in process operations if they are not already familiar with such operations. After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with an experienced operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks. After operators demonstrate adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently. In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level. This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years, or more frequently upon request. All of this training is documented for each operator via documentation kept at the facility and in CMS (Competency Management System).\r\n\r\nContractors\r\n\r\nThe Wilson Creek Gas Plant uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities. Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the facility has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform facility personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.
