Policy\n\n     The management and employees of Wiggins Coop Inc., Wiggins facility are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accident would occur, the Wiggins Coop, is working to put in place a memorandum of understanding with the local fire department, on responding to and mitigate any release, thus minimizing the impact of a release to the community and the environment.\n\n2.  Facility Information.\n\n     The primary activity at this site is storage for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is recieved, stored and distributed.  The maximum quantity handled would be 168,235 pounds in  two storage vessels of 18000 and 30,000 gallons each. The maximum quantity handled would be the unloading of a rail car holding 157000 pounds.\n\n3.  The Worst Case Scenerio and the Alternate Release Scenerio.\n\n     The worst case release scenerio would be the release of the total contents of a storage vessel released as a gas over 10 minutes. The maximum quantity release would be the 168,235 pounds, which represents the volume of the storage vessels at 85% capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the endpoint { point of dispersion to 200 ppm } is 1.25 miles.\n\n    The alternate release scenerio is based on the five-year accident history {or the likely potential incident} is a release from a break in a transfer hose.  The distance to the endpoint {point of dispersion to 200 ppm} is .56 miles.\n\n4.  The Accidental Release Prevention Program.\n\n     The Wiggins Coop Inc.,  has implemented the provisions of Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handeling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K61.1, published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc., and the standards of the U.S. Department of Labor, Ocupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CRF 1910.111,  Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia.\n\n5.  The Five-Year Accident History.\n\n     There has been no"

The Emergence Response Program.\n\n     The Wiggins Coop Inc., Wiggins facility has a written emergency action plan in accordance with OSHA's standard {29 CRF 1910.38.}  The Wiggins Coop Inc. has provided the Colorado Emergency Planning Commission and the Morgan County local emergency planning committe the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III {EPCRA}.  The Wiggins Coop Inc., has a written emergency response program, in accordance with OSHS's standard {29 CFR 1910.120}, including a memorandum of understanding with the Wiggins Fire Department for response to our facility.  Additionally, the Wiggins Coop Inc., has trained our employees in accordance with OSHA's Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response.\n\n7.  Planned Changes To Improve Safety.\n\n     Safety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations {at least annually} will be preformed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
