      "SummaryText": "The Pole Bridge Advanced Wastewater Treatment (AWT) Facility has prepared and implemented a Risk Management Program in accordance with the Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions of 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 68 to prevent the accidental release of chlorine and exposure to Pole Bridge personnel and members of the community, as well as to the environment.  This Risk Management Plan (RMP) encompasses all the elements of the Risk Management Program.\nThe Pole Bridge AWT Facility is located on the South River in the southeastern portion of DeKalb County, on Flat Bridge Road.  Chlorine is used to disinfect wastewater prior to discharge to the South River.  A chlorinated water solution is pumped from the chlorinator room to the contact chamber, where it enters the wastewater system to provide disinfection.  The facility uses approximately an average of 144 pounds per day (lbs/day) of chlorine and stores a maximum of 28,000 lbs of chlorine on-site.  Chlorine at the facility is stored in 1-ton (2,000 lb) containers.  \nChlorine containers are stored on a standby/on-line basis so that the chlorination process is continuous.  The chlorination process is continuously monitored for chlorine gas leaks and is equipped with an audible and visible alarm to alert personnel in the event of a release.  Pole Bridge AWT Facility personnel are routinely trained to safely operate the chlorination system.  The Pole Bridge AWT Facility preventive maintenance program ensures that equipment related to chlorine operations is maintained as fully operational.  Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at the Pole Bridge AWT Facility emphasize safety, training, and maintenance.\nThe Pole Bridge AWT Facility has developed an accidental release prevention program.  The primary safeguard is the chlorine leak detection system located at the chlorine building.  The leak detection sensors are manually checked on a monthly basis to ensure they are functioning properly.  O"

      "SummaryText": "perators inspect the facility every two hours to ensure the chlorine feed system is also functioning properly.  Audible and visible alarms will activate at the chlorine dock and control room, located at the main building, when the chlorine leak detection system detects an ambient air chlorine concentration of 1 part per million (ppm) or greater in the chlorinator room, or 5 ppm at the chlorine dock.\nThe Pole Bridge AWT Facility has established several programs to prevent accidental chlorine releases.  Specifically, the facility trains operators to properly operate the chlorination process, uses state-of-the-art safety equipment, and implements a preventive maintenance program to ensure the process equipment is operating properly.\nA review of the hazards associated with the Pole Bridge AWT Facility chlorination process was conducted.  Results of the review and recommendations identified during the hazard review process that would improve safety at the facility are documented in the Hazard Review Checklist Analysis. \nThe Pole Bridge AWT Facility personnel are trained to respond to an incidental release of chlorine.  In the event that a release is beyond the control of the operators, personnel have a mechanism established to notify the DeKalb County Fire Services Hazardous Materials (Haz Mat) Team emergency responders.  Safety equipment available on-site includes Self-Contained Breathing Apparatus (SCBA) and ton container emergency repair kits (`B? Kits)."
