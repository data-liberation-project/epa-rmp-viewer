      "SummaryText": "NOVVI produces renewable biodegradable base oils and lubricants. Chemicals are brought into the facility via tank truck, ISO container or pipeline and transferred to the process. Plant based feedstock is reacted in vessels to produce the desired crude base oils. The crude base oils are moved to other facilities for further processing.\n\n               \n\nThe proprietary process utilizes Boron Trifluoride (BF3). The BF3 is brought and stored onsite in tube trailers. The site may have up to 22,500 pounds of BF3 in combined storage and process. The site employs an active mitigation system that includes a BF3 sensor installed at the site of the tube trailer.  The sensor activates an automated control valve for line closure and a deluge system (fire monitor for exclusive use on BF3 releases) is manually targeted at any leak on the tube trailer or BF3 piping system.   In addition, a BF3 vent scrubber system is installed to neutralize emergency releases from the process.\n\n"
