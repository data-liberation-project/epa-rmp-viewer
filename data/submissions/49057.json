The Ormesa Geothermal Projects are near the Cities of El Centro and Holtville, California within the East Mesa Known Geothermal Resource Area (KGRA) and generate electricity from renewable geothermal resources in an environmentally friendly manner.  The North America Industrial Classification System code for the Ormesa facility is 221119.  Ormat operates the Ormesa Geothermal Projects in accordance with all applicable federal, state, and local environmental and safety regulations and is committed to maintaining compliance with these regulations.  The Ormesa Geothermal Projects have emergency response procedures and protocols in place at the facility in coordination with local emergency response agencies.\nThe facility consists of five independent geothermal power plants, and associated geothermal wells, known as the Ormesa Geothermal Projects, comprising of four binary geothermal power plants designated as Ormesa Geothermal I (OGI), Ormesa Geothermal IE (OGIE), Ormesa Geothermal II (OGII), Ormesa Geothermal IH (OGIH), and a Dual Flash Geothermal Power plant designated as GEM 2&3 (GEM 2&3 power plants are operated as one combined power plant).  As a dual flash power plant, the GEM 2&3 facility does not use isopentane or chlorine or meet the requirements of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) or the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).  Recent changes to the Ormesa Geothermal Projects include a newly constructed GEM Bottoming Unit Project (a binary system), which has been added to the existing dual flash GEM 2&3 power plant.  The GEM Bottoming Unit uses isopentane in a binary system similar to that of the other Ormesa Projects, and therefore has been included in the Combined Plan.  All five power plants use isopentane, which is listed by OSHA and EPA as a flammable material.  The OGI, OGIE, OGII, and OGIH facilities also use chlorine, an "

As such, these facilities are subject to applicable regulations and requirements.  Since Ormesa Geothermal IE and IH are in remote locations and are not regularly manned, these facilities are essentially exempt from the PSM regulations.  Because the processes at these units are functionally identical, however, this combined plan is applicable to all five facilities.  \nIn addition, the Ormesa Geothermal II facility has been updated and now includes two (2) Thermodynamic Cycle, Integrated Two Level Unit Ormat Energy Converters, referred to as ITLU-OECs.  The new 5th generation ITLU-OECs have replaced all of the 20 Level I and Level II Ormat Energy Converters at the Ormesa Geothermal II power plant and will increase the electrical power generation of Ormesa Geothermal II from a nominal 19.95 megawatts to 23.5 megawatts.  \nThis document represents a 3-year review of the previous Combined Plan information for Ormesa based on the latest EPA Risk Management Plan (RMP) regulations adopted on April 9, 2004 and OSHA PSM regulations, and includes the recent changes to Ormesa Geothermal II and the addition of the bottoming unit (a binary plant) to the GEM 2&3 facility.   \nEach of the five separate facilities are covered by the PSM and RMP regulations, which requires proactive identification, evaluation and mitigation or prevention of chemical releases that could occur as a result of failures in processes, procedures, or equipment.  The PSM/RMP regulations also define the responsibilities of employers and contractors involved in work that affects or takes place near processes covered by the regulations to ensure the safety of both plant and contractor employees and the potential effects on public receptors (RMP only).\nThe primary chemicals used at each facility that are covered by PSM/RMP regulations are isopentane and ch"

      "SummaryText": "lorine gas.  In the binary process of electrical generation, isopentane is used as the motive fluid in the generation of electricity from natural geothermal fluid in a series of interconnected Ormat Energy Converters at each facility.  Geothermal fluid is used to heat isopentane liquid to vapor in the Ormat Energy Converters, which in turn is used as the motive fluid to spin a turbine connected to a generator to produce electricity.  The isopentane vapor is then condensed and reused in a continuous, closed loop process within each Ormat Energy Converters that does not involve any chemical reactions or changes to the isopentane. At each facility, isopentane is also stored in one or more storage tanks.\nChlorine gas is used in the water treatment system to inhibit bacterial growth in the cooling towers at all of the Ormesa Projects, except at the GEM 2&3 plant where a 12.5 percent solution of sodium hypochlorite (bleach) is used to control bacterial growth.  Chlorine gas is stored in one or more one-ton cylinders, located adjacent to the cooling towers.  The water in the cooling towers is used to condense the isopentane vapor into liquid phase during the generation of electricity.  Makeup water for the cooling tower is obtained from a nearby irrigation canal.  \nAn integral part of the PSM/RMP is the completion of a hazards and operability study of the facility's flammable and toxic materials.  The study was conducted by a Process Hazard Analysis/Hazards and Operability Study (PHA/HAZOP) team composed of Ormesa personnel with detailed knowledge of the process(es) and consulting members retained for the completion of this document.  The objective of the study was to identify potential hazards and their causes, consequences and appropriate responses or actions to mitigate the identified hazards.  A relative risk ranking was used to assign a hazard to each identified segment or ?node? of a given process based on experience frequency and the consequence category of the haza"

      "SummaryText": "rd.  The performance of this study and relative risk ranking meets the requirement for a process hazard analysis.  A supplemental \"What If\" analysis was also performed to evaluate other circumstances or outside influences beyond the control of the system operators and maintenance workers.  These outside influences were evaluated by the PHA/HAZOP team and possible consequences were discussed.  For each of the consequences, a mitigating action was presented and/or developed to address such occurrences.\nThe previously established HAZOP segment nodes for the Ormesa Processes were evaluated, changed or eliminated as necessary to reflect the current Ormesa processes as of March 2007.  Of the 84 potential hazards identified during this update, 66 were ranked at Risk Level 4 (acceptable as is), 16 at Risk Level 3 (acceptable with controls) and 2 at Risk Level 2 (undesirable).  None of the potential hazards identified were assigned a Risk Level 1 (unacceptable).  The two that were assigned a Risk Level 2 were related to a decreased efficiency of the pneumatic diaphragm pump due to high ambient temperatures and vapor lock in the pump. All of these potential hazards are avoidable and are addressed in either the safe operating procedures or standard operating procedures manuals maintained at the Ormesa Projects administrative offices and the GEM control room.  \nOrmesa has complied with the PSM/RMP requirements and is committed to reviewing and updating the program periodically as appropriate and maintaining compliance with regulatory requirements.  This PSM/RMP has been updated to comply with all applicable regulations and is accessible to all interested persons at all times.  Ormat has been proactive in developing and implementing the PSM/RMP for the Ormesa Geothermal Projects, not only to comply with state and federal requirements but also as a commitment to a safe workplace as a top priority."
