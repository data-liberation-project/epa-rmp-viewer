All these activities are monitored to ensure they remain current.\n\nFive-year Accident History\nThere have been no RMP reportable accidents on this facility to date.\n\nPlanned Changes To Improve Safety\nMaking our processes safer is an on-going program at the Nevada site. Employee suggestions, capital improvements, audit programs, and various other activities help to ensure that we provide safe, reliable processes. Other programs aimed at improving process safety and our emergency response planning include:\n- Recommendations developed during cyclic process hazards analyses that reduce the risks associated with our processes.\n- Providing additional process safety training to technical personnel in topics such as chemical reactivity, layer of protection analysis, and safety instrumented systems risk analysis.\n- Expanding periodic process safety metrics reporting to management."

The Verbio Nevada, LLC (Verbio) Biorefinery in Nevada, Iowa has been modified in two phases from the Nevada Cellulosic Ethanol Facility originally located at the plant site. Phase 1 (or the \u201cstraw plant\u201d) uses crop-residue to produce biomethane and humus. Phase 1 includes straw pretreatment, fermentation, biogas cleaning, solids separation, digestate treatment, and ancillary support operations. Phase 2 (or the \u201ccorn plant\u201d) is a dry mill corn ethanol plant. Phase 2 includes corn receiving and handling, a fermentation process, distillation, and evaporation processes (producing 200-proof ethanol, syrup, and corn oil), two biogas cleaning lines to produce biomethane, and ancillary support operations. The site uses the following EPA regulated RMP chemicals at levels above their process threshold quantities:\nToxics \u2013 None              Flammables \u2013 Methane, Isopentane, Pentane\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nThe Nevada site manufacturing areas follow the requirements set out in the VEAP (Verbio North America Emergency Action Plan) and OSHA Process Safety Management.
