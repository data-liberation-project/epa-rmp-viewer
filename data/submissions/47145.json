(SUGS) is a publicly held company that has been in \r\nthe gas processing business for more than 50 years.  SUGS operates natural gas \r\nprocessing plants in West Texas and Southeast New Mexico.  The Keystone gas \r\nplant has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety.  This \r\ncommitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, \r\nsuch as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, \r\noperation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement \r\nreasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  \r\nHowever, if a release does occur, trained gas plant personnel will respond to \r\ncontrol and contain the release.  \r\n\r\nThis facility gathers field natural gas for processing.  The facility and system \r\nof pipelines is jurisdictional to the Environmental Protection Agency, Texas \r\nNatural Resources Conservation Commission, Texas Railroad Commission, the \r\nOccupational Safety and Health Administration, and the United States Department \r\nof Transportation.  This facility is covered by OSHA PSM standard.  These agencies\r\nconduct periodic facility inspections and report findings to SUGS management.\r\n\r\nThe Keystone Plant has an excellent record of accident prevention.  Over the past\r\n5 years there have been no incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have\r\nresulted in, a fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental\r\nloss, or personal injury at this facility.\r\n\r\nThe Keystone gas plant is located northeast of Kermit, in Winkler County, Texas.  \r\nThe plant operates a variety of processes to separate raw natural gas into \r\nmethane gas and natural gas liquid (NGL) product \"Product\", with black gasoline\r\nand scrubber oil (compression liquids) as by-products.\r\n\r\nSeveral regulated flammables occur as various mixtures in the natural gas stream"

These mixtures meet the NFPA 4 flammability criteria, and \r\nthe mixtures are present in amounts above the threshold quantity.  Propylene and \r\nmethyl alcohol, also regulated flammables, are purchased for use in the \r\nrefrigeration of the gas stream for processing, and for de-icing as needed of \r\ninternal components during processing, respectively.\r\n\r\nTwo regulated toxics are present: the plant purchases chlorine gas for use at \r\nits cooling towers, and hydrogen sulfide gas occurs in, and is removed from, the \r\nraw natural gas.  The quantity on hand of each of these toxics is less than the \r\nthreshold quantity, so they are not covered processes under the RMP.  However, \r\nboth of these toxics are addressed in our existing emergency action plan.  In \r\naddition, the hydrogen sulfide gas is covered under Texas Statewide Rule 36, \r\nthat deals with the protection of the general public. This facility does not \r\nhave a threshold planning quantity of any toxic; therefore, a worst-case \r\nscenario (WCS) for a toxic release was not evaluated.  \r\n\r\nCovered processes involving regulated flammable substances are all Program Level \r\n1.  There are no public or environmental receptors within any endpoint.  \r\nAlthough Program Level 1 limits scenarios to overpressure resulting from a VCE \r\ninvolving the entire vessel contents, it should be noted that the farthest \r\noverpressure endpoint of 0.60 mile is unrealistically high, in that this is an \r\natmospheric storage vessel with hydrocarbon liquid at ambient temperature.  A \r\nrealistic scenario would be a pool fire for the contents of this vessel, which \r\nwould yield an endpoint of 0.39 mile rather that the 0.60 mile, which results \r\nfrom a VCE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Keystone gas plant maintains a written emergency action program, which is in \r\nplace to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment.
