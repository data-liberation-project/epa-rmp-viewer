      "SummaryText": "The ONEOK North System, L.L.C Morris Storage Facility is primarily a liquified petroleum gas pipeline breakout storage facility and a propane truck loading terminal.  The facility receives ethane, propane and butane by pipeline; stores them in an underground rock cavern and above ground storage tanks; transports them from the facility by pipeline and some of the products are sent out via the truck loading rack.\n\nThe facilities cavern capacity is 4,200,000 gallons.  The truck loading has a storage of  2,000 gallons (14,000 pounds) of ethyl mercaptan storage capacity.  The ethyl mercaptan is an odorant that is injected into the propane during truck loading for safety requirements.\n\nProcess controls are in place at the facility to prevent or minimize an emergency release which include automatic and manual shutoffs, alarms, vents, relief and check valves, excess flow devices and grounding equipment.  In addition the facility has UV/IR fire detection \"eyes\" process area detectors.\n\nThe worst case scenario (WCS) for the facility is a release from the LPG mixed cavern due to aboveground piping failure that results in a vapor cloud expolsion.  The estimated amount of propane released in the WCS is 420,000 gallons (1,200,000 pounds).  Under EPA requirements the WCS assumes weather conditions that allow the chemical to travel as far as possible and further assumes that none of the facilitiy's mechanical controls or safety systems are functioning.  Based on these assumptions, the WCS could potentially affect nearby public receptors.  The process controls mentioned in the previous paragraph minimize the potential for the worst case scenario to occur.\n\nThe facility complises with Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) regulations, including the process safety management (PSM) requirements.  Facility personnel undergo operations competency training and testing including emergency response training drills.  Agencies also receive SARA Tier II Chemical Inventory repo"
