Specifically, each process consists of two, Integrated Two Level Unit (ITLU) air-cooled Ormat Energy Converter (OEC) units and one, level 3 air-cooled OEC.  Each OEC incorporates one double ended shaft generator driven by two 1800 RPM direct coupled special organic fluid turbines, and associated facilities. Geothermal brine is supplied from five production wells per process.  Spent geothermal fluid will be injected back into the subsurface reservoir via three injection wells per process.\r\n\r\nMcGinness Hills is operated by Ormat's Eastern Nevada Operations Group (ENOP).  The organization is comprised of management, administration, maintenance, engineering and operations personnel. ENOP operates four eastern Nevada power generation facilities owned by Ormat.\r\n\r\nAll the Eastern Nevada power plants operate continuously, 24 hours per day and 365 days per year (excluding scheduled maintenance downtime or plant upsets).   The McGinness Hills complex is staffed 24 hours per day and 365 days per year.  The remaining Eastern Nevada power plants are operated remotely from a central control room located at MGH1; however, personnel are always on site during the day shift at these locations.\r\n\r\nRegulated Substance Handled\r\nMcGinness Hills stores n-pentane (CAS # 109-66-0) as the motive fluid used in the OEC units. In addition to the inventory present in the OECs, the plant has n-pentane storage tanks.  The tanks provide evacuation capacity that is necessary to facilitate removal of n-pentane from an OEC for maintenance activities. At MGH1, two tanks will have a nominal capacity of 30,000 gallons each (maximum fill capacity of 27,000 gallons) and one will have a nominal capacity of 12,000 gallons (maximum fill capacity of 10,800 gallons).  MGH2 has two, 36,000 gallon capacity tanks.  During normal operation, the tanks are essentially empty.  The registered quantities of n-pentane for each process include the quantity charged to each OEC plus a nominal"

However, in conformance with Office of Emergency Management guidance, the OCA for worst-case and/or alternative release scenario(s) has not been included in this Executive Summary because of security concerns.\r\n\r\nAccident Prevention Program\r\nGiven the lack of proximity to offsite receptors and lack of accidents, McGinness Hills is registered as a program level 1 stationary source.  Notwithstanding the program level, Ormat maintains a complete accident prevention program as specified for a program level 3 facility, at all plants.\r\n\r\nSafe Work Practices: Safe work practices have been developed and implemented to provide for the control of hazards during work activities such as lock out/tag-out, confined space entry, opening process equipment or piping, and control over entrance into a facility by maintenance, contractor, laboratory or other support personnel. These safe work practices apply to both employees and contractors.\r\n\r\nMaintenance Procedures: A Mechanical Integrity Program (MIP) has been initiated at the McGinness Hills\r\nfacility. The MIP adopted a maintenance concept for periodic preventative and corrective maintenance of the OEC system at McGinness Hills. The preventative maintenance tasks include visual inspection, lubrication of rotating parts, system cleaning, replacing liquids and filters, and periodic tests to verify that the system is in proper operating condition. Preventative maintenance tasks and procedures are scheduled to be undertaken over a series of maintenance intervals.  Alarm system maintenance is determined using a combination of regulatory requirements, manufacturer's recommendations, plant operating experience and best practices. \r\n\r\nTraining: Initial training for personnel is given before that employee is allowed to either handle n-pentane,\r\noperate or work o"

The EAP procedures apply to all personnel working at the McGinness Hills facility. The EAP has been submitted to the local fire department and LEPC for review and their concurrence when changes are made to the plan. \r\n\r\nImplementation, Control and Compliance: The Plant Manager has overall responsibility for the development and implementation of the Emergency Action Plan. The Emergency Action Plan is reviewed annually to verify regulatory compliance and accuracy with both OSHA Regulations on Emergency Plans 29CFR1910.38 and CAPP's Emergency Response Programs, NAC 459.9544.

The PLC receives all discrete (logic) and analog signals from the input devices (e.g. switches and measuring sensors), processes the signals according to pre-loaded Ormat software, and then outputs logic and analog command signals to local and field devices. All parameters needed for proper operation of the OEC units, such as pressure, temperature, voltage, current, power, speed, etc. are measured by the proper measuring instruments. Deviation from the operating parameters will immediately be detected by the PLC and the PLC will initiate correction or automatic shutdown of the related OEC unit. Under normal circumstances, no releases or other dangerous situations are expected to result from these automatic actions. Appropriate manual override is provided.\r\n\r\nRelief system design: Relief valves are located on the n-pentane storage tanks and on the OEC vaporizers and condensers.
