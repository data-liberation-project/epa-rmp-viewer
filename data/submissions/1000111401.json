This is done by stating the policies and procedures for the management of process hazards in design, construction, start-up, operation, inspection, maintenance, employee training, and emergency response.\n\nKey to the success of these programs is the active involvement and participation of the employees in the completion of the process hazard analyses. The facility\u2019s commitment to the use of the latest process hazard analysis techniques, detailed and accurate procedures and regular employee training, ensures that each critical safety component of chemical processing operations is reviewed in detail.\n\nFive Year Accident History:\nThe facility had no accidental releases from the regulated process within the last five years that meet the five-year accident history criteria.\n\nEmergency Response Program:\nThe overall emergency response program for the facility is coordinated with the local fire department and Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC). Employees are trained to evacuate their respective areas in accordance with OSHA 1930.38(a). The facility has capability to communicate with appropriate organizations in the event of an emergency. This provides a means for notifying of an incident and facilitating quick response. \n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:\nThe facility plans to implement safety improvements driven by the most recent PHA and compliance audit. These changes include additional instrumentation, improvements in mechanical integrity procedures, revisions to the emergency response plan, and additional employee training."

Ethylene is being used in the manufacture of an ethylene/maleic anhydride (EMA) co-polymer product that is used in the glass fiber industry. The ethylene is stored under pressure in two (2) transport tube trailers, each capable of holding approximately 14,000 pounds of ethylene. The ethylene is connected directly from the transport trailer to the manufacturing operation through a piping manifold located in the EMA facility.\n\nAurorium Zeeland also has covered on-site storage of piperidine, which is repackaged into drums and reuseable containers for shipment to customers without any addition, mixing, or reaction operations. Piperidine is stored in an atmospheric tank, capable of holding approximately 88,000 pounds. The tank is connected by a dedicated transfer line to the repackaging station. Finished piperidine for the repackaging process is delivered via tanker truck.\nPiperidine is also used in an uncovered quantity in a separate manufacturing process at the facility, where it is charged directly from portable containers such as drums.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program:\nAs part of the compliance effort with OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard (29 CFR 1910.119) and Michigan's Department of Labor (R325.18302) regulations, the Zeeland facility has completed detailed reviews of critical plant operations in order to assess their inherent safety readiness.
