      "SummaryText": "This report is to summarize the Risk Management Plan of Happy Ice LLC, Fairport New York.  The facility has one process requiring a level 3 Risk Management Plan (RMP).  That process is the manufacture and storage of Packaged Ice using an ammonia refrigeration system.  Ammonia is the regulated substance and there are approximately 22,000 lbs. used in the process.The Process Safety Management system required by OSHA was used for the RMP where appropriate.  The facility contains approximately 77,000 square feet of refrigerated space, most of which is used for warehousing.\n\nHappy Ice recognizes its' responsibility to minimize risk to the public.  It limits access to the process to only well trained employees and contractors that are recognized as experts in working with ammonia systems.  Risk reduction is considered in every decision.  Regular inspections are conducted to insure that components are updated and everything possible is being done to operate with the minimum quantity of hazardous substances.\n\nHappy Ice is a Non-Responding Facility, meaning it has an Emergency Action Plan, but relies on th Fairport Fire Department and The Monroe Couny Hazmat Team to be the Emergency Responders.  Happy Ice concentrates on having qualified personnel and documentation available to assist the Hazmat team in the event of an emergency.  Happy Ice has participated in drills with the local fire departments and Monroe County Hazmat Team and supports efforts to train their personnel.\n\nThere have been no reportable accidents in the past five years.\n\nPlanned for the next year is a reduction in ammonia required to operate the system by removal of large evaporators in two warehouse rooms and improving the emergency shutdown procedure to reduce the response time."
