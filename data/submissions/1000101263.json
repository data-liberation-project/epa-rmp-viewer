In the event of an off-site release, County Emergency Management will provide for warning and evacuation / shelter-in-place for the general public.\r\n\r\nVI. Planned Changes \r\n\r\n We evaluate new and emerging technology within the ammonia refrigeration industry and how it would apply to our specific ammonia refrigeration system to ensure the continued safety of our employees and the surrounding community. Additionally, throughout the implementation of our PSM/RMP program, we are always looking for continuous improvement opportunities to improve safety."

The ammonia is contained in a closed loop system; it is designed to remain inside the piping and vessels in our facility. We believe that ammonia provides the safest and most efficient cooling choice for our operation; however, because of its moderate toxicity and slight flammability, ammonia is considered a hazardous material.\r\n\r\n Ammonia is the only substance covered by the Accidental Release Prevention Regulations handled at this facility.\r\n\r\nIII. General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical A\u00bf Specific Prevention Steps:\r\n \r\n We take many precautions to prevent or minimize accidental releases of ammonia from the refrigeration system. These precautions include safety controls (alarms and automatic shutdown devices) which are designed to identify and prevent potentially unsafe conditions like pressure increases that could cause a system failure. We also have a preventive maintenance program designed to maintain the on-going integrity of the systems, a training program designed to ensure that the systems are operated by qualified personnel, and emergency action procedures that enable trained personnel to respond quickly to system upsets.\r\n\r\n We are committed to maintaining a safe manufacturing operation for our employees and the surrounding community. Our refrigeration system obeys our local building and fire codes, as well as industry consensus codes and standards where appropriate. In accordance with the Federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration (29CFR1910.119) and Environmental Protection Agency (40CFR68) our priority is to prevent accidental releases of hazardous materials instead of merely responding to problems.  \r\n\r\nIV.

The facility is located at 1401 West Farmers Avenue, Amarillo, Texas 79120.  The SIC code for the operation is 4222; the NAICS code is 49312.  The facility has approximately 1057 full time employees.  The facility typically operates 24 hours per day, 7 days per week, 52 weeks per year.  Staffing is greater during normal business hours due to the presence of management and administrative personnel.\r\n\r\nI. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:\r\n\r\nThe facility has developed and implemented a Process Safety Management Program (PSM) in accordance with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Standard, 29 CFR 1910.119 and the Environmental Protection AgencyA\u00bfs Risk Management Program 40 CFR 68 as their accidental release prevention program.  The system is continuously monitored by a control system that monitors temperatures, pressures, ammonia detection.  A computer station is located in the refrigeration manager office.  The system is monitored and checked by technicians that are trained, qualified, and experienced in ammonia refrigeration in accordance with the facilityA\u00bfs PSM program.  The system is visually inspected twice a day for proper operation.  System parameters are logged, as are routine maintenance activities.  Safe operation of the system will be accomplished by utilizing general good operating procedures and providing appropriate training to employees.\r\n\r\nThis facility has developed and implemented a written Emergency Action Plan as defined in \r\n29 CFR 1910.38 as their emergency response program.  Emergency evacuation drills are conducted on a periodic basis to ensure personnel quickly and safely evacuate the plant. This facility will utilize outside agencies and/or organizations to perform emergency response measures in the event of a fire, explosion or hazardous material release.\r\n\r\nII. Description of the"
