In order to prevent this possibility we have implemented a safety and security program in where we training our personnel in froklift operation, Hazardous Materials Handling and Warehouse safety.In order to address this issue we have prepared the following procedure:                                      PREVENTION, PREPAREDNESS, CONTINGENCY AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN\nFOR THE WAREHOUSE FACILITIES OF OCHOA INDUSTRIAL SALES CORP.\n\n1.0 Introduction\n\nThe information contained in this plan has been prepared in accordance with the requirements for a Prevention Preparedness and Contingency Plan as set forth in 40 CFR Parts 265.50 through 265.56, as well as any applicable Commonwealth of Puerto Rico laws, rules and regulations. Also, elements of Emergency Response Plans (in accordance to EPCRA requirements), and of Risk Management Plans (40 CFR 63) have been incorporated. The contents of this plan have been expanded to cover not only hazardous wastes but also hazardous materials present at the owner's facility.\n\nThis document constitutes the first revision to the Contingency Plan dated June 17, 2003 and has been prepared for the Ochoa Industrial Sales Corp. facilities located at West Gate Industrial Park, Road 869, Km.0.3,  Bo.

If spilled materials are flammable, the Emergency Response Team will mobilize with foam equipment and hoses.

When any spill occurs, only those persons involved in overseeing or performing emergency operations will be allowed within the designated hazard area.

These are only general guidelines and actual circumstances may dictate that certain alterations be made to these procedures:\n\ni)    If a leak develops or a spill occurs, the person discovering the discharge will immediately contact the Emergency Coordinator. The Emergency Coordinator will obtain the following information:\na)    Person(s) injured, if any, and seriousness of injuries.\nb)    Location of the spill or leak, material involved, and source.\nc)    The approximate amount spilled, an estimate of the liquid and/or gas discharge rate, and the direction the liquid flow or gaseous cloud is moving.\nd)    Whether or not a fire is involved.\n\nNext, the Emergency Coordinator will:\n\na)    Initiate evacuation of the hazard area.\nb)    Initially isolate least 100 ft. in all directions and keep all persons upwind of spill.\nc)    Obtain medical attention for any injured persons. It may be helpful to instruct the caller in initial first aid procedures. Then call the local hospitals.\nd)    Call the local fire department if a fire is involved that cannot be extinguished by facility personnel. Fight small fires with dry chemicals, C02 or foam, and large fires with water jetspray, fog, or foam. Keep heat exposed containers cooled with water spray and remove them from the fire if possible. If a rising sound comes from a venting device or container begins to discolor, withdraw immediately from the area.\ne)    Dispatch emergency personnel to the site t"
