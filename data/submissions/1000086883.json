We at Sanderson Farms, Inc. are strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety.  This \n\n        commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such \n\n        as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the \n\n        processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of \n\n        regulated substances.\n\n\n\n2.    Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\n       ?    Our facility's primary activities encompass Poultry Processing.  We have one regulated substance present at \n\n        our facility.  This substance is Ammonia (anhydrous).  Ammonia (anhydrous) is used as a refrigerant.\n\n\n\n3.    General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps \n\n       ?    Our facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements \n\n        set out under 40 CFR Part 68 of EPA.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-58 \n\n        Standard, 1998 Edition.
