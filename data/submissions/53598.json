As part of this commitment, the company has established a system to help ensure the safe operation of the chemical processes at this facility. One component of this system is a Risk Management Program (RMP) that helps manage the chemical process risks at the Palatka Mill and addresses compliance with the requirements of the United States Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) Regulation 40 CFR Part 68, ?Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions?. One of the requirements of the Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions is to submit a Risk Management Plan (RMP) describing the Risk Management Program at our Palatka Mill. This document is intended to provide the public with a description of the Risk Management Program in use at the Georgia-Pacific Palatka Mill.\n\nThe Risk Management Program at the Palatka Mill consists of three core elements:\n\nI. Hazard assessments which serve to help us understand the potential off-site consequences of hypothetical accidental releases.\n\nII. Prevention programs which serve to help maintain and safely operate the process which contains more than the threshold quantity of chlorine dioxide. \n\nIII. Emergency response program which serves to help respond to accidental releases of chlorine dioxide from the covered process. \n\nAlthough the Risk Management Program at The Palatka Mill helps provide assurance that our mill is maintained and operated in a safe manner, it is only one component of the overall safety program. The Palatka Mill has a comprehensive safety program in place establishing many levels of safeguards that are designed to minimize the potential for the release of any hazardous substances. \n\nWhen hazardous substances are used at the mill, the equipment is carefully designed, built, and operated to reduce the likelihood of an accidental release.

This Executive Summary is primarily intended to describe those parts of the safety program at the Palatka Mill that are required by the RMP Rule.\n\n1. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe Palatka Mill is committed to the safety of workers and the public, as well as the preservation of the environment through the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances. The Palatka Mill implements reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous substances. These controls include training programs for personnel, programs to help ensure safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the processes, and programs to evaluate the hazards at the Palatka Mill.\n\nIn the event of an accidental release, the Palatka Mill will control and contain the release in a manner that will be safe for workers and will help prevent injury to the public and/or the environment. The Mill provides response training for upset conditions to facility personnel, designates an emergency response coordinator to oversee response activities, and coordinates response efforts with the local emergency response organizations. The Mill works with the Local Emergency Planning Commission (LEPC) to help ensure that injuries and/or environmental damage will not occur in the event a release does occur.\n\nIn order to effectively implement these policies, The Palatka Mill has established a management system directed by the Vice President of the Palatka Mill. The Vice President has the overall responsibility for ensuring that the facility operates in a safe and reliable manner. This responsibility includes overseeing the implementation of the elements of the Risk Management Program. To ensure that the Risk Management Program is appr"

These documents address, the hazards of the chemicals used in the process, the technology data of the process, and the design basis and configurations of the equipment used in the process. The Palatka Mill ensures that this process safety information is maintained, accurate, and available to all the Palatka Mill employees, and the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC). All of the information and documentation for the RMP Prevention Program is maintained in the Chemical Process Safety Center at the Palatka Mill. The Palatka Mill maintains the following chemical process information for each regulated substance in a covered process as well as for other hazardous materials in both covered and non covered processes:\n\ni. Toxicity information.\nii. Permissible exposure limits.\niii. Physical data.\niv. Reactivity data.\nv. Corrosivity data.\nvi. Thermal and chemical stability data.\nvii. Hazardous effects of inadvertent mixing of different materials that could occur.\n\nThe Palatka Mill uses material safety data sheets (MSDSs) to provide most of the process chemical information. Material safety data sheets (MSDS) document the physical and chemical properties of the hazardous substances handled at the mill, including non-regulated substances in the covered process. MSDS's for hazardous substances handled in each process are available in a web based format called ?MSDS Web?. Every computer terminal in the Palatka Mill has a link to our MSDS Web database on the desk top. In addition, MSDS's are provided to the LEPC for use in helping formulate emergency response plans. Whenever required information, such as corrosivity data or hazardous effects of inadvertent mixing, is not available in MSDSs, The mill develops the missing data from other sources and provides it in separate documents.\n\nThe Palatka Mill maintains the following required process technology information:\n\ni.

Georgia-Pacific Palatka Mill?s Regulated Substances\n\nGeorgia-Pacific?s Palatka mill is a pulp and paper mill primarily involved in the manufacture of brown/bleached pulp and paper products. As part of this manufacturing process, the mill produces and stores chlorine dioxide for the use of bleaching pulp. The chlorine dioxide solution system, which includes the generation, storage and distribution of the chlorine dioxide, is considered a Program Level 3 RMP-covered process.  The Palatka Mills threshold quantity for Chlorine Dioxide is approximately 46,734 pounds (400,000 gallons) during peak operations.\n\n3. Accidental Release Prevention Program \n\nGeorgia-Pacific?s Palatka Mill has always used a prevention program to help prevent accidental releases of hazardous substances. Beginning in 1992, The Palatka Mill formalized this prevention program for the chlorine dioxide system to comply with the 14 elements of The United States Department of Labors Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard 29 CFR 1910.119. In 1996, the EPA RMP Rule established that a Program Level 3 prevention program would become a requirement for these processes as well. The Palatka Mill's Program Level 3 Prevention Program under the RMP Rule is essentially the same as the OSHA PSM Program, except that the RMP also focuses on protecting the public and the environment. The following sections briefly describe the twelve elements of the Georgia-Pacific Palatka Mills Program Level 3 prevention program that addresses the EPA RMP rule prevention program requirements for the Chlorine Dioxide System.\n\n* Process Safety Information (40 CFR 68.65):  The Palatka Mill maintains a variety of techn"
