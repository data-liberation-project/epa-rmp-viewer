Brainerd Chemical Co., Inc. has two chemicals on site that have exceeded the threshold limits and are subject to RMP.  These chemicals are Nitric Acid (99%) and Hydrofluoric Acid (70%).\n\nIt is expected that the worst case for Nitric Acid would be a complete loss of the bulk tank in which the chemical is stored.  Should this occur, the chemical would be captured in a secondary containment dike that will hold the entire contents of the tank. Further protection  is given to the environment by virtue of the face that this tank is indoors.  The alternative release scenario would be a hose or valve failing, resulting in the uncontrolled draining of the tank.  Again, the secondary containment would be expected to prevent further release to the environment.\n\nIt is expected that Hydrofluoric Acid and Hydrofluoric Acid would be lost from a drum.  The worst case evaluation assumes a complete loss that was contained indoors, as that is where the chemicals is stored.  The more probable alternative release was one drum that might be punctured while on the loading dock by a fork truck.  This would result in the release of approximately 550 pounds to the environment.\n                                                                                                                                                                      \nIt is expected that the worst case release of Formaldehyde would be from one of the tanks that is located outside.  (Note that there are four tanks containing 13,500 pounds each.)  The worst case scenario shows that the toxic endpoint wopuld be lcoated approxiamtely 6.2 miles from the facility.  It should be noted that the containers are in a secondary containment area and the most likely loss to the environment would be a hose or valve failure.  \n\nThe facility is located in an area of light industry."

There are residences in these areas that are projected to be affected by any of the evaluated releases from this facility.  Further, downtwond Tulsa is within a 2 mile radius and will be densely populated during business hours, as will the campus uf OSU Tulsa, located approximately the same distance to teh southeast.  There is also a jail located on the north side of downtown Tulsa.  In the event of a release, these areas would have to be notified.  The contingency plan currently states that the rasio stations and emergency responders would be notified.  This plan also contains the telephone numbers to the the schools that are also located int he area."
