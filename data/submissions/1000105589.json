Victor Packing's safety and environmental policies are administered by the Quality Assurance/Quality Control (QA/QC) Manager. The Dehydrator Manager conducts periodic inspections of the facility to ensure compliance. The Executive Vice President and QA/QC Manager oversee the safety and environmental programs, including the PSM/CalARP/RMP Program.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nThe Victor Packing facility is located at 11687 Road 27 \u00bd, Madera, California. The facility is approximately 0.57 miles east of Highway 145 and approximately 1.56 miles west of Highway 99. The area immediately surrounding the facility is rural respect to the surrounding area with a mixture of farmland and residential areas.\n\nThe sulfur dioxide system is an open system that transfers the chemical through a phase change for the purpose of preserving raisins. The system, consisting of a one-ton cylinder, piping, flex hosing, and valves, transfers sulfur dioxide through two physical states (liquid and vapor) in order to preserve raisins which occurs in the sulfur dioxide houses. \n\nThe sulfur dioxide process begins with the transfer of liquid sulfur dioxide from the one-ton container through flexible and rigid piping to twenty (20) sulfur dioxide houses. A maximum of one (1) one-ton container (2,000 pounds) is used in the system. A maximum of five (5) one-ton containers are stored on a rail system located north of the sulfur dioxide houses.\n\nThe ambient temperature can increase up to 165\u00b0 F before the fusible plugs (pressure relief system used on the cylinders) will release the contents of the cylinders.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe Victor Packing sulfu"

      "SummaryText": "r dioxide system has many safety features. Much of the safety of the system is inherent in the policies and procedures that govern the operation of the system. For example, the facility operates in accordance with Cal-OSHA's Process Safety Management regulation. The facility conducts preventative maintenance and any necessary minor repairs in house, but an outside contractor is hired for major repairs or maintenance. The Victor Packing facility operates in accordance with the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program. It is important to note that the sulfur dioxide system has been designed to prevent the accidental release of sulfur dioxide. Safety features of the sulfur dioxide system include the fusible relief plugs installed on the one-ton containers. These relief plugs are designed to typically melt at 157\u00b0F to 170\u00b0F to prevent cylinder rupture in the event of over pressurization.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe CalARP Program defines \"accident\" as the following:\n\n\"An unanticipated emission of a regulated substance or other extremely hazardous substance into the ambient air from a stationary source.\"\n\nThe release must have caused at least one of the following:\n\n-\tOn-site deaths, injuries, or significant property damage (19CCR2750.9(a)); or\n-\tKnown offsite deaths, injuries, property damage, environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place (19CCR2750.9(a)).\"\n\nBased on the above definition and an investigation into the facility's accident history conducted during the PHA meeting on May 23, 2023, there have been no releases of sulfur dioxide within the past five years (May 2018 - May 2023), that exceeded the Federal Reportable Quantity of 500 pounds or the state requirement mandating immediate reporting of any release or threatened release of a hazardous material to date. \n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe Victor Packing facility has an emergency response plan in effect. The Emergency Action Plan (Plan) is detailed in the Emergency Planning"

To protect the environment.\n4.) To minimize property damage.\n\nThe Dehydrator Manager and the Operations Manager are the designated emergency coordinators for the facility. The Emergency Action Plan (EAP) provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, sulfur dioxide health hazards, and mitigation procedures, which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility. The EAP is reviewed and updated at least once per year. The EAP was reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM, RMP and CalARP regulations.\n\nIn case of a sulfur dioxide emergency, the facility evacuates all employees and contractors. Victor Packing will alert the local emergency responders (fire department) for assistance. The facility plans to coordinate emergency response efforts with the fire department on a periodic and ongoing basis.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThe Process Hazard Analysis, conducted on May 23, 2023, including a Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) study, provided mitigation measures to improve safety at the Victor Packing facility. The Victor Packing safety team is planning to complete several items over the next year, as a continual effort to provide a safe work environment for their employees. These changes include the following items:\n\n1. Continue to train all employees in the facility Emergency Action Plan/Programs.\n2. Continue to have employee involvement in Emergency Action Plan Development.\n3. Continue employee involvement through safety team participation.\n4. Continue internal and external safety audits/inspections and implement changes as needed."
