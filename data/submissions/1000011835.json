The regulated substance is anhydrous ammonia with a total inventory charge of 2,000 lbs. which is over the threshold quantity of 10,000 lbs.  Since the facility is also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's PSM Standard 29 CFR 1910.119, Program 3 is required.\r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION POLICY\r\n\r\nThe top priority of Sysco Food Services of West Coast Florida, Inc. is to provide a healthy and safe work environment for its employees and the surrounding community.  In this effort Sysco Food Services of West Coast Florida, Inc. has developed strict policies and procedures to reduce the risk of an accidental hazardous chemical release.  The Process Safety Management (PSM) program acts as a gatekeeper of these policies and procedures.\r\n\r\nThe requirements of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) PSM Standard 29 CFR 1910.119 mirrors that of Risk Management's Prevention Program 3 and therefore been integrated.  Of the 14 PSM elements 13 focus on accidental release prevention and one on emergency planning and response.  It is the commitment of management and employees to follow the established procedures and seek new ways for improvement. \r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICY\r\n\r\nThe facility has developed an Emergency Response Plan with specific actions to be taken in response to accidental releases.  Sysco Food Services of West Coast Florida has designated and trained employees that will respond in emergency situations.  Sysco Food Services of West Coast Florida provides annual refresher training and schedules periodic meetings and drills.\r\n\r\nCopies of the Sysco Food Services of West Coast Florida, Inc.

The process includes refrigerated spaces that utilize anhydrous ammonia as the refrigerant.  Anhydrous ammonia is a regulated substance under the Chemical Accidental Prevention Provisions, 40 CFR 68.\r\n\r\n\r\nWORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO AND ALTERNATE RELEASE SCENARIO\r\nThe Worst Case Release Scenario and Alternate Release Scenario, including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distance for the reported scenario have been completed and are included in the enclosed RMP Submittal text file.\r\n\r\nTo evaluate both the worst case and alternate release scenarios, EPA's RMP Comp was utilized.  RMP Comp is an acceptable model for the mathematical approximation process.  Public and environmental receptors that could possibly be affected by the scenarios were determined through the use of LANDVIEW 6 mapping system software and US Census Bureau 2010 data.\r\n\r\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\r\nCHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\n\r\nEPA's Risk Management Prevention Program 3, 40 CFR Part 68(D) and OSHA's Process Safety Management Standard 29 CFR 1910.119 outline the facilities accidental release prevention program.
