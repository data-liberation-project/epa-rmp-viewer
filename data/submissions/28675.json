Further more, we are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release of LP or Ammonia should occur, it is our policy to notify the Wellington Fire Department, or other athorities, to minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information: This facility is a grain handling facility, we also resale fertilizer for farm use, and we resale LP-Gas as a heating source for our customers. We have three 12,000 gallon LP tanks and associated piping, valves, and other misc. equipment. We have a maximum storage of 275,774 pounds of anhydrous ammonia. This total was derived from taking the 85% capacity of one 26,000 gallon storage tank, two 11,000 gallon storage tanks, and fifteen 1,000 gallon nurse tanks multiplied by 5.15#/gal. The number of nurse tanks vary from time to time because we are a multiple location facility.\n\n3. The Worst Case Scenario: LP-Gas: A release of 44,000 pounds resulting in a vapor cloud explosion. According to EPA's look-up tables, the distance to the endpoint is 0.04 miles. There are ten private homes within the distance to the endpoint, with a total population of 25 people.\nAnhydrous Ammonia: A release of the contents of a storage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes. According to the Degadis System the maximum quanity released would be 113,815 pounds. The distance to the endpoint is 2.32 miles.\n\n4. Accidental Release Prevention Program: This facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule and all state and local codes and regulations and our propane system is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with NFPA-58 and state law. Our facility is regulated by the Kansas Dep. of Ag.\n\n5. Five Year Accident History: There has been no accidents within the last five years involving LP-Gas or Anhydrou"
