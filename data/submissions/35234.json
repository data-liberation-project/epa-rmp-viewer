      "SummaryText": "Introduction\n\nTrigen-Peoples District Energy Company provides steam/heating and chilled water/air conditioning for the Chicago Metropolitan Pier & Exposition Authority?s (MPEA) McCormick Place exhibition and Convention Center and surrounding buildings.  Trigen-Peoples is a company jointly owned between Trigen-Chicago Energy Company, a wholly owned subsidiary of Trigen Energy Corporation and Peoples District Energy Company, a wholly owned subsidiary of Peoples Energy Corporation (the parent company of Peoples Gas in Chicago).\n\nTrigen Energy Corporation, the leading thermal sciences company in North America, develops, owns and operates commercial and industrial energy systems.  Trigen uses its expertise in thermal engineering and proprietary cogeneration processes to convert fuel to various forms of thermal energy and electricity at more efficient conversion rates than conventional processes.  Trigen combines heat and power generation, producing electricity as a by-product, for use in its facilities and for sale to customers.  The Corporation serves more than 1,500 customer facilities with energy produced at 45 plants in 30 locations, including industrial plants, electric utilities, commercial and office buildings, government buildings, colleges and universities, hospitals, residential complexes and hotels.  Trigen?s mission statement is: ?Provide heating, cooling and electricity with half the fossil fuel and half the pollution of conventional generation.?\n\nTrigen-Peoples District Energy Company integrated existing MPEA heating and cooling equipment with a Thermal Energy Storage (TES) system and three trigeneration (combined heating, cooling, and power) systems.  The TES system stores cold water produced at night and discharges it to meet daytime peak cooling loads.  Fewer chillers are required to meet peak demands and they can be operated continuously, maximizing their production efficiency.  The three trigeneration systems combine a gas turbine, a motor/generator, a"

Their design also allows the equipment connected to the gas turbine to produce any combination of electricity, steam or chilled water while the gas turbine is in operation.  Steam absorption chillers utilize steam produced by the trigeneration systems in the summer.\n\nThe efficiency improvements of the integrated facility result in substantial economic and environmental benefits.  By using the same fuel twice to produce electricity and other energy products and maximizing the use of all the possible energy from the fuel, the facility is able to achieve fuel conversion efficiencies of 91%.  Operational savings of $1 million per year are projected over the life of the project.  Additionally, emissions of CO2 are reduced annually by 24, 327 tons, SOx by 126 tons annually, and NOx by 59 tons annually when compared to the separate production of these same energy products (steam, cooling, and electricity) by conventional means.  By increased efficiency in the cooling process and use of ammonia as a refrigerating agent, 6,500 refrigeration tons of potential ozone depleting refrigerant (CFCs and HCFCs) has been displaced.\n\n\nAmmonia Refrigeration System\n\nTrigen-Peoples uses pressurized liquid anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant for portions of its district cooling system.  The ammonia is used to cool a chilled water system, which in turn is distributed and cools re-circulated air systems.  Trigen-Peoples? ammonia system contains approximately 28,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia (based on latest re-charging records.)\n\nAt ambient temperature and pressure, ammonia is a colorless gas with a characteristic, irritating odor.  Ammonia is highly soluble in water.  Ammonia is the third highest-volume chemical produced in the United States, with eighty percent of the ammonia produced used in the manufacture of fertilizers.  The EPA defined toxic endpoint for ammonia is 0.14 mg/L (approximately 200 ppm).  OSHA?s Imme"

The OSHA Personal Exposure Limit (PEL) for a time-weighted 8-hour average is 50 ppm.\n\nTrigen-Peoples incorporates OSHA?s Process Safety Management and EPA?s Risk Management for its ammonia refrigeration process.  Its dedication to safety is reflected in zero lost-time accidents in the last five years.  The facility has not had an ammonia leak resulting in an impact on a public or environmental receptor; or one requiring notification to response agencies in the last five years.\n\nTrigen-People?s ammonia system utilizes state of the art design, control, and protective devices and systems.  All ammonia equipment is located at the central power plant; there is no ammonia distribution piping.  All equipment, construction, operations, and maintenance activity meets or exceeds the requirements and/or recommendations of over thirteen different regulatory codes and industry guidance regarding ammonia refrigeration systems.  Trigen-Peoples only utilizes ammonia compatible products which are designed to meet or exceed the conditions (pressure, temperature, and function) found in their refrigeration system.  Trigen-Peoples incorporates a management system to ensure all modifications or other changes to the system meet these stringent criteria.  Additionally, the management system ensures only qualified contractors (installation, welding and other specialists), operators, and maintenance personnel are allowed to work on or with Trigen ammonia systems.\n\nAmmonia control systems include redundant monitoring and equipment shut down circuitry.  This includes computer-controlled operations, alarms, and/or automatic equipment shut down due to changing process parameters.  The computer system is backed up with an independent ?hard wire? system that can independently shut down equipment due to out of range process values.

Problems identified during equipment inspections are addressed immediately.  The preventative maintenance program includes regularly scheduled maintenance activities such as equipment testing, clearance checks, vibration checks, periodic overhauls, vessel and pipe inspections and certifications, and lubrication oil and refrigerant quality testing.\n\nAll ammonia-related activities (operations, maintenance, and construction) are conducted under the aegis of the General Manager.  The Plan and Controls engineer coordinates all facility activity.  Direct involvement of the chief Engineer and the Assistant Chief Engineer (Safety Officer) is found in all ammonia-related activities and personnel utilize facility specific operation procedures in their operation and maintenance of the ammonia equipment.\n\nLeaks\n\nEvery effort is made to prevent ammonia leaks.  However, the possibility of a leak does exist and thus Trigen-Peoples has developed an Emergency Ammonia Leak response plan.  Trigen personnel are thoroughly trained in ammonia response and have the necessary equipment maintained on-site to respond immediately and effectively to an ammonia release.  Employees undergo initial response training and yearly refresher course that include practice response scenarios utilizing the required protective equipment under adverse conditions.  Personnel safety is of primary importance.  An important component of the response plan is, if necessary, to shut down all equipment and await backup personnel before attempting to enter a potentially unsafe area.  Essentially, production is sacrificed in order to achieve safety.\n\nThe key to leak mitigation is the ability to identify leaks as early in their development as possible.  Ammonia has a very low odor threshold; in other words, it "

A small ammonia leak in the room is immediately detected by area personnel (or ammonia sensors  and promptly investigated.  Ammonia equipment located on the roof of the facility is physically inspected three times a day.\n\nTrigen-Peoples also utilizes ammonia sensors located throughout the ammonia equipment areas and ventilation air stream.  This system is linked with the computer-control system.  If a sensor detects an ammonia leak, a series of alarms will activate, alerting the operator not only to the situation but its severity.  It also alerts the operator to a changing situation.  Upon detection of an ammonia concentration equal or greater than 250 ppm, the system will automatically shut down all equipment in the central power plant (not just the ammonia system equipment) and activate a mandatory evacuation of all non-responding personnel.  The ventilation system design mitigates the potential impact of an ammonia release on the public and the environment by dilution, increased atmospheric mixing and the elevated release point.\n\nIn the event of a major release, Trigen-Peoples would promptly link with the Chicago Fire Department for removal of the entire ammonia inventory or isolated sections of ammonia inventory.  This system is called the ?fireman?s dump.?  The ammonia is mixed with water and discharged to the sewer system.  The ammonia/water discharge ultimately enters the city?s wastewater systems in which ammonia will not adversely impact the environment.  The system is required by the City of Chicago Building Code."
