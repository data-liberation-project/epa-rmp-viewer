Executive Summary\r\n\r\nThis program is intended to meet the spirit and intent of the following regulations:\r\n- California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program - Title 19 CCR, Chapter 4.5\r\n- Federal EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) - Title 40 CFR \u00a768\r\n- California Process Safety Management (PSM) Program, Title 8 CCR \u00a75189\r\n- Federal Process Safety Management (PSM) Program, Title 29 CFR \u00a71910.119\r\n\r\nHereafter this program will be referred to as the RMP-PSM program.\r\n\r\nThis program is intended to be a \"living document\". As such, the information, procedures, policies, and documentation that make up this program must be made easily accessible and updated as necessary. To accomplish this, Kirschenman Enterprises - Edison has elected to use PSMWriter, software developed and distributed by Resource Compliance, Inc. This software will assist us with updating, maintaining, scheduling, and tracking RMP-PSM related activities. \r\n\r\n1.1 Kirschenman Enterprises - Edison, Risk and Process Safety Management Program\r\n\r\nThis is to inform all interested persons, including employees, that Kirschenman Enterprises - Edison has updated/developed their unified RMP-PSM Program. This program has been prepared to address the risks involved in operating and maintaining the following processes which have the presence of hazardous chemicals above threshold quantities: \r\n\r\nProcess Name               | Process Chemical                | Process Quantity(lbs.)\r\nChlorine Process             Chlorine                          6,000\r\n\r\nOur RMP-PSM program promotes overall plant, worker, and public safety. The program enables our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of hazardous chemicals. Overall, the program is designed to prevent accidental fatalities, injuries, illnesses, and physical property damage.\r\n\r\nOur company has many policies and procedures in place to promote overall plant, worker and public safety. We have: \r\n1. Prepared a uni"

Utilized PSMWriter software to ensure that all necessary employees have access to relevant information (SOPs, PHAs, audits, etc.)\r\n\r\nThe RMP-PSM program sets forth rules, procedures, and practices that will help our employees and neighbors protect themselves.\r\n\r\n1.2 Process Descriptions\r\n\r\nKirschenman Enterprises Edison operates a commercial cold storage for potatoes in Edison, CA. \r\n\r\nKirschenman Enterprises Edison has one chlorine process, which operates as follows:\r\n1. Chlorine one-ton containers are delivered and connected to the process by the chlorine vendor.\r\n2. When water treatment is required, the water pump for the chlorination system is turned on. An ejector(s) installed in the water pump discharge line draws chlorine gas through a regulator mounted on the ton container.\r\n3. The highly acidic chlorinated water downstream of the ejector(s) is dumped into a buffer tank where the pH is neutralized.\r\n4. Chlorinated, buffered water with a neutral pH is sent to the Potato Wash process and then to the Pit.\r\n5. Empty cylinders are disconnected from the process and removed from the facility by the chlorine vendor for refilling.\r\n\r\nThe chlorine process at this facility consists of vessels which are interconnected, or which are co-located such that a release of chlorine could impact the ability to operate vessels that are not directly connected.  Therefore, the system is treated as a single process.\r\n\r\n1.3 General Accident Release & Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\r\n\r\n1.3.1 General \r\n\r\nWe inform our employees engaged in process operations of the dangers of an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia in annual safety meetings. During these meeting we also discuss preventative measures, such as evacuation, in order to be prepared for a release.\r\n\r\nKirschenman Enterprises - Edison has also conducted"

These are for the purposes of informing the public in the event of an accidental release. The results of the analyses are reported in PSMWriter and hard copy binders. \r\n\r\n1.3.3 Chlorine\r\nThe chlorination process at the Kirschenman Enterprises - Edison facility is an integral part of the overall business and operates for only a few months out of the year. The chlorination process utilizes one [QUANTITY (lbs.)] cylinder, with another cylinder stored next to it as a backup. As with the ammonia process management is committed to making sure that employees are made aware of the potential danger of a chlorine leak. \r\n\r\nKirschenman Enterprises - Edison personnel monitor the chlorination process. In addition, the process is checked frequently during the operational season by our outside water treatment contractor. This contractor also assists in performing the annual mechanical integrity review of our chlorine equipment. \r\n\r\n1.4 Five Year Accident History\r\n\r\nKirschenman Enterprises - Edison has had no accidental release within the last five (5) years.\r\n\r\n1.5 Emergency Action and Response Plan\r\n\r\nKirschenman Enterprises - Edison's emergency action and response program has been developed to satisfy the following requirements:\r\n- Cal/OSHA's Emergency Action Plan - Title 8 CCR \u00a73220\r\n- U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) Emergency Action Plans - Title 29 CFR \u00a71910.38\r\n- Cal/OSHA's Process Safety Management [Emergency Response Program Requirements] - Title 8 CCR \u00a75189(n)\r\n- U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) Process Safety Management [Emergency Planning and Response Requirements]- Title 29 CFR \u00a71910.119(n)\r\n- California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program [Emergency Response Program Requirements] - Title 19 CCR, Division 2, Chapter 4.5 \u00a72765.1-2765.2\r\n- USEPA Risk Management Program [Emergency Response Program Requirement"

Nevertheless, Kirschenman Enterprises - Edison continually strives to improve in all areas, including safety.\r\n\r\nBy utilizing PSMWriter software, all necessary employees have access to every aspect of the RMP-PSM program. This has improved Kirschenman Enterprises - Edison's ability to communicate hazardous situations to employees and contractors. In addition, PSMWriter tracks all RMP-PSM related events so that Kirschenman Enterprises - Edison's management team can ensure that the RMP-PSM program is being implemented.\r\n\r\nKirschenman Enterprises - Edison has implemented all aspects of the RMP-PSM program. When a RMP-PSM program requirement is completed (i.e. mechanical integrity inspection, process hazard analysis, compliance audit, etc.) any specific action items related to that event are entered into PSMWriter, assigned a responsible person, and given a due date. Once the action item has been completed, the resolution can be documented using PSMWriter as well. A list of current or past due action items can be accessed at any tim"
