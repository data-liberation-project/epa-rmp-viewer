It is our policy to meet, or exceed, all local, state, and national standards relating to storing and transferring flammable liquids. Although Natural Gas Liquid (NGL) is a flammable material, records of the state fire marshal show no fatalities at propane or NGL bulk storage facilities for as long as records are available (back to 1982).  In addition, we have never had any accidents or releases with off-site consequences.  Specific safety features that we employ to minimize damage from any unusual occurrences include: 1.  Pull-away shut off valves and vertical bulkheads to minimize the amount released if a truck accidentally leaves before disconnecting hoses. 2.  Emergency shut off valves, with remote activation, to minimize the amount released if anything unusual occurs during loading or unloading.  3.  Excess flow valves to prevent flow from the tank if any hose or line breaks.  4.  Pressure relief valves on each tank to prevent over-pressuring and rupture of the tanks.  To further ensure safe operation of the facility, our employees are trained, and periodically retrained, in our companies safe handling and operating prodecures.  In addition, we have an emergency response procedure/evacution plan and have coordinated with the Springtown Fire Department to respond to emergencies.  As required by EPA, we have analyzed the worst-case scenario defined by the EPA.  This scenario involves a vapor cloud explosion from a release of the entire contents of the 30,000 gallon tank.  According to information supplied by the EPA the impact from this scenario would extend 0.39 miles from our facility.  It is extremely unlikely that an event such as EPA's worst-case release scenario will ever occur.  A more probable, but still highly event, would be an event like a hose rupture for one minute due to a transpor"
