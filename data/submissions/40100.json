      "SummaryText": "The Town of Billerica Water Treatment Plant, currently located at 250 Boston Road, Billerica, Massachusetts, treats and disinfects water before it is discharged to the water distribution system.  The Town presently utilizes chlorine gas for disinfection to meet minimum standards of the Safe Drinking Water Act.  Nine one-ton containers of pressurized liquid chlorine are located on site.  Three one-ton containers of chlorine are located within the building of which two are manifolded to the chlorination system. The remaining six cylinders of chlorine are each stored in one-ton containers on an exterior elevated rack.\n\nA new water treatment plant is under construction at a different location and will be placed in service in the fall of 2005.  The new plant will use Sodium Hypochlorite solution as it's method of disinfection and the chlorine gas system will be dismantled.  This RMP has been prepared to cover the next 15 month period when chlorine gas is the disinfectant.  For this RMP, data have been updated where it has changed since the last submittal. \n\nThe offsite consequence analysis includes consideration of two release scenarios, identified as ?worst case release? and ?alternative scenario.?  EPA defines the first scenario, which states that ?the owner or operator shall assume that the  . . .  Maximum quantity in the largest vessel  . . .  Is released as a gas over 10 minutes,? due to an unspecified failure.  The alternative scenario is defined as ?more likely to occur than the worst-case release scenario.?\n\nAtmospheric dispersion modeling has to be performed to determine the distance traveled by the chlorine released before its concentration decreases to the ?toxic endpoint? selected by EPA of 3 ppm (chlorine), which is the Emergency Response Planning Guideline Level 2 (ERPG-2).  The American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA) defines this as the ?maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to "

      "SummaryText": "one hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects or symptoms which could impair an individual?s ability to take protective action.?  The residential population within a circle with a radius corresponding to the toxic endpoint distance has to be defined, ?to estimate the population potentially affected.?\n \nThe worst-case release scenario involves a failure of a one-ton storage tank containing either 2,000 pounds of chlorine.  The offsite consequence analysis for these tanks was performed for two sets of conditions.  The first set of conditions was predefined by the EPA.  This analysis assumed that the vessel would completely release all of its contents in ten minutes.  The toxic endpoint used was the one-hour average ERPG-2.  The population residing within a full circle with a radius corresponding to the toxic endpoint distance was estimated based upon the earlier risk management plan.  \n\nThe worst-case conditions from the earlier risk management plan were used.  These correspond to Stability F, wind speed of 1.5 m/s, highest daily temperature of 77oF and an average humidity of 50%.  No new modelling was conducted.  Rather, it was assumed that the radius which corresponded to the toxic endpoint distance, 3.0 miles, was the same as that identified in the earlier risk management plan.  Within the 3.0 miles, it was estimated that 55,000 people would be affected by this EPA-specified release and the corresponding conditions.\n\nThe alternative release scenario involves the release of a one-ton cylinder of chlorine.  In this case, however, the release is inside a building. The release is assumed to be over a ten-minute time period. Liquid chlorine released from the ruptured whip would flash immediately to a vapor.  The meteorological conditions used were Stability D, wind speed 3.0 m/s, average air temperature of 50oF, and 50 percent average humidity.  Based on these conditions, the off-site impact extends 0.6 miles.  The chlorine det"

      "SummaryText": "ector is the active mitigation measure considered.  \n\nThe general WTP accidental release prevention program is based on: training of operators; a preventive maintenance program; use of process and safety equipment that is standard in the industry; use of accurate and effective operating procedures, written with the participation of the operators; completion a hazard review of equipment and procedures; and implementation of an auditing and inspection program\n\nChemical-specific preventions steps include availability of self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA), awareness of the hazardous and toxic properties of chlorine, and presence of chlorine detectors.  \n\nNo accidental releases of chlorine have occurred at this facility in the past five years.\n\nThe facility has an emergency response program, which has been coordinated with the Billerica Fire Department."
