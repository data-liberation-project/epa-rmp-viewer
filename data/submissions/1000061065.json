The Sanitary District of Michigan City (SDMC) maintains quantities of chlorine and sulfur dioxide above the RMP threshold quantity of 2,500 and 5,000 pounds, respectively, and as such, is subject to the requirements of 40 CFR Part 68. A hazard review was completed to determine that RMP program level 3 is applicable to SDMC's chlorine and sulfur dioxide systems. \n\n\n\nThe information presented in this section is intended to describe the elements of SDMC's Risk Management Program. The format of the section corresponds to the executive summary data elements as described in 40 CFR Part 68 Executive Summary Section. \n\n\n\nExecutive Summary Data Elements\n\nAccording to EPA guidance the executive summary must include a brief description of the facility's Risk Management Program. The following sections list each of the required executive summary data elements by rule citation. In accordance with EPA guidance, the Offsite Consequence Analysis (OCA) is not covered in the executive summary. \n\n\n\n68.155(a) Accidental Release and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nThe Sanitary District of Michigan City Wastewater Treatment Plant (J.B. Gifford WWTP) has operated their Disinfection Process (Chlorination & Sulfonation Systems) without an incident since the previous RMP submission. This successful operating record is due to the WWTP's commitment to effective management of the RMP elements. RMP elements are assigned to skilled and knowledgeable WWTP personnel who have the overall responsibility to manage their program elements. The Risk Management Program, Management System Organization is illustrated in the following table. \n\nRMP Management System Organization\n\nRisk "

The Wastewater Treatment Plant uses an aqueous solution of chlorine to provide disinfection of the treated wastewater.  Dechlorination (Sulfonation) is accomplished with an aqueous solution of sulfur dioxide that reacts with chlorine residuals including mono- and dichloramine before the treated wastewater is discharged through NPDES permitted outfalls into Trail Creek. \n\nThe Disinfection Process is located within the perimeter fence line of the wastewater treatment plant site. A physical security protection system including access controls are in place to prev"

The WWTP maintains chlorine and sulfur dioxide   leak detection devices within the Disinfection Process including the Gas Storage Room, Effluent Disinfection Room and the Storm Basin Disinfection Room. There are audible and visual alarms for chlorine and sulfur dioxide in the facility. The Disinfection Process stores chlorine (Cl2) and sulfur dioxide (SO2) at the Gas Storage Room in 1-ton containers. \n\nThe Effluent Disinfection System and the Storm Basin Disinfection System are systems whereby chlorine and sulfur dioxide gas are fed through systems called a Chlorinator and Sulfonator. A vacuum is created by the site's non-potable water feed system which draws chlorine and sulfur dioxide gas through the Chlorinator and Sulfonator respectively at an amount preset by designated, qualified WWTP personnel. This system provides an excellent active mitigation measure that greatly minimizes the risk of a reportable release to the environment. If a chlorine or sulfur dioxide gas leak occurs anywhere in the system beyond the regulator that is attached to the 1-ton container in the Gas Storage Room, then the vacuum is lost and the regulator automatically shuts-off gas flow at the container. Also, the regulator automatically shut-off gas flow at the container, if the non-potable water source is removed from the process.  \n\n \n\nThe inventory of chlorine and sulfur dioxide fluctuates throughout the year. The Sanitary District's \"Disinfection Season\" typically begins around the end of February and ends around the first part of December. During this time period, normal inventory in the Gas Storage Room is six (6) 1-ton chlorine containers and five (5) 1-ton sulfur dioxide containers. During the \"Disinfection Season\", two (2) chlorine containers and two (2) sulfur dioxide containers are feeding gas to the Effluent Disinfection System.

During the period between early December and late February, the inventory is reduced to only two (2) sulfur dioxide containers and two (2) chlorine containers in the Gas Storage Room. One of the two chlorine containers and one of the two sulfur dioxide containers are connected to their respective gas feed system. Gas inventories on site are carefully managed by operations, maintenance and purchasing. The maximum inventory in the Gas Storage Room is seven (7) 1-ton containers of chlorine and the maximum inventory for sulfur dioxide is six (6) 1-ton containers, but this would rarely occur. \n\n\n\n68.155(d) Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\n\n\nThe Prevention Program required for compliance with 40 CFR Part 68 for Program 3 processes aligns with the prevention program required under OSHA 29 CFR 1910.119-Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals. Sanitary District management aligned its Disinfection Process Prevention Program with Indiana OSHA PSM regulatory requirements in 2010. The Sanitary District's WWTP operations and maintenance employees are actively involved in the evaluation, review and updates of their prevention programs and safety-related procedures. WWTP operations and maintenance personnel along with subject matter specialists were actively involved in the Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) completed on September 2, 2016. \n\n\n\n68.155(e) Five-year Accident History\n\n\n\nThe chlorination and dechlorination facility has been in place since 1955.
