      "SummaryText": "Mennel Milling Company operates a large mill in Bucyrus, Ohio that processes wheat into many different grades of flour. Several of the grades involve a bleaching process un which chlorine is added to the milled flour. In addition, a small amount of chlorine is added to the temper water for wheat prior to milling to prevent spoilage.\n\n\n\nChlorine is delivered to Mennel Milling Co. in one (1) ton cylinders. The supplier delivers full chlorine cylinders to the site via truck. The containers are unloaded and stored in the indoor storage area by the use of an overhead crane rail hoist. Mennel Milling staff connects the one (1) ton cylinders to the feed system. The maximum number of one (1) ton cylinders located onsite at any time is eight (8).\n\n\n\nMennel Milling Co. uses vacuum systems that involve the use of air or water flowing through an eductor that creates a vacuum. This vacuum allows for the feed of chlorine from the cylinders into the piping system. If a chlorine line downstream of the vacuum regulator is broken or develops a leak, the vacuum is interrupted and the vacuum regulator automatically closes, preventing discharge of chlorine gas.\n\n\n\nWorst Case Scenario: The worst case scenario involves the rupture and complete loss of chlorine from a full one (1) ton cylinder outside the chlorine room at the Mennel Milling Co. The distance to the specific endpoint is estimated to be 1.3 miles. This distance was estimated using a computer-based version (RMP * Comp Version 2.01) of the methodology presented in the USEPA's \"RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance\", USEPA, April 1999. The public receptors affected by this worst case scenario included schools, private residences, recreation areas, offices and or industrial facilities. The residential population within the 1.3 mile radius is approximately 7,609 persons and 3,670 households estimated April 2015 using USEPA RMP COMP online program coupled with the USEPA's MARPLOT software.\n\n\n\nAlternative Release Scenario: The a"

      "SummaryText": "lternative release scenario considers a leaking gasket at the connection between a one-ton cylinder and valve/piping system while the system is operating. It is is assumed that the odors of the chlorine building are closed and the ventilation fan is running, exhausting fumes to the atmosphere at a rate of 4 pounds per minute. It is also assumed that the leak is detected and a response curtails the release in 10 minutes. The distance to the toxic endpoint was estimated using the RMP* Comp Version 2.01 as 0.1 mile. The public receptors affected under this scenario include private residences, offices, and or commercial facilities. The residential population within this radius is 11 persons and 4 households , which was estimated April 2015 using USEPA RMP COMP online program coupled with the USEPA's MARPLOT software.\n\n\n\nEmergency Action Plan: The Emergency Action Plan contains measures that the Mennel Milling Company staff can take to alert the employees to a release, how to distinguish between an accidental release and a significant release, and many other elements. Mennel Milling staff receive training to allow for the defensive action to an onsite release. In the event of a chlorine release, Mennel Milling staff will contact the Crawford County Hazmat for technical support. The Hazmat team is trained and equipped to respond to chlorine incidents.\n\n\n\nThe facility has coordinated its emergency activities with the City of Bucyrus Fire Department and the Crawford County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC)."
