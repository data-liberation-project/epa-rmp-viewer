If an emergency accidental release were to occur involving our propane storage system, it is our policy to immediately notify the Bucyrus City Fire Department, who would respond to the emergency.\n\n2.  A description of your facility and the regulated substances handled:\n\nThe Bucyrus Blades facility manufactures cutting blades and construction machinery.  We use propane as a backup fuel to natural gas furnaces, for surface hardening of steel and flame cutting.  The propane storage process consists of two 18,000-gallon propane tanks and associated piping, valves, and other equipment.\n\n3.  The worst-case release scenario:\n\nThe worst-case release scenario for the Bucyrus Blades facility considers the potential failure of one (1) 18,000-gallon storage tank filled to 88% of its holding capacity (administrative controls limit each storage tank to 88% of capacity at 600F), resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  Utilizing a computer-based version (RMP*Comp) of the methodology presented in USEPA's \"RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance\", USEPA, May 24, 1996, the distance to the flammable endpoint (1 psi overpressure) was determined to be 0.3 miles.  The public receptors affected under this worst-case release scenario include:  a school; private residences; commercial, office, and/or industrial facilities; and, agricultural land.  The total population within this 0.3-mile radius is approximately 108, which was estimated using an Environmental Data Resources - Offsite Receptor Report.\n\n4.

Utilizing RMP*Comp, the distance to the flammable endpoint was determined to be 0.03 miles.  No public or environmental receptors are affected under this alternative release scenario.  Also, there is no residential population within this 0.03-mile radius.\n\nThe second alternative release scenario for the Bucyrus Blades facility considers the potential rupture of the piping from the propane unloading area to the propane storage tanks, in addition to the potential rupture of the transport truck itself (total of 42,200 lbs).  This was determined by calculating the mass of propane within the piping run (200 lbs), in addition to the volume of propane within the transport truck (42,000 lbs).  Utilizing RMP*Comp, the distance to the flammable endpoint was determined to be 0.2 miles.  The public receptors affected under this alternative release scenario include:  private residences; commercial, office, and/or industrial facilities; and, agricultural land.  The total population within this 0.2-mile radius is approximately 48, which was estimated using an Environmental Data Resources - Offsite Receptor Report.\n\n5.  The general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps:\n\nThe Bucyrus Blades facility complies with USEPA's accident prevention rule and all applicable federal, state, and local codes and regulations.  The propane system is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with NFPA-58 and state law at the Bucyrus Blades facility in Bucyrus, Ohio.\n\n6.
