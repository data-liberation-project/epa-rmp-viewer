      "SummaryText": "1.  Facility Policy.  The owners, management and employees of Weber Fertilizer are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia by utilization of proper equipment, regular inspections and maintenance and training of all persons that work with the material.  Should an accidental release occur, the facility has oriented the local fire department and thte local emergency planning committee so they can plan for response to any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n2.  Facility Information.  The primary activity at the facility is the storage for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient.  The maximum quantity stored would be 140,000 lbs in the facility's 1 tank.  The capacity of this tank is 30,000 gallons or 140,000 lbs.  \n3.  The worst-case scenario would be release of the total contents of the storage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released wuld be 140,000 lbs which represents the volume of the storage tank at 85% capacity as limited by design standards and company procedures.  The distance to endpoint of dispersion based on the model used is 2.68 miles.  The alternativ-case release scenario is assumed to be a release from the rupture of a 2 inch transfer hose, with 12,000 lbs released over 2 minutes.  The distance to endpoint of dispersion is 0.56 miles.  \n4.  The accidental release program.  Weber Fertilizer complies with the Rules and Regulations relating to the Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia and Low Pressure Nitrogen Solutions, Equipment, Containers and Storage Facilities.  These regulations administered by the Illinois Department of Agriculture are consistent with ANSI K61.1 and OSHA 29 CFR 1910.111 regarding storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia.\n5.  The five year accident history.  There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia for the covered process in the past"

      "SummaryText": " five years that have caused any deaths, injuries or significant property damage on site; nor to our knowledge, have any accidental releases resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage.\n6.  The emergency response program.  Weber Fertilizer has a written emergency response action plan in accordance with OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.38 and provides state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III of EPCRA.  Our emergency response action plan has been reviewed with the local fire department and provided to the local emergency planning committee for coordination in the community response training.  \n7.  Planned changes to improve safety:  Safey improvements are an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe pratices and operations.  There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
