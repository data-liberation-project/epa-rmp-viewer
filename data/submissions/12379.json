      "SummaryText": "     We at Bruder Fertilizer Inc. are a working part of our community here in LaCrosse, IN.  My parents, myself, my wife and my two daughters were all born and raised here in LaCrosse.  My parents home is within 100 yards of our Anhydrous Ammonia storage facility, while myself, my wife and two daughters live within two miles of our storage tanks.  It goes without saying, that no one would suffer any greater losses than the Bruder Family if the unthinkable were to happen, and we were to have a large scale release of Anhydrous Ammonia from a storage tank rupture.  Fortunately, our ammonia storage facility is in an area that is not densely populated. However, almost all of the people that reside within the 4.2 mile radius that makes up the \"danger zone\" are friends, customers or people that we know.  With all this in mind, we at Bruder Fertilizer Inc. have, are currently, and will continue to do all that is in our power to limit the chance of a large or small scale ammonia release. In efforts to do so we will continue to uphold our maintenance programs, safety training to employees, and compliance with regulatory specifications.  In the event of a release we have action plans in place that our employees have been made aware of.  This action plan has provisions for employee safety, public notification, and notification of the authourities.\n                                                                                Respectfully,\n                                                                                Daron R.
