Sound health, safety, and the \n         environment practices are an integral part of our everyday job requirements.\n\n        In recognition of this responsibility, we will correct any unsound health, safety, and envirnmenttal\n        practices or conditions, or call them to the attention of those who will do so, as soon as they are\n        identified. We will:\n\n       .  Conduct our operations in compliance with all laws and regulations.\n       .  Conduct periodic assessments of our operations to ensure compliance and reduce risks.\n       .  Establish health, safety, and environmental performance practices that apply risk management and\n          and loss control principles to our operations.\n       .  Provide education and training regarding laws, regulations, policies, and procedures to protect \n          human health and the environment.\n       .  Cooperate with our trade groups, governmental agencies, and others to develop effective,\n          reasonable rules and regulations to protect human health and the environment.\n\n2.      Our goal is to provide a safe and dependable supply of drinking water that meets all federal and state\n         regulations while protecting the human health of our neighbors and protect the environment.\n\n         Our groundwater comes from twenty-eight wells and is treated in two plants.  Water enters Plant #1 \n         and passes through an aerator that strips volatile organics out of the water. After aeration, the \n         following chemicals are added to the water.  Limes is added to increase the pH and alkalinity of the\n         water. Fluoride is added for dental health, Phosphate is added for corrosion control and finally \n         CHLORINE is added for disinfection purposes.\n\n3.

The distance to the\n         toxic endpoint  would be 0.9 miles.  This distance was determined by EPA's RMP*Comp\n         software.\n\n        The alternative release scenario (ARS) for chlorine would be the shearing off of the liquid valve\n        from the cylinder and releasing 2000 pounds of chlorine in 15 minutes. The distance to the toxic\n        endpoint  would be 0.2 miles as determined by the RMP*Com software.\n\n4.
