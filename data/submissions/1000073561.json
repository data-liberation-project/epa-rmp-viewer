      "SummaryText": "PROCESS SUMMARY\n\nThe Reddy Ice-Harrisonburg (402) facility manufactures packaged ice for wholesale/retail distribution.  The facility has a production capacity of approximately 850 tons of ice per day and utilizes anhydrous ammonia as refrigerant for ice production and storage. \n\n\n\nThe refrigeration system is a standard closed-loop design with two distinct refrigeration loops.  The main system operates six icemakers and the ice storage vault refrigeration.  The second system is dedicated to operating three additional tube icemakers.  Each of the systems has numerous protective controls including motor overload, high discharge temperature, high discharge pressure, low suction pressure, low oil differential on all compressors, low-level cutouts on all recirculators, and approved pressure relief valves on all applicable equipment. \n\n\n\nThe facility has multiple safeguards pertinent to the anhydrous ammonia process.  These include emergency ventilation systems, controls that shut down the compressors if operating limits are exceeded, and the capability of shutting down the entire system remotely if required.  An ammonia detection and alarm system is installed to notify employees in the event of an ammonia leak.  Programmable Logic Controllers (PLC) monitor and control both icemaker systems.\n\n \n\nAnhydrous ammonia, when properly used, has proven to be a safe and reliable refrigerant.  The sharp odor of ammonia provides its own warning agent.  Practically all accidents involving anhydrous ammonia can be avoided through the facility's program of proper employee training; knowledge of the equipment and procedures; and the development, maintenance, and implementation of effective operating and maintenance procedures for all ammonia equipment.\n\n\n\nThe company has developed an emergency action plan that includes procedures for notification of emergency authorities/agencies and the public, evacuation of personnel, and first responder duties by trained refrigeration personnel in th"

This accident prevention program is a way to make safe operations and accident prevention systematic throughout the facility.  Reddy Ice Corporate Management and Reddy Ice-Harrisonburg management are committed to operating a safe and compliant facility for the protection of its employees, the public, and the environment.  A combined Process Safety Management/Risk Management (PSM/RMP) Program has been developed to meet the accidental release prevention requirements of EPA's Risk Management Program (40 CFR Part 68) and OSHA's Process Safety Management (29 CFR 1910.119) regulations.  The combined PSM/RMP Program contains fourteen elements, establishing requirements for employee participation, process safety information, process hazard analysis, pre-startup safety review, operating procedures, training, management of change, mechanical integrity, hot work permits, contractors, incident investigation, compliance audits, emergency planning and response, and trade secrets. These elements are tied together by a management system to ensure development, implementation, and integration of the program requirements.\n\n\n\nMANAGEMENT SYSTEM\n\nA management system has been developed to oversee the implementation of the PSM/RMP Program elements.  The Plant Manager has been identified as PSM/RMP Program Coordinator, with overall responsibility for developing, implementing, and integrating the program requirements.  Under the PSM/RMP Program, various responsibilities have been assigned to other individuals.  The Maintenance Lead is responsible for portions of the program closely tied to the refrigeration equipment and operation.  A safety committee with rotating membership meets each month to review safety inciden"

Monthly safety meetings are held and documented with all plant employees.\n\n\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT\n\nAs required by the RMP regulations, the Reddy Ice-Harrisonburg facility has conducted a hazard assessment including offsite consequence analyses (OCA) for potential accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  The OCAs describe the potential offsite exposure to surrounding areas from an accidental release.  A worst-case release scenario and alternative release scenarios were calculated using the EPA's RMP*Comp modeling program, and the potentially affected offsite population and facilities were identified. \n\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe Reddy Ice-Harrisonburg facility has not had any releases that would require reporting as part of a five-year accident history.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY PLANNING AND RESPONSE\n\nThe Reddy Ice-Harrisonburg facility operates under an Emergency Action Plan (EAP) that includes procedures for: notifying plant personnel, the public and local emergency responders; emergency evacuation/response procedures; use of emergency alarms and equipment; employee training in evacuation and response procedures; first aid for ammonia exposure; and periodic review and updating of the EAP.  The plan is reviewed regularly for verification of data, and revised and updated as necessary to reflect changes in facility operations and personnel.\n\n\n\nIn addition, the facility has coordinated emergency response activities with the Rockingham Department of Fire and Rescue/County LEPC and the Harrisonburg Fire Department, and has appropriate mechanisms in place to notify emergency responders if needed.  The ammonia inventory is verified and reported annually to the state and local authorities, and the plant is incorporated into the community emergency response plan developed under 42USC.\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES\n\nThe Reddy Ice-Harrisonburg facility operates an ongoing program of preventive and predictive maintenance to identify and implement chang"
