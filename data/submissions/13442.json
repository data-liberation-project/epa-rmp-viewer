Additionally, this new regulation, 40 CFR Part 68 Chemical Accident Prevention Program, Risk Management Plan, will further enhance Sierra Chemical Co. commitment to risk management.\n\nFacility and Regulated Substances Handled:  Sierra Chemical Co., Rocklin Facility, consists of storage and handling of 1 ton containers and 150 pound cylinders of chlorine and sulfur dioxide.  Typical inventory of sulfur dioxide is 8,750 pounds and chlorine is 29,700 pounds.\n\nThe Worst-Case Release Scenario and the Alternate Release Scenarios:  Because chlorine and sulfur dioxide is stored and handled at the facility in 1 ton containers, complying with Department of Transportation regulations, the worst-case scenario for the facility would be the release of the contents of a 1 ton container.  This scenario was chosen based on the requirements contained in 40 CFR Part 68.  For the alternate release scenario, Sierra Chemial Co. chose a leaking valve or fuse plug on a 1 ton container, which emergency response personnel mitigated within 180 minutes with an emergency repair kit.  Modelling for all scenarios was completed utilizing RMP*Comp, Version 1.06, as provided by EPA.  Modelling for both the worst-case release scenario and the alternate release scenarios demostrated potential off-site impacts to adjacent industrial facilities only.  \n\nThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps:  Sierra Chemical Co. achieves accidental release prevention through the following programs.

Additionally, a copy of the emergency response plan has been furnished to the Local Emergency Planning Committee.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:  Sierra Chemical Co. strives to improve safety by implementation of the OSHA Process Safety Management Standard (including compliance audits every three years and process hazards analysis revalidation every five years) and an employee safety committee."
