We constantly strive to recognize areas for improvement and implement the changes necessary to achieve our goals.  Methods used to identify areas for improvement include, but are not limited to:\n\n?\tProcess hazard analyses for manufacturing processes\n?\tInternal audits of procedures and processes\n?\tSite inspections\n?\tObservations of \u0093on-the-floor\u0094 work \n?\tReview of completed safe work permits and other procedures\n?\tSafety suggestion and near miss program\n\nIn addition, the following are examples of safety improvement opportunities identified and implemented by the site for an RMP covered chemical.\n\n?\tInstallation of secondary containment around tank truck unloading area to catch material in the event of a spill\n?\tConversion from bottom tank truck unloading to top unloading to reduce the potential for spills\n?\tInstallation of a sealless pump to reduce the likelihood for leaks\n?\tInstallation of a backflow prevention device in unloading piping\n?\tRestriction of traffic under piping to prevent a collision\n?\tReplacement of transfer piping\n\nFor historical purposes, the following specific improvements were made between the 2014 and 2019 RMP re-submittals:\n\n?\t100-Unit demolished, removing ammonia service"

A trained incident commander is on duty 24 hours per day.  A drills schedule is developed annually which includes at least one evacuation drill and other drills which test the primary components of our plan (e.g., chemical shelter in place, severe weather, etc.)  Alarm systems are also periodically tested.  All personnel are trained on the relevant aspects of the ERP.  \n\nWorst Case and Alternative Case Release Scenarios\n\nThe RMP rule provides detailed requirements that define a worst case scenario, namely a release of the entire contents of the largest storage vessel occurring under very stable weather conditions and at a low wind speed.  EPA notes that the worst case scenario is designed principally to support a dialogue between the source and the community on release prevention, and not to serve as the sole or primary basis for emergency planning.  Based on previous site history, in addition to the several layers of protection in place, the worst case scenarios is highly unlikely to actually occur.\n\nThe site worst case scenario is documented and is based on the detailed requirements for worst case scenarios as prescribed by the RMP rule.\n\nThe RMP rule also defines the alternative release scenario.

The site complies with OSHA\u0092s Process Safety Management (PSM) rule, which is nearly identical to EPA\u0092s Risk Management Program (RMP) rule. Additionally, the site follows corporate and site-specific safety standards (which in some cases are more stringent than the OSHA general safety standards) while also complying with other applicable Federal, State, and Local regulations and standards.  The following items are part of our ongoing program to prevent releases and incidents for RMP chemicals as well as any other chemicals:  \n\n?\tEmployee Participation:  Employees are involved in many activities to continuously improve site EH&S performance.   Participation includes, but is not limited to, audits, design and pre-startup safety reviews, process hazard analysis, training, procedure development, incident investigations, and various site teams.\n\n?\tProcess Hazard Analysis:  Various process hazard analysis techniques are used to identify and analyze the potential hazards associated with chemicals and processes.

      "SummaryText": "Rohm and Haas Chemicals LLC - Knoxville Site\nEPA Risk Management Plan (RMP) Executive Summary\n\nIntroduction \n\nThe Rohm and Haas Chemicals LLC Knoxville site is a manufacturing facility located in Knoxville, Tennessee.  Rohm and Haas first came to Tennessee in 1943 as part of the national defense effort in World War II.  In a government-owned facility, the company began production of Plexiglas acrylic sheet for use in American military aircraft.  Following the war, Rohm and Haas purchased the Knoxville facility and expanded its production capabilities to include acrylic polymers.\nAlthough no longer a Plexiglas manufacturer, the Knoxville site employees approximately 215 personnel and produces over 150 different products which are sold to other manufacturers who use them as key components in consumer products such as paints, laundry detergents, paper coatings, and non-woven binders.\nThe site contributes to a variety of charitable organizations within the community and works closely with its Community Advisory Panel (CAP) to identify and address needs and community concerns.\n\nWe are pleased to provide information on our safety and emergency preparedness plans, as well as the systems and training at Rohm and Haas designed to prevent accidental releases.\n\nThe EPA Risk Management Program\n\nIn a series of rules promulgated between 1994 and 1998, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency established the Risk Management Program (RMP) under Clean Air Act Section 112(r).  The RMP contains a list of toxic and flammable chemicals.  Facilities that manage more than a threshold amount of a listed chemical may be subject to the RMP.  Covered facilities must assess the risks associated with their management of the listed chemicals and produce a plan to prevent releases and incidents.  In order to assist in emergency planning, covered facilities must evaluate \u0093worst case\u0094 and \u0093alternative case\u0094 scenarios that would result from the release of a listed chemical.  Finally, the covered fac"
