Describe Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Policies\n\nThis company recognizes management's responsibility in protecting it's employees, equipment, property and the environment.\nThe safety and health of all personnel are very important. The control of accidents has been and will continue to be a basic responsibility of all personnel in the facility.\n\nTo accomplish the Company's goal in controlling accidental losses, the facility has established a Plant Safety Program.\nThe objectives of this program are to achieve maximum efficiency and safety performance.\n\nOne of the activities associated with the Plant Safety Program has been the development and implemenation of accidental release prevention and emergency programs which are designed to comply with OSHA's Process Safety Managenment standard\n(29CFR 1910.119) and EPA's Risk Management Program (40CFR Part 68 ).\n\nThe purpose of the accidental release prevention and emergency response program is to prevent the occurence , and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of toxic substances as well as fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic events.\n\n\nB.   Stationary Source and Regulated Substance Handled\n\nThis company operates a food production facility at this location. The facility operates one ammonia refrigeration system to provide cooling and freezing capabilities. The amount of ammonia ( CAS#7662-47-7) contained in the system is in excess of 10,000 pounds.Since an ammonia release from the system could pose a risk of offsite public impact, and the system is regulater under the OSHA PSM standard, the system is subject to the Program 3 requirements of the EPA's Risk Management Program.\n\nIn the ammonia refrigeration system, ammonia vapor is fed from vessels at low pressures to stage compressors. The compressed vapors from the low stage compressors are fed to vessels operating at intermediate pressures and then fed to the high stage compressors"

      "ESSeqNum": 1,
      "FacilityID": 45503,
      "SummaryText": ". The high pressure ammonia vapor flows from the high stage compressors to the condensers where heat is removed, trurning the vapor into a high pressure liquid. The high pressure liquid from the condensers is collected in a high pressure receiver.\n\nThe high pressure liquid collected in the high pressure receiver is circulated to various pressure vessels, where it is pumped to evaporators ( storage tanks, freezers, air handling units, etc.) located throughout the plant. The ammonia liquid absorbs heat at these various evaporatoprs, changing from liquid to a vapor.The low pressure vapor is then sent back to the appropriate vessel and the cycle repeats itself.\n\n\nC.   Summary of Worst Case and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nThe worst-case release scenario at the facility is a release of pressurized liquid ammonia from the 60 inch by 14 foot High Pressure Receiver located in the Ammonia Compressor Room. The Receiver has a capacity of 10,000 pounds of ammonia. However the plant has administrative controls in place that limit the inventory in that receiver to a maximum of 40% of the capacity. Therefore the worst-case release would involve the release of 4142 pounds of ammonia over a ten minute period due to the failure of the receiver. The ammonia could travel 0.99 miles before dispersing enough to no longer pose a hazard to the public.\n\nThe worst-case senario is unlikely for the following reasons:\n\n1.  Industry standards were followed for the manufacture of this receiver.\n2.  Ammonia is not corrosive in this service.\n3.  Pressure safety relief valves limit operating pressures in this receiver.\n4.The facility has a P.M. program to maintain the integrity of pressure vessels.\n5.The system is maintained and operated by qualified personnel, and\n6.The facility has dual pressure sensors that shut the system down before reaching the pressure of the relief valves.\n\n\nThe alternative release scenario involves the release of 1325 pounds of ammonia over a five minute period due to the"

The ammonia could travel 0.31 miles before dispersing enough to no longer pose a hazard to the public.\n\nThe alternative release scenario is unlikely for the following reasons:\n\n\n\n1. The recirculative liquid lines are in areas that could help contain such a release.\n2. Industry standards were followed in the manufacture of these lines.\n3.Ammonia is not corrosive in this service.\n4.The facility has a P.M. program to maintain the integrity of the system.\n5. The system is maintained and operated by qualified personnel, and \n6.The facility has procedures in place to stop flow promotion devices in the refrigeration system quickly.\n\n\nD.  Description of the Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe prevention program consists of the following elements:\n\n1. Employee Participation: The program involves the employees in establishing and implementing the program.The employees were involved in all process hazard analysis and have access to the program.\n2. Process Safety Information: information has been collected which enables employees to identify and understand the potential hazards in the system. Information includes MSDS and the design of the system.\n3. Process Hazard Analysis: An involved study using the \" What-If Technique \" has been conducted to look at the system and identify potential hazards.\n4. Operating Procedures: Procedures have been developed to safely operate the ammonia system.\n5. Training: A training program has been established to train employees in the safe operation and maintenance of the ammonia system.\n6. Contractors: All contractors are evaluated before they perform work on the ammonia system.\n7. Pre-Startup Safety Review: A pre-startup review is conducted for all new projects to verify that all safety programs are in place, that training has been performed and construction completed according to design standards before the project is put in"
