LA PORTE PLANT RMP EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES:\n\n\n\nAt the La Porte Plant, we are committed to operating and maintaining all of our processes in a safe and responsible manner. We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public as well as protection of the environment. This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including:\n\n\n\n* A description of the La Porte plant and use of substances regulated by EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP) regulation\n\n* An overview of our accidental release prevention programs\n\n* A five-year accident history for accidental releases of chemicals regulated by EPA's RMP rule\n\n* An overview of our emergency response program\n\n* An overview of improvements made at the La Porte plant to minimize the potential for accidental chemical releases that could adversely affect our employees, the public, and the environment\n\n* Certifications in accordance with RMP rule\n\n* Relevant details about the La Porte plant's risk management program\n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES:\n\n\n\nThe site includes unit operations to produce polypropylene and polyethylene products using multiple chemicals including RMP regulated substances.   \n\n\n\nOur accidental release prevention programs and our contingency planning efforts help us effectively manage the hazards to employees, the public, and the environment otherwised posed by these chemicals.\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS:\n\n\n\nThe centerpiece of the accident release and prevention program at the La Porte plant is Process Safety Management. This is a fully comprehensive prevention program designed to prevent accidental releases of hazardous chemicals. We take a systematic, proactive approach"

Our management systems address each of the key features of successful prevention programs including:\n\n\n\n* Process safety information\n\n* Process hazard analysis\n\n* Operating procedures\n\n* Training\n\n* Mechanical integrity\n\n* Management of change\n\n* Pre-startup safety review\n\n* Compliance audits\n\n* Incident investigation\n\n* Employee participation\n\n* Hot work permit\n\n* Contractors\n\n\n\nWe actively encourage participation by all employees in process safety management. Relevant process safety information is readily available to employees. Employees participate in PHA studies and PHA revalidation studies consistent with our Management of Change Program. Procedures provide the knowledge necessary for employees to perform their jobs safely and correctly. Employee suggestions for improvement are encouraged. Experienced employees are involved in training. Employees and contractors are trained and are included in the investigation of incidents and accidents.\n\n\n\nAs prescribed by our Management of Change procedure, Pre-Startup Safety Reviews are designed to ensure the safety of process operations following new installations or modifications.  Our Mechanical Integrity Program includes written procedures governing the inspection and maintenance of affected process equipment.  The La Porte Plant also has developed and implements a Hot Work Permit procedure to prevent performance of hot work in potentially dangerous areas.\n\n\n\nThrough implementation of these multiple elements of our prevention program, the Plant  minimizes accidental chemical releases. In order to enhance and reinforce the Plant and employee commitments to the standards underlying these management systems, the Company has established both specific accountability and controls for implementation of these systems in support of the Plant's high standards for accident prevention.\n\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\n\n\n\nWe keep records for any significant accidental chemica"

R. 68.42(a), or that have had an adverse impact on employees, the community, or the environment.  If an incident governed by 40 C.F.R. 68.42(a) were to occur, we would conduct formal incident investigations designed to identify and address the root cause.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM:\n\n\n\nWe have developed and maintain an emergency response plan which includes planning and training elements for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations. Furthermore, we coordinate our plan with the Channel Industries Mutual Aid (CIMA) and local emergency planning committee (LEPC).\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nBraskem believes in a philosophy of continuous improvement. A number of programs are in place to monitor the status of ongoing efforts and continually seek opportunities to improve. The La Porte plant maintains employee safety teams that meet regularly and a structured safety process.\n\n\n\nThe Company's current plans to further enhance safety practices during 2020 include improvements and updates to the site's life critical procedures and associated training curriculum, as well as the addition of new four-gas meters in support of safe work permitting across the site (meters driven by the VPP team).\n\n\n\nREVISION OF SITE MAXIMUM INTENDED INVENTORY\n\n\n\nExisting onsite inventory within the polypropylene process is being modified due to the construction of a new operating line within this process. As a result, the amount of propylene and ethylene onsite will be increased.  The amount of propylene was already above its threshold quantity.  Under certain operating conditions, the amount of ethylene will now be above its threshold quantity.   Separately, ethane storage has been removed from the site as well as the capability to add ethane to the idled proces"
