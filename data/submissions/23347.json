The process units and storage tanks have been inspected as necessary prior to the introduction of hydrocarbons into the facility.  During the month of April 2000, the facility staff performed a thorough safety analysis of each skid using the HAZOP methodology.\n\nSince the facility is an OSHA covered facility, the various skids have undergone the initial Process Hazards Analysis (PHA).  The initial PHAs and subsequent safety analyses included employee participation at the unit operator level.\n\nThe facility has a policy of periodic mechanical integrity inspections, depending on the type of equipment.  The safety relief valves that protect vessels, tanks and piping systems, are integral parts of this program.  The last mechanical integrity inspection of the product storage tank was conducted in the fabrication shop.\n\n\nThe five year accident history.\n\nThe Chalmette Cryogenic Gas Processing Plant is a new facility, and , hence, there is no five year accident history.\n\nThe emergency action plan.\n\nThe Chalmette Cryogenic Gas Processing Plant maintains a written emergency action plan, which is in place to help protect worker and public safety as well as the environment.  The emergency action plan is designed to address the facility's main hazard - the hazard of fires and/or explosions.  The responsibilities for various functions during the emergency are clearly defined in the response plan.  Gathering places (primary and secondary staging areas, as well as, one off-site staging area) for employees evacuated from the control room and plant area by the emergency conditions are also listed.\n\nThe action plan contains reporting procedures for employees when the fire is too"

The plan identifies steps to be taken in case of an accidental release including first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, and notification of local emergency response agencies. Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary based on their specific emergency duties.  The emergency action plan is updated when necessary based on modifications made to the process or other Plant facilities.\n\nThe overall emergency action plan for the facility has been coordinated with the St. Bernard Parish Fire Department.  This coordination includes meetings with the Fire Department personnel.  The facility is manned 24 hours a day and has around-the-clock communications capability with the Fire Department.  This interface provides the means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident. \n\n\nPlanned changes for improved safety.\n\nSince the facility is a new plant, there are no planned changes for improved safety at this time.\nExecutive Summary\r\nfor the\r\nGulf Liquids New River Project, LLC\r\nChalmette Cryogenic Gas Processing Plant - Risk Management Plan\r\n\r\n\r\nFacility description and the regulated substances handled.\r\n\r\nGulf Liquids New River Project, LLC (GLNRP), a Delaware limited liability company, has contracted with Exxonmobil Chalmette Refining, LLC for the extraction, transportation, and fractionation of the refinery products from two liquid hydrocarbon streams and two refinery gas streams.  GLNRP has installed a cryogenic gas processing plant at the Chalmette Refinery, an eighty mile long 10 pipeline from Chalmette to Geismar, LA and a fractionation facility in Geismar.  Total investment for the three components was $ 115,000,000.  Present personnel complement is 26 for the operations and maintenance activities.

The first is saturated off-gas and the second is unsaturated off-gas.  These gas streams are processed through compression and low temperature separation to extract natural gas liquids (NGL's).  The natural gas liquids are then pumped into a transmission pipeline to Gulf Liquids New River Project, LLC's Fractionation Plant in Geismar, LA.  The Cryogenic Gas Processing Plant returns residual gas and hydrogen to the Chalmette Refinery.  This facility also receives a hydrocarbon liquid consisting of Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) and/or commercial butane.  This small hydrocarbon liquid stream is pumped directly into the product pipeline to the Geismar Fractionation Plant.  The product is stored in a small 15,000 gallon product surge tank prior to injection into the transmission pipeline.\r\n\r\nThe flammable worst case scenario to be reported is the scenario of the release of the entire product surge tank contents (at 100% level) and a subsequent vapor cloud explosion at or near the product surge vessel.  This was chosen as the worst case scenario because the product surge tank is the largest single vessel which contains the flammable product under pressure.\r\n\r\nThe flammable alternate case scenario to be reported is that of a rupture of a 2 LPG (propane) truck unloading hose at the truck unloading area near the South property line of the facility.  This alternate (or more likely) case scenario was chosen because of its proximity to the property line and the fact that if it should occur, the consequence would have very limited offsite impact.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at the facility.\r\n\r\nGulf Liquids New River Project, LLC has developed an overall safety and health policy to prevent accide"

This policy is supported by many programs such as, the compliance with OSHA's 1910.119 Process Safety Management regulation which includes communication of risks and hazards to the employees and contractors, the development of an employee training, certification and retraining program with written operating procedures.

GLNRP has installed a cryogenic gas processing plant at the Chalmette Refinery, an eighty mile long 10 pipeline from Chalmette to Geismar, LA and a fractionation facility in Geismar.  Total investment for the three components was $115,000,000.  Present personnel complement is 26 for the operations and maintenance activities.  Future growth plans include a cryogenic gas processing plant at the Motiva Enterprises, LLC, Convent Refinery and an Refinery Grade Propylene Splitter system at the Geismar Fractionation Facility.\n\nThe Chalmette Cryogenic Gas Processing Plant receives Chalmette Refining's off-gas in two streams.  The first is saturated off-gas and the second is unsaturated off-gas.  These gas streams are processed through compression and low temperature separation to extract natural gas liquids (NGL's).  The natural gas liquids are then pumped into a transmission pipeline to Gulf Liquids New River Project, LLC's Fractionation Plant in Geismar, LA.  The Cryogenic Gas Processing Plant returns residual gas and hydrogen to the Chalmette Refinery.  This facility also receives a hydrocarbon liquid consisting of Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) and/or commercial butane.  This small hydrocarbon liquid stream is pumped directly into the product pipeline to the Geismar Fractionation Plant.  The product is stored in a small 15,000 gallon product surge tank prior to injection into the transmission pipeline.\n\nThe flammable worst case scenario to be reported is the scenario of the release of the entire product s"

The emergency action plan is designed to address the facility's main hazard - the hazard of fires and/or explosions.  The responsibilities for various functions during the emergency are clearly defined in the response plan.  Gathering places (primary and secondary staging areas, as well as, one off-site staging area) for employees evacuated from the control room and plant area by the emergency conditions are also listed.\r\n\r\nThe action plan contains reporting procedures for employees when the fire is too large to be extinguished by a portable handheld fire extinguisher.  The plan identifies steps to be taken in case of an accidental release including first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, and notification of local emergency response agencies. Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary based on their specific emergency duties.  The emergency action plan is updated when necessary based on modifications made to the process or other Plant facilities.\r\n\r\nThe overall emergency action plan for the facility has been coordinated with the St. Bernard Parish Fire Department.  This coordination includes meetings with the Fire Department personnel.  The facility is manned 24 hours a day and has around-the-cloc"
