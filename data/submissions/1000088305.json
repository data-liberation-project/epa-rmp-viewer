The PSM program is in compliance with Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), Process Safety Management (PSM) of 29 CFR 1910.119. Employees and management participate and cooperate in the PSM program to maintain a work environment that is safe to employees, the community, and the environment.\n\n \n\nThe facility has developed an Emergency Action Plan with the responsibility to notify the Goodbe and Mandeville Fire Departments of an incident for a timely response.  Trained Diversified Foods and Seasonings personnel will initiate safety systems as they evacuate to minimize the impact of the emergency. Once the Fire Department arrive on-scene they will assume the role of Incident Commander and have control the incident. \n\n \n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n \n\nThis food processing facility operates a two-stage, anhydrous ammonia (R-717) refrigeration system.  Anhydrous ammonia (R-717) refrigerant is a Group II refrigerant. \n\n \n\nEngine room electrical classification is NEMA-1. \n\n\n\nThere are some mitigating measures in place. Although there are doors and windows, the overall enclosure acts as a dike creating liquid pooling and limiting the liquid run-off. Ammonia leak detection is installed in this area that sounds alarms and starts emergency ventilation. The emergency ventilation is automatically controlled and discharges the engine room air through the roof which creates a lower level of concentration in the engine room for responders. It also starts air dispersion at lower concentration levels and disperses the ammonia with greater air turbulence. \n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS \n\n \n\nThis facility follows the OSHA Process Safety Management Program. Various special elements have been"

Following is an overview. \n\n\n\nEmployee Participation -The Employee Participation Program is an asset to both employees at the site and to the community as a whole. As a general rule, employees who are fully involved have a greater sense of responsibility; they are more likely to catch the problems that can cause accidents. Employee awareness is for employees, not directly involved with the process, this includes knowing the hazards, the safety rules, warning signs, and evacuation procedures. All employees have access to the PSM Program. Involved employees participate directly in every phrase of the PSM program, including conducting the PHA, developing or reviewing operating procedures, reviewing incident investigations, and conducting mechanical integrity and compliance audits.\n\n \n\nCommunity involvement is through coordination and cooperation with the local Fire department and LEPC. \n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information - Process Safety Information includes a wide variety of books, manuals, and process information. These are available to employees that operate, maintain, or repair the process equipment or piping. There are three major categories of information: ammonia data such as MSDS, safety information, first aid, chemical properties, IIAR safety bulletins, etc.; process information such as piping & instrumentation diagrams (P&ID's), block flow diagram, mass flow balance, design codes and standards, pressure safety relief settings, safety system/devices, ventilation system design, operating procedures, safe operating limits, and ramification of process deviation; and process equipment information such as equipment specifications, electrical classifications, materials of construction, installation manuals, operating and maintenance manuals, and manufacturer's manuals.\n\n \n\nProcess Hazard Analysis -A Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) was completed using the \"What-if\" technique. This addressed"

The results of the PHA were prioritized and incorporated into a PHA Findings Report for follow-up as a corrective action log. \n\n\n\nStandard Operating Procedures - SOPs are provided for each compressor, condenser, ammonia vessel and oil pot, and evaporator. Topics include general information such items as objectives, hazards, location, equipment needed, P&ID's, task flow diagrams, and step-by-step procedures with specific warnings and comments. The SOPs cover different phases of operations such as: initial startup; normal, temporary and emergency operations; emergency shutdowns; and startup following a shutdown. \n\n\n\nTraining - All employees are who are involved with anhydrous ammonia have been properly trained, at a minimum, in understanding the MSDS, routine refrigeration system operation, emergency refrigeration system operation, emergency and normal refrigeration safety practices, and, if appropriate, the individual's role in the emergency response plan.\n\n \n\nContractors - This site follows strict guidelines for qualifying contractors who directly influence the safety of the process or the system. The contractor qualification procedure ensures that contractors and their employees are fully aware of the potential dangers involved with the ammonia process, that contractors understand their responsibility and train their people, and that a contractor's safety record is considered in reviewing the bids.\n\n \n\nPre-Startup Review - Pre-startup safety reviews are required on all new or modified equipment/systems. This involves process safety information, process hazard analysis, training, safety procedures, operating procedures, and verification that construction and equipment are in accord with the design specifications.\n\n \n\nMechanical Integrity Audits - T"

These are performed on all compressors, condensers, evaporators, pressure vessels, piping system, relief and vent systems and devices, emergency shutdown systems, controls, and pumps.\n\n \n\nHot Work Permits - This permit process is to protect against fire, explosion and other dangers resulting from hot work (welding and cutting outside the designated areas). Hot work permits must be obtained before any work is done outside the shop area. The Maintenance Supervisor reviews and issues the permits to insure all fire prevention and protection rules are met. Permits indicate the appropriate dates and the work to be done. The permits are kept on file until workers have completed the hot work operations. \n\n\n\nManagement of Change - The Management of Change (MOC) procedure requires that all changes (even \"replacement in kind\") be reviewed to see if there is a possible negative effect. The MOC review addresses the \n\ntechnical basis for the change, the impact on safety and health, modifications to operating procedures, and authorization requirements for the proposed change. Employees affected by the change are informed of the change before startup and trained in the proper procedures. \n\n\n\nIncident Investigation - An incident investigation shall be performed any time there is an incident which resulted in, or which could reasonably have resulted in, a catastrophic release of ammonia. The purpose is to gain information that could prevent further accidents and to identify weaknesses in the emergency response plan that need to be addressed. Investigations are initiated promptly using a trained team. The findings and recommendations will be studied and appropriate corrective action taken. \n\n\n\nEmergency Action Plan - This facility has a comprehensive emergency action plan that meets established criteria. This plan will be provided to the local fire departments "

A release was also recorded in December 2015 involving a limited release of ammonia inside the spiral freezer whereby a motor fell from a conveyor belt onto the evaporator fan shroud which bent and contacted the fan blades shattering them and sending pieces into the coil rupturing it.  There were two releases in 2018. One release was the result of a faulty safety relief device. The second release was due to human error when a contractor failed to isolate and pump-down equipment prior to opening the equipment to the atmosphere.\n\n \n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM \n\n\n\nThis facility has an Emergency Action Plan (EAP). The EAP defines the sequence of actions to be taken by facility employees in the event of an accidental release of hazardous materials.  This EAP has been communicated to the Goodbe Fire Department, the Mandeville Fire Department, and the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC). \n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n \n\nThe Diversified Foods and Seasonings, Inc., Madisonville facility is proactive on performing audits and hazard analysis per their Process Safety Management and Risk Management programs.  Any areas for improvement during these audits and hazard analysis are identified and corrective actions are recommended. "
