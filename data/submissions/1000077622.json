The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\nOwensboro Specialty Polymers maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.  Some examples of the process safety information included Safety Data Sheets (SDS) on all raw materials and products, Equipment Specification Sheets, and Process Instrumentation and Design drawings (P&ID).\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis\r\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses is Checklist and Whatif.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of not greater than five (5) years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner. The most recent PHA/update was performed on 9-21-2018\r\n\r\nOperating Procedures\r\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Owensboro Specialty Polymers maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\r\n\r\nTraining\r\nOwensboro Specialty Polymers has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.

(OSP) are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\r\n\r\n\r\n2.\tThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\r\nOur facility's primary activities encompass the production of various latex polymers, NAICS code 325211 (formerly Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) Code 2821).  We have 2 regulated substances present at our facility.  These substances include Acrylonitrile  [2-Propenenitrile] and Vinylidene chloride [Ethene, 1,1-dichloro-].  The regulated substances at our facility are involved in several uses.  Acrylonitrile and Vinylidene Chloride are used for manufacturing liquid latex emulsion polymers.\r\n\r\nThe total quantities handled/stored for each regulated substance, used for determination of Offsite Consequence Analysis (OCA), are - Vinylidene chloride [Ethene, 1,1-dichloro-] is 403,600 lb., and Acrylonitrile  [2-Propenenitrile] is 67,200 lb.  A summary description of each of the production processes is set forth below. \r\n\r\n3.\tPolyvinylidene Chloride (DARAN)\r\n\r\n     a.\tProcess Description: Emulsion polymerizations of 1,1-Dichloroethylene with other monomers such as acrylonitrile and various acrylates.   Polyvinylidene Chloride emulsions are high barrier, flexible, crystalline polymers designed for coating paper, paperboard, plastic films and metal.  Polyvinylidene Chloride is made in glass-lined or stainless steel reactors by semi-batchwise emulsion polymerization.\r\n\r\n     b.\tPrimary Equipm"
