ANPI's prevention program reduces the likelihood of a hazardous substance release by implementing the Occupational Safety and Helath Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard.  Although not all processes are considered covered by the PSM standard, ANPI's PSM process applies to all five production units: 1) Ammonia Unloading and Storage Area, 2) Nitric Acid Plant (AOP3), 3) Nitric Acid Plant (AOP4), 4) Liquid Ammonium Nitrate (LAN) Plant,and 5) Prilled Ammonium Nitrate Plant.  ANPI prevention program elements are, therefore, reported on a unit-by-unit basis.",

      "SummaryText": "1.0 INTRODUCTION\n\nApache Nitrogen Products, Inc. (ANPI) manufactures nitrogen - based chemical products for the mining and agricultural industries. ANPI (formally the Apache Powder Company) has been manufacturing at its Cochise County facility since 1922. ANPI has implemented the Risk Management Program (RMP) in accordance with Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 68. \n\n2.0 SOURCE AND PROCESS DESCRIPTION\n\nANPI converts anhydrous ammonia into various ammonium nitrate products.  There is one manufacturing process at ANPI consisting of five interconnected production units: 1) Ammonia Unloading and Storage Area, 2) Nitric Acid Plant AOP3, 3) Nitric Acid Plant AOP4, 4) Liquid Ammonium Nitrate (LAN) Plant, and 5) Prilled Ammonium Nitrate Plant. Different safeguards apply to different production units in ANPI?s manufacturing process.\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia is the only regulated substance present at the ANPI facility in an amount greater than the ?threshold quantity? as defined by 40 CFR Part 68. Anhydrous Ammonia is received at the facility by railcar. The railcars are unloaded into the Anhydrous Ammonia Unloading and Storage Area. Ammonia then is transferred to ANPI Nitric Acid Plants (AOP-3 and AOP-4). The resulting acid feeds into the LAN Plant where it is reacted with more ammonia to produce LAN. The majority of the LAN is pumped to the Prilled Ammonium Nitrate Plant where it is concentrated and converted from liquid into a solid. The remaining LAN is either sold directly to customers or converted in to fertilizer solution for the agricultural industry.\n\n3.0 SUMMARY OF MAJOR HAZARDS\n\nThe potential hazards associated with the manufacturing process are related to chemical releases, equipment failures, and process upsets. The nature of the hazard is related to the type of event or accident that could occur.\n\nRelevant onsite or facility hazards associated with the production units are reported in this document on a unity-by-unit basis. Major onsite hazards in"

      "SummaryText": "clude toxic release, fire, explosions, overpressurization, corrosion, overfilling, contamination, equipment failure, or loss of cooling, heating, electricity, or instrument air. \n\nThe relevant offsite hazard that could impact the local population and environment is also in this document. The major offsite hazard would arise from an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia gas resulting in a toxic vapor cloud. Whether a release of anhydrous ammonia poses a threat to health depends on the concentration of ammonia in the air and the duration of exposure. If individuals remain exposed to high concentrations of ammonia in the air for a long period of time, any or all of the following health effects could occur:\n1) eye contact: sever irritation, swelling, partial or total blindness; 2) skin contact: severe irritation, blisters; and 3) inhalation: difficulty breathing, lung damage, and death by suffocation. \n\n4.0 EXPLANATION OF HOW RELEASES ARE PREVENTED\n\nANPI?s RMP is designed to reduce the number and severity of potential hazardous substance releases. ANPI?s RMP focuses its primary prevention measures on anhydrous ammonia, the chemical that poses the greatest risk to offsite receptors near the ANPI facility. The frequency and severity of a hazardous substance release is reduced through the implementation of effective prevention, management, mitigation, and emergency response, measures in accordance with the following: 1) OSHA 1910.119 Process Safety Management, 2) 1910.111 Storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia, 3) 1091.38 Employee Emergency Plans and Fire Prevention, 4) ANSI K61.1, and Recognized and Generally Accepted Good Engineering Practices. \n\nANPI executive management and employees are committed to the safety of the employees, the community and the environment.\n\n4.1 Response actions in the Event of a Release\n\nIn the event of accidental release of a hazardous substance that could have an offsite consequences, ANPI response actions would include any or all of the "

      "SummaryText": "following: employing mitigation measures, implementing the ER Plan, notifying the community, notifying to perform shelter-in?place, or notification of evacuation from the affected area(s).\n\n4.2 Emergency Response Program (ERP)\n\nIn the event of a release, ANPI has a comprehensive ERP that is coordinated with the Cochise County Sheriff?s Department and the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC). The purpose of the ERP is to prevent or minimize the impact to on-plant personnel, offsite population, and the environment.\n\nIt is ANPI policy to maintain a current and accurate written ER Plan (ANPI document PSM-0012) for facility operations. ANPI ER Plan is updated annually as a minimum and is updated to reflect changes at the ANPI?s facility. ANPI employees are trained in any changes to the ER Plan. ANPI?s ER Plan addresses the elements of the RMP regulation.\n\n4.3 Emergency Response Training\n\nTraining is provided to ANPI employees for relevant ER procedures. In accordance with OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.120, initial 40-hour. ER Teams receive 8-hour refresher training, every quarter, for hazardous substance/waste operations and emergency response is provided. ANPI maintains a forty-plus member ER Team. ANPI Team is well trained and equipped to respond to onsite accidental hazardous substance release. ANPI has developed and manages an onsite Incident Command System (ICS) to be utilized during emergencies. The ICS includes the designation of responsibilities for ANPI personnel responding to on site emergencies. The ANPI ER Team and the Cochise County LEPC periodically participate in tabletop ER sessions and drills.   \n\n4.4 Community Notification System\n\nANPI has established an emergency notification system that utilizes a community-warning siren, Community Alert Network (CAN) telephone notification system, and   public radio announcement. In the event of a release, ANPI utilizes the CAN system to notify residences within a 1-mile radius of the ANPI Anhydrous Ammonia Unloadin"

ANPI community outreach program alerts and protects nearby residents in the event of an off-plant ammonia release. ANPI?s community outreach program:\n\n?Presents the basic health hazards associated with anhydrous ammonia\n?Explains how you will be notified in the event of an off-plant anhydrous ammonia release\n?Details the shelter-in-place protection procedures\n?Provides general information on evacuation, fundamental first aid, decontamination measures, and special assistance needs.\n\n5.0 FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n?ANPI had an accidental release of 388 pounds of NOx gas when an expansion joint failed that injured one employee on July 6, 1999.\n?ANPI had an accidental release of 645 pounds of anhydrous ammonia gas on August 28, 2000, when a side arm heater overpressurized causing the relief valve to lift. The CAN system was activated and the residents notified to shelter-in-place.\n\n6.0 PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY.\n\nANPI improves safety at the facility by continually evaluating training, written procedures, and contractors. Performing PHA on the process and updating the PSI. Emergency Response training is conducted every quarter instead of annually. \n\nANPI plans to revamp the Ammonia Unloading and Storage Area to improve safety by making the operation easier thereby reducing the chance for error."
