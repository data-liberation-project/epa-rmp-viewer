      "SummaryText": "ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\n\n\nThe ACE Cogeneration facility uses ammonia to help maintain air quality compliance of the emission stack, specifically, reducing NOx (NO and NO2) emissions.  Ammonia is a hazardous substance that must be handled properly in order to prevent accidental releases and injuries.  It is the policy of ACE Cogeneration Company to conduct all operations (including the ammonia DeNOx system) in a safe manner.  This policy extends to all employees and contractors at the facility.  ACE Cogeneration implements this policy towards chemical and general safety through on-going employee participation, training, written operating procedures, maintenance, inspections, safety committee meetings, and safety reviews/evaluations.  These programs are in effect at the facility to prevent the accidental release of ammonia.  In the event of an ammonia accident, the facility has an Emergency Response Plan to notify the appropriate authorities and safely evacuate the facility.\n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\n\n\nGeneral Overview\n\n\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is used at the ACE Cogeneration facility in the ammonia DeNOx system to help maintain air quality compliance of the emission stack, specifically, reducing NOx (NO and NO2) emissions. When in operating mode, the anhydrous ammonia system is automatically controlled based on system demand.  The anhydrous ammonia is stored in a 12,000 gallon Storage Tank inside a bermed containment area for the DeNOx system.\n\n\n\nThe DeNOx process occurs naturally with the ammonia mixing and reacting with the flue gas. Anhydrous ammonia is used as the reducing agent.  \n\n\n\nFacility Details\n\n\n\nThe DeNOx process begins with the flow of liquid ammonia from the Storage Tank through the vaporizers by natural circulation due to the difference in product densities.  In the event of low liquid levels, the ammonia is pulled from the Storage Tank to the vaporizers using the ammonia pump. Upon reaching the va"

      "SummaryText": "porizers, liquid ammonia is vaporized using three heaters located at each unit.  Except on extreme conditions, typically only one vaporizer is utilized at one time. Upon vaporization, the ammonia vapor returns to the Storage Tank, where it is pushed to the injection grid.   From the top of the Storage Tank, the ammonia vapor flows through the ammonia tank emergency shutoff valve, two pressure reduction regulators, a flow orifice, a flow control valve, a line shutoff valve, a check valve, and then splits to provide ammonia vapor to two identical injection grids.  The ammonia vapor is mixed with flue gas using the injection grid (distribution nozzles) at the cyclones inlet duct.  Each cyclone typically has two nozzles on the top and three nozzles on the inside and outside.   \n\n\n\nThe NOx in the flue gas reacts with ammonia to form harmless elemental nitrogen and water.  The elemental nitrogen and water remain in the flue gas as it passes through the stack to the atmosphere.  The goal of the process is to reduce NOx emissions exiting the stack to less than 104 lbs/hr.  \n\n \n\nAll ASME vessels are equipped with pressure relief valves (PRV).  The Storage Tank has a dual relief valve assembly with a relief setpoint of 265 psig.  The two ammonia vaporizers are equipped with single relief valves, which actuate at 265 psig.  The liquid/vapor supply and return lines connecting the Storage Tank and the Receiving and Transfer Station are also equipped with single relief valves which actuate at 400 psig.  All relief valves vent to the atmosphere. \n\n\n\nIn case of an ammonia leak, four ammonia sensing devices are located near the storage tank which provide a local alarm and an alarm in the control room.  ACE Cogeneration personnel and/or contractors circulate throughout the plant, taking note of unusual conditions in any portion of the system.  If a leak is detected or observed by any ACE Cogeneration employee (or contractor), it is immediately reported to the control room in order to"

The maximum intended inventory of ammonia is estimated at 10,320 gallons (60,800 pounds) which is 86% of the maximum capacity of the Storage Tank.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nIn order to operate the ammonia DeNOx system, the facility complies with the following risk management regulations:\n\n\n\n?    OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM);\n\n?    EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP); and\n\n?    California Accidental Release Prevention Program (CalARP). \n\n\n\nIn addition, common industry standards, policies, and procedures are utilized to ensure safe practices are being performed.  The ammonia system employed by the ACE Cogeneration facility is equipped with various system controls and status indicators intended to minimize potential ammonia related accidents and to allow operators to monitor system operations.  This monitoring system is comprised of pressure indicators, as well as other system safeguards and methods for allowing facility operators to effectively monitor and control operations.  Four ammonia sensors are employed around the Storage Tank. In the event a sensor detects ammonia, the detection system will alarm the Control Room operators at setpoints of 50 and 100 ppm.  A water deluge system surrounding the containment berm can be manually activated to help mitigate a release.  \n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nThere have been no significant releases of ammonia at the facility in the last five years (January 2007 - January 2012) that exceeded the Federal Reportable Quantity of 100 pounds or the state requirement mandating immediate reporting of any release or threatened release of a hazardous material.  In addition, there have been no injuries resulting from an ammonia release, nor any releases or \"near misses\" that warranted an internal incident investigation.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe facility has an Emergency Action Plan (EAP) in effect at the facility.  This EAP was d"

The EAP is reviewed and updated at least once per year to ensure compliance with the PSM, RMP, and CalARP regulations.  Facility personnel receive annual training regarding the emergency procedures.\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nA Process Hazard Analysis was performed on January 31, 2007 and was revalidated on January 12, 2012. The Process Hazard Analysis Revalidation generated mitigation measures (recommendations) to improve safety at the ACE Cogeneration facility located in Trona, California.  The mitigation measures include additional training, key maintenance-related tests/inspection, and enhanced emergency response policies and procedures.  The ACE Cogeneration Safety Committee is planning to complete several items, including the recommendations, over the next year, as a continual effort to provide a safe work environment for their employees.  These changes include the following items:\n\n1. Continue to train all employees in the facility Safety Plan/Programs.\n\n\n\n2. Continue to have employee involvement in Safety Plan Development.\n\n\n\n3. Continue employee involvement through safety team participation.\n\n\n\n4. Continue internal and external safety audits/inspections and implement changes as needed."
