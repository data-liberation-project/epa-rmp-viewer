The gas is received in one-ton containers and dissoved in water using vacuum feed chlorination with leak detection.  A gas detector and alarm system is connected to an automatic telephone dialer.  Two people unload a delivery truck with crane hoist, an approved lifting device.  Empty chlorine containers are exchanged by a team of two operators.  Self-contained breathing apparatus is available on-site.  The Adams County Hazardous Materials (HAZMAT) Response Team is the delegated first-responders and use an emergency response plan developed by the Adams County LEPC as a result of SARA III and EPCRA reporting.  Additionally, supported is provided by the Cumberland County HAZMAT team, if needed.  The release risk management program in place at the facility ensures that all equipment, including process and safety equipment, is in excellent working condition.  A call-out list assures that this is round-the-clock coverage of operations at the facility.",

      "SummaryText": " The Borough of Hanover Municipal Authority owns a potable water treatment and distribution system for the Borough of Hanover and some surrounding communities, located in York and Adams Counties, Pennsylvania.  This system is operated by the Borough of Hanover.  The Hanover Municipal Water Works Filter Plan, located at 235 Old Hanover Road, processes up to 11 million gallons per day of water drawn from the South Branch of the Conewego Creek to yield potable water.  Treatment processes at the Plant include pretreatment, coagulation, flocculation, sedimentation, filtration, fluoridation, and chlorine disinfection.  Chemical addition is utilized to control taste, odor, and corrosion.  The Plant is typically operated 24 hours per day, Monday through Saturday, with 8-hour coverage on Sundays and major holidays.\n\n    The Water Works Filter Plant includes a Chlorination Room, which contains four (4) one ton cylinders of chlorine liquefied under pressure, chlorinators, various safety equipment, and instrumentation consisting of flow recorders, electrical panels, and a gas detector/alarm unit.  The chlorinator system uses remote vacuum actuated feed lines and has high pressure regulators attached directly to the chlorine vessel gas valves to mitigate high pressure gas releases through the chlorinator system.  Water treatment operators regularly check the room and its equipment, inventory the rate of chlorine use and adjust the rate as necessary.  The maximum intended inventory of chlorine gas for planning purposes is 8,000 pounds.\n\nAtmospheric dispersion modeling was performed using the RMP*Comp program distributed by the Chemical Emergency Preparedness and Prevention Office of the United States Environmental Protection Agency.  This model determines the distance traveled by chlorine released until its concentration decreases to the A?toxic endpointA? of 0.0087 mg/L.  The chlorine toxic endpoint of 0.0087 mg/L in air represents the American Industrial Hygiene Association Emerge"

This amount corresponds to 3.0 parts per million by volume.\n\nThe Borough of Hanover Municipal Water Works Filter Plant Accidental Release Prevention Program is based upon the following elements:\n\n1.    High level of training for the operators;\n\n2.    Preventative maintenance program for equipment;\n\n3.    Use of modern process and safety equipment;\n\n4.    Use of accurate and effective standard operating procedures, written with the participation of the operators;\n\n5.    Performance of a Hazard Review of the equipment and procedures; and\n\n6.    Implementation of an auditing and inspection program.\n\nChemical specific prevention steps include availability of self contained breathing apparatus (SCBA), awareness of the hazards and toxic properties of chlorine, and the presence of a chlorine gas detector connected to an alarm and telephone dialer.\n\n    Based on available information, there has not been an accidental release of chlorine in more than 35 years. Therefore, there have been no accidental releases of chlorine within the 5 year review period.\n\n    The facility has an emergency response program that has been reviewed and coordinated by the Adams County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania.  The operation and response procedures are reviewed and updated on an annual basis by the Adams County LEPC.  The Adams County Defensive Hazardous Materials (HAZMAT) Response Team is the designated first-responder in the event of a chlorine leak incident.

The Cumberland County HAZMAT team is state certified and undergoes extensive training in dealing with a variety of hazardous material incidents, including chlorine gas leaks.  \n\nRecommendations to improve safety were made following a May 12, 2009 inspection of the disinfection systems by the Borough's Consulting Engineer.  These recommendations included improvements to written emergency standard operating procedures, and the development of an operator training program which provides annual refresher training on proper safety and handling of chlorine, as well as chlorine leak response procedures.\n\n"
