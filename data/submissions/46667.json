For alternative release scenario analysis, we have also used the RMP Pro-98 Program incorproating the look-up tables and equations provided by the EPA in the RMP offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario and alternate release senario(s) for each toxic substance are part of the data package. \n\nOne alternative release scenario has been submitted for each toxic substance present in Program 2 and Program 3 processes cumulatively.\n\n4.\tThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-58 Standard, 1967 Edition.    The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nArr Maz Custom Chemicals maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses are the HAZOP and the What If/Check List.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering"

These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nTraining\nArr Maz Custom Chemicals has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Refresher training is provided at least every three (3) years and more frequently as needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nOur facility carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nManagement of Change\nWritten procedures are in place at Arr Maz Custom Chemicals to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures.  Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification.\n\nPre-st"

Due to our stringent release prevention policies, there has been no accidental release during this period.\n\n6.\tEmergency Response Plan\nArr Maz Custom Chemicals carries a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials.  As part of the Beaufort County Local Emergency Response Committee (LEPC) actions, the plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas.\n\nTo ensure proper functioning, our emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced.  In addition, the plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within our processes that would require a modified emergency response.\n\nBeaufort County LEPC is the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) with which our emergency plan has been coordinated and verified.\n\n7.\tPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\nSeveral developments and findings have resulted from the implementation of the various elements of our accidental release prevention program. Existing dike systems have been modified and some new dikes constructed around those chemicals that are affected by the RMP Program.

This commitment continues to be demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  \n\n2.\tThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities encompass High Technology Chemical Manufacturing.  We have 5 regulated substances present at our facility.  These substances include Oleum (Fuming Sulfuric acid), Methyl chloroformate, Formaldehyde,  Ammonia, and Ethyl Chloride.  These regulated substances at our facility are involved in several uses.  Oleum (65% solution) and Formaldehyde (37% solution) are used to manufacture a water based additive.  Methyl chloroformate (97% solution) is used for manufacturing Herbicides.  Ammonia (29% solution) is used both for Herbicide and Dye & Pigment manufacturing.  Ethyl Chloride (30% solution) is a recycle stream generated by one of the Herbicide processes.\n\nThe maximum expected inventory for each chemical contained on-site is listed as part of the data package.\n\n3.\tThe Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario("
