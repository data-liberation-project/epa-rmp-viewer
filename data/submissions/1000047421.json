To prevent accidental releases Schirm has worked closely with local responders for many years and particularly involved them during design and construction of the facilities handling the RMP regulated substance. The facility operating procedures are intended minimize the possibility of any kind of upset or malfunction (i.e., help ensure safe operation).  In the event there were some sort of malfunction, the emergency response procedures are designed to minimize hazards to human health and to the environment: in the event of spills, fires, explosion or any sudden release of hazardous substance to air, soil, or surface water.\r\n\r\nExamples of Schirm's commitment to safety particularly to the process subject to RMP include the fact that during design and construction local emergency responders were asked to provide input.  Also, Schirm identified potential operators in early phases of plant design. These operators were present during the design and construction and even provided some input. Having the intimate knowledge of the plant helps these operators to be better operators and more aware of potential safety problems. In addition, numerous equipment redundancies and safeguards including automation of many tasks to help minimize the possibility of human error have been included in the plant which are aimed totally at increasing the safety of the plant. Such extra measures required a large commitment of resources and help demonstrate a strong commitment to safety.\r\n\r\nAlthough very familiar with the facility, operating personnel are given emergency response training specific to the subject facilities over"

      "SummaryText": "and above the regular emergency response training. \r\n\r\nThe Facilities and Regulated Substances\r\nIncorporated originally as Agriculture Warehouse, Inc. in 1976, Schirm USA, Inc., was formed to serve the Agricultural Chemical Industry with Warehousing, Formulation and Packaging, as a third party for several industry clients. Whether solid or liquid, formulation involves various ingredients being mixed together either in a blender-type device or in a stirring-type device. This is a mixing operation. \r\n\r\nAnother facet of the business (in addition to formulating) involves re-packaging of many of the same products. The re-packaging normally involves receiving finished product from our clients in bulk format and loading it into specialized consumer-d packaging according to customer specification. \r\n\r\nNone of the above activities involve complex chemical reactions.\r\n\r\nThe two facilities subject to the Risk Management Plan (RMP) requirements were newly constructed in 2008 and added a new type of process to the activities performed at the Schirm site, namely reacting chemicals. The RMP chemical involved is Isopropylamine (IPA).\r\n\r\nOne of the facilities associated with this process is a storage tank for Isopropylamine (IPA) CAS No.: 75-31-0. This tank has a total capacity of about 29,000 gallons however, the maximum to be stored is approximately 26,000 gallons. The other facility is a process area which includes reactors in which a chemical reaction (acid-base) actually occurs and a new product (salt) is\r\nformed.\r\n\r\nIn the processing area, to process a batch, a measured amount of water is added to the reactor initially.  One half of the concentrated wetcake (acid) material needed for a batch is added into the reactor by mechanical augering.  After an amount of the concentrated wetcake is added to the reactor, isopropylamine (IPA) (base) is added at a fairly constant rate through a dip tube with an associated valve system beginning the reaction.  After the first reaction is com"

After the second reaction has stabilized, a final amount of water is added to achieve the desired pH and assay.\r\n\r\nThe reaction is exothermic. Once the reaction begins, the temperatures in the reactor vessel will be higher than the boiling point of the IPA. The temperature of the reaction is primarily controlled by the feed rate of the IPA.  \r\n\r\nThe reactors are cooled by use of cooling water circulated through the coils on the reactors which will also help control the temperature of the reaction.  The heated cooling water is cooled by passing it through a 200 ton cooling tower. \r\n\r\nGases released from the each reactor first pass through a water scrubber which has provisions to reinject the material vaporized back in to the reactor. Gases passing through the water scrubber pass through an acid scrubber. The two scubbers nearly eliminate all of the gaseous pollutants.\r\n\r\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\r\nThese facilities are subject to the OSHA PSM standard therefore, enhanced chemical safety procedures are involved. The Schirm plant has been subject to the OSHA emergency response requirements for many years.\r\n\r\nBased primarily upon volumes involved, the risk of an accident involving IPA is much greater at the storage tank. IPA is pumped to the processing facility in measured amounts and is reacted quickly as it is added to the reactor. After addition to reactors, hazard from IPA is nearly eliminated under normal operating conditions.\r\n \r\nAt the storage tank, hazards are to be minimized by use of several procedural and equipment safeguards: \r\n\u00bf\tAdditional IPA is not supposed to be ordered unless the tank level is below the level that would accommodate a truckload of IPA thus helping to prevent over-filling. \r\n\u00bf\tThere are high level alarms attached to liquid level sensors that are mou"
