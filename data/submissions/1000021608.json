Under EPA guidelines, facilities that handle certain quantities of regulated chemicals must submit plans that show the consequences of hypothetical chemical releases.  Facilities must also outline their measures to reduce the risk of releases and minimize their effects.\n\nSeveral processes at the site are regulated by the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) requirements listed in 29 CFR Part 1910.119.  PSM and RMP complement each other in that PSM is concerned about the facility employees and RMP is concerned about the public and the environment.  Sun Chemical at the Bushy Park site is in full compliance with PSM requirements.  \n\nIII. RMP REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nSun Chemical will continue to use anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant in the purchased process areas. Previously, these areas were included in the Bayer RMP for anhydrous ammonia.  It is delivered via an overhead pipeline system from the CRP plant-wide distribution system.  Anhydrous ammonia when released to the atmosphere is a colorless gas with a strong pungent odor.  Exposure to anhydrous ammonia can irritate the eyes, nose and throat.  Exposure to extremely high levels can result in a buildup of fluid in the lungs and can be life threatening.\n\nSun Chemical will also continue to use methyl chloride to make an intermediate product in the manufacture of paint pigments in building C8-1. Methyl chloride when released to the atmosphere is a clear flammable gas with a sweet ether-like odor.  It is extremely flammable in the liquid and vapor state with an OSHA PEL of 100 PPM.  Inhalation is the primary potential route of exposure that causes depression of the central nervous system possibly leading to headache, nausea, vomiting, drowsiness, dizziness, diarrhea, and blurre"

Oleum is used in 1 process in Building C8-2 to produce a Pigment product #R6422.  The Oleum is mixed with 96% sulfuric acid to raise the strength of the acid to 98%.  Pigment powder is then dissolved into this mixture.  Oleum is also used in 2 separate processes in Building C9-1.  Building C9-1 is owned by Kemira Corporation.  Kemira uses the oleum to produce 2 Pigment crude acid pasting products.  In both products the oleum is mixed with 95% sulfuric acid to raise the concentration of the acid mixture to 97.5%.  The pigment crude powder is dissolved into this mixture.  The Oleum is pumped from the top of the tank directly from the bulk storage tank to the reaction vessels.  Flow rates, pounds charged, reactor levels,and temperatures are all monitored during the process.  Offloading is also continuously monitored.  The bulk storage tank pressure, temperature, and level are monitored.  The most likely point of failure would be a flange leak at the top of the tank, and maintenance does regular inspections on the header piping.\n\nIV. RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nA worst case scenario is included in the plan for anhydrous ammonia.  An alternative case scenario (or more likely scenario) is included in the plan for each of the three regulated substances.  \n\nSun Chemical uses anhydrous ammonia in several process buildings in chiller systems. One area, has a self contained chiller system that operates on its own anhydrous ammonia. This system contains anhydrous ammonia below the regulated quantity.  It has a backup supply connection to the CRP's operated site-wide anhydrous ammonia system in the event of a refrigeration unit failure.  Also, there is direct use areas of CRP supplied anhydrous ammonia.  The worst case scenario for Sun Chemical would be CRP's worst case since most of the liquid anhydrous ammonia is under CRP's con"

The anhydrous ammonia worst-case scenario is based on the complete failure of the largest process vessel in the LanXess system containing 36,200 pounds of liquid anhydrous ammonia.  A written operating procedure, high level alarm, and visual level display in the CRP's control room prevent the vessel from being operated with more than 36,200 pounds of liquid anhydrous ammonia.  The maximum distance for the most impacting hypothetical worst case release with no mitigating measures is 2.3 miles to the level of concern (LOC) or toxic end-point.  Several industrial, commercial, residential, public, and military facilities are in the potential impact area.\n\nToxic end-point or Level of Concern (LOC)\n\nThe Emergency Response Planning Guideline 2 - Level of Concern (ERPG2-LOC) is the maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals can be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or serious health effects, or symptoms which impair their ability to take protective action.  The release impact distance is the distance down wind to the ERPG2-LOC concentration.  The ERPG2-LOC for anhydrous ammonia is 0.14 mg/L or 200 parts per million (PPM).  The concentration (estimated from toxicity data) that is immediately dangerous to life and health (IDLH) for anhydrous ammonia is 300 PPM. The ERPG2-LOC for methyl chloride is 400 parts per million (PPM).\n\nAll scenarios evaluated used EPA's published model, RMPComp; to provide toxic end-point determinations and flammability impact based on EPA published levels of concern (LOC).  Other models did not provide satisfactory estimates for use in evaluating the maximum end-point distance.  Public and environmental protection requires conservative results.

The more likely scenario for each could involve a breach in the integrity of the piping system or operator error.  A flange leak or rupture could constitute a likely potential for a release of the regulated substance.  The ammonia piping system is constructed with welded pipe where a leak could not occur.  Flanged connections are used for pumps, vessel attachment and critical control valves so they can be taken out easily when repair or replacement is necessary.  \n\nThe methyl chloride and oleum piping system is similar.  The opportunity for leaks and/or ruptures is also reduced. The methyl chloride and oleum systems were part of the acquisition.  No accidents occurred before Sun Chemical to use as a history for handling. Similar systems in operation were included in the review.\n\nThe alternative scenario is a hypothetical release that is more realistic than the worst-case scenario.
