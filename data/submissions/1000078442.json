These programs enable our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of toxic substances as well as fires, explosion, and other types of catastrophic accidents.  Overall, these programs prevent accidental fatalities, injuries, illnesses and avoid physical property damage.\r\n\r\nOur safety program is applied to any activity involving hazardous chemicals including any use, storage, handling or the on-site movement of such chemicals, or combination of these activities.\r\n\r\nAny group of vessels which are interconnected and separated vessels which are located such that a hazardous chemical could be involved in a potential release shall be considered a single process.\r\n\r\nOur safety programs prevent accidents because they focus on the rules, procedures, and practices which govern individual processes, activities, or pieces of equipment.  These rules are detailed and improved as necessary.  They are also communicated to and accepted by all employees at the facility.\r\n\r\nThe plant's process entails processing of raw meat products is such a way as to prepare pre-formed and uncooked meat products for the fast food industry.
