      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n1.0    FACILITY DESCRIPTION\n\nThe HWRT Terminal ? N Little Rock, LLC (HWRT) facility is a terminal for the storage and distribution of various fuels.  Petroleum products (i.e., gasoline and diesel) are received by pipeline.  Transport trucks deliver ethanol and other additives to the facility.  Transport trucks then deliver the products to the facility?s customers.  HWRT has decided to replace an existing 30,000-gallon butane storage tank and add a butane injection process to the facility.  Butane has been identified by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency as a regulated substance subject to section 112 (r) of the Clean Air Act, which requires the preparation of this Risk Management Plan (RMP).  HWRT is also subject to the OSHA process safety management standard and is submitting a Program Level 3 Risk Management Plan.\n\nThe initial construction of the terminal facility was completed in 1965, which included construction of Tanks NLR-201 through NLR-204.  Additional tanks were constructed later.  HWRT purchased the terminal from Crown Central Petroleum Corporation in 2004.\n\nThe facility is located at 2626 Central Airport Road in North Little Rock, Arkansas.  The immediate vicinity is sparsely populated in an industrial area near Interstate Highway 40.  The facility has eleven fuel and additive storage tanks having capacities ranging from 250 gallons to 1.5 million gallons.  Each of these tanks is provided with adequate secondary containment.  \n\n2.0    PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nIt is HWRT?s policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local rules and regulations.  The owners and management of this facility regard employee and public safety as a very serious matter and have taken many precautions to maintain a safe working and public environment.  Some of these precautions include:\n\n?    Generating a Facility Response Plan (FRP);\n?    Generating a Spill, Prevention, Control and Countermeasure (SPCC) Plan;\n?    Instituting safe operating procedures;\n?    Training"

      "SummaryText": " employees in safety programs and procedures; and,\n?    Coordinating with the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).\n\nThe FRP includes information regarding emergency response, hazard identification, various discharge scenarios, descriptions of periodic drills and exercises, and describes employee training.  The SPCC Plan includes similar information as well as facility inspection forms.  Employees are typically provided with emergency response training, on-the-job training, spill prevention and spill response training, and other supplemental training.\n\n3.0    PROCESS DESCRIPTION\n\nThe proposed butane injection process is fairly simple.  Liquified butane gas will be delivered in tank trucks and pumped into the butane tank.  Butane is stored under ambient temperatures which can exceed 100 degrees F in the summer.  Butane will be injected into gasoline by pumping it into the pipeline as the gasoline is being delivered to HWRT.  HWRT also has the capability to bypass the storage tank and inject the butane directly from the delivery truck.\n\n4.0    WORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\nThe Clean Air Act risk management planning regulations require HWRT to prepare a worst-case scenario consisting of the release of the entire contents of the largest vessel containing a regulated chemical.  The largest butane-containing vessel is a 30,000-gallon tank, with a maximum capacity of 144,300 pounds.  The worst-case release is assumed to result in a vapor cloud containing the total quantity of butane in a concentration that is assumed to be between the upper and lower flammability limits of butane.  For the worst-case consequence analysis, the vapor cloud is assumed to detonate.\n\nThe endpoint for the consequence analysis of a vapor cloud explosion is an overpressure of one pound per square inch (1 psi).  The ?Automated Resource for Chemical Hazard Incident Evaluation? (ARCHIE) software was used to estimate the distance to this endpoint.  \n\nThe worst-case scenario assumptions are as follows:\n\n?

There is no passive mitigation.\n\nThe estimated ?distance to endpoint? is 1457 feet (0.28 miles) using ARCHIE software.  The public receptors within this distance include at least one residence and an industrial area.  Schools, hospitals, prisons, recreation areas, major commercial or office areas, national/state parks/monuments and wildlife refuges are not present inside this radius.  The population within this area was estimated at 18 using the ?Landview 6? software program by selecting the ?calculate population using block points? option.  The Landview software contains the latest (2000) census data available.  \n\n5.0    ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\nHWRT is required to identify and analyze at least one alternative release scenario that is more likely to occur than the worst-case release scenario.  The scenario selected involves a leak while transferring butane from a truck to the tank due to a gasket failure or hose failure.  This is a potential failure mode identified during the Process Hazard Analysis.  The pressure drop in the hose would be detected by a sensor and the truck?s automatic excess flow shut-off valve would be activated and the butane flow would be stopped.  The contents of the hose could be released.\n\nThe hose is a nominal 3-inch diameter and the length is an estimated 30 to 50 feet long.  A 50-foot length will be utilized for a conservative scenario.  The volume of the hose is approximately 2.5 cubic feet.  Using a conversion factor of 7.48052 gallons per cubic feet and a butane density of 4.81 lb per gallon, the hose could hold about 90 pounds of butane.  For an extremely conservative scenario, it will be assumed that twice the total volume of the hose leaks out before the shut-off mechanism is activated, so the total release would be 180 pounds.\n\nThis release is also assumed to result in a vapor cloud of but"

This is achieved through a combination of safety equipment, personnel training, and operating procedures.  The safety equipment includes excess flow valves, pressure relief valves, and emergency shut-off valves.  The butane tank and supporting equipment was installed and tested in September, 2006.  An inspector from the Liquified Petroleum Gas Board inspected the process, pressure-tested the tank, and approved the installation on September 18, 2006, prior to HWRT initiating the butane process at this facility.\n\n7.0    FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThis facility has not had a reportable release of buta"

The Facility Response Plan contains specific actions to be taken in response to an accidental release of butane, procedures to inform the public and health care information.  All employees working with butane are trained in handling flammable materials and are provided with annual refresher training.  This plan has been coordinated with the Pulaski County and North Little Rock LEPCs.  The telephone number for the North Little Rock LEPC is 501-340-5365.\n\n9.0    PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThe planned changes (both procedural and equipment changes) were documented during and after the Process Hazard Analyses which were initially conducted on August 3, 2005, and reviewed and updated on September 18, 2006.  These changes are listed below.  \n\n?    Add percent capacity gauge to butane tank.\n?    Replace butane tank pressure gauge.\n?    Inspect butane tank and piping prior to use.  Replace equipment as necessary.\n?    Test and replace as necessary the pressure relief gauges on the butane tank.\n?    Create a procedure for butane truck unloading.\n?    Create a procedure for butane injection.\n?    Replace gaskets on the flanged butane pipe connections.\n\nThese changes were all completed on or before September 19, 2006."
