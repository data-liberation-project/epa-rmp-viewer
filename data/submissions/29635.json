      "SummaryText": "This Risk Management Plan (RMP) has been prepared by the Ciba Specialty Chemicals Corporation (Ciba), McIntosh site to satisfy the requirements of the Clean Air Act Amendments (CAAA) Section 112 (r) mandated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (40 CFR-part 68).\n\nThe Ciba McIntosh site is located on Ciba road in McIntosh, Washington County, Alabama.  The site occupies approximately 1,500 acres and has approximately 800 employees on site. Production at the McIntosh site began in 1952 with 32 employees manufacturing one product.  Currently, the site produces additives for plastics, paints, and oils, optical brightners used in the detergent, paper and textile industries, and chemicals used in household products.  \n\nWith an injury rate 36 percent below the national average, the McIntosh site is a leader in safety.  In fact, employees at the site have worked one million safe hours (hours worked without a lost time accident) 37 times since 1972.  The OSHA VPP Star Designation program requires stringent inspections and an excellent safety and health program.  In 1989, the McIntosh site became the 64th industrial site out of five million in the U.S. to receive the coveted designation.  The site was re-certified as an OSHA VPP Star site in 2000.\n\nThe line of products at McIntosh may vary in response to market demand.  Overall, there are two operating divisions at the McIntosh site.  These two divisions are the Plastic Additives Division and the Home and Personal Care Division.  Below is a brief description of each production area at the site:\n\nThe Additives Area 1 is designed to produce Irgafos (process stabilizers used primarily as blend components) and Irganox (antioxidants).  In this Area, raw materials and solvents are fed to reactors.  The reaction mass undergoes additional processing steps such as stripping, crystallizing, centrifuging, blending, and drying.  The products are then either packaged dry or transferred to the granulations area.  Solvents used in the"

One RMP-regulated substance exceeding the threshold quantity was identified in Area 1: Phosphorous trichloride at a maximum quantity of 80,000 lbs.\n\nThe Additives Area 17/18 is designed to produce various additives by diazotizing o-nitroaniline with sodium nitrite in an acidic medium.  The resulting diazonium salt is reacted with one of several substituted phenols.  The intermediate is then separated from the reaction mass and dissolved in a solvent before being reacted with hydrogen in the presence of a catalyst to form the corresponding additive product.  The catalyst is then removed from the reaction mass and the solvents partially stripped off.  The product is finally purified, isolated and dried to the finished form for packaging.   No RMP regulated substances exceeding their threshold quantities were identified in Area 17/18.\n\nThe Additives Area 20 is a multi-product batch processing unit that produces a variety of additives that are used in other finished products.  Some of the chemicals produced in Area 20 include light stabilizers, antioxidants, and oil additives.  No RMP regulated substances exceeding their threshold quantities were identified in Area 20.\n\nThe Consumer Care Area 8 produces fluorescent whitening agent (FWA) intermediates and paper dyes.  These are either further processed on site or sold.  The FWA intermediates and some of the paper dyes are produced from a para-nitro toluene base.  Many dyes are also formulated and/or repackaged, but not chemically produced in the Area.  Two RMP regulated substances exceeding their threshold quantities were identified in Area 8: Anhydrous Ammonia at a maximum quantity of 130,000 lbs. and Oleum, 65% at a maximum quantity of 920,000 lbs.\n\nThe Consumer Care Area 10 primary task is to produce fluorescent whitening agents (FWA) that are used in various commercial products, such as paper, textiles, and detergents.

The final products are sold in liquid, solid or slurry forms.  Various additives are used to enhance product performance.  No RMP regulated substances exceeding their threshold quantities were identified in Area 10.\n\nThe Utilities Department controls all the boilers as well as the hydrogen storage and header system.  No RMP regulated substances exceeding their threshold quantities were identified in the utilities area.\n\nA waste management facility (Area 15) also exists on site which includes an incinerator for hazardous waste as well as aboveground wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) that treats sanitary and process wastewater generated at the plant.  No RMP regulated substances exceeding their threshold quantities were identified in Area 15.\n\nThe first key element in the RMP regulations is that a facility must identify all processes that contain any RMP-regulated substances above their designated threshold quantities.\n\nThe second key element in the RMP regulations, is to determine program levels for the RMP-regulated processes.  These levels range from a Program 1 that imposes minimal requirements on a process to a Program 2 or 3 which require a much greater level of effort.  The McIntosh site is subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard, 29 CFR 1910.119.  The site?s processes are also included in the nine SIC codes specified by the RMP rule.  Therefore, the facility has designated all of its processes to be in the Program 3 level of the RMP.\n\nThe third key element in the RMP regulations is that Program 3 facilities must conduct an offsite consequence analysis.  Ciba opted to use the EPA guidance manual mainly because it is more conservative than most commercial models. Ciba also used the toxic endpoint concentrations specified in the manual, which represent concentrations below those believed to cause "

This data was then confirmed using the EPA provided software RMP*COMP. \n\nOn August 28 2003, the Diazinon manufacturing unit ceased production which resulted in the removal of three RMP regulated chemicals from the RMP plan: aqueous ammonia, chlorine, and isobutyronitrile. On October 22 2003, the Thioherbicide manufacturing unit ceased production which resulted in the removal of one RMP regulated chemical: methylmercaptan. Methylmercaptan was previously determined to be the worst-case scenario for the RMP plan. That designation now becomes 65% oleum. With the change in worst-case scenarios, the distance to endpoint has been reduced from 17 miles to 14.1 miles with an  affected population of 17,990. \n\nUsing extremely conservative estimates of weather and release conditions, Ciba?s offsite consequence analysis indicated that a worst-case toxic release scenario could have an offsite impact.  This scenario was based on the release of 65% oleum from a rail car within a 10 minute period. This material  has a toxic end point concentration of 0.010 mg/liter.  The toxic end points specified for the regulated toxic substances are intended to be protective of the general public.  These end points are concentrations below which it is believed nearly all individuals could be exposed for one-half to one hour without any serious health effects.  To prevent such a catastrophe from occurring, Area 8 has a permanently installed emergency storage vessel, which can accommodate the material in case of a vessel failure and the storage vessel is double walled for added protection. Training, procedures, safety systems, and preventive maintenance programs are all in place to ensure we will  handle this and all materials safely.\n\nAn alternative release scenario was also considered for each RMP-regulated toxic chemical on site.  The alternative release scenarios were based on process knowledge, accident history or the process ha"

With a toxic endpoint of 0.028 mg/liter, the release scenario could have an offsite impact. Operators are always present during these unloading operations to insure the safety of the operation. The unloading operation is also monitored by a computer and by control room operator. Should a problem with the unloading occur, the tank trucks are equipped with an emergency cut off valve that can quickly be closed from the front of the truck.  Also, the unloading area is surrounded by a concrete dike that is large enough to hold the contents of an entire truckload of material. This diked area is equipped with a foam spray system that can be used to provide a protective barrier to prevent vapors from a spill from being released to the air. Procedures, training, safety systems and preventive maintenance programs are all in place to prevent spills, but should a spill occur, this unit  is well prepared to effectively respond.\n\nThe oleum alternative release scenario was based on the assumption that a pipe begins to leak in Area 8.  This scenario could have an offsite impact.  Spill prevention measures in place for oleum include the use of a double walled storage tank, redundant level instrumentation, preventive maintenance programs, scrubber system, and computer controls and interlocks. If a spill should occur, the storage area is located within a concrete dike to contain the spill, and a storage tank is always kept empty for emergency storage of oleum. A special neutralizing powder called Spill-X-A is also available to neutralize spills.\n\nAnother key element of the RMP regulations is to develop and submit a five-year accident history involving RMP-regulated substances.
