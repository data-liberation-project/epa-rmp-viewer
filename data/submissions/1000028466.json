      "SummaryText": "The Bellemeade Power Station is an electric utility generating facility, which burns natural gas and distillate oil to generate electricity.  It is required, by the terms of its air quality permit, to use Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) to reduce the emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx) which are created during combustion.  The SCR system operates by injecting ammonia into the flue gas and passing the flue gas/ammonia mixture through a catalyst which causes the ammonia to reqact with NOx, converting into nitrogen gas (a natural component of the atmosphere) and water.  This Risk Management Plan covers the storage and handling of ammonia.\n\n\n\nBellemeade Power Station employs several practices to provide a thorough accidental release prevention program.  100% containment is employed around the ammonia storage tank and transfer pumps, and operator inspection of piping and systems is conducted on a daily basis.  The operations staff has been trained on chemical safety, emergency action plans, and Hazard Communication.\n\n\n\nThe company's prevention program is based on OSHA's Process Safety Management standard.  The facility has never had a reportable release of ammonia.  It does not (is not required to) have an emergency response plan meeting OSHA standards at 29 CFR 1910.120 (HAZWOPER); accidents that cannot be corrected immediately by employees who are within the immediate release area would be referred to the Richmond LEPC.\n\n\n\nBellemeade Power Station has not had an accident in the last seven (7) years.  As a result, no changes are deemed to be necessary to improve safety."
