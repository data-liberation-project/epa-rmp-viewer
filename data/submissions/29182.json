The stationary source is the Meadowbrook Farm's Pork Processing Facility located at 205 Turner Road, Rantoul, IL.  The site is owned and operated by Meadowbrook Farms. The only RMP regulated substance in this facility is anhydrous ammonia--which is classified as a toxic substance, liquefied under pressure.\n\nThis is a first time RMP submission for a new ammonia refrigeration system for a prok processing and cold storage facility.\n\nThe refrigeration system in this facility has an inventory of up to 21,600 pounds of anhydrous ammonia. This process does not meet the requirements of Program 1. It is subject to OSHA's PSM standard.  Therefore, this RMP is written to meet the EPA Program 3 level of compliance.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION POLICY\nThis facility follows a rigorous thirteen volume Process Safety Management Program to prevent the accidental release of ammonia. The PSM program is in compliance with Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), Process Safety Management (PSM) of 29 CFR 1910.119. Employees and management participate and cooperate in the PSM program to maintain a work environment that is safe to employees, the community, and the environment.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICY\nThe facility has a comprehensive emergency response plan that meets established criteria. The plan will be provided to the local LEPC for review.\n\nPROCESS OVERVIEW \nThis food processing facility operates a two-temperature, single stage, anhydrous ammonia (R-717) refrigeration system with a maximum engine room capacity of 378.6 TR @ +15?F high-temperature suction and 389.2 TR @ -30?F low-temperature suction. This refrigeration system is a liquid recirculation system and is designed to operate at an over-feed ratio of approximately 3:1 for all evaporators.

Engine room electrical classification is NEMA-1.\n\n\nThis ammonia refrigeration system contains six interconnected sub-systems:\n1.Low temperature system (-30?F @ 1.6 in. Hg.).\n2.High temperature system (+15?F @ 28.4 PSIG).\n3.Thermosyphon pilot-receiver system (95?F @ 181.1 PSIG).\n4.Condenser system (95?F C.T. 79?F W.B.)\n5.Compressor low temperature system (-30?F @ 1.6 in.

FCT/ 79? FWB).\n\nMITIGATION MEASURES\nThere are some mitigating measures in place. The location of the ammonia vessels is inside the engine room. Although there are doors and windows, the overall enclosure acts as a dike creating liquid pooling and limiting the liquid run-off. Ammonia leak detection is installed in this area that sounds alarms and starts emergency ventilation. The emergency ventilation is automatically controlled and discharges the engine room air through the roof which creates a lower level of concentration in the engine room for responders. It also starts air dispersion at lower concentration levels and disperses the ammonia with greater air turbulence. \n\nSUMMARY OF HAZARD ASSESSMENT\nThis hazard assessment was conducted to meet the RMP Off-site Consequence Analysis requirements for the ammonia refrigeration system.

      "SummaryText": "y RMP regulated substance at this facility is anhydrous ammonia which is classified is as a toxic substance, liquefied under pressure. The definitions and parameters for the following release scenarios are based on the \"Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration\" as described in Chapter 4: Off-site Consequence Analysis.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario (OCA-1) used in this assessment identifies the high-temperature recirculator (V-2) as the vessel with the potential to hold the largest quantity of ammonia. This is based on the system design that uses this vessel as a pump-down holding receiver. The worst-case release scenario is based on over-filling this vessel with 13,616 pounds of ammonia and causing the released quantity to be equal to the total vessel volume with no piping volume included. The Distance to Toxic Endpoint of 2.2  miles creates a Circle of Concern that includes a residential population of 307 people.\n\nThe alternative release scenario is the direct release of ammonia vapor from the largest pressure relief valve. The size of the release is based on the rated capacity of the pressure relief valve  (138.1 lbs per min.) with a release duration of 30 minutes. The Distance to Toxic Endpoint of 0.2 miles creates a Circle of Concern that includes a residential population of 0 people.\n\nACCIDENT PREVENTION PROGRAM\nThis facility follows the OSHA Process Safety Management Program. Various special elements have been incorporated into this program to meet the additional EPA requirements for hte RMP. Following is an overview.\n\nParticipation - The Participation Program is an asset to both employees at the site and to the community as a whole.  As a general rule, employees who are fully involved have a greater sense of responsibility; they are more likely to catch the problems that can cause accidents. Employee awareness is for employees, not directly involved with the process, this includes knowing the hazards, the safety rules, warning signs, and "
