      "SummaryText": "The Eugene Water & Electric Board (EWEB) is a public utility, and as such, it is incumbent upon the utility to protect its employees and the community from dangers inherent in the operation of providing reliable electricity, steam, and safe drinking water.\n\nEWEB's Hayden Bridge Water Filtration Plant (water plant) has been, and intends to continue to be in compliance with EPA and OSHA requirements for prevention and responsible reaction to chlorine (chemical) releases..  The water plant staff annually reviews ans drilla with its Process Hazards Analyses (PHA), Process Safety Management (PSM) and Emergency Action Plan (EAP).  In addition, EWEB's water plant is annually inspected by local emergency responders and is used as a practice site for the City of Springfield Fire & Life Safety.\n\nREGULATED PROCESS\n\nThe water plant uses the toxic gas chlorine to disinfect McKenzie River water to produce safe drinking water.  To disinfect the raw water, chlorine gas is mixed with water at a concentration of up to 2.0 mg/l (ppm).  After filtration, the clear water is adjusted as needed with smaller doses of chlorine to provide a final chlorine residual of 0.65 mg/l as the treated water leaves the plant site.  As the water reaches the community, the average chlorine residual throughout the service area averages 0.28 mg/l (2006 data).  The Federal Safe Drinking Water Act requires that drinking water contain a minimum of 0.20 mg/l of chlorine as it leaves the treatment facility and that measureable chlorine exists in 95% of all distribution samples collected.\n\nThe Hayden Bridge containment facility can hold up to twelve one-ton cylinders of chlorine gas.  Historically, the water plant has taken several measures to protect the public in the event of a toxic gas release.  Since operations started at the plant on July 12, 1950, there have been no reportable releases caused either by transportation accident, equipment failure or Operator error.\n\nEWEB completed a new disinfection buildin"

      "SummaryText": "g in 1997.  The storage / process rooms have redundant detectors, half of which are tested weekly.  If a release is detected, the system closes the vents from the outside and the released gas is blown into a scrubber unit that is designed to neutralize the release.  This scrubber is designed to handle a one-ton release of chlorine and is also checked and tested weekly.  The structure itself is built to earthquake codes and fire codes and insulation codes.  All monitoring systems have been checked and all computerized components are Y2K compliant.\n\nThe chlorine feed system is engineered to prevent releases.  Chlorine is fed through a vacuum system.  In the event of a line break in the disinfection building, the line loses vacuum and the feeders shut down, preventing a release.\n\nIt is our belief that the one-ton cylinders are one of the safest methods for transporting and storing chlorine.  EWEB owns 22 one-ton cylinders so that we can be assured of their integrity and so that we can monitor the tanks and request maintenance on a more frequent basis than may be normal. \n\nWORST CASE SCENARIO\n\nThe water plant's worst case scenario assumes that a one-ton cylinder (the largest single container) stored inside the disinfection building releases its entire contents in 10 minutes.  After leaving the building and being dispersed with a 1.5 meter per second wind, the chlorine gas would travel an estimated 0.9 miles before its concentration was diluted to a safe concentration (0.0087 milligrams/liter).  Using 0.9 miles as a radius, the estmaated population that could be affected by a release is 1,650.  Primarily, the surrounding community is a mixture of agricultural, residential, heavy commercial and light industrial uses.  No schools or hospitals are within the worst-case scenario radius, however Briggs Middle School and Yolanda Elementary School are just beyond the worst-case radius.\n\nALTERNATIE CASE SCENARIO (a realistic scenario to be used for accident prevent and response"

The most likely scenario, with the largest potential impact would be a fuseable-plug blowing out of a chlorine cylinder causing the realease of a large amount of the cylinder's contents.  The disinfection building's containment features and scrubber installation should control any release from the building to at or below a safe concentration (0.0087 mg/l in the air).  However, for the purposes of the RMP, the calculated effectiveness of the scrubber unit was lowered to 95%.  With a 1.5 meter per second wind, a plume would go 0.2 miles before it was a safe concentration (0.0087 mg/l).  The alternative case radius is just beyond the water plant boundaries and includes several residences and one industrial facility.\n\nTHE FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere have been no accidents or releases in the last five years."
