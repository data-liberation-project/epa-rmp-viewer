      "SummaryText": "   Rapid City is a liquid fertilizer production facility owned by Kugler Oil Company, of McCook, NE. Kugler Oil Company is a 85 year old family owned business, and has been in liquid fertilizer production for the past 40 years at three other locations outside the state of South Dakota. Company-wide, approximately 100 full time employees are utilized in the operation and management, to include a full time Safety & Compliance Director. The three owners, are always actively involved in all daily operations of the company. Safety and compliance is considered by management to be a highly regarded business objective.\n\n\n\n   This facility uses Anhydrous Ammonia, (considered a regulated toxic substance) in its production. Employees are trained on operations of the plant, including working with hazardous chemicals. They are also trained on the importance of safety and the disciplinary actions that may be implemented for non-compliance. Compliance with the company's Safety Policies are a condition of continued employment.\n\n\n\n   The worst case scenario were based on the amount of product, that could be released from a failure of the largest tank of anhydrous ammonia. The alternate case scenario was based on piping failure, for the same product.\n\n\n\n   There have been no Incidences to report.\n\n \n\n   The facility has a written Emergency Action Plan, in which the local fire and police departments respond to all emergencies at the plant. Plant personnel work under the guidance of \n\n Emergency Response Teams in caring for emergencies at the plant as needed.\n\n\n\n   The Kugler Oil Company also works with the South Dakota Department of Agriculture and other State and Federal regulators during Inspections, Audits and design requirements when updating the facility."
