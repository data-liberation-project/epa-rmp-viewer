The facility utilizes anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant to maintain the proper temperature of Fluid Milk Products within the facility. Anhydrous ammonia is an effective refrigerant that has been used for many years by most food processing facilities. Ammonia is normally a gas at ambient temperatures but is handled as a gas liquefied under pressure. The refrigeration system consists of a high-pressure receiver, evaporators, compressors, piping, and valves. \nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies: Bell Dairy Products, Inc. is committed to promoting safety for the plant, its employees and the surrounding area. The facility is complying with OSHA's Process Safety Management Standard (PSM), Title 29 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 1910.119, and EPA's Risk Management Program regulations (RMP), Title 40 CFR Part 68. The purpose of these programs is to ensure that the refrigeration system is operated safely in order to prevent releases of ammonia from the system. In addition, these programs serve to develop procedures to minimize releases in the event that they do occur and to outline appropriate emergency response steps to take in the event of a release.\nWorst Case Release Scenario: EPA's \"Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration\" (November 1998) and the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration's (IIAR) Risk Management Guidelines (1998) were the primary documents used to develop the worst case release scenario. The worst case release is one that is unlikely to occur. The purpose of the worst case release analysis is to support a dialogue with the community on release prevention. It is a conservative analysis and is not to serve as a rational basis for actual emergency response planning.\nThe worst case release scenario (as defined by EPA) is the release of the largest quantity"

      "SummaryText": " of ammonia from a vessel or process line failure that results in the greatest distance to a toxic endpoint. The worst case release scenario for the refrigeration process is assumed to be a case where the total quantity of ammonia in the high- pressure receiver is released. The release scenario was performed assuming that the vessel was filled to 60% of capacity (the greatest amount that would ever be placed in the vessel). The vessel, however, is normally filled to 30% of capacity.   There  were no  passive mitigation systems (dikes, berms, drains, sumps or enclosures) considered in the analysis since the vessel is located outdoors.\n\nI\n\n In addition, Dean Foods has installed a sophisticated system of ammonia sensors that can remotely close certain isolation valves in the event of a small release and thereby limit an accidental release of ammonia. These sensors are capable of detecting releases of ammonia at low levels, and are connected to a computer that will shut certain valves to the system if ammonia is detected. In this way, potential releases of ammonia are minimized.\n\nA possible release scenario is one in which a pressure relief valve  is forced opened from over pressurization in the system.  Most of the relief valves are located on the roof therefore passive and active mitigation was not considered in the alternate release scenario.  The plant has ammonia detectors located in the engine room (1), Ice Cream Vault (3) and the Milk Cooler (3).  An alarm is located near the Plant Superintendents office.  There is an automatic notification system (Sensaphone Express) connected to the PLC which automatically calls pre - assigned phone number in order to notify appropriate personnel of a detection.\n\n\nThe toxic endpoint used for this scenario must be where the ambient concentration of ammonia is 0.14 mg/L or less. Based on EPA's guidance, the alternative release scenario would result in a situation where public receptors would be within the distance to the toxic en"

      "SummaryText": "dpoint.\n\n\n\n\nThe toxic endpoint used for this scenario must be where the ambient concentration of ammonia is 0.14 mg/L or less. This endpoint is a concentration below which nearly all individuals could be exposed to for one hour without serious health effects. Based on Exhibit 4-4 in EPA's guidance, a release from the vessel would result in a situation where public receptors would be within the distance to the toxic endpoint.\nAlternative Case Release Scenario: The alternative case release scenario selected is one in which a pressure relief valve opens. EPA's \"Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration\" (November 1998) and the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration's (IIAR) Risk Management Guidelines (1998) were the primary documents used to develop the alternative release scenario. The alternative release scenario is one that is more likely to occur than the worst case release scenario.\nThe alternative release scenario must meet two criteria:\n1)     Must be more likely to occur than the worst case scenario, and\n2)     Must reach an endpoint off site, unless no such criteria exist.\nAccidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps: As a part of its PSM Program, Bell Dairy Products, Inc. has established numerous programs that serve to prevent accidental releases of ammonia. These programs include:\n\n\n7 \n\n2\n7 Process Safety Information\n7 Process Hazard Analysis\n7 Operating Procedures\n7 Training\n7 Mechanical Integrity\n7 Management of Change\n7 Pre-Startup Review\n\n\n\n\n \n7 Compliance Audits\n7 Incident Investigations\n7 Employee Participation\n7 Hot Work Permits\nEmergency Response Information: As a part of the PSM Program, the facility maintains an Emergency Response Plan that was prepared in order to improve responsiveness to an emergency incident, and to increase the reliability of actions taken during an incident. The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations,n"

In addition, the Lubbock County LEPC has included Bell Dairy Products, Inc. in its local emergency response planning.\nFive-Year Accident History: Bell Dairy Products, Inc. has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last 5 years. Due to our stringent release prevention policies, there has been no accidental release during this period.\nSteps to Improve Safety: Several developments and findings have resulted from the implementation of the various elements of our accidental release prevention program. Some changes have been implemented in SOP's such as the placement of traffic  cones during receiving of ammonia.  The implementation of full PLC (Programmable Logic Controller) control has started which will be control solenoids in the event of a leak. These are some of the major steps taken to improve safety at our facility. \n\nIn addition, the facility will continue to operate and maintain the system in accordance with IIAR Guidance and will continue to implement its OSHA PSM Program in conjunction with the Risk Management Program.\n\n BELL DAIRY EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n"
