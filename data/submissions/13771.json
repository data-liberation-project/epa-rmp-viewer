Our facility is a petroleum refinery under NAICS code 32411, and must meet the requirements of Program Level 3.\n\nWe are reporting the following two regulated chemicals in the RMPlan:\n* Flammable Mixture (Mixed Butanes): This represents a butane/butene mix in storage. The maximum quantity of Flammable Mixture onsite is 5.9 million pounds.\n* Propane. The maximum quantity of propane onsite is 2 million pounds.\n\nH2S and SO2 in the Sinclair Casper Refinery do not meet threshold levels. We have four units that process or remove H2S from the processes. Our total amount does not exceed the RMP threshold quantities for these substances; therefore, we do not trigger RMP. Prevention and safety programs are in place for all H2S-handling units as part of our Process Safety Management Program.\n\nIn the past, the Sinclair Casper Refinery used chlorine to treat water for its boilers and cooling towers. With the release modeling required under RMP, the Sinclair Casper Refinery determined that the potential impact of chlorine on the surrounding community was not necessary. Therefore, we replaced chlorine with an alternate, non-gaseous treatment system. This treatment system is more expensive to operate, yet we felt it was essential to remove chlorine in order to improve the safety of the community and minimize any toxic footprint from our facility.\n\nHazard Assessment Results \n\nThe Sinclair Casper Refinery has no toxic substance onsite that meets the threshold requ"

The worst-case scenario (WCS) was developed using the RMP-defined parameters, which may not accurately reflect properties of the substances or available mitigation controls. Because of the RMP definition of WCS, the following event is very unlikely to occur.\n\nThe WCS associated with the flammable substances is a vapor cloud explosion (VCE) involving the full inventory of the largest butane sphere (Tank 217) containing the Flammable Mixture. The tank can contain up to 9,700 barrels. Therefore, the full tank inventory is assumed to release, completely vaporize, and ignite, resulting in a VCE. The maximum distance to the 1-psi endpoint for this WCS is 1.0 mile (as calculated by RMP*Comp). Although we have numerous controls to prevent such releases and to manage their consequences, we took no credit for passive mitigation measures in evaluating the WCS.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario. The alternative release scenario (ARS) for flammable substances at the Sinclair Casper Refinery is based on our largest historical release of an RMP flammable substance. It was a butane release resulting from a lineup error in transferring the gas to a truck. It is important to note that this release was successfully mitigated and no VCE occurred. \n\nFor purposes of the ARS, the amount released was 1,028 lb over 30 minutes. We assumed that the gas would stay around the tank and, with a perfect fuel-to-air mixture, be released in a VCE. The release is expected to be isolated by the operators within 30 minutes (active mitigation). The maximum distance to the 1-psi endpoint for this event is 0.10 mile (as calculated by RMP*Comp). The endpoint crossed the northeast boundary of the facility by approximately 300 feet and impacted only industrial land. \n\n5-Year Accident History\n\nThe Sinclair Casper Refinery has not had any RMP-defined accidents.

For the one RMP process being reported by the Sinclair Casper Refinery, encompassing the entire refinery, RMP allows us to use OSHA's PSM standard as our prevention program. This summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements that are part of the RMP, and describes the system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\nThe elements are as follows:\n* Employee Participation\n* Process Safety Information\n* Process Hazard Analysis\n* Operating Procedures\n* Training\n* Contractors\n* Pre-Startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\n* Mechanical Integrity\n* Safe Work Practices\n* Management of Change\n* Incident Investigation\n* Compliance Audits\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nThe Sinclair Casper Refinery encourages and invites employees to participate in every aspect of process safety management and accident prevention. Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the Sinclair Casper Refinery and addresses each accident prevention program element. \n\nEmployees have access to all information that is part of the accident prevention program. Copies of information that is used daily is located in the unit operations buildings for quick access. \n\nExamples of employee participation include participating in the HAZOP analysis of each unit, updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information for their unit area, and reviewing and being trained on any changes to operational or mechanical information that may affect them.

This information helps ensure and maintain safe operation for the processes. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis and configuration information. \n\nThe Safety, Engineering, and Maintenance departments are assigned responsibility within the plant to keep the process safety information updated. A table summarizing the reference documents and their location is readily available as part of the file in the Technical Manager's office in the main building.

This information is stored with the Inspection and Testing department.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nThe Sinclair Casper Refinery has a comprehensive analysis program to ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled. Each process unit is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage those hazards. \n\nThe Sinclair Casper Refinery uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations. HAZOP is a very systematic and thorough evaluation of potential hazards in the process unit. The Sinclair Casper Refinery conducts a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) with a team formed of knowledgeable, trained personnel from safety, maintenance, operations, environmental, engineering, and plant management. The team evaluates potential process hazards and identifies accident prevention and mitigation measures to ensure safe operating and maintenance of the units. The team makes recommendations about systems, procedures, or practices to put in place to ensure the hazards are managed and mitigated. \n\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to local and corporate management for review and resolution.

Revalidated hazard analysis results are tracked, submitted for management review, and retained and documented until they are complete. \n\nOperating Procedures\n\nThe Sinclair Casper Refinery maintains written procedures for all operations functions at the refinery. The procedures address various modes of unit operation, including:\n* Pre-Startup\n* Unit Startup\n* Normal Operations and Process Control\n* Temporary or Special Operating Procedures\n* Emergency Shutdown\n* Normal Shutdown\n\nAdditional information present with the operating procedures include a process description, a process chemistry description, an equipment description, operator responsibilities, safety concerns, chemicals in the unit, and utility and auxiliary systems. \n\nThese procedures are used to train personnel in their responsibilities at the unit, to reference during operation of the unit, and to provide checklists necessary for unit operation.
