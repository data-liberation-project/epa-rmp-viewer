      "SummaryText": "This Risk Management Plan describes the procedures implemented by Unified Western Grocers, Inc. To prevent accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia that could cause harm to the public and the environment.  The plan includes the analysis of the potential off-site consequences of an accidential release, the five year accident history and process safety management for release prevention.   Unified Western Grocers facility is located at 6433 S.E. Lake Road in Milwaukie, Oregon.  The facility is a wholesale grocery distribution company.  The frozen food building located within this facility utilizes ammonia refrigeration to keep temperature for storage of frozne products.  The ammonia refrigeration system contains 11,500 of anhyrous ammonia.  The worst case scenario was determined to be a failure of the main ammonia receiver.  The receive is assumed to fail in catastrophic manner and release the entire charge of ammonia over a period of ten minutes.  For the alternative release scenario, it was assumed that a puncture in a tank or pipe occurred resulting in an airborne release of ammonia.  Unified Western Grocers has developed and implemented a Process Safety Management Plan that reduces the possibility of accidental releases of regulated substances that may impact human health or the environment.  There have been no qualiying accidents involving reportable substances in the past five years."
