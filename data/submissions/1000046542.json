This commitment is an inherent part of our comprehensive Accidental Release Prevention Program that covers areas such as (but, not limited to)design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training, all associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement the appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. We also coordinate our response efforts with the local Fire Department, Law Enforcement, and Emergency Medical Services, all which provide additional emergency response information and expertise.\r\n\r\n 2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled:\r\n Our facility's primary activities include support services for agricultural crop production.  We have anhydrous ammonia stored at our facility, in both a primary holding tank(s), as well as supplemental nurse tanks, which are used for product field application.  All of our tanks are filled by skilled, trained employees who do not fill any tank beyond the 85% standard maximum storage capacity.\r\n\r\n 3. Worst Case Release and Alternative Release Scenarios:\r\n (NOTE: #3 Available only to County Emergency Manager, Fire Department and Agroline - not included with disk to EPA for public access per Federal Regulation posted 2004)\r\n\r\n 4. General Accidental Release Prevention Program :\r\nOur facility has taken the necessary steps to comply with the EPA's accidental release prevention requirements as set forth in 40 CFR part 68.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source:\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information:\r\nAgroline maintains a currant and detailed data base of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters, and equipment designs associated with all processes (Appendix E).\r\n\r\nProcess Haz"

Any findings from the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\r\n\r\nOperating Procedures:\r\nAgroline maintains strict written operating procedures to ensure that activities within our covered processes are conducted safely.  These procedures address various modes of operation; the information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to all operators involved in the processes (Appendix B).\r\n\r\nTraining:\r\nAgroline has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that all employees who are involved with operating processes and procedures are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.\r\n\r\nMechanical Integrity:\r\nAgroline conducts regular, documented maintenance checks on all process equipment to ensure safe, proper operation.  Maintenance checks are conducted by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Examples of process equipment that would receive maintenance checks include:  pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls, and pumps.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are taken out of service and corrected in a safe and timely manner (Appendix C).\r\n\r\nManagement of Change:\r\nWritten procedures are in place at Agroline to manage changes in process\r\nchemicals, technology, equipment, and procedures.  Process operators, maintenance personnel and/or other employees whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly notified of the modification and receive updated training to deal with it.\r\n\r\nPre-startup Reviews:\r\nAgroline routinely conducts pre-startup safety reviews related to new processes and modifications in established processes.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, and"

Any non-compliance issue discovered during the audit is promptly noted and immediately corrected.\r\n\r\nEmployee Participation:\r\nAgroline truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.  Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  In addition, our employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP, particularly information resulting from process hazard analyses.\r\n\r\n  5. Five-year Accident History:\r\nAgroline had an accidental release in 2011.  Changes have been made by updating operating procedures & training.  We expect to have an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the next 5 years.  Due to our stringent release prevention policies.\r\n\r\n  6. Emergency Response Plan:\r\nAgroline maintains a written Emergency Action Plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials.  The plan addresses all aspects of emergency response including first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, and, in the event of an accidental release, Agroline will contact local emergency response agencies and the public (Appendix A).  Agroline maintains a written Emergency Action Plan which is coordinated with the local Fire Department and the county's Emergency Manager.  The plan is intended to assist responding agencies to address all aspects of emergency response including first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, and notification of other local emergency response agencies and the public.  The Fire Department conducts regular, routine training sessions at this location assisted by our facility personnel."
