If any emergency were to occur, it is our policy to follow the emergency procedures outlined in our 2003 Integrated Contingency Plan (ICP).  The procedures in our ICP include shutting down as promptly as possible the operation and notifying the Terminal Manager and the United States Coast Guard.  The ICP is discussed in further detail in the emergency response program section below.\n\nA description of your facility and the regulated substances handled:  This facility manages liquid and bulk transfer of chemicals.  We receive and ship material by water, rail and truck.  The facility manages the regulated substance, vinyl acetate monomer.  The vinyl acetate monomer is stored in one 860,627-gallon storage tank, which is limited to 90% capacity by an internal floating roof.  \n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps:  This facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule, OPA 90 - Oil Pollution Act (33 CFR 154), SPCC (40 CFR 112), and all applicable state a local codes and regulations.  Furthermore, the vinyl acetate system is maintained in accordance with good engineering practice.\n\nFive-year accident history:  Queen City Termincal, Inc. has not had an accident involving vinyl acetate that caused injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or shelterings in place in the past five years.\n\nThe emergency response program:  In the event of an emergency involving our vinly acetate process, it is our policy to follow the guidelines outlined in our ICP.
