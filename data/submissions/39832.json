The City will take every reasonable action to prevent all accidental releases. We will accomplish this by using the most current design, training and inspecting processes available.\n\nEmergency Response Policy (ERP).  The City will respond to any emergency in a manner best suited to protecting our employees, the public, and the environment. Onsite employees are trained to evacuate the site and call the Fire Department if a chlorine leak is detected.  The Fire Department visits the site each year to remain familiar with the chlorine system and it?s risks.  \n\nThe Stationary Source.  The stationary source is the gaseous chlorine disinfection system at this municipal wastewater treatment facility. Chlorine (CAS No. 7782-50-5) is the regulated substance handled at this facility. The chlorine system has a maximum inventory of 18,000 pounds. This quantity qualifies the chlorine system as a Program 3 process.\n\nThe Worse-Case Scenario.  The worst case scenario is the rupture of the largest chlorine tank. The volume of the storage tank would allow a maximum of 2,000 pounds of liquid chlorine to be released. In the worst-case scenario, this tank would rupture and spill its entire contents onto the ground in ten minutes. Using the EPA lookup tables for this release, the distance to the toxic endpoint is 1.3 miles.\n\nThe Alternative Release Scenario.  The alternative release scenario is the discharge of chlorine from a broken valve on a ton cylinder. Based on a ?-inch opening, such a release could yield a release of 840 pounds of chlorine during a ten-minute release. Using the EPA lookup tables for this release, the distance to the toxic endpoint is 0.2 miles.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program.  The accidental release prevention program includes a combination of design, training, and inspecting. The chlorine system was designed according to appropriate codes and specif"

The operators and contractors who work in and around the chlorine equipment have been trained in both safety and proper operating procedures. We have a detailed monitoring and inspection program that maintains the mechanical integrity of the chlorine equipment.\n\nFive Year Accident History.  There were no reportable accidents in the last five years.\n\nEmergency Response Program (ERP).  The Wastewater Treatment Facility has a written ERP that includes specific actions to be taken in response to an accidental release of chlorine. Employees are trained to evacuate the facility and call the Fire Department when a chlorine leak is detected.  Any large or uncontrolled release will require assistance from offsite responding agencies. The ERP plan states the specific procedures for informing the public and local agencies responsible for responding to an accidental release. The ERP also includes information on emergency health care for exposure to chlorine. The ERP was last reviewed on May 20, 2004. ERP training for all employees was last conducted on May 14, 2004. The ERP is coordinated with the North Tonawanda Fire Department HAZMAT unit. The contact is the Battalion Chief, at telephone (716) 693-2201. \n  Planned changes to improve safety.
