      "SummaryText": "The Hillsborough County Water Department (HCWD) has an accidental release prevention policy integrating technology, established procedures and management practices into a unified approach to risk management.   The HCWD operates a number of water and wastewater treatment facilities throughout unincorporated Hillsborough County.   The plants adhere to all applicable policies and procedures of the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Florida Department of Environmental Protection and the Florida Department of Community Affairs.  Each facility is in compliance with the EPA emergency response program requirements.\n\nFalkenburg AWT\n\nThe Falkenburg Advanced Wastewater Treatment Plant is located at 102 North Falkenburg Road, Tampa, Fl.  The site is immediately west of the intersection of Woodberry and Falkenburg Roads. In addition to the treatment facility, the complex includes wastewater transmission facilities and a reclaimed water system.\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis\n\nThe offsite consequence analysis includes consideration of two chlorine release scenarios identified as worst case release and alternative scenario.  The first scenario is defined by the EPA, which states that the owner or operator shall assume that the ...  maximum quantity in the largest vessel ... is released as a gas over ten minutes,  due to an unspecified failure.  The alternative scenario is identified as more likely to occur than the worst case scenario.\n\nFor modeling, the HCWD utilized the EPA lookup Taqbles. \n\nThe worst case scenario at Falkenburg AWT involves an unspecified failure of a single one-ton chlorine container.  The offsite consequence analysis was performed for two sets of meterological conditions.  The EPA-specified conditions assume the release of the entire amount as a gas in ten minutes, use of the one hour ERPG-2 as the toxic endpoint and consideration pf the population residing within a full circle with radius corresponding to the toxic endpoint dista"

      "SummaryText": "nce.  EPA set these conditons to facilitate the performance of offsife consequence analysis.  The Hillsborough County Water Department believes the EPA assumptions to be unrealistic because:\n\n      A.      Only a fraction of the compressed liquified chlorine released to the atmosphere flashes to a vapor.  The remaining liquid forms liquid droplet aerosols.  This results in the formation of a very dense chlorine cloud consisting of vapor and liquid droplets, with dispersion characteristics significantly different than for a cloud of only chlorine gas.\n\n     B.     Only the population within an elliptical plume extending downwind of the release point is potentially affected.  The plume area, or footprint, is approximately six (6) percent of the area of the full circle.\n\nEPA-mandated meteorological conditions, Stability F, wind speed of 1.5 m/second, highest daily maximum temperature and average humidity were used for the modeling.\n\nMitigation systems to be considered include chlorine leak detection system and the use of a vacuum system in the chemical feed process. The Falkenburg vacuum feed system is expected to significantly reduce the amount of chlorine released in case of a pigtail or piping failure.\n\nRelease Prevention Program\n\nThe HCWD general release prevention program is based on several key factors:\n     High level of training of operations and maintenance staff\n     Preventative maintenance program\n     State of the art process and safety equipment\n     Accurate, effective operating procedures\n     Hazard review of equipment and procedures\n     An in-house inspection program\n\nChemical specific prevention steps include the availability of self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) worn by operators during connection / disconnection of chlorine and/or sulfur dioxide containers; awareness of the hazardous and toxic properties  of chlorine and sulfur dioxide and the presence of chlorine and sulfur dioxide detection systems.
