The Water Plant currently treats an average of 3.5 MGD and uses\nchlorine gas as a disinfectant in the treatment process.  The City uses approximately 180 pounds per\nday of chlorine in their prechlorination and postchlorination facilities.  The Water Treatment Plant\nutilizes ton chlorine cylinders manifolded in pairs with a backup pair to provide the supply chlorine. \nAdditionally, the Plants stores two to four reserve non-connected cylinders to replace chlorine\ncylinders in service as they are depleted.  Typically no more than 10,000 pounds of chlorine are on\nthe site at any time.\n\nThe City of Pulaski Water Treatment Plant has developed this Risk Management Program in an\nattempt to identify all possible chemical emergencies which may occur and the best way to prevent\nthe accidental release of chlorine to the atmosphere from the plant's chlorination facilities.  The City\nPersonnel responsible for the daily maintenance and operation of the chlorination equipment conduct\ntheir work with the upmost professionalism and have a deep respect of the dangers involved with\nchlorine.  The City places chlorine safety ahead of all other matters.  \n\nIn addition to the Risk Management Plan, the City of Pulaski is subject to OSHA Process Safety\nManagement (PSM) regulations.  The City is working with Tennessee OSHA to develop and\nimplement an approved PSM plan for chlorine.  This has been coordinated with the Giles County\nLocal Emergency Planning Committee and the City of Pulaski Safety Board to assure that all entities\nare aware of the possible dangers involved in a chlorine leak from the Water Treatment Plant.  The\nCity has developed a written operations manual, emergency response plan and "

As a part of the written operations manual, City personnel\nalways conduct their work with the chlorine equipment at  a safe pace and double check all\nconnections when changing tanks or adjusting the system.  Additional safety measures are installed\nin the form of ventilators and chlorine leak detectors which assist in the notification and protection\nof emergency personnel in the event of a leak.\n\nThe emergency response plan outlines the proper procedures to follow in the event of a chlorine leak\ndetection.  Upon detection of the leak, the plant supervisor will notify the emergency service\ncoordinator as defined in the City of Pulaski's Emergency Operations Plan to coordinate assistance\nwith outside emergency units.  The cause of the leak will then be determined so that appropriate\nactions may be taken to insure public safety.  The City of Pulaski Fire Department will act as\nstandby rescue personnel for the plant operators while an attempt to stop the chlorine leak is made. \nThe fire department personnel will be familiarized with the chlorine system so as to assure that, if\nnecessary, they may be able to isolate the leak and stop it.  The Emergency Service Coordinator will\nwork with the Pulaski Police Department and other personnel to alert nearby residents to remove to\nsafety if the need arises.  Local radio stations may also be utilized to notify the public of the\nemergency condition and what to do.\n\nTo date, the City of Pulaski has had no major accidental releases of chlorine which required action\ninvolving off-site receptors.  There have been no accidental releases of chlorine in the last five years.\n\nThe Worst Case Scenario for the Risk Management Plan was evaluated as a rupture of a full ton\nchlorine cylinder and release of its contents to the atmosphere.  The most probable alternative release\nscenario has been determined to be a cracked and leaking supply line.  The EPA supplied\nRMPCOMP program was used to "

The worst case scenario\nhas an area of effect of 0.9 miles in radius and the alternate scenario has an area of effect of 0.1 miles\nin radius.  The worst case scenario could possibly affect approximately 3,700 people and public\nreceptors involved include schools, hospitals, major commercial areas, churches and residences\ndepending on the wind direction.  The alternate scenario could possibly affect 200 people with public\nreceptors involving residences and churches.  The mitigation devices utilized in the alternative\nscenario include enclosure of the chlorine facilities and chlorine detection devices which will\nminimize the amount of the chlorine lost prior to detection and repair.\n\nThe City of Pulaski is still reviewing its PSM plan to define required modifications and additions\nto improve safety.  A training session will be conducted at the end of the PSM review to inform plant\npersonnel of the proper methods for reporting accidents and proper operational methods to minimize\nthe chance of accidental release of chlorine.  Additionally the City is reviewing addition of a\nwindsock to determine the wind direction in case of an emergency and a remote alarm light for the\nchlorine leak detector to improve detection response time."
