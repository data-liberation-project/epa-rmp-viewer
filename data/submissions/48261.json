The ISO Farm qualifies as Program Level 3 under the RMP Rule.  The Belle Mead facility has prepared and implemented a Risk Management Program for the ISO Farm in accordance with Program Level 3 requirements and has submitted a Risk Management Plan to the EPA in compliance with 40 CFR Part 68.150 (Risk Management Plan - - Submission).\n\nThis Executive Summary is required under 40 CFR Part 68.155.  The intention of this Executive Summary is to provide general information to the EPA, employees of Reckitt Benckiser, and the local community about the regulated flammable substances stored and handled at the Belle Mead facility and the facility?s accidental release prevention program and emergency response policies associated with the ISO Farm. Additionally, it reports on the five-year accident history of the Belle Mead facility, as it pertains to the flammable substances stored in the ISO Farm. \n\nFor the purposes of this Executive Summary and for the facility's Risk Management Program and Plan, the substances, equipment and procedures of focus are the regulated flammable substances, equipment, and procedures associated with the ISO Farm only. This area encompasses the ISO Farm, unloading area, and process piping entering the aerosol propellant gassing operation at the gashouse.\n\nDescription of Regulated Substances\nThe Belle Mead facility does not handle, manufacture or use any toxic substances over the regulatory threshold.  Reckitt Benckiser does use blends of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) and difluoroethane in the aerosol propellant gassing operation at the Belle Mead facility.  Difluoroethane is a flammable substance and is regulated unde"

The specified threshold quantity for flammable substances under the RMP Rule is 10,000 pounds. \n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Programs\nReckitt Benckiser places great importance on the implementation of procedures for responding to and, more importantly, preventing accidental releases of chemicals that have the potential to harm human health or the environment.  \nAt Reckitt Benckiser, we have adopted a rigorous approach to ensuring that hazardous chemicals and flammable liquids are used and stored safely.  One element of that approach is a thorough risk assessment, a formal and exhaustive analysis of chemical processes used to identify and address process hazards.  Risk assessments are conducted on a periodic basis for existing processes and immediately before the final design stage of new or modified processes.\n\nIn a typical risk assessment, team members from a variety of disciplines - engineers, team leaders, plant operators, and maintenance technicians - gather to analyze a chemical process. Every component of the process - pumps, piping, storage tanks, instruments, valves, controls, and safety devices - as well as operating and maintenance practices are evaluated to determine possible causes of failure. Each cause is then reviewed to ensure that one or more levels of safety protection are available in the event a failure occurs. \n\nThe use of risk assessment by analyzing process hazards became universal with the introduction of OSHA?s Process Safety Management regulation in 1993. Although this regulation applies only to certain flammable liquids used at the Belle Mead facility, we recognize the importance and benefits of risk assessment to all our operations and have applied it to other processes that have the potential of creating a significant safety hazard.\n\nSubject to several Fede"

      "SummaryText": "ral and state discharge prevention and process safety requirements for many years, Reckitt Benckiser maintains an environmental program that requires continuous evaluation and improvement of facility compliance programs, work practices, employee training programs, first-responder spill response capabilities, equipment maintenance and repair programs, leak detection systems, and other safety measures.  In an effort to enhance the effectiveness and organization of the several accidental release prevention programs and emergency response programs maintained at the Belle Mead facility, Reckitt Benckiser has recently prepared an Integrated Contingency Plan in compliance with the National Response Team's Integrated Contingency Plan.  This plan also provides guidance to include local emergency responders such as police, fire, and rescue as appropriate.\n\nFive-year Accident History\nFacilities subject to the RMP Rule are also required to report accidents and releases occurring in the last five years in which exposure to a regulated flammable substance, overpressure generated by an explosion of the substance, or radiant heat generated by a fire involving the substance led to death, injury, or response or restoration activities at an environmental receptor on-site or off-site.  Reckitt Benckiser certifies in the RMP submission to the EPA that during the past five years, no accidental releases have occurred involving regulated flammable substances from the ISO Farm according to the EPA's criteria.  \n\nConclusion\nThe safety and control systems on the equipment in and associated with the ISO Farm are state-of-the-art and represent the highest degree of safety and accident prevention currently available for unloading, storage, and distribution of flammable substances.  We also meet and exceed National Fire Protection Association (NFPA 58) standards for the LPG.  As a responsible corporate citizen and neighbor in the community, Reckitt Benckiser acknowledges its duty to prevent accid"
