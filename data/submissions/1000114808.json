ACCIDENTAL RELEASE AND PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe facility operates in accordance with the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) guidelines and standards including the following:\n\nIIAR Bulletin 107, A Suggested Safely and Operating Procedures When Making Ammonia Refrigeration Tie-ins\n\nIIAR Bulletin 109, Minimum Safety Criteria for a Safe Ammonia Refrigeration System\n\nIIAR Bulletin 110, Start-up, Inspection, and Maintenance of Ammonia Refrigeration Systems\n\nIn addition the The Hillshire Brands Company has implemented a Process Safety Management program for compliance with CFR 29, 1910.119. This include an initial Process Hazard Analysis that is re-validate every five years. In addition, the facility has a Mechanical Integrity program that includes an Engineering Checklist for equipment inspections.\n\nD. FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere have been no reported release of ammonia at this facility over the last five years.\n\nE. Emergency Response Program\n\nTLC`s Emergency Response Program is described in  their Emergency Response Plan (ERP) for the The Hillshire Brands Company.\n\nThis plan includes planned responses and procedures for evacuation. Notification and alarm procedures are outlined in the ERP as well. The plan addresses training requirements for employees, including production employees, supervisors, managers, and operators.

These manuals were designed to meet the following objectives.\n\n1) To save lives.\n2) To minimize and avoid injuries.\n3) To protect the environment and the public.\n4) To minimize property damage.\n\nThe Emergency Response Plan had Procedures provides the reporting and notification procedures,evacuations procedures,and mitigation procedures that may be implemented to ensure operators respond effectively to an emergency situation. All employees are trained in there specific roles when responding to an emergency. The manuals are kept in strategic locations throughout the facilities and are readily available to all employees.\n\nB. STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system is a closed loop system that cycles refrigerant, or ammonia, from a liquid to gas and back to liquid again. The system, consisting of vessels, and interconnecting piping, valves, and process equipment,cycles ammonia through various states(high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid,low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration for product and process equipment.\n\nChanges in pressure are directly related to changes in temperature: lowering the ammonia pressure lowers its temperature. Low-pressure(cold) liquid ammonia provides refrigeration by removing ambient heat. Removal"
