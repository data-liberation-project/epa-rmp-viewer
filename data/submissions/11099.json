Lake Charles Refinery\nRisk Management Plan\nExecutive Summary\n\nAIRI Lake Charles Refinery has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety.  This \ncommitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, training of highly qualified \npersonnel, and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of our \nprocesses.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent hydrocarbon  releases.  However, if \na release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control, contain, and mitigate the release.\n\nAIRI is committed to voluntary initiative for safe management of chemicals.  AIRI follows an internal \ncode of Management Practice, which is integral to the implementation of the AIRI Environmental and \nHealth and Safety policies.  The Community Awareness Code of Management Practice and AIRIs \nCommunity Awareness and Emergency Response policies are designed to assist emergency \npreparedness and to faster community right to know.\n\nThe AIRI Lake Charles Refinery, located in Calcasieu Parish, Louisiana, uses crude oil and certain \nadditives as the primary raw materials to produce naphtha, kerosene, diesel fuel and asphalts.  The \nrefinery uses or produces several regulated flammables such as propane, butane, methane. \n\nThere are no chemicals listed in the EPAs list of toxic chemicals which are maintained on site.\n \nThe WCS (worse case scenario) associated with the release of a flammable substance involves the \nrelease of largest inventory, in a single vessel, of mixed propane and butane. Such a release would \nrequire a catasatrophic failure of a pressure vessel with overpressure protection in place. No credit was \ntaken for active mitigation measures when evaluating this scenario. Therefore, the maximum allowable \nsingle vessel inventory allowed to release under established administrative controls is 161,339 pounds. \nThis inventory is as"

These documents address chemical properties and associated \nhazards, limits for key process parameters, specific chemical inventories, and equipment design \nbasis/configuration information.  Specific departments within the chemical complex are assigned \nresponsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information. Employees are provided training on \nhow to locate the information from various computer terminals located throughout the chemical complex.\n\nChemical specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure \ntreatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDS). This information is \nsupplemented by documents that address known corrosion concerns and known hazards associated \nwithin inadvertent mixing of specific chemicals. For the different process areas, the chemical complex has \ndocumented safety related limits for specific process parameters (e.g. temperature, pressure, \ncomposition, etc.). The chemical complex ensures that the processes are maintained within these limits \nusing process controls, monitoring instruments, protective instrument systems, and highly trained \npersonnel.\n\nThe chemical complex also maintains a database, that is accessible by both employees and \ncontractor supervision, which provides information about the design and construction of process \nequipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, \nelectrical classification, etc.  This information in combination with written procedures and trained \npersonnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities as well as for \nevaluati"

Within this program, each process is \nsystematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage \nthese hazards.\n\nThe Lake Charles refinery primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to \nperform these evaluations.  HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough \nhazard evaluation techniques.  The analysis are conducted using a team of people who have operating \nand maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  The team identifies and evaluates \nhazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions \nfor additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are \nnecessary.\n\nThe PHA team findings are made available to people associated with the process unit for comments \nand forwarded to local and corporate management for resolution.  Implementation of mitigation options in \nresponse to PHA findings is based on a relative ranking assigned by the PHA team. This ranking helps \nensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest rank receive immediate attention.  All \napproved mitigation options being implemented in response to PHA findings are tracked until they are \ncomplete.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nOperators, supervisors, and plant engineers work together to develop and maintain operating \nprocedures.  These procedures define how tasks related to process operations are safely performed.  At \nThe Lake Charles Refinery, operating procedures:  (1) are used to train employees and (2) serve as \nreference guides for appropriate actions to ta"

This training includes training on specific types of equipment, such as pumps and \ncompressors, general overview of the process, properties and hazard substances in the process,  \ndetailed review of complex procedures, such as, safe work practices and emergency response.

Process changes that are determined to be a \nreplacement in kind (e.g. replacing a valve with an identical valve) are allowed without completing a full \nmanagement of change program.  All other changes must be confirmed through a full management of \nchange program to help ensure process safety information and procedures are updated, and affected \nemployees are notified of the change.\n\nPre-Startup Safety Review (PSSRs)\n\nThe Lake Charles Refinery conducts a safety review of a new or modified process before the \nprocess is placed in service.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure the safety features, procedures, \npersonnel and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment in service.  \nThe review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design \nspecifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready.
