The Five Year Accident History\n\nThere has never been a reportable accident involving HCL Anhydrous or any other chemical at the Rinchem Company Inc, Colorado Springs, CO Warehouse.\n\n1.5. The Emergency Response Program\n\nOverall safety at the Rinchem Company, Inc, Colorado Springs, CO Warehouse is governed not only by our ability to prevent accidental releases of (HCL anhydrous),from occurring, but also by the ability to mitigate any accidental releases of the above mentioned materials. Rinchem has developed an emergency response program to minimize the effects of accidental releases of (HCL anhydrous), to employees. Rinchem management has opted to respond to releases of these chemicals by containing the spill when it can be safely done and using contracted services for spill cleanup.\n\nThe Colorado Springs Warehouse Emergency Response Program consists of:\n\nEmergency Action Plan & Emergency Evacuation Plan\n\nThe Emergency Response Program outlines the instructions and required information in order to respond to fire, chemical spills, natural disasters and other emergencies that may arise. The emergency response plan and documents are reviewed at least annually and revised as necessary to reflect changes that may occur to content and structure of the plan.\n\n"
