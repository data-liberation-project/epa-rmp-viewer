The covered process is the titanium dioxide manufacturing plant.  This process uses two chemicals included on the EPA regulated list, namely chlorine and titanium tetrachloride.\n\nDuring the five years prior to the date of this report, there were no releases of chlorine or titanium tetrachloride that caused an offsite impact or employee/contractor injuries.\n\nHPP has a comprehensive emergency response plan that is tailored to the process and covered a variety of differen"
