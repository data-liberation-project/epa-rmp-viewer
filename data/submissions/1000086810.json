City of Inglewood staff is well trained and utilizes modern equipment to monitor its facilities to provide safeguards, while effectively employing these useful chemicals.  These chemicals play an important role in water treatment, enabling everyone to lead healthier lives.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nCity of Inglewood has an emergency action plan in effect to handle potential emergencies at this facility.  This plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n\n\n1.) To save lives.\n\n2.) To minimize and avoid injuries.\n\n3.) To protect the environment.\n\n4.) To minimize property damage.\n\n\n\nThe Emergency Action Plan provides notification procedures, evacuation routes, chlorine health hazards and mitigation procedures that will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated periodically and has been reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM, RMP and CalARP regulations.\n\n\n\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance\n\n\n\nThe City of Inglewood Sanford M. Anderson Water Treatment Plant maintains chlorine on-site for use in disinfecting water treated by the plant.  There is a single chlorination building located at the facility housing the chlorine containers.  Chlorine gas is supplied under vacuum from the containers to the chlorinators which regulate the chlorine feed.  Downstream of the vacu"

      "SummaryText": "um regulators installed on each container, the system is operated under vacuum as a safety measure.  The vacuum is created at the chlorinators by water flow through a set of injectors.  In case of a break, the vacuum regulators close automatically minimizing the quantity of chlorine gas that may escape from the system.  Also, the entire system is connected to the gaseous side of the container.  This is also an important safety feature.  Chlorine detectors are provided for the chlorination building to maximize safety and minimize release of any chlorine gas from the storage building into the atmosphere.  The detectors alarm locally and remotely. \n\n\n\nThe City of Inglewood Sanford M. Anderson Water Treatment Plant also maintains 19% aqueous ammonia on-site for use in disinfecting water treated by the plant.  The Aqueous Ammonia System is situated in a containment area inside the fence line of the plant.  Aqueous ammonia is supplied from the Aqueous Ammonia Storage tank to the injection point.  A Vapor Diffuser is used as a safety measure to minimize the possibility of ammonia vapors being released into the atmosphere.  Pressure switches are placed downstream of the pumps as a safety feature.  If the pressure rises above or below the operating parameters, the pumps will automatically shut down.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nCity of Inglewood Sanford M. Anderson Water Treatment Plant has PSM and RMP programs in place to manage the handling of chlorine and aqueous ammonia.  The programs include strict requirements for written operating procedures, personnel training, contractor safety, equipment maintenance, incident investigation, process hazard analysis, management of change and periodic review or audit of the implementation of program elements.  Management of change element addresses proper implementation of system updates to ensure that all changes are reviewed properly by knowledgeable persons, all engineering do"

Process Safety Management also requires a pre-startup safety review to ensure that the system is properly reviewed before it is put back into service after a major change.  \n\n\n\nIn addition to PSM and RMP, common industry standards, policies, and procedures are strictly followed.  Also, common practices outlined by the Chlorine Institute are implemented in system design and day-to-day system operation.  \n\n\n\n\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\n\n\nThe five-year accident history (April 2015 to April 2020) for the City of Inglewood Sanford M. Anderson Water Treatment Plant reveals that there were no reportable accidents during this period.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nWhen implementation of the PSM and RMP compliance program was initiated, several studies were conducted that included recommendations to enhance safety.  Those recommendations have been addressed,  Recent review of the system and associated safety programs has not identified any additional safety related improvements.\n\n"
