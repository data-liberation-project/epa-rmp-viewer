This Program summarizes the management, administrative, procedural, and technological controls that work together to minimize the risk to site personnel, contractors, visitors, and the community and environment at large of hazardous chemical releases. The Risk Management Plan (RMP) is organized to correspond with specific U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) RMP, Program 3 of 40 CFR 68, definitions and requirements of Subpart G, including: \r\n\u00bf\tIntroduction;\r\n\u00bf\tWhole Foods' policies to protect health, environment, and safety;\r\n\u00bf\tFacility identification and regulated substances covered processes;\r\n\u00bf\tHazard Assessment;\r\n\u00bf\tPrevention Program;\r\n\u00bf\tFive-Year Accident History;\r\n\u00bf\tEmergency Response Plan; \r\n\u00bf\tEmergency Communications;\r\n\u00bf\tSpill Reporting / Environmental Release Procedures;\r\n\u00bf\tPlanned changes to improve safety; and\r\n\u00bf\tManagement Program\r\n\r\nII.\tWhole Foods' Policies To Protect Health, Environment, and Safety\r\nRisk management and safety are important concerns at Whole Foods; this RMP formalizes and documents these activities. Whole Foods is committed to conducting its operations in a safe and responsible manner and to reducing risks to human health and to the environment. It is Whole Foods policy to comply with all applicable federal, state, and local rules and regulations. \r\n\r\nThis RMP has identified potential hazards and has taken steps to design and maintain a safe facility in order to prevent releases, and minimize the consequences of accidental releases, which could occur. This RMP addresses potentially catastrophic chemical releases that could result in immediate harm and acute health effects to offsite receptors (public and environmental).

The NAICS code for the facility is 49311 - Refrigerated Warehousing and Storage. \r\n\r\nThe facility uses ammonia for refrigeration, and is regulated under 40 CFR Part 68, the EPA RMP Rule. There is one (1) refrigeration system onsite that is used for cold storage. \r\n\r\nThe amount of ammonia currently present in the refrigeration system is approximately 11,500 pounds.  The refrigeration system is used to cool the storage coolers and freezers. \r\n\r\nIV.\tHazard Assessment - Worst Case Scenarios (WCS)\r\nAppendix A consists of the RMP*Submit Printout and contains additional information on the worst-case scenario.  Appendix B consists of the offsite consequence analysis data and maps for the worst case release scenario. \r\n\r\nV.\tHazard Assessment - Alternative Release Scenarios (ARS)\r\nAppendix A consists of the RMP*Submit Printout and contains additional information on the alternative release scenario.  Appendix C consists of the offsite consequence analysis data and maps for the alternative release scenario. \r\n\r\n \r\nVI.\tGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program\r\nA prevention program is in place to minimize the risk of hazardous chemical releases in accordance with the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (29 CFR 1910.119) and the EPA Risk Management Program.   However, as discussed throughout this document Whole Foods is continuously improving this program. \r\n\r\nThis prevention program covers those processes that handle ammonia above the threshold quantity for both PSM and RMP rules. The first audit of the PSM program will be conducted on or before September 15, 2020, in compliance with the requirement to conduct PSM audits every three years.

In addition, the employee participation program will ensure employees and their representatives have access to process hazard analyses and all other information required to be developed under PSM/RMP.  \r\n\u00bf\tProcess Safety Information - Whole Foods maintains a site-specific PSI program that ensures information pertaining to the hazards, technology, and equipment of the process are properly developed and maintained. \r\n\u00bf\tProcess Hazard Analysis - Whole Foods has developed a site-specific PHA program that ensures a PHA is conducted initially, at a minimum of every five (5) years, and whenever a change is significant enough to require a change in PSI.  In addition, this program ensures PHAs are conducted in accordance with OSHA and EPA regulations and ensures findings and recommendations of PHAs are properly documented. Whole Foods conducted an initial PHA study for the ammonia refrigeration system on September 14-15, 2017.\r\n\u00bf\tOperating Procedures - Whole Foods has updated a site-specific procedure that ensures operating procedures provide clear instruction for different phases of process operations and ensures they are properly maintained.  Whole Foods developed initial operating procedures for the refrigeration system on September 6 and 13, 2017.  \r\n\u00bf\tTraining - Whole Foods has developed a site-specific training procedure that ensures employees operating the ammonia process have the knowledge to safely operate the process, are aware of the potential hazards of the process, and understand the causes of process problems.\r\n \r\n\u00bf\tManagement of Change - Whole Foods has developed a site-specific management of change procedure that ensures changes (except for replacement"
