The refrigeration process at this facility is comprised of two (2) independent ammonia refrigeration systems (North System and South System) both of which are closed-loop, mechanical refrigeration systems. Liquid ammonia is supplied by pumps or pressure differential to the production and process area evaporators for cooling and freezing purposes. Ammonia vapor and liquid from the evaporators returns to recirculators and/or suction accumulators. The normal high-side operating pressure ranges from 130 to 185 psig. The maximum allowable high side working pressure is 250 psig.\r\n\r\nAs part of the PSM program, Birchwood Foods has completed a process hazard analysis, developed written operating procedures, trained employees on awareness and system operation, established procedures to conduct management of change procedures and pre-startup safety reviews, and developed a mechanical integrity program for ammonia refrigeration equipment. In addition to the daily monitoring of the refrigeration process, Lakeside Foods implements an ongoing preventive maintenance program to ensure the refrigeration equipment and safety systems are maintained in good operating condition.\r\n\r\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\n\r\nA PSM program, which meets the requirements of the RMP general accidental release prevention program, is being implemented by Birchwood Foods to address the anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system at the Columbus, OH facility.
