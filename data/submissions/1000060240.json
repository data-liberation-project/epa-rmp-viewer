Lakeville WTF has a maximum quantity of twelve (12) one ton (2,000 pounds each) cylinders of chlorine on site.   A Risk Management Plan (RMP) is required because the on-site storage quantity of  is above the RMP threshold of 2,500 pounds and is subject to Process Safety Management (PSM) due to the storage exceeding 1,500 pounds in a single process.\n\n\n\nThis RMP needs to meet Program 3 requirements, because the chlorine storage triggers the PSM and RMP threshold quantities and the process has the potential to impact off-site receptors resulting from a worst-case release scenario.   The RMP requires the Data Elements Submission, an Offsite Consequence Analysis, a Program 3 Prevention Program, and an Emergency Response Plan.  \n\n3.1    City Policy\n\nLakeville WTF has developed policies for enhancement of employee health and safety and environmental management programs.  Lakeville WTF is strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety.  Each individual employee is responsible for observing all safety regulations and practicing good safety at all times.  No job is too important to not take the time to perform the work safely.  No operation shall be carried out until safety is assured.  The Lakeville WTF is audited by corporate personnel on an annual basis to ensure continued enhancement of its health and safety and environmental programs.\n\n3.2    Stationary Source Information\n\nLakeville WTF is subject to Program 3 RMP requirements, because the chlorine storage is above the PSM and RMP threshold quantities and the worst-case release scenario could impact off-site receptors.  Thus, an alternative release scenario was also performed.  The "

The alternative release scenario was determined for a pipe rupture release.  The distances to the toxic endpoint for the worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario were 1.3 mile and 0.3 mile respectively.  \n\n3.4    Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nLakeville WTF has taken all necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set forth under 40 CFR Part 68.   Lakeville WTF has developed the required elements of a Program 3 prevention program, including Safety Information, Hazard Review, Operating Procedures, Training, Maintenance, Compliance Audit, and Incident Investigation programs.  In addition, Lakeville WTF has prepared an Emergency Response Plan designed for timely, safe, and efficient response to minimize hazards to human health and safety.  The plan is reviewed and updated periodically to ensure that the information is accurate.\n\n3.5    Five-Year Accident History\n\nWithin the previous five years, Lakeville WTF did not have any accidental release of chlorine that caused deaths, injuries, or the need for response or restoration activities.  \n\n3.6    Emergency Response Program\n\nLakeville WTF has written Emergency Plans and Procedures to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials.  The plan includes all aspects of emergency response actions including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency responders, as well as post-incident clean-up and decontamination of affected areas.  \n\n\n\nThe Emergency Plans and Procedures for Lakeville WTF was last updated in October 2011.  Lakeville WTF also has a spill plan to prevent and control the accidental release of hazardous waste material from this facility.\n"

Lakeville WTP may set up contracts with its supplier and/or qualified service companies to conduct the annual inspection and servicing the chlorine system.\n\n3.8    General Duty Clause\n\nThe RMP regulations include a general duty clause to prevent release of any hazardous material regardless of quantity stored on-site.  Other than chlorine, Lakeville WTF stores additional process chemicals in enclosed designated chemical storage areas at various rooms within the building, which are equipped with spill containment and proper ventilation.  The risk of releases from chemical storage areas at Lakeville WTF is low due to inherent safeguards, proper handling procedures and employee training.  Thus, these activities were not included in the off-site consequence analysis for this facility. \n\n4.0    Data Elements\n\nLakeville WTF has completed the required data elements information required for RMP submission to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA).  A diskette and printout of the data elements submission report is included on this diskette.  \n\n\n\n5.0    Off-Site Consequence Analysis\n\n\n\nThe Off-site Consequence Analysis (OCA) for Lakeville WTF's RMP includes a worst-case release scenario and an alternative release scenario.

The chlorine tank is located inside a building, which was considered for purposes of this analysis.  However, in order to present the most conservative (overestimated) worst-case scenario, safeguards present at the Lakeville WTP were not considered.

Urban setting was used for the most conservative release scenario.  Thus, a limited amount of residential areas, a large health club, and two schools could be impacted by a worst-case release scenario.  Based on a conservative estimation by the City of Lakeville GIS staff, the number of persons within the area impacted by a worst-case release scenario would be fewer than 9,300 persons.

It is the goal of Lakeville WTP to develop and build a relationship with the community and build trust among the public, neighbors, and the community at large.\n\n\n\nAs part of its company objectives, Lakeville WTF intends to take its place as a good citizen in the community.

Chlorine is toxic and can lead to a respiratory irritation if released in sufficient quantities.  Chlorine is a gas at ambient conditions.  Therefore, it is normally stored as a pressurized liquid.  Being heavier that air, it can collect in low places and displace oxygen.  There is nothing that can be done to change the properties of chlorine.  Another example of hazard is from the natural causes, such as severe weather, floods or earthquakes.  \n\n\n\nRisk is usually evaluated based on several variables, including the likelihood of the rele"

For example, if a release occurs during loading and the quantity of release is small and does not migrate offsite, the overall risk to the public is low.  If the likelihood of a catastrophic release is extremely low, but the number of people who could be affected is large, the overall risk may still be low because of the low probability that a release will occur.  \n\n\n\nWhat does the Worst-Case Release Distance Mean?\n\nThe worst case distance is intended to provide an estimate of the maximum possible area that might be affected under catastrophic conditions.  It is intended to ensure that no potential risks to public health are overlooked, but the distance to an endpoint under worst-case conditions should not be considered a \"public danger zone\".  In most cases, the models used to determine the extent of a worst-case release scenario may overestimate the area that would be impacted by a release.  For great distances from the site, the models are especially uncertain.  The models do not incorporate site-specific factors, such as buildings or berms located between the source and the public.  These obstacles could mitigate and reduce the area of impact, if a worst-case release should occur.\n\n\n\nIf there is an accident, will everyone within 1.3 miles be hurt?\n\nIn general, no.  For a flammable release, everyone with the circle would certainly feel the blast wave since it would move in all directions at once.  However, while some people within the circle could be hurt, it is unlikely that everyone would be since some people would probably be in less vulnerable locations.  Most injuries would probably be due to flying glass, falling debris, or impact with nearby objects.  Generally, it is the people closest to the facility who would face the greatest danger if an accident occurred.  In an explosion, environmental impacts and"

      "SummaryText": " property damage may extend beyond the distances at which injuries could occur.  \n\n\n\nFor toxic chemicals, whether someone is hurt by a release depends on many factors.  First, the released chemicals would usually move in the direction of the wind (except for some dense gases, which may be constrained by terrain features to flow in a different direction).  Generally, only people downwind from the facility would be at risk of exposure if a release occurred, and this is normally only a part of the population inside the circle.  If the wind speed is moderate, the chemicals would disperse quickly, and people would be exposed to lower levels of the chemical.  If the release is stopped quickly, they might be exposed for a very short period of time, which is less likely to cause injury.  However, if the wind speed is low or the release continues for a long time, exposure levels will be higher and more dangerous.  The population at risk would be a larger proportion of the total population inside the circle.  \n\n\n\nGenerally, it is the people who are closest to the facility who would face the greatest danger is an accident occurred.  Damage to property and the environment will depend on the type of chemical released.  In an explosion, environmental impacts and property damage may extend beyond the distance at which injuries could occur.  For a vapor release, environmental effects and property damage may occur as a result of the reactivity or corrosivity of the chemical or toxic contamination.   \n\n(Excerpt from the Risk Management Program Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants) \n\n\n\nHow sure are you of your distances?\n\nThe distances determined in this RMP were based on conservative estimates which would tend to overestimate the impact area from a catastrophic release.  The model represents scientist's best efforts to account for all variables involved in an accidental release.  No model is perfect and different models can produce differing results.

Lakeville WTF believes that using a conservative approach yields conservative (overestimate) results for the distances that would occur from a worst-case release.  Lakeville WTF recognizes that within the predicted distance is a band of uncertainty, and in the unlikely event of a catastrophic release, the extent of impact may be shorter or longer depending upon the conditions at the time of release.   \n\n\n\nDo you need to store twelve one-ton containers on-site?\n\nLakeville WTP has determined that storing a maximum of twelve one ton containers at the facility is the best balance between maintaining operations at the facility and public safety.  Alternatives to storing the ton containers on site would be shipment of chlorine more frequently.  An increase frequency of chlorine shipments increases the risk for on-road accidents and as well as handling accidents during delivery of the chlorine.  The amount of chlorine stored at Lakeville WTF is sufficient to last approximately 10 weeks or so.  The usage is dependent upon the municipal demands.  \n\n \n\nWhat are you doing to prevent releases?\n\nLakeville WTP believes that the safety of its employees and community are of primary importance.  Lakeville WTF is committed to developing and implementing safe work practices and procedures, and to maintain equipment in a safe condition.  Lakeville WTF is also committed to providing training to employees to enable then to work and prevent accidents from occurring.  Employees are trained and instructed to comply with all safety rules, regulations, and procedures.\n\n\n\nIn addition to proper training of employees, supervisors and managers are responsible for managing emergency response actions and procedures.  Supervisors and managers will be accountable for actively supporting and participating in the RMP program, including communication of, compliance with, and monitoring of safety performanc"

In the event of a release, Lakeville WTF has developed procedures and contingencies to respond. Employees have been trained to properly respond to releases of chlorine to protect themselves, other employees, and the public.  \n\n\n\nIn the event of a release that is beyond the control, or presents and unacceptable risk to employees, the City of Lakeville Fire Department may respond to the emergency.  The Lakeville Fire Department will implement their incident command system to manage the emergency response and request additional assistance, if necessary.\n\n\n\nHow likely are the worst-case and alternative release scenarios?\n\nIt is generally not possible to provide accurate numerical estimates of how likely these scenarios are.  EPA has stated that providing such numbers for accident scenarios rarely is feasible because the data needed (e.g.  rates for equipment failure and human error) are not usually available.  Even when data are available, there are large uncertainties in applying the data because each facility's situation is unique.\n\n\n\nIn general, the worst-case scenario is low.  Although catastrophic vessel failures have occurred, they are rare events.  The alternative scenario, although more likely, is also believed to occur very rarely.  Lakeville WTF is committed to developing and maintaining safe work practices and procedures, to maintain equipment in a safe condition.  Lakeville WTF is also committed to providing training to employees to enable them to work and prevent accidents from occurring.  Employees are trained and instructed to comply with all safety rules, regulations, and procedures.  As evidence of Lakeville WTF's committed adherence to safe work practices and procedures, the chlorine system has not experienced a reportable release or incident since Lakeville WTF obtained ownership of the "

      "SummaryText": "site in 1997.\n\n\n\nIs the worst-case release scenario you reported really the worst accident you can have?\n\nEPA defined a specific scenario (failure or the single largest vessel) to provide a common basis of comparison among facilities nationwide.  Lakeville WTF stores a maximum of twelve one-ton 2,000 pounds each) containers of chlorine.  The absolute worst scenario would occur if the entire contents of one tank was released resulting in a toxic cloud.  The chlorine containers stored at the Lakeville WTF are self contained and not interconnected.  It should be noted that the relationship between the quantity of toxics released and the distance to the endpoint are not directly proportional.  Thus, doubling the release quantity does not double the distance to the endpoint.  Lakeville WTF has determined that such a release would be extremely unlikely and the worst-case release from a single vessel was appropriate.   \n\n\n\nAn event that may result in the complete release of chlorine from multiple vessels would most likely involve a disaster, such as a tornado, that completely destroys the facility.  If this occurred, the effects of the natural disaster would make modeling the release nearly impossible and certainly very inaccurate.  In this case, the primary and secondary effects of a tornado and response requirements to the citizens in the area would be the primary concern.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRisk Management Plan:  Lakeville Water Treatment Plant\n\nOctober 2011 (updated October 2016)\n\n"
