      "SummaryText": "A. Describe the Accident Release Prevention and Emergency Policies\n\nIt is the policy of Campbell Soup Supply Company that the receipt, storage, and handling of chlorine and ammonia at its facility in Sacramento, CA be done in a manner that meets regulatory requirements and minimizes the probability and severity of releases of chlorine and ammonia to the atmosphere in order to protect the health and safety of its workers, the public, and the environment.  In order to accomplish this goal, Campbell Soup Supply Company has gathered safety information on chlorine and ammonia, performed a structured assessment of hazards of the processes and external events that might affect the processes, performed an offsite consequence analysis of defined release scenarios, established a written program for prevention and mitigation of releases, and established a written emergency action plan coordinated with emergency response agencies.\n\nThe Environmental Project Engineer is responsible for the management of the chlorine and ammonia risk management programs.\n\n\nB.   Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nCampbell Soup operates a food processing plant located at 6200 Franklin Blvd., Sacramento in Sacramento County.  The facility prepares food ingredients, blends food ingredients, and fills food products into containers for sale throughout the Western United States.  The regulated substances used at Campbell SoupA?s facility and considered in this RMP are chlorine and anhydrous ammonia.  Chlorine gas is used in one process to disinfect well water for process uses.  Anhydrous ammonia is used at the facility in two separate processes as a refrigerant.\n\n\nC.   Description of the Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe facility has an accident release prevention program that complies with the California Accidental Release Prevention (Cal ARP) regulations, OSHA's Process Safety Management Standard (PSM) and EPA's Risk Management Program Regulation.\n\nThe accident release preven"

Five-Year Accident History\n\nThere have not been any chlorine or ammonia related incidents at the Sacramento Plant during the previous five years that resulted in significant on-site or offsite consequences.\n\n\nE.   Description of the Emergency Action Plan\n\nThe emergency response plan for this facility consists of notifying emergency responders and evacuating personnel to designated assembly areas upwind of the release location.   Once the affected areas have been isolated, trained facility personnel will respond to chlorine and ammonia releases up to an Operations level per HAZWOPER regulations.  Their role is to contain a release from a safe distance, keep it from spreading, and prevent possible exposures.  If the release is beyond the capabilities of facility personnel, representatives from the Sacramento County HAZMAT Division would be called to respond to the incident.\n\nThe emergency response program has been coordinated with the Fire Department and with the Sacramento County EMD.\n\n\nF.   Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nSeveral modifications have been made to the ammonia and chlorine systems over the past five years to improve safety.  These include, among other items, additional system alarms and interlocks, additional ammonia detectors, and installation of a water diffusion tank.  Since all measures identified have already been implemented to date there are no current planned changes to further improve safety at the facility."
