This RMP/CalARP, submitted by Applied Energy LLC (AE LLC), presents the 5-year anniversary update and resubmittal; there have been no process changes (per 40 CFR Part 68.190) since June 21, 1999.\n\nAs background for this facility, AE LLC is the current owner.

This RMP/CalARP, submitted by Applied Energy LLC (AE LLC), presents the 5-year anniversary update and resubmittal; there have been no process changes (per 40 CFR Part 68.190) since June 21, 1999.\r\n\r\nAs background for this facility, AE LLC is the current owner. Applied Energy, Inc. (AEI) was owner/operator of the facility that prepared a Risk Management and Prevention Program (RMPP) for handling anhydrous ammonia (NH3) at this facility in October 1996, and submitted the RMPP to the San Diego County Department of Environmental Health?s Hazardous Materials Division (HMD) under the former California RMPP rule.  HMD approved the RMPP for this facility on January 14, 1997.  HMD granted approval for AEI to revise and update the existing RMPP and submit it as a Risk Management Plan (RMP) to U.S. EPA and HMD under the California Accidental Release Program (CalARP); AEI?s RMP/CalARP document was submitted June 21, 1999. For purposes of this update and resubmittal, the previous references to AEI are replaced by AE LLC in this document.\r\n\r\nAs required by the federal EPA, this executive summary has been submitted to the EPA under the filename ?NVS_EXEC? as a text document.  This RMP Public Document presents the efforts of AE LLC to manage and prevent risks associated with the storage and use of anhydrous ammonia at its cogeneration facility located at 32nd Street U.S. Naval Station (NAVSTA) in t"
