Risks for acciential exposure to ammonia n a vapor state sre irritation to the eyes, nose, throat. The extent of irriataion is dependant of level of concentation and durtaion of exposure. Ammnia is classified non-flammable by the DOT. Ammonia will burn, but onlt ia a very narrow concentration level, when accompanied with a constant ignition source.\n\nThe normal inventory of level of ammonia used at this facility is 18,000 pounds.\n\n\n\n3. The following administrative and engineering controls are in place at this facility. These controls are designed to eliminate, or reduce the possibility of an ammonia release.\n\n* Electronic ammonia detectors in compressor, vessel, and warehouse areas.

General accidental release and prevention policy of Merchants Terminal\n\nIn this frozen food distribution center we utilize anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant. Anhydrous ammonia is considered hazardous by the Environmental Protection Agency. The same properties that make ammonia a valuable refrigerant also makes its necessary to observe certain safety percautions during its use to prevent exposure to our workers, the surrounding community and the environment. It is our policy at Merchants Terminal Corporation to implement the requirments of the Risk Management Program by manageing and operating this facility in full compliance with all applicable federal and state regulations. The objective is to minimize the risk of an accidental ammonia release. Safety depends directly on our proper handling of ammonia. Our plant personnel have been trained on the equipment operating procedures and various safety devices that are incorporated in our facilty to prevent the possibility of accidental releases.\n\n2.   Stationary source and regulated substane handles.\n\nMerchants Terminal Corporation, 7950 Oceano Avenue, Jessup, Maryland is responsible for the storagre and distribution of various frozen food products.
