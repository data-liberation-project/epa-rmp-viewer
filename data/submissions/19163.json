Chlorine is a regulated substance under 40 CFR Part 68 Accidental Release Prevention Requirements and meets the minimum requirements set forth in the EPA Risk Management Plan.\n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency policy at the plant is to adhere to all applicable federal and state rules and regulations to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to our own employees, contractor employees, and to reduce the risk to nearby members of the community.
