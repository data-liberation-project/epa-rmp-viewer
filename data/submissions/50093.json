This commitment is demonstrated by the resources it has invested in accident prevention and training, as well as considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the facility.  RRE's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent release of regulated substances.  However, if a release occurs, RRE personnel may respond to contain and control the release.\n\n\n\nStationary Source Description and Regulated Substance\n\nThe plant is located just east of Rosholt, SD and operates 24 hours per day, 7 days a week manufacturing fuel grade ethanol from corn.  Denaturant (natural gasoline) is stored in a 17,500-gallon aboveground storage tank and anhydrous ammonia (liquidfied under pressure) is stored in portable 2- or 3-ton tanks (maximum of three 3-ton tanks on-site).  Denaturant contains greater than 1% of regulated substances (butane, isopentane, and pentane) and is regulated as a Flammable Mixture.  Anhydrous ammonia is a listed Toxic Substance.  This RMP is submitted to cover denaturant and anhydrous ammonia stored at RRE.\n\n\n\nOff-Site Consequence Analysis Results\n\nRRE meets RMP Program 3 eligibility requirements.  The worst case scenario for a toxic gas is release of the entire contents of one 3-ton anhydrous ammonia storage tank.  The worst case toxic gas release generates a 0.14 mg/L toxic endpoint about 1.4 miles from the tank and affects the entire population of the Town of Rosholt, SD (419 persons or 199 homes; 2000 Census).  The Alternative Release Scenario (ARS) evaluated release of toxic gas because of a hose break.  This ARS generates a 0.14 mg/L toxic endpoint about 0.3 miles from the tank and also affects the Town of Rosholt.\n\n\n\nThe worst case scenario for a flammable substance is release of the entire contents of the 17"

The worst case flammable substance release generates a 1 psig over-pressure endpoint about 0.3 mile from the tank and also affects the Town of Rosholt, SD.  The ARS evaluated release of a flammable substance because of a hose break.  This ARS generates a dispersion distance of 0.1 mile to the lower flammability limit (LFL) for a vapor cloud fire and does not affect the Town of Rosholt.\n\n\n\nAlthough RRE has numerous controls in place to prevent such releases and to manage potential consequences, no credit for administrative controls or passive or active mitigation measures were taken into account when evaluating these scenarios.\n\n\n\n5 Year Accident History\n\nRRE purchased the facility formerly know as North Country Ethanol in September 2011.  RRE is not aware of any RMP reportable accidents at the facility within the last 5 years.  \n\n\n\nPrevention Program Information\n\nThe plant prevention program includes safety information (Material Safety Data Sheets, regulated substance inventory, and equipment and process specifications), periodic reviews, written operating procedures consistent with safety information, training (weekly, monthly, quarterly, and annually), maintenance schedules and procedures, and compliance audits.     \n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program Information\n\nRRE's Safety Compliance Manual, Emergency Action Plan, and Spill Prevention Countermeasure and Control (SPCC) Plan address emergency response requirements.  These documents are updated as necessary.  The Safety Compliance Manual includes Emergency Notification and Contingency Planning, Emergency Fire Protection & Prevention Plan, and Spill Prevention/Reaction Plan sections.  The Emergency Action Plan addresses numerous emergencies, including releases/spills, and explosions.  The SPCC Plan includes spill prevention and response activities.  Employee training is required.   \n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nRRE acquired"
