The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first-aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post incident cleanup and decontamination procedures.  In addition the East Texas Gas Plant has procedures that address maintenance, inspection and testing of emergency response equipment, as well as instructions that address the use of emergency response equipment.  Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties.  The emergency response program is updated as necessary.  Any significant changes to the emergency response program are administered through the management of change (MOC) process, which includes informing and/or training affected personnel in the changes.\r\n\r\n The overall emergency response program for the East Texas Gas Plant is coordinated with the volunteer Carthage Fire Department.  This coordination includes periodic meetings with the local emergency response officials, local government officials, and industry representatives.

Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by (1) equipment failures and (2) human errors.\r\n\r\nSpecialized Safety Features\r\n\r\nThe East Texas Gas Plant has safety features on many units to help (1) contain/control a release, (2) quickly detect a release, and (3) reduce the consequences of (mitigate) a release.  The following types of safety features are used in the covered processes:\r\n\r\nRelease Detection\r\n\r\n1. Hydrocarbon detectors with alarms in all closed compressor buildings \r\n\r\nRelease Containment/Control\r\n\r\n1.  Process relief valves that discharge to a flare/vent system to handle episodic releases\r\n2.  Valves to permit isolation of the process (manual or automated)\r\n3.  Automated shutdown systems for specific process parameter (e.g., high level, high temperature)\r\n4.  Curbing or diking to contain liquid releases\r\n5.  Redundant equipment and instrumentation (e.g., uninterruptible power supply for process control system, backup firewater pump)\r\n6.  Atmospheric relief devices\r\n\r\nRelease Mitigation\r\n\r\n1.  Fire suppression and extinguishing systems\r\n2.  Trained emergency first-responder personnel\r\n3.  Personal protective equipment \r\n4.  Spacing of equipment in accordance with IRI spacing"

Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures are updated to incorporate these changes.  In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on the change.\r\n\r\nIncident Investigation\r\n\r\nThe East Texas Gas Plant promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury.  The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to East Texas Gas Plant management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation teams findings and recommendations are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings.

The East Texas Gas Plant incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs.  This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.  Pre-startup safety reviews are also used to support the quality assurance program.\r\n\r\n Safe Work Practices\r\n\r\nThe East Texas Gas Plant has long-standing safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety.  Examples of these include (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment that is being worked on, (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous materials before process piping or equipment is opened, (4) a permit and procedure to control spark-producing activities (i.e., hot work), and (5) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space.

The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure safety features, procedures, personnel, and the equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally read.  A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements were properly implemented.\r\n\r\nMechanical Integrity\r\n\r\nThe East Texas Gas Plant has well-established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition.

New employees receive initial training in East Texas Gas Plant operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate (e.g., tests, skill demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years.  All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\r\n\r\nContractors\r\n\r\nThe East Texas Gas Plant uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.

All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\r\n\r\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the East Texas Gas Plant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.

This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.  We also work closely with our public emergency responders providing them with training and equipment so that they can respond safety and efficiently to emergencies that might occur at our facility.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES \r\n\r\nThe East Texas Gas Plant, located 5 miles east of Carthage, Texas on US 79 north, operates a variety of processes to produce petroleum products (e.g., natural gas, & condensate) from oil and gas wells.  The East Texas Gas Plant handles methane, ethane, propane and butane which are regulated flammables. It processes approximately 400 million cubic feet a day of raw natural gas and natural gas liquids.  The East Texas Gas Plant does not use, process or store a reportable quantity of toxic regulated substances.\r\n\r\nFive-Year Accident History\r\n\r\nWithin the past five years the process has had no accidental release that caused onsite or offsite impacts provided in the risk management program rule (40 CFR 68.42.(a)).\r\n\r\n GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM/CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\n\r\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the East Texas Gas Plant.
