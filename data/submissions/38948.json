      "SummaryText": "The City of Madison WWTP handles Chlorine above threshold levels.  They have had no accidents in the past 5 years.  They handle Chlorine based on the procedures outlined by the equipment designer and Chlorine distributor.  Audio and Visual alarms are set at 8 parts per million (ppm) in both the storage room and the control room.  They are checked regularly to assure operability.  Employees use a hoist in the storage area to remove cylinders from delivery trucks and they are then set in place in the storage room.  Installation of cylinders follows procedures outlined by the equipment manufacturer.  The vacuum system provides engineering controls for the chlorine process.  If a vacuum is lost on the discharge port, gas flow from the cylinder stops.  Employees use lead washers for attachement of the yokes to the cylinders.  Once the lines have been attached, employees use ammonia swabs to check for leaks.  The exhaust system can be controlled remotely.  Warning lights and horns are to prevent entry of chlorine levels in the room exceed 8 ppm.  In a large release situation the facility would call for the local Hazardous Materials Team to come to the scene.  The chemical distributor also has a Hazardous Materials Team which would come assist."
