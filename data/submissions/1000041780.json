The methodologies used to carry out these analyses are Reactive Chemical/Process Hazard Analysis Reviews, Layer of Protection Analysis Reviews, and other reviews such as annual Management System Reviews.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations, and are revalidated at a regular interval of three years.  Production personnel are integral team members in these reviews.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.  The most recent PHA/update was performed on 9/11/2013.\r\n\r\nOperating Procedures\r\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, The Dow Chemical Company maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\r\n\r\nTraining\r\nThe Dow Chemical Company has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Refresher training is provided at least every three years and more frequently as needed.\r\n\r\nMechanical Integrity\r\nThe Dow Chemical Company carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.

      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\r\n\r\n1. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\nWe at The Dow Chemical Company are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\r\n\r\n2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\r\nOur facility's primary activities encompass production of polyurethane systems.  We have one regulated substance present at our facility, Toluene Diisocyanate (unspecified isomer) [Benzene, 1,3-diisocyanatomethyl-] [CAS 26471-62-5] (TDI).  The liquid is stored in a single tank at the facility, and is used in the production polyurethane systems.\r\n\r\n3. The Worst Case and the Alternative Case Scenarios\r\nThe Worst Case Scenario and the Alternative Case Scenario were completed using RMP*Comp, Version 2.01, the version available on line at the time of submittal. These scenarios are described in the data supplied with this submission. \r\nThe Worst Case Scenario considers total loss of containment of the site's single bulk storage tank.  Material is contained in the concrete dike surrounding the tank, though we also modeled loss of the dike to understand the effect that might have. \r\nThe storage tank is assumed to be full to the high limit (116,273 lbs) and to be held at the upper limit for storage temperature, 92 degrees Fahrenheit. \r\nThe resulting potential affected radius is the same in both scenarios, .4 mile using Worst Case modeling (.1 miles with Alternative Case modeling for these scenarios). Placement of the tank and dike behind sheltering structures, and the heavy construction of the dike walls make loss of containment with an intact dike the more cr"

      "SummaryText": "edible scenario. \r\nThe Alternative Case Scenario considers loss of integrity of the hose connecting a delivering TDI tanker truck to the plant offload pump. No credit is taken for the operating discipline practice of being in attendance during unloading, or for the process control system which would stop the pump and alarm if a no weight increase was detected from the storage tank, or if a no pressure condition was detected at the pump. It is assumed these safeguards have failed and that intervention would not occur until the entire tanker load was lost.   \r\nThe loss is assumed to be full load of 45,000 lbs at the maximum delivery temperature of 120 degrees Fahrenheit.  Credit is taken for the construction of the unload area, which has a dike. The resulting potential affected radius is .1 mile. \r\nChanges in scenario selection and consideration from the last submission of 2009 were due to the wish to better document the effects of a possible loss of containment of the bulk storage tank.  \r\nDue to a change in applicable NAICS code to 325211 (Plastics material and resin manufacturing) the Marietta site now falls under Program 3.  The Dow internal procedures and requirements followed by our site were already structured to comply with Program 3, as this is the predominant Program requirement for plants subject to RMP elsewhere in the company.   Moving from Program 2 to Program 3 will have a nil effect on site practices and procedures. \r\n\r\n4. General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with applicable API / ASME Specifications, Southern Building Code, and Corporate Standards.
