To ensure the safe operation of our process, SSI has complied witrh OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) Title 29 Code of Federal Regulation(CFR) 1910.119, EPA's Risk Management Program regulations (RMP) Title 40 CFR Part 68, and ANSI/IIAR 2-1992 Standard for Equipment, Design, and Installation of Ammonia Mechanical Refrigeration Systems.\n\nTo deal with the risks involved with ammonea refrigeration, programs have been developed to prevent the occurence of a release and or minimize the consequences of a significant release of anhydrous ammonia, fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents.  Programs developed for the PSM/RM plan include employee participation, process safety information, process hazard analysis, pre-startup safety review, standard operating procedures, training, management of change, mechanical integrity, hot work permit, contractor qualifications, and incident investigation.  To help coordinate the plan, a management program has been established as well as an internal audit program which will help identity compliance status and possible deficiencies in the program.  In the event of a toxic release , an emergency responce plan coordinated with the locan emergency planning commission (LEPC), rural fiire department and trained company personnel has been written.  Annuall drills are held to ensure that all emergency responding agencies are familure with the plan and their responsibilities.  The ultimate goal for SSI's PSM/RM plan is to prevent accidental fatalities, injuries, illness and avoid physical damage to the environment.  These programs enable our facility to operate a refrigeration system safely because they focus on the rules, procedures, and guidelines which govern the industry.\n\nSSI Foods Service Inc. processes fresh meat products and uses a refrigeration system for freeze tunnels,"

To select a plausible ACS, SSI considered three scenarios, the one selected for the RMP Submit was the recharging of the ammonia system.  A break or rupture of the 1-inch recharging hose that occures during the system recharge, resulting in a vapor phase release.  Recharging is performed by loading vapor phase ammonia from pony tanks.  The pony tanks are placed just outside of the south entrance door to the machine room while recharging.  The release is assumed to happen under worst case summer conditions (190 psig and 105 degrees fahrenheit).  The temperature in the tank will drop due to the ammonia evaporation (latent heat) ; however, to be conservative this effect has not been considered.  It is assumed that this release can be controlled within 10 minutes.  The vapor release rate calculated is 127 (lbs/min) for 10 minutes for a quantity of 1,270 (lbbs) at a distance of 0.3 miles to toxic endpoint.  The following public and envirnmental receptor locations are within the ACS endpoint radous:  Four (4) residences, with a total estimated population of 12, Commercial Agriculture and Hwy 95.  This scenario is unlikely for the following reasons; the accident prevention program inplace at the facitity including operationg procedures to have personnel present  at all times during the transfer process; the  mechanical integrity program for regular maintenance, inspection and testing, and replacement of equipment if necessary; and the emergency response plan and equipment in place at the facility. \n\n\n\n\nThe accidental release prevention program in general starts with good operating and manufacturing practices.  All ammonia process equipment, piping and valves are inspected on a regular schedual depending on manufacture and industry recommendations, for example; all compress"

      "SummaryText": "storage and plant cooling.  The maximum inventory of ammonia onsite is 60,000 (lbs).  RM regulations require hazard assessments, including offsite consequence analysis.  EPA categorizes release scenarios as worst case (WCS) or alternate case (ACS).  To evaluate potential WCS's and ACS's for toxic chemicals, the distance to endpoint is determined.  The toxic endpoint for ammonia is 0.14 mg/L (200 ppm).  Following EPA guidance the largest vessel/release rate was used to estimate the WCS.  All of the major ammonia vessels are located indoors and many would have significant passive mitigation factors.  The highest 10-minute release rate was determined to be from the high perssure receiver which contains 12,000 (lbs) of ammonia liquefied under pressure.  While the high pressure receiver is located inside a building, it is also adjacent to a door; therefore, the building mitigation calculations in EPA's Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration  were not used.  Instead the more conservative and more suitable passive mitigation factor provided in RMP*Comp was used to calculate the mitigated release rate.  The WCS release quantity is 12,000 (lbs) at a rate of 660 (lbs/min) for a distance endpoint of 1.5 miles before dispersing enoughto no longer pose a hazard to the public.  The following public and environmental receptor locations are within the WCS toxic endpoint  radius:  Wilder Head Start School, Holmes Elementary School, Wilder Junior, Senior High School, Industrial and Commercial establishments (including commercial agriculture), with a estimated population of 1,426, and  Hwy 95.
