The facility has an extensive Risk Mangagement Program that follows OSHA and EPA guidelines.  The program emphasizes employee training, emergency response, and equipment inspection/ maintenance.\n\nThe WTP stores and utilizes chlorine, which is a regulated substance under this rule.  This substances is stored in one-ton cylinders. The maximum quantity on-site at any given time is 6000 lb.   Chlorine is used for the disinfection of drinking water.\n\nRMPcomp software was used to conduct the worst-case release scenario for chlorine. The analysis calculated an impact radius of 1.3 miles.  This impact radius would result in an off-site impact (members of the pubic could be exposed to toxic concentrations). \n\nFor the alternative scenario, the same procedures were used as listed above for the worst-case release scenario.  Additionally, enclosures (e.g. buildings) were considered as passive mitigation measures in the analysis, which reduced the impact of a potential release.   The scenario chosen for analysis was a hole in the liquid space of one of the storage cylinders.  The analysis showed an impact radius of 0.6 miles.  This impact radius would result in an off-site impact. \n\nThe WTP's Risk Management Program covers all aspects of safely handling/storing chlorine.   This program requires employees to routinely inspect and maintain all process equipment.   The program requires that employees receive training on all aspects of  process equipment to ensure a safe operating environment, and more importantly, to minimize the possibility of a release.\n\nThe WTP has had no accidental releases of chlorine within the past five year. \n              \nThe facility does not have its own emergency response program.  Response to releases and public notification will be handled by the local fire and police departments.\n\nThe facility is in the proce"
