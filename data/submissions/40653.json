      "SummaryText": "The City of Liberal, Kansas has one regulated substance located at the City's domestic wastewater treatment facility.  That substance, chlorine, is used as a disinfectant on the plant's effluent prior to discharge.  The plant has been in operation for twenty (20) years, using the chlorine system.  During this time no leaks or other incidents have occurred which would cause a threat to the community or to the emplyees of the facility.  The chlorine system is contained in a building on the treatment facility grounds, located on the east side of the city.  The chlorine is in a gasous state and it's release would present a toxic hazard to the surrounding community.  It is estimated that a \"worst case\" release would cause a gas to travel a distance of 2.6 miles before dissipating to a non-hazardous level.  The most likely occurance would be a release to the east over the wastewater lagoons and the landfill.  In the case of a release, the fire department would initiate our community emergency response plan.  This plan would include notification to the public and possible evacuation of the affected areas.  Efforts to ensure that equipment and procedures are non-threatening to the community are on going.  These include regular training sessions, emergency equipment replacement, and yearly upgrades."
