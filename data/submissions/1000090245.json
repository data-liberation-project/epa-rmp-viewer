It documents that appropriate fire prevention measures have been implemented, and defines the work dates and scope of work to be performed.  The permit ensures that the appropriate facility management personnel are aware of ongoing hot work operations and that the facility utilizes the necessary fire prevention precautions.\r\n\r\nContractor Safety \r\nThe Ruiz Foods facility hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities associated with the ammonia refrigeration process.  Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of the contractor's safety performance is carried out. Ruiz Foods has a strict policy of informing contractors of any known potential hazards related the contractor's work and the processes within the facility. Contractors are also informed of all procedures for emergency response and evacuation should an accidental ammonia release occur.
