This commitment is reflected in a comprehensive accidental release prevention program. This program addresses the design, installation, operation, maintenance, and employee training associated with the ammonia refrigeration equipment at the Ruiz Food Products, Inc. facility in Denison, Texas. \n\n\n\nIt is the policy of Ruiz Food Products, Inc. to ensure that controls are in place to limit the risks of potential ammonia releases. If such a release does occur, the facility's emergency response personnel are trained to control and mitigate the effects of the release. The facility has coordinated emergency response activities with the City of Denison Fire Rescue Department and the Grayson County LEPC, who provide additional emergency response expertise and support.\n\n  \n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\n\n\nRuiz Foods is a family owned business with a legacy of making great food since 1964.  Our brands deliver convenience, value, and great taste to American families.  Our facility in Denison, Texas is our company headquarters and the largest in our supply chain.\n\n\n\nThe primary business activities at Ruiz Food Products involve the manufacturing and subsequent cold storage of frozen food products.  Located at 2410 Texoma Drive in Denison, Texas, the facility prepares, stores, and ships frozen food products.  Ammonia is the only RMP-regulated substance at the facility, and it is used as a refrigerant in the preparation and cold storage of various food products.  The maximum inventory of ammonia at the facility is approximately 107,000 pounds.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nThe Ruiz Food Products, Inc. facility is in full compliance with EPA's accidental release prevention requirements as defined in 40 CFR Part 68, OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) requiremen"

This includes design parameters and safe operating conditions, as well as details of the many safety features incorporated into the design of the ammonia refrigeration system.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis \n\nThe facility has conducted comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with the ammonia system are identified and effectively controlled.  The HAZOP methodology, Industry Safety Checklists, and process inspections have been used to carry out the process hazard analysis (PHA) studies. The studies have been conducted by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations, and have been revalidated at least every five years, including most recently in July 2020.  Any findings and/or recommendations associated with the evaluation of hazards are addressed in a timely manner.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures \n\nTo further ensure that activities are safely conducted regarding the ammonia refrigeration system, Ruiz Foods has developed written operating procedures to supplement the current on-the-job operator training.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operation, normal shutdown and startup, and emergency shutdown and startup. This information is regularly reviewed and readily accessible to operators and/or contractors who are involved in the routine operations of the ammonia refrigeration process.\n\n\n\nTraining \n\nRuiz Foods has an on-the-job training program in place to ensure that employees who are operati"

Outside schooling resources are utilized for key personnel to ensure a comprehensive understanding of continued safe and effective operations.  Refresher training is provided at least every three years.  All training associated with the ammonia refrigeration system is documented and validated.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity \n\nRuiz Food Products, Inc. has a written maintenance program in place for preventative maintenance of all ammonia equipment to ensure ongoing reliability of equipment and safe operations.  Refrigeration rounds are conducted daily that require visual observation of the various ammonia components and auxiliary systems.  Any issues noted during rounds are resolved as soon as possible.\n\n\n\nEquipment maintained under this program includes pressure vessels, piping systems, evaporators and other process equipment (chillers, heat exchangers, ice makers, etc.), condensers, compressors, pumps, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, and instrumentation/controls.  System maintenance is completed only by qualified personnel with training in maintenance practices, including in-house personnel and contractors as needed.  Specialized training is provided as needed to ensure maintenance personnel are fully qualified. Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner. \n\n\n\nManagement of Change \n\nWritten procedures are followed at Ruiz Foods to manage changes in the design of the ammonia process, technology, equipment, and procedures.
