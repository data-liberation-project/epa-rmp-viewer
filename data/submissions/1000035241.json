      "SummaryText": "The Wise County Power Company defined the worst-case release scenario as a failure of the aqueous ammonia tank releasing the entire volume into the diked area and, subsequently, into the atmosphere due to evaporation from the pool which formed.  The EPA's Risk Management Program Guidance for Off-Site Consequence Analysis was used to determine the distance to the toxic endpoint of a worst-case release of 28 weight percent aqueous ammonia from the facility.  Results obtained using the methods in this document are expected to be conservative (i.e., they will generally, but not always, overestimate the distance to endpoints).\n\n\n\nA release rate was calculated based on a 30 weight percent (data for 28 weight percent was not listed) concentration of aqueous ammonia being released into an 869.25 square foot diked area with a wall height sufficient to contain the entire volume.  The formula assumes a default wind speed of 3.4 miles per hour and 77 degrees Fahrenheit.  A temperature correction factor was calculated to adjust the default 77 degrees Fahrenheit to the highest maximum daily temperature of the liquid, which was assumed to be 110 degrees Fahrenheit.  The temperature correction factor was multiplied by the release rate, which produced a corrected release rate.  This value was then compared to the lookup table for aqueous ammonia and the distance to the toxic endpoint for a rural setting was determined to be 0.40 miles.  The nearest public receptor is 0.6 miles from the ammonia tank; therefore, the facility qualifies as a Program 1 facility. \n\n\n\nAn emergency response plan has been developed for use in the event of an ammonia release."
