The bromine is spilled into a 320 square foot sump surrounding the railcar which mitigates the off-site impact of the release.  The release would reach off-site endpoints and nearby public receptors, including the city of Mt. Pleasant.  This event is extremely unlikely to occur.  There have been no accidental releases of bromine at the Mt. Pleasant Site that have resulted in any off-site impact.  \n                             \n**Flammable Substance Worst-Case Scenario**\nThe worst-case flammable substance release (scenario resulting in the greatest distance to an endpoint) involves failure of the isoprene storage tank containing 50,000 pounds of isoprene.  It is assumed that the entire contents of the tank are released as vapor which finds an ignition source and results in a vapor cloud explosion.  There are no passive mitigation measures considered in this release scenario.  Since the Mt. Pleasant Site is located in a relatively remote, unoccupied area, the flammable substance worst-case scenario would not affect anyone beyond our property line.  This event is extremely unlikely to occur.  There have been no accidental releases of isoprene at the Mt. Pleasant Site that have resulted in any off-site impact.\n\n**Bromine Alternative Release Scenario**\nThe alternative release scenario for bromine involves failure of a 1-inch unloading hose at the railcar unloading facility.  The release is stopped after 5 minutes.  A total of 12,000 pounds of bromine is released with a release rate to"

This scenario was chosen because the RMP regulation requires (Title 40-Subpart B-Section 68.28) our facility to develop a scenario that will reach an off-site impact.  This scenario has the potential to extend beyond the facility boundary.  As evidenced by our past operating history, we have had no bromine accidental releases that have resulted in any off-site impact.\n\n**Chlorine Alternative Release Scenario**  \nThe alternative release scenario for chlorine involves failure of a 1-inch unloading hose on a 1-ton cylinder at the Process A unit.  The release last for a total of 10 minutes.  A total of 750 pounds of chlorine is released with a release rate 200 pounds per minute.
