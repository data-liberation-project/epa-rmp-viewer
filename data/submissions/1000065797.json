As a reflection of its policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws and regulations, Matheson submits this plan to address the hazards inherent with the use of anhydrous ammonia, the RMP regulated used onsite.  \n\n\n\nThe accidental release prevention program is clearly defined in the Process Safety Management and Risk Management Program for this facility.  The program addresses safety precautions regarding the ammonia refrigeration system. Written procedures have been developed for the operation and maintenance of the system.  The company training policy requires all employees to be properly trained for a job position before assignment to that job.  The facility's maintenance program requires periodic inspections of process and safety equipment to ensure they are in good condition.  Overall, the program follows industry-recommended standards for preventing unnecessary human exposures and reducing the threat to the health of employees as well as to members of the community and the surrounding area.  \n\n\n\nIncorporated into the program is our Emergency Action Plan (EAP), which details the response this facility will take as a result of an uncontrolled chemical release.  The EAP includes procedures for notification of local emergency responders.  The EAP is maintained current and updated periodically.\n\n\n\nThis facility has also coordinated with the local emergency responders and will maintain close contact to ensure that the responders are familiar with the process and with the general safety and accidental release program at the plant.\n\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance:\n\nThe Matheson Tri-Gas, Inc. CO2 plant at Washington, IN (Washington Plant) produces carbon dioxide used in the carbonation of beverages, food processing and preservation, pH control of water, fire protection and other "

Anhydrous ammonia is the RMP regulated substance maintained onsite, which is used in the process as a refrigerant to cool and liquefy CO2.   The site has 19 employees.\n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps:\n\nThe Washington CO2 plant is subject to the EPA RMP and the OSHA PSM regulations. The plant has developed an accidental release prevention program to satisfy the RMP and PSM requirements. The program includes the following elements:\n\n\n\n1) Process safety information that describes the hazards of ammonia and technical specifications for the refrigeration process equipment.\n\n2) Process hazard analysis to identify the hazards associated with the system and the safeguards in place to reduce or eliminate the hazards, and to implement corrective measures if the existing safeguards are inadequate.\n\n3) Written procedures for operating the refrigeration system.\n\n4) Training for employees involved with system operations and maintenance.\n\n5) Contractor management policies to ensure contract employee safety while working on facility premises.\n\n6) Written management of change and pre-startup safety review procedures for safely introducing modifications to the refrigeration system.\n\n7) Mechanical integrity program that includes written procedures to inspect, test, and maintain the integrity of the ammonia equipment and associated safety systems. \n\n8) Incident investigation program for investigating releases and near misses, identifying the root cause, and implementing measures to prevent recurrence.\n\n9) Written procedures for conducting hot work on or near the covered process.\n\n10) Employee participation plan, which details procedures for employee involvement in program development and implementation.\n\n11) Emergency action plan that describes actions to take in the event of an emergency.\n\n12) Three year compliance audits to ensure the accident prevention program is compliant with "

The following are examples of safety features put in place at the plant:\n\n\n\n?    Ammonia detectors located inside process equipment enclosure and in the control room are set to detect and alarm.\n\n?    Automatic control and manual valves to provide for isolation of the ammonia refrigeration process equipment.\n\n?    The placement of the ammonia process equipment and system liquid receiver within the Washington CO2 plant process equipment building allows for limited containment of an ammonia leak.\n\n?    Establishment of contracted emergency response specialist to support the Washington Plant emergency action plan.\n\n?    Personal protective equipment (e.g., protective clothing, and Air-Line respirators).\n\n\n\nFive-Year Accident History:\n\nThe Washington CO2 plant has had no accident resulting in either on or offsite effects in the last 5 years.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program Information:\n\nThe Washington CO2 plant has developed an emergency action plan.  The plan outlines actions to be taken at the plant in the event of an ammonia release and the communication to emergency responder, local response agencies, and outside agency notification procedures. The emergency plan provides for the evacuation of Washington CO2 plant personnel and visitors.  The Washington CO2 plant has provided the emergency action plan to the Washington Fire Department.  Should an emergency involving the release of ammonia occur that will have off-site consequences, the plant will contact the Washington Fire Department, who will coordinate action for the affected community. \n\n\n\nAdditional Activities Planned to Improve Safety:\n\n?    The Washington CO2 plant resolves all findings from three year audits and PHAs, some of which result in modifications of the process.\n\n"
