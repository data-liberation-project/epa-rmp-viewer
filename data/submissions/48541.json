This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of the facility?s processes.  It is the practice of T E Products Pipeline Company,  L.P. (TEPPCO) to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of substances.  However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will respond to, control and contain the release.\n\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nThe Princeton Terminal located in Gibson County, Indiana is owned by T E Products Pipeline Company, LP is operated by TEPPCO\n\nThe Princeton Terminal is a wholesale terminal facility for the storage and loading of propane.  The propane is received from a T E Products Pipeline underground pipeline and is stored in two above ground 60,000 nominal capacity storage tanks or in one 156,000 barrel underground storage cavern.  The stored propane is transferred from the storage bullet tanks into highway transport trucks for delivery of the propane to wholesale customers, or may be returned to the pipeline for bulk delivery elsewhere.  Ethyl mercaptan is added to the propane during the truck filling operation as an odorant to aid in propane leak detection.  The mercaptan is stored is one 2,360 gallon tank.\n\nThe Princeton Terminal was evaluated to determine if any regulated flammable or toxic substances exceeded the threshold quantity.  TEPPCO identified the regulated substances and quantities kept on site based on facility knowledge.  Listed flammable substances which are stored above the threshold quantities at the Princeton Terminal are propane and ethyl mercaptan.  The Terminal is subject to the O"

Normal butane and / or isobutane may be stored at the facility in four spherical tanks that are part of DOT pipeline operations.  These butanes are in storage incident to transportation and are exempt from the RMP rule.  Additionally, refined gasoline, natural gasoline and number 2 fuel oil are stored at Princeton and are redelivered either to the inlet pipeline or to transport trucks.  The vapor pressure of these stored products is above 14.7 psia at 100 degrees Fahrenheit, and they are also exempt from coverage by the RMP rule. \n\n\n\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis Results\n\nThe offsite consequence analysis will not be reflected in the executive summary but rather is reflected in the data components.  There are flammable substances on site and no toxic substances above the threshold quantity.\n\n\nGeneral Accident Release Prevention Program\n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the Princeton Terminal.  The operations at the terminal are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) regulation, and are also subject to the OSHA PSM standard.  This summary addresses each of the PSM program elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nActive employee participation and involvement in the development and implementation of the terminal?s PSM program is an important step toward achieving the objective to prevent or minimize the consequences of catastrophic releases of toxic, reactive, flammable or explosive chemicals.  Employee involvement helps to insure that all perspectives regarding PSM compliance and accident prevention are considered and that the best ideas are implemented.

These programs include regularly scheduled safety meeting, tail-gate safety meetings, hazard communications, Safety Suggestion Forms, a ?near-miss? reporting system and special training programs such as emergency response training, first aid training, etc.\n\nTEPPCO actively seeks employee involvement in the development and conduct of all accident prevention activities through the appropriate existing safety programs.  Accident prevention is discussed at the regularly scheduled safety meetings and/or during special training sessions if necessary.  Employees are encouraged to discuss accident prevention with their supervisors and to bring any questions, comments or suggestions forward for open discussion.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nComplete and accurate written process safety information concerning process chemicals, process technology and process equipment is essential to an effective PSM and RMP program as well as completing and maintaining a process hazard analysis.  The process safety information will be useful to the operators, the team performing a process hazard analysis and those in charge of updating the emergency preparedness plans.  Process safety information is readily available to all employees.  TEPPCO keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain a safe operating process.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters, specific chemicals inventories and equipment design basis/configuration information.\n\nChemical specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDS).\n\nTEPPCO also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.

This information in combination with written procedures and trained personnel provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to insure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\nThe Princeton Terminal has a comprehensive program to help insure that hazards associated with the various operations are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each portion of the facility is systematically examined to identify hazards and insure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nTEPPCO primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) and What-if/Checklist method analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  The analyses are conducted using a team of TEPPCO staff which has operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to local and corporate management for resolution.  Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps insure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\nTo help insure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the terminal periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis"

The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.  Once again, the responses to the team findings are also documented and retained.\n \n\nOperating Procedures\n\nThe Princeton Terminal maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations such as; (1) start-up, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown and (6) initial startup of a new process.  These procedures provide guidance for experienced operators and also provide the basis for training new operators.  Operating procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.  The review and certification process involves both operators and technical staff.\n\nThe intent of the operating procedures is to provide workable, useful and clearly written instructions for conducting operating activities.  To have effective operating procedures, the task and procedures directly and indirectly related to the covered process must be appropriate, clear, consistent and most importantly communicated to employees.  Operating procedures are specific instructions or details on what steps are taken or followed in carrying out the stated procedures.  The specific instructions include the applicable safety precautions and appropriate information on safety implications.\n\nTraining\n\nIn addition to training on operating procedures, the Princeton Terminal has a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating the terminal.  New employees receive basic training in pipeline, storage and terminal operations.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to insure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted at lease every three years.  All "

In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on the changes.\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nThe Princeton Terminal promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury.  The goal of each investigation is to gather the facts, determine the root cause, and develop corrective action to prevent the reoccurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendation(s) to prevent a reoccurrence and forwards these results to the business management team for resolution.\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nTo help insure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, TEPPCO periodically conducts an audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented.  Compliance audits are conducted at least every three years.  Both hourly and staff personnel participate as audit team members.  The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to terminal management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team?s findings are tracked until they are resolved and completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are retained.\n\n\nChemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe operations at the Princeton Terminal have hazards that must be managed to insure continued safe operation.  The following is a description of existing safety features applicable to prevention of accidental releases of regulated substances in the facility.\n\nUniversal Prevention Activities\n\nThe accident prevention program summarized previously is applied to all RMP covered operations at the Princeton Terminal.  Collectively, these prevention program"

      "SummaryText": " activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human errors.\n\nSpecialized Safety Features\n\nThe Princeton Terminal has safety features throughout the terminal area to help contain/control a release, to quickly detect a release and reduce the consequence of a release.  The following types of safety features are used in the covered processes:\n \n\nRelease Detection\n\n?    Hydrocarbon (hazardous gas) detectors and alarms in the storage , loading and dehydration areas\n?    Flame detectors in the storage, loading and dehydration areas\n\nRelease Containment and Control\n\n?    Area relief valves and vents that discharge to a flare to capture and incinerate episodic releases.\n?    Valves to permit isolation of the process (manual or automated).\n?    Automatic shutdown systems for specific process parameters (e.g., high flow, low pressure).\n?    Secondary containment to contain any release of liquid ethyl mercaptan.\n?    Redundant equipment and instrumentation where advisable\n?    Dual mechanical seals with seal failure alarms installed on hydrocarbon liquid pumps, where feasible. \n?    Storage tank emergency shut down valves\n?    Loading line excess flow valves\n?    Atmospheric relief devices.\n\nRelease Mitigation\n\n?    Hand-held fire extinguishers \n?    Personnel trained in emergency response and procedures.\n?    Personnel protective equipment (e.g., chemical protective clothing, flame retardant coveralls, hard hats, safety glasses, etc.)\n\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nThe Princeton Terminal has an excellent record of accident prevention.  Over the past five years there have been no large or small releases, with no injuries or offsite consequences.  \n\n\nEmergency Procedures Information\n\nThe Princeton Terminal maintains a written emergency procedure, which is in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment.  The procedures are for the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address noti"

      "SummaryText": "fication of local emergency response agencies if a release occurs.  Employees receive training in emergency procedures.  The emergency procedure is updated when necessary based on modifications made to the terminal facilities.  The emergency procedure changes are administered through the Management of Change process.\n \n\nThe overall emergency procedure program for the Princeton Terminal is coordinated with the Gibson County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  This coordination includes periodic meetings with the anticipated first responder, the Columbia Township Fire Department.  The Princeton Terminal has around-the-clock communications capability with the Columbia Township Fire Department, which provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.  In addition to providing information on the emergency plan to the LEPC, the Princeton Terminal conducts periodic site orientations and emergency drills that involve the emergency response organizations.  The Princeton Terminal also provides periodic refresher training to local emergency responders regarding the hazards of regulated substances in the terminal.  The Terminal has also conducted one multi-department mock drill involving additional volunteer fire departments that could be called upon to respond in case of a serious emergency.\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThe Princeton Terminal resolves all findings from PHA?s, some of which result in modifications to the storage and loading operations.  Additionally, employee recommendations to improve the safety of the storage and loading operations are reviewed and implemented if they are judged to be effective in improving terminal safety or reducing accident risk.  At the present time, the following change that should help to improve operating safety is planned at the terminal:\n\n?    A new flare system including a taller flare stack and flame auto-ignition system is currently planned for"
