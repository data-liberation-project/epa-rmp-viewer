The following areas are addressed in this summary:\n\n?Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n?Stationary Source Activities and Regulated Substances Handled\n\n?Worst-Case and Alternative-Case Release Scenarios\n\n?Prevention Program\n\n?Five-Year Accident History\n\n?Emergency Response Program\n\n?Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nCool Pacific is committed to complying with all of the regulatory requirements of the EPA Risk Management Program and the California Accidental Release Prevention Program. Cool Pacific has developed their Risk Management Plan / Process Safety Management (RMP/PSM) Manual to document Cool Pacific policies addressing the implementation of these regulations.  The PSM sections pertain to the prevention of accidental releases and include the Process Hazard Analysis study and procedures for operating, training, maintenance and others. The RMP sections pertain to management systems and emergency response and include the Hazard Assessment (Offsite Consequence Analysis) Report.\n\n\n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE ACTIVITIES AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nThe Cool Pacific-Salinas facility provides product cooling and short-term storage for fresh vegetables.\n\n\n\nThe facility is located in a light industrial area of Salinas. Ammonia is used as the refrigerant in the Main/RT3 Refrigeration System (\"System\"). This is a direct, mechanical refrigeration system with equipment located inside and outside.\n\n\n\n(July 2014 Note: The Main and RT3 Refrigeration Systems were previously reported as two separate but interconnected systems. Given the interconnecting piping, it was deemed more appropriate to report/evaluate these two systems as one system, specifically named the Main/RT3 Refrigeration System There is no change in the ammonia inventory for the Main/RT3 Refrigera"

The Ice Generator System operates completely independent of the Main/RT3 System and is located outside at least 30 feet away. As required by the California Accidental Release and Prevention Program (CalARP), the Ice Generator System is addressed in the Cool Pacific RMP Manual. Since the Ice Generator System is below the EPA threshold for ammonia, it is not addressed (other than this clarification) in the RMP*Submit.\n\n\n\nWORST-CASE SCENARIO ANALYSIS\n\n\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT \n\nThe regulation requires that the Worst-Case Release Scenario use the ammonia quantity in the largest vessel or pipe.\n\n\n\nNOTE: It is important to consider that the Worst-Case Scenario is extremely unlikely to occur since this scenario does not consider any safety features of the system - in either design or operation.  The scenario parameters are established by the regulation to provide uniformity for dialog between the industry, community, and regulatory agencies.\n\n\n\nThe regulation allows the facility to select the Alternate-Case Scenario.\n\n \n\nPREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n\n\nCool Pacific's Prevention Program is described in the RMP/PSM Manual.  The RMP Prevention Program is equivalent to OSHA's Process Safety Management Program (PSM).  The Prevention Program implemented by Cool Pacific is essential to help prevent releases and to minimize the effects if a release does occur.\n\nKey objectives of Cool Pacific Prevention Program are briefly described below:\n\n\n\n1. Maintain current and complete refrigeration system technical information. (Addressed under the Process Safety Information chapter)\n\n2. Thorough team evaluation of the refrigeration system.  The evaluation considers a number of potential"

Written procedures and policies that establish how the refrigeration system should be operated and maintained and how to investigate accidental releases. (Addressed under Operating Procedures, Mechanical Integrity, and Incident Investigation chapters.) \n\n4. Certification of refrigeration operators to safely operate the refrigeration system.  Cool Pacific certifies operators following completion of operator training and Cool Pacific's confirmation of the operator's ability apply what they have learned.  (Addressed under Training chapter.)\n\n5. Employee involvement in the Prevention Program.  This is addressed on two levels.  \n\nFirst, refrigeration equipment operators participate in the planning and evaluation of the Prevention Programs (e.g., Process Hazard Analysis study team, writing and/or reviewing operating procedures, Incident Investigation team, etc.).  This involvement encourages ownership of the Prevention Program and positively affects the operators' day-to-day activities.  \n\nSecond, all Cool Pacific employees (direct hires and contract) at this facility receive ammonia awareness training.  Additionally, they have access to the RMP/PSM information.  These activities improve the overall safety of the employees. (Both levels are addressed under Employee Participation chapter)\n\n6. Implementation of additional measures when changes are planned (procedural or mechanical).  These measures begin before any changes are made and may include a Process Hazard Analysis, operator training, and Process Safety Information updates plus other measures required by Cool Pacific's Management of Change Procedure.  \n\nIf a mechanical change is required and for maintenance contracts, Cool Pacific has a procedure for selecting a contractor "

Additionally, if welding, grinding, or other \"Hot Work\" occurs close to the refrigeration system, a Cool Pacific Hot Work permit is required.  The purpose of the permit and the associated Hot Work procedure is to minimize the possible of a fire. \n\nFollowing completion of a mechanical change, a pre-startup safety review is required before the system can be started. (These areas are addressed under Management of Change, Contractor Qualifications, Hot Work Permit, and Pre-Start-up Safety Review chapters.)\n\n7. Verification of Cool Pacific's compliance with the RMP/PSM program.  This self-audit process is an important tool to confirm whether each of the elements in the Prevention Program (and the Risk Management Program) has been implemented and properly documented by Cool Pacific personnel.  Cool Pacific has established a Management System procedure to address any shortcomings, which the audit may find. (Addressed under Compliance Audit chapter.)   \n\n8.
