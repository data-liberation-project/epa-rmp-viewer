      "SummaryText": "Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nMatheson is committed to the safety of its employees and neighbors and operates the facility as a responsible member of the community.  Matheson encourages personnel to continually identify methods and procedures to reduce the use and risks associated with hazardous chemicals.  This process includes protecting the community, environment, and personnel by implementing technology and procedures designed to reduce the impact of any potential release of toxic chemicals.  This commitment to safety is documented in the policy and compliance manuals for this facility, which are available to all employees.\n\nAs part of Matheson's commitment to safe and environmentally friendly operations, monthly meetings are conducted with all employees as well as other more specific operational meetings concerning safety.  Input and comments from plant personnel are also key aspects of Matheson's safety practices: By giving personnel the ability to make suggestions regarding safety and operational practices, the facility can operate efficiently and safely.  Another key element in Matheson's safety practices consists of the regular internal and third party environmental and safety audits.\n\nRegulated Substances\n\nThe Matheson facility receives, stores, manufactures, and ships the following regulated chemicals: n-Butane, 1-Butene, Carbon Monoxide, Ethylene, Isobutane, Isopentane, Methane, n-Pentane, Propane, Propylene, and Isobutylene.  These chemicals are regulated at the Program 3 level.\n\nOffsite Release Scenarios\n\nMatheson has conducted an offsite consequence analysis based on the EPA's RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidelines, and used the EPA's RMP*Comp Version 1.07 to estimate the distance traveled to a toxic endpoint defined by the EPA.  This data was then used to estimate the potential impact caused by a release from each of the regulated substances.\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenarios\n\nUsing the Risk Management Program Guidan"

      "SummaryText": "ce for Offsite Consequence Analysis (March 2009), the worst case release for flammable substances is as such: The total quantity of the flammable substance is assumed to form a vapor cloud.  The entire contents of the cloud are assumed to be within the flammability limits, and the cloud is assumed to explode.\n\nIt also states that for the worst case analysis 10% of the flammable vapor in the cloud is assumed to participate in the explosion (i.e. the yield factor is 0.10).  The worst case scenario requires that the facility estimate the consequence distance to an overpressure level of 1 pound per square inch (psi) from the explosion vapor cloud.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario\n\nBased on a review of facility operating history and accident history, the Process Hazard Analysis, and knowledge of industry incidents, the alternative release scenario was chosen as a likely scenario as the facility frequently transfers hazardous materials to and from the process tanks during deliveries or truck loadings.  Specifically, the alternate case scenario was defined to be a transfer hose malfunction associated with Tank 020 (Propane).\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Programs and Prevention Steps\n\nAs part of the implementation of the PSM/RMP, elements of the prevention programs have been developed to manage process safety issues associated with the facility.  Each of the program elements have been developed according to OSHA and EPA regulations in order to ensure safe operating practices and conditions at the Matheson facility.\n\nPrevention 3 Elements:\n\nProcess Safety Information - information regarding the hazards each chemical, process descriptions, and equipment properties.\n\nProcess Hazards Analysis - a detailed review of the process and recommendations to improve the safety of the system.\n\nOperating Procedures - procedures designed to comply with regulations and provide safe practices for the system.\n\nTraining - procedures and logs for personnel training on the covered process"

The Management System includes planning, organizing, implementing, and controlling different aspects of the plan.\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nThere has been one RMP applicable accident of a regulated chemical at the facility in the past five years.  The chemical involved in the incident as propane.  There was a fire onsite on February 8, 2005 that was caused by a leak between a pump (p-016) associated with Tank 007 and a hand valve (HV-020).  The East Greenville Fire Department was dispatched to the site at 8:21 AM and arrived onsite at 8:30 AM.  The fuel (propane) supply valve was closed at 8:49 AM and the situation was under control at 9:12 AM.  The facility performed and incident investigation and determined that the leak persisted for not more than 20 minutes before the supply valve was closed.  After the supply valve was closed a leak at a lower pressure persisted for approximately 28 more minutes.  \n\nThe total calculated amount "

The issues have since been resolved and as a result of this incident, the storage tanks onsite have been equipped with al fusible link that shuts the liquid supply valve coming out of the tank to stop the fuel to the fire.  The fusible links are rated for 212 psi, the lead melts and the lever releases shutting the valve.\n\nEmergency Action Plan\nMatheson has implemented a corporate Emergency Action Plan, which includes emergency and evacuation procedures, safety and health considerations, and notification procedures.\n\nPlanned Changes\n\nChanges determined by the Process Hazard Analysis and consideration made during the development of this plan will be conducted in a timely manner.\n\nUpdates\n\nThe PSM/RMP will be updated at least every five years and is due to be updated on the five year anniversary of the PHA study (May 2014).  The PSM/RMP will also be updated within six months in the event of a change which requires a new Process Hazard Analysis.\n"
