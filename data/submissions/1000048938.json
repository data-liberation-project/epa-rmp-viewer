Inspections, maintenance and employee training are important components of our accident prevention program.\r\n\r\n1. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies: The owners, management, and employees of Front Range Energy, LLC are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of denaturant by utilization of proper equipment, regular inspections and maintenance and training of all persons that work with the material. Should an accidental release occur, the facility has orientated the local fire department and the local emergency planning committee so they can plan for response to any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment. The facility also has prepared an Integrated Contingency Plan that addresses response to incidents and evacuation.\r\n\r\n2. Facility and the Regulated Substances Handled: The primary activity at Front Range Energy, LLC is the production of ethanol from corn. The facility uses natural gasoline as a denaturant for the final product. The natural gasoline is a flammable mixture that contains iso-pentane, among other flammable constituents.  Front Range Energy, LLC has previously submitted Risk Management Plans for aqueous ammonia in concentrations over 20 percent; the facility no longer uses aqueous ammonia at concentrations that meet or exceed this regulatory threshold. \r\n\r\n3. General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps: Front Range Energy, LLC has implemented Process Safety Management and Risk Management Plan Prevention Programs to manage the use of its covered material. These programs cover employee participation, process hazard analyses, training, standard operating procedures, mechanical integrity, emergency response, compliance audits, hot work and other safe work practices, process safety information, man"
