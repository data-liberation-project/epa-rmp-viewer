To insure safe operation and release prevention at Tyson Foods- Jacksonville, this facility has implemented The Occupational Safety and Health Administrations Chemical Process Safety Management Program 29 CFR 1910.119.  All operators of systems containing the threshold amount of hazardous chemicals will undergo Chemical Process Safety Management training and operator training specific to the system. \nTo insure proper response to emergency situations, Tyson Foods- Jacksonville, has implemented Emergency Action Plans as required by The Occupational Safety and Health Administrations 29 CFR 1910.38(a) and Emergency Response Plans  29 CFR 1910.120. All safety personnel and operators of the process will be trained in these emergency procedures.\n\n2.  The stationary source and regulated substance(s) handled.\n? Poultry Processingr Facility\n? Anhydrous Ammonia used for refrigeration\n? We have on-site approximately 31,000 pounds of ammonia.\n \n3.  Worst-case release scenario and alternative release scenario(s).\n       \nWorst-case Scenario. - Failure of high-pressure receiver when full releasing 16,383 pounds of ammonia in 10 minutes.   The high-pressure receiver will be full only when the entire system is being pumped down for repairs.  This situation occurs on the average of 2 to 4 times per year.  Therefore the possibility of a worst-case scenario will exist only 2% of the time.  This facility has never had a failure of a high-pressure receiver.  The loss of 16,383 pounds of ammonia will have a distance of 1.5  miles before no longer posing a health hazard to the public. \n\nAlternative Release Scenario. - An upset condition resulting in an overpressure of the ammonia system causing a safety relief valve to discharge 500 pounds of ammonia in 5 minutes.  The loss of 500 pounds of ammonia will have a distance of 450 feet"

Each Instructor receives an initial 40 hours of training and 16 hours per year re-certification training that goes to I.C. level. \n \n The training is designed to teach both theory and hands-on training giving the person an overall understanding of the nature of hazardous materials and the ability to assess and safely respond to the incidents in the Incident Command structure.  Technician level training includes but is not limited to the following:\n \n? Knowledge of basic hazards and risk assessment techniques\n? Proper selection and use of appropriate and required PPE for the chemical hazard\n? Terminology associated with Hazmat\n? Advanced site control/security procedures\n? Advanced Containment/Control/Decon procedures\n? Use of Atmospheric Monitoring Equipment and Contaminant Test Procedures\n? Incident Command Structure Roles and Line of Authority\n? Interaction with Local and State Officials\n? Standard Operating Procedures for Clean-up and termination \n? Critique\n\nAll training materials, hands-on drills and response procedures have been developed under the direction of the Corporate Loss Control Department.\n\nAll Team members are taught in Hazard Communication to report any observed chemical leaks/spills and odors to their supervisor or lead person immediately.  Supervisors and Leads are taught to report the above to the Safety or Process Manager immediately for further investigation and action by the Hazmat team.  MSDS information books are accessible to all team members for review.\n         \n7.  Planned changes to improve safety.\n? Continued training (HAZMAT)"
