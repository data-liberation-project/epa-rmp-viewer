      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\n\n\nStoney Creek Technologies has sales internationally with a manufacturing facility located on 14 acres of land in Trainer, PA, along with a sales office in Trainer as well as sales and distributors in Europe.  This manufacturing location was previously owned by Witco Corporation as part of their Performance Chemicals Group (PCG) and was purchased in July 1998, by a management-led team.  There are currently 6 Stoney Creek personnel at the Trainer facility. Stoney Creek Technologies is currently under US EPA Order # CERC-03-2007-0254-DC, to halt production and lower inventory until refinancing is completed and other conditions stated in the Order are met. Stoney Creek Technologies has been actively seeking and have obtained a source of funding and are in the final stages of the transaction.\n\nSCT manufactures and markets, worldwide, a series of corrosion inhibitors under the trade name SACI (Severe Atmospheric Corrosion Inhibitor).  Additionally SCT produces oil and fuel additives (magnesium and calcium alkylbenzene sulfonates).\n\nSCT operated all processes in an environmentally responsible manner.  \n\nSCT believes that Safety is unequivocally our number one priority.  We have an excellent employee-driven safety program and have an outstanding safety record, with zero (0) loss time injuries and illnesses.\n\nIn the manufacture of SACI and the oil and fuel additives, SCT uses one regulated substance, Oleum (fuming sulfuric acid).  This raw material is used in the production of sulfonic acids, which are the basic building blocks for our products.  \n\nThis chemical is received at Trainer by tank wagon and unloaded/stored in a registered horizontal carbon steel storage tank, with a total capacity of 18,000 gallons.  A 3164 cubic foot dike, designed to contain Oleum, surrounds the storage tank.  SCT written operational procedures prevent more than 10,000 gallons from being stored in this tank.  High-level alarms will be activated if the administrative controls"

      "SummaryText": "fail and the tank volume reaches 14,700 gallons.\n\nSCT has developed a worst-case and an alternate case scenario for the accidental release of Oleum from the Trainer plant.  The worst-case scenario would be the rupture of the storage tank and the release of its entire contents (163,300 lbs.) in less than 10 minutes.  Such a release would have an off-site impact.  This scenario is a highly unlikely event.\n\nControls in place to limit the quantity released include the following: \n\u00b7\tAdministrative controls to limit the quantity in the storage tank \n\u00b7\tHigh level alarms with interlock shut off switches\n\u00b7\tA concrete retention wall (dike) \n\u00b7\tFixed white oil system (for vapor suppression)\n\u00b7\tHM200 HAZMAT foam nozzles (for vapor suppression)\n\u00b7\tTank wagon unloading basin with automatic shut-off and depressurization switch; \n\u00b7\tRemote emergency shut-off switch\n\u00b7\tFixed water monitors for vapor suppression.    \n\nThe alternate case scenario would involve a line leak during the unloading of a tank wagon of Oleum due to the failure of a check valve.  This incident would occur for not more than 10 minutes.  This scenario is considered to be a more likely occurrence.  If such an incident occurred, there would be no off-site impact.\n\nControls in place to mitigate the effects of this alternate case scenario are the same as indicated above for the worst-case scenario.\n\nSCT has a documented spill prevention program.  Processes which are part of our operational SOP and accidental release prevention program include numerous technological systems, i.e., backup systems and redundancies, and procedural and\nmanagerial practices, including PM and employee training in how to prevent accidental releases and how to respond should one occur.\n\nSCT has an Emergence Action Plan in place as described in our Spill Prevention and Integrated Contingency Plan.  Due to the reduction in force of personnel, SCT has had to rely on trained and equipped outside volunteer fire fighters and mutual aid HAZMAT technici"
