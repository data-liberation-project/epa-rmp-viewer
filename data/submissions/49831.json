Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nCold Chain Integrity, owned and operated by United Dairy Farmers, Inc., is strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety. This commitment is inherent to our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with our regulated process.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, our highly trained emergency response personnel are available to control and mitigate the effects of the release.   We are also coordinated with the City of Erlanger Fire Department and the Kenton County LEPC for emergency response support.\n\n2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe date in which the ammonia is expected to be added to the system (Charge Date) is near the end of August 2007.  This facility will primarily be used for warehouse storage and distribution of ice cream products.  The only RMP regulated substance present at our facility will be ammonia, utilized as the primary cooling media in our closed-loop refrigeration system.  Refrigeration is a critical part of our business, providing cold storage capabilities for products per Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations. The amount of ammonia estimated to be in the system is ~9,400 pounds, but this RMP program will assume 10,000 pounds will be present.  Due to the size and characteristics of our ammonia system, as well as Process Safety Management (PSM) applicability, this facility is covered under Program 3 of the RMP regulations.\n\n3. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nOur facility has taken the necessary "

Our facility is also subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119, as well as the EPCRA Section 302 and 311/312 notification/reporting requirements.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the accidental release prevention program that is in place at our facility.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nUnited Dairy Farmers, Inc. maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters, and equipment designs associated with the ammonia refrigeration system.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies so that hazards associated with our ammonia refrigeration system are identified and controlled efficiently. The methodology used to carry out these analyses are What If Scenarios.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in refrigeration engineering and process operations, and are reevaluated at a minimum of every five (5) years. Any findings related to the process hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities related to our ammonia refrigeration system, United Dairy Farmers, Inc. maintains written operating procedures. These procedures address various modes of operation including startup, normal operations, emergency operations, normal shutdown, and emergency shutdown.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to all operators who work with the ammonia refrigeration system.\n\nTraining\n\nUnited Dairy Farmers, Inc. has a comprehensive training program in place so that employees who are working with the ammonia refrigeration system are competent in all relevant operating procedures. Refresher training is provided at least every three (3) years and more frequently as needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nUnited Dairy Farmers, Inc. carries out well documented mai"

Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure vessels, piping systems, pressure relief valves, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps. Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in applicable maintenance practices. Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nManagement of Change\n\nWritten procedures are in place at United Dairy Farmers, Inc. to manage changes in ammonia systems technology, equipment, and procedures. Process operators, maintenance personnel, or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by an ammonia systems modification are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification.\n\nPre-startup Reviews\n\nPre-start up safety reviews are conducted any time the ammonia refrigeration system, or any of its components, are opened for repairs, tie-ins, or modifications. These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating procedures, and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nUnited Dairy Farmers, Inc. conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented. These audits are carried out at least every three (3) years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nUnited Dairy Farmers, Inc. promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in, an unintentional release of ammonia.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident, as well as any corrective actions implemented to prevent the release from reoccurring. All repo"

Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements. In addition, our employees have access to all information related to PSM and RMP implementation, including Process Hazard Analyses (PHA) information.\n\nContractors\n\nOn occasion, our company hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and/or construction activities related to the ammonia refrigeration system. Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is carried out. United Dairy Farmers, Inc. has a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related to the contractor's work with the ammonia systems. Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of ammonia occur.\n\n4. Five-year Accident History\n\nThis is the initial RMP submittal.  \n\n5. Emergency Response Plan\n\nUnited Dairy Farmers, Inc. maintains an Emergency Response Plan to document specific procedures to be implemented in the event of various emergencies, including an ammonia release.  The Emergency Response Plan addresses adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas.  The plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within the facility that would require modified procedures.  \n\nThe Kenton County LEPC is the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) with which our Emergency Response Plan has been coordinated and verified.  The Erlanger Fire Department is the primary emergency response agency for all facility emergencies, including ammonia releases.\n\n6. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThis "
