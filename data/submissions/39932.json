      "SummaryText": "Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nIt is the policy of Blue Bird to adhere to all applicable federal and state safety and environmental regulations.  To implement this policy the Wenatchee Plant maintains an Accident Prevention Program to protect employees from injury.  This includes a written process safety management program to prevent accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  It also includes an emergency response plan that describes actions employees would take should a release occur.\n\nFacility and Regulated Substance Handled\n\nBlue Bird, Inc. is a cooperative that stores and packs apples, cherries, peaches, nectarines, plums, and other fruit.  The Wenatchee Plant is located at 1470 Walla Walla Ave. in Wenatchee, Washington.  It includes 20 refrigerated fruit storage areas and two hydrocoolers.\n\nThe regulated substance used at Blue Bird is anhydrous ammonia, which is used as a refrigerant to keep fruit cold while it is stored, thus maintaining its freshness and quality before it is shipped to market.  There are 11,700 pounds of anhydrous ammonia in the refrigeration system.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\nBlue Bird's accidental release prevention program is based on the WISHA/OSHA process safety management standard and the EPA risk management plan rule.  Important practices that prevent releases are: \n+ Equipment is designed for ammonia service and installed as recommended by the manufacturers\n+ Employees are experienced in monitoring and servicing the equipment to maintain its safety and reliability\n+ Ammonia detectors are installed so leaks may be identified immediately.\n+ Ammonia is delivered by trained vendors using trucks and trailers that comply with DOT regulations.\n+ Operation is computer-controlled and equipped with an automatic paging system that will alert the refrigeration engineer should a process deviation occur.  This system includes many automatic shutdown devices that will safely shut down the refrigeration ma"

      "SummaryText": "chines to prevent a release..\n+ Piping is elevated to prevent accidental damage to the system from moving vehicles.\n \nFive-Year Accident History\n\nBlue Bird has not had any accidents involving ammonia in the last five years.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nBlue Bird has an Emergency Response Plan for responding to ammonia releases.  Refrigeration staff are trained to respond to minor releases by isolating components of the refrigeration system and making repairs as needed while following plant safety practices for respiratory protection.  Should a large release occur all employees will evacuate and trained hazmat responders will be called in to take corrective action.  Community notification and response would be directed by the Wenatchee Fire Department.\n\nPlanned Safety Improvements\n\nRecommendations from the revalidation process hazard analysis will be implemented to further reduce the risk of an ammonia release."
