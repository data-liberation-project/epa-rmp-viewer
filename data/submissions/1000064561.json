      "SummaryText": "FACILITY NAME\n\nCraig Generating Station (Craig Station)\n\n\n\nFACILITY POLICIES & PROGRAMS\n\nCraig Station is a 1264 MW coal-fired steam electric generating unit located near Craig, Colorado.  Craig Station is owned and operated by Tri-State Generation and Transmission Association, Inc. (Tri-State).  As a Tri-State facility, Craig Station operates under the direction of the Tri-State Board of Directors.  The Tri-State Board of Directors has developed environmental health and safety policies requiring compliance with all applicable regulations.  These policies have been implemented for the protection of the employees, the public, and the environment.  To further the goals of the board environmental policies, Tri-State management has also implemented a company-wide Environmental Management System (EMS), which is used to help set and achieve environmental goals, as well as to ensure environmental compliance.  \n\n\n\nIn addition to the compliance policies of the board of directors and the EMS, Craig Station has developed an Integrated Contingency Plan (ICP) to prepare for and provide a coordinated response to emergency situations.  The integrated approach is used to coordinate all aspects of emergency planning and response to provide a comprehensive response to emergency situations.  The Risk Management Plan is incorporated into the ICP to ensure that the Risk Management Plan requirements are taken into consideration in the facility emergency planning and response efforts.  Additional information on the ICP can be found in the Emergency Response Program section below. \n\n\n\nFACILITY DESCRIPTION\n\nThe primary function of the Craig Station is to generate electric power for use throughout the region. Steam electric power generation involves burning fuel to heat water and produce steam.  The steam produced is used to spin a large turbine, which in turn rotates a generator that converts the mechanical energy of the turbine into electrical energy for use by consumers.  The primary fuel"

The Anhydrous Ammonia System is used to control the release of nitrous oxides (NOx) through the Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) System for Unit 2.   \n\n\n\nThe Anhydrous Ammonia System is divided into the storage area and injection area.  The storage equipment consists of storage tanks, truck unloading station, tank heaters, and supply pumps.  The ammonia supply vaporizer and injection equipment is in the vaporizer and air flow control skid areas and consists of air flow control units and ammonia air mixers, balancing manifolds, and ammonia injection grid.\n\n\n\nPREVENTION PROGRAM 3\n\nThe anhydrous ammonia process requires a level three prevention program due to the applicability of the OSHA PSM standard and EPA RMP regulations.  To meet this requirement Craig Station has developed an integrated PSM/RMP for the system. Due to the similarity of the RMP and PSM rules, an integrated approach was used to ensure compliance, eliminate redundancy, and simplify documentation.  \n\n\n\nThe Craig Station RMP/PSM Prevention Program includes detailed information on the following topics:  program management, employee participation, process safety information, process hazard analysis requirements, standard operating procedures, training, contractor safety, pre-startup safety reviews, mechanical integrity, hot work permits, management of change, incident investigation, and compliance audits.  Each of the prevention program elements listed above is included as an integral part of the RMP/PSM program and the facility Integrated Contingency Plan (ICP). This approach ensures that the anhydrous ammonia system requirements are considered during emergency planning and respons"

Portions of the PSM/RMP prevention program are also integrated into the facility work management system to ensure that PSM/RMP activities and considerations are addressed during routine maintenance activities at the station.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nCraig Station is committed to ensuring the safety of its workers, the safety of the surrounding community, and the protection of the environment.  To this end, Craig Station maintains relationships with the local fire department and the local emergency planning committee.  In addition, Craig Station has developed an Integrated Contingency Plan (ICP) to meet all OSHA and EPA emergency response requirements.  The ICP assists in the evaluation of risks and in the preparation for and response to all types of emergencies.  The ICP sets forth procedures for emergency response and required notifications of the public and government agencies.  The ICP also details the emergency response organization, the training requirements, and the required maintenance and testing of emergency response equipment.\n\n\n\nACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe anhydrous ammonia system is a new process and there have been no accidents at the Craig Station in the past five years that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nAt this time there are no significant changes planned for the Craig Station anhydrous ammonia system, however, routine activities such as employee training, emergency response drills, and preventative maintenance are ongoing to ensure safe operation of the system."
