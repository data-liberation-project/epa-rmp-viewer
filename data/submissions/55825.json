The PWTP is owned by the City of Newark and operated by the Newark Watershed and Development Corporation.  The chlorine system, used for disinfection, is the plant's only process that is subject to the EPA RMP Part 68 and NJAC 7:31 Toxic Catastrophe Prevention (TCPA) regulations.  The chlorine process is located at the Pre-Treatment Building, which is separate from the treatment plant.\n\nChlorine is stored in steel one-ton containers in the Chlorine Storage Room, within the Pre-Treatment Building, which is of sound masonry construction.\n\nThe City of Newark has maintained an \"approved\" Risk Management Plan Program under the New Jersey TCPA regulations for the chlorine process since approximately 1988.  The current City of Newark/NWCDC program includes a complete chlorine safety program including extensive operator training, emergency response training, standard operating procedures and chlorine safety equipment.  The chlorine process includes chlorine monitors, alarms and controls.\n\nThe City of Newark/NWCDC written Risk Management Program includes all necessary Prevention Program elements, meeting the requirements of EPA and OSHA Process Safety management.  The Prevention Program includes elements such as safety information, standard operating procedures, operator training, preventative maintenance, hot work permits, and other safety programs to ensure that the chlorine process meets the highest possible safety standards."
