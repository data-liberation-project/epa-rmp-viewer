Air Products manages the safety of the regulated processes by means of operating procedures, equipment testing and inspections, safety devices (e.g., alarms, shutdowns, instrumentation, relief devices) inherent in the design of this facility and other controls and systems designed to prevent accidental release of hazardous chemicals.  Safe work practices and training of our personnel supplement the inherent safe design of the plant.\r\n\r\nOur emergency response program is based upon OSHA's HAZWOPER regulation.  The emergency response plan includes procedures for the notification of the local fire authority. \r\n\r\nThis document has been prepared in accordance with the EPA's Risk Management Plan regulation (40 CFR, Part 68).  The substances and processes considered during the preparation of this RMP and the scenarios described were selected based on criteria established in the regulation.\r\n\r\nOne of the principal purposes of this facility is to transport liquid hydrogen.  This facility ships and temporarily stores liquid hydrogen. Hydrogen is used by our customers in their manufacturing processes.  Hydrogen product is brought onsite from the manufacturing facility down the street.  The pure hydrogen is then shipped out for delivery to our customers via tank truck. \r\n\r\nThe facility complies with the Federal EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Plan, and OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation.
