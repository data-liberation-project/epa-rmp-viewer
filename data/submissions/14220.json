      "SummaryText": "The regulated substances on site only include chlorine. The Pi`iholo WTF currently has an adopted Chlorine Leak Alarm and Containment program.  The facility is equiped with an automated chlorine leak detection system which automaticly activates the scrubber system and noitfies the DRC operator.  The chlorine scrubber is sized for the worse case scenario of netralizing two (2),  one ton cylinders of chlorine.  The facility was newly constructed in 1995 and has no accident or incident history to date.  Mitigation of chlorine leaks is handled by the chlorine scrubber.  The emergency response plan is out lined in the Chlorine Leak Alarm and Containment policy.  The inventory of Chlorine at the Pi`iholo facility has been reduced to a maximum of 1400 Lbs. which is  below the reportable limit.  This report supersedes the previous submission made on June 9, 1999"
