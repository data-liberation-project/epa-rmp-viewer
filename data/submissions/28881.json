Many of our employees are members of Local Emergency Planning Committees.  Our facilities have written emergency preparedness plans that are updated regularly.  \n\nOur facilities typically host open houses every 3 to 5 years as an opportunity for neighbors to learn about our commitment to safety.  Our facility makes an effort to support our communities through sponsorship of local activities and participation in many local organizations.\n\nA description of your facility and the regulated substances handled:  \n\nThis facility manufactures, receives, stores, and ships chemicals which are primarily used in the electronics and semiconductor industry.  The regulated substances handled are anhydrous ammonia, ammonium hydroxide, and hydrochloric acid.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario:\n\nThe USEPA RMP regulations require the worst-case release scenario to assume that the entire contents of the largest vessel of a regulated substance in a process are released.  The USEPA requires that one worst-case scenario be reported to represent all regulated toxic substances held above the threshold quantity.  This facility reported the worst-case scenario for anhydrous ammonia.  Based on our analysis using USEPA-approved methods, the worst-case release sce"

The administrative control on tank inventory and the enclosure surrounding the storage tanks were taken into consideration in the analysis to limit the distance reported. \n\nThe alternative-case release scenario:\n\nThe USEPA RMP regulations require an analysis of the alternative-case release scenarios.  The alternative-case release scenario represents an accidental release that is more reasonable than the worst-case, but is still highly unlikely to occur.  The USEPA requires that the results of the alternative-case release scenario analysis be reported for each toxic present.  Based on our analysis using USEPA-approved methods, the alternative-case release scenarios for anhydrous ammonia and ammonium hydroxide could potentially impact offsite public receptors.  \n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps:\n\nThis facility is operated in strict accordance with the USEPA prevention program requirements.  A written management system is in place with written operating and maintenance procedures.  The operations at this facility are ISO 9002 certified.  The management system procedures contained in the ISO program ensure rigorous training for operations employees, numerous management checks and balances, and strict attention to changes in the operations with a thorough review and examination of potential incidents that could lead to an accidental release.  This facility has emergency medical treatment information readily available for use in an emergency. \n \nFive-year accident history: \n\nThis facility has never had a release of anhydrous ammonia, ammonium hydroxide, or hydrochloric acid  per the definition in 40 CFR  68.\n  \nThe emergency response program:\n\nOur employees are trained and equipped to respond offensively to accidental releases of the regulated substances and will coordinate with local emergency responders when there is a need for response.
