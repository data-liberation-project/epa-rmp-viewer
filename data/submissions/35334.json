Hydrogen, in the amounts \nhandled by our facility, is considered hazardous by the EPA.  It is our policy to adhere to \nall applicable Federal and state rules and regulations.  In addition, Corporate Practice \n1002A, Emergency Response Program, and 1003A Planning for Emergencies, \nspecifically highlight the Air Products' commitment of being prepared for and \nresponding promptly and appropriately to emergency events. Air Products manages the \nsafety of the regulated processes by means of operating procedures, equipment testing \nand inspections, safety devices (e.g., alarms, shutdowns, instrumentation, relief devices) \ninherent in the design of this facility and other controls and systems such as the site \nsecurity system, communications system, fire control system, and flammable gas \nmonitoring system, designed and used to help prevent and control accidental releases of \nhazardous chemicals.  Safe work practices and training of our personnel supplement the \ninherent safe design of the plant.\n\nOur emergency response program is based upon OSHA's HAZWOPER regulation.  The \nemergency response plan includes procedures for the notification of the local fire \nauthority and Hazardous Materials unit so that appropriate measures can be taken by \nlocal emergency responders to control accidental releases.\n\nThis document has been prepared in accordance with the EPA's Risk Management Plan \nregulation (40 CFR, Part 68). The substances and processes considered during the \npreparation of this RMP and the scenarios described were selected based on criteria \nestablished in the regulation.\n\n2.\tThe stationary source and regulated substances handled:\n\nThe Sacramento facility mailing address is 5025 83rd Street, Sacramento, California and it \nis"

The facility is owned and operated by Air \nProducts Manufacturing Corporation, a wholly owned facility of Air Products and \nChemicals, Inc.  The facility has the following registrations: RMP ID 100000001972, \nEPA ID CAD082023665 and a Dunns # 003002070.  The site's manager and emergency \ncontact is Race Cargile (916) 381-1776.  \n\nThe primary purpose of this facility is the manufacturing of gaseous and liquid hydrogen. \nGaseous hydrogen is used by our customer in their manufacturing process. Gaseous \nhydrogen is produced in the reformer process (See Reformer Process below) and \ntransmitted to the customer via pipeline. The pipeline is connected to a 20,000 gallon \nliquid hydrogen backup tank that supplies the pipeline when the reformer is off-line.  \nGaseous hydrogen exists in various stages of purity at the Sacramento plant, depending \nupon where it is in the manufacturing process.  Ultimately the product gaseous hydrogen \nsent to P&G is pure hydrogen. \n\nLiquid hydrogen is also produced from the hydrogen gas taken from the reformer \nprocess. Liquid hydrogen is produced by passing  hydrogen gas through a series of \ncompression, cooling, and expansion steps. The liquid hydrogen is stored in two 70,000 \ngallon and one 20,000 gallon liquid hydrogen tanks.  Liquid hydrogen is loaded into \nhighway tankers and shipped to various off-site customers.  Liquid hydrogen stored on \nsite is pure hydrogen.\n\nREFORMER PROCESS: Hydrocarbon based gases (natural gas or methane) are received \nby our plant via pipeline and used as our feedstock.  The feedstock is then compressed \nand cracked in our reformer (furnace).  By exposing the feedstock to a catalyst in the \npresence of heat (approximately 1,500 degrees F.) and steam, a chemical reaction takes \nplace that converts the feedstock into hydrogen, carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide.  \nThe carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide is then separated from the hydrogen in \nadsorbers.
