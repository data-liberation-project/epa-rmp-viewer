This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, training of highly qualified personnel, and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of our processes.  \r\n\r\nColonial's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent chemical releases.  It is agreed upon between Colonial and the third party that the third party will respond to releases per their RMP which states, \"In the event of fire or explosion, or a release of a regulated substance from the process, entry within the distance to the specified endpoint may pose a danger to public emergency responders. Therefore, emergency responders should not enter the area except as arranged with the emergency contact indicated within the [third party] RMP.\"  Colonial personnel will notify the third party and evacuate, if necessary but will take no action.  Powder Springs Logistics will respond to releases.\r\n\r\nColonial's Atlanta Junction Facility includes gasoline blending connections.  The blending operation consists of Colonial-owned manual isolation valves at the injection points of third party butane blending lines. These lines connect the third party to six Colonial pipelines for the purpose of blending butane into gasoline.  The blending operations utilize butane as a blending component.  Butane is sourced via pipelines connected to a third-party storage facility located near the Atlanta Junction Facility. Butane is the only chemical maintained on site and listed on the EPA's list of flammable chemicals above EPA's threshold quantity.\r\n\r\n1.

The information will be updated when new equipment is purchased or significant changes are made to existing equipment in accordance with the Colonial MOC Process.\r\n\r\n2.  Process Hazard Analysis\r\nColonial has a comprehensive program that establishes requirements for documented hazard reviews of the PSM-covered process at Colonial's Atlanta Junction facility. These hazard reviews, often referred to as Process Hazard Analyses (PHAs), must be completed initially and re-validated every five (5) years. A PHA is an organized and systematic effort to identify and analyze the significance of potential hazards associated with the processing or handling of highly hazardous chemicals. It provides management and facility personnel with information that will aid in improving safety and reducing the consequences of unplanned spills or releases of hazardous materials. A PHA is directed toward analyzing potential causes and consequences of fires, explosions, releases of toxic or flammable chemicals and major spills of hazardous materials. A PHA focuses on equipment, instrumentation, utilities, human action (routine and non-routine) and external factors that might impact the process. These considerations assist in determining the hazards and potential failure-point or failure modes in a process.\r\n\r\nPHAs are performed using a team approach with at least one member of the team being knowledgeable of the process under review.

Recommendations are tracked until resolved, addressing each PHA recommendation in a timely manner. Management must agree and implement the recommendation, reject if recommendation is not warranted, or agree in principle with the recommendation but suggest an alternative.  A recommendation is considered complete when it has been physically implemented or rejected, with proper documentation. A schedule for completion of action items is published noting each action item, responsible party, and target date for completion.\r\n\r\n3.  Operating Procedures\r\nOperators, supervisors, and other qualified personnel work together to develop, publish and follow operating procedures for each PSM-covered process task.  These procedures define how tasks related to process operations are safely performed.  Colonial uses operating procedures to train employees and serve as reference guides for appropriate actions to take during both normal operations and process upsets.  Procedures are kept in easily accessible areas for personnel who may work on process equipment.

Colonial's IMP provides well-established practices and procedures to maintain the pipeline and related systems such as relief, control systems, emergency shutdown systems, and rotating equipment in safe operating condition.\r\n\r\nThe IMP and related documents meet the written procedures requirements of 1910.119(j)(2) and fully describe the inspection and testing requirements of OSHA mechanical integrity under 29 CFR 1910.119(j)(4). These internal documents also cover the requirements for equipment deficiencies at 1910.119(j)(5) and provide the information needed to address the requirements for quality assurance 1910.119(j)(6).\r\n\r\nAll site personnel who perform inspection, testing and service or repair work on PSM-covered equipment are trained on the content of this procedure. Each person performing maintenance activities on critical equipment is trained on the applicable procedure(s). Training is documented in accordance with the Conduct of Operations Manual.\r\n\r\nThe mechanical integrity element of a PSM plan requires a listing of all critical equipment, written procedures, maintenance training documentation, inspection, testing and calibration documentation and quality assurance of construction and maintenance. Equipment critical to operations or identified in the process haz"

Procedures in this manual have been divided into two categories, System Integrity and General. The categories define the rationale for performing maintenance as outlined by regulatory agencies, manufacturer's and Colonial's experience. Specific procedures outlining maintenance procedures, inspection, testing and other references are listed for all critical equipment.\r\n\r\nEquipment inspections, tests and/or calibrations are outlined in Colonial's Equipment Maintenance Procedures. Specific procedures for inspections, tests or calibration are listed for all critical equipment. Each specific procedure describes the frequency of the maintenance event. Documentation for each inspection, test or calibration is recorded on forms for each specific piece of equipment. Forms are either manual or embedded within Colonial's Maximo Asset Management system (Maximo).\r\n\r\nColonial has a substantial volume of internal documentation that addresses the pipeline integrity, operations, and record keeping requirements under the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) found in 49 CFR Part 195 and also requirements for mechanical integrity under OSHA regulations found in 29 CFR 119(j)(6).\r\n\r\nMitigation of the risk of accidents begins with reliable design. Approximately 76 Engineering Standards are used to support and standardize pipeline system design and construction. Colonial's Engineering Standards are based on regulatory requirements, industry standards, and best practices. These standards call for preventive measures such as increased depth of cover, additional pipe wall thickness and concrete pipe coating in high risk areas including waterway, road and railroad crossings. Pipeline, tank, and facility engineering standards are published"

Examples of the program include:\r\n1)\tProcedures for identification and listing of all existing or potential hazardous and possible reactions to failure for job tasks (i.e. hazard exposure assessment or job safety analysis (JSA));\r\n2)\tLockout/tagout procedures to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance;\r\n3)\tProcedures for safe removal of hazardous materials before process piping or equipment is opened (i.e. line separation);\r\n4)\tA permit and procedures to conduct work or equipment that may generate sparks, excessive heat or open flames (i.e. hot work); and\r\n5)\tA permit and procedures to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space.\r\n\r\nThese procedures, along with other procedures not specifically listed here and training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely. Colonial requires completion of a Daily Work Permit and Safety Checklist for any work that may affect the integrity of the pipeline and associated systems and any other hazardous work or work performed in hazardous areas. \r\n\r\n9.  Incident Investigation\r\nColonial investigates all incidents that could reasonably have resulted in a serious injury to personnel, the public, or the environment so similar incidents can be prevented.  Employees at the facility are trained to identify and report any incident requiring investigation.  The investigation is initiated immediately, or no less than 24 hours after the incident.  Depending on the incident, an investigation team may be formed.  Results of the investigation are documented and appropriate changes are made through training that incorporates the findings of the incident investigation.\r\n\r\n10.  Employee Participation\r\nColonial maintains a written employee participation program to help ensure compliance with"
