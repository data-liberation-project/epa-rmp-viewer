      "SummaryText": "ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICIES\r\nFlint Hills Resources Alaska LLC (FHRA) is owner and operator of a petroleum refinery in North Pole, Alaska (the Refinery). FHRA purchased this refinery in April 2004 from Williams Alaska Petroleum, Inc. Since doing so, FHRA has gone to great efforts to further develop and prioritize health and safety performance at the refinery. At FHRA, safety is a value.  As such, it defines who FHRA is and what we believe in. The refinery has made a commitment to both employee and public safety. Our vision is to be recognized as a leader for safe operations ensuring the health and safety of employees, contractors, customers, and neighbors. Our first priority is prevention. This priority is demonstrated by the resources we have invested in accident prevention. These include designing and constructing our equipment to meet stringent, nationally recognized standards of performance. We operate and maintain our equipment to ensure reliability, which also serves as a measure of how safe an operation is. We train our employees to recognize the importance of safety and to incorporate safety as a value, both at work and at home.  In the event that a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to, control, and contain the release.  Our emergency responders train regularly, not only at the refinery but also at  internationally known training centers. We train, not just internally, but also with our mutual aid partners - local emergency responders, on a regular basis. Our goal is to have the best trained, best equipped emergency response capability that is never used, except to drill.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\r\nThe refinery operates a variety of processes to produce all grades of gasoline, diesel fuel, home heating oil, asphalt, and jet fuel, from crude oil. The refinery does not handle or process threshold quantities of toxic highly hazardous chemicals per this regulation. As a result,"

These processes previously had been designated Program Level 1 based on the use of a more refined multi-energy model for determining the potential for offsite impact.  This time, for simplicity, FHRA has utilized EPA\u00c2\u00bfs RMP Comp model.\r\n\r\nSection 1: Registration - Prior RMPs did not include the Volume of Flammables contained within the Solvent Recovery System, or the DeBenziner System. These systems are connected to the Extraction Unit. This increased the quantity of Flammables reported by approximately 2,000 pounds.\r\n\r\nSection 1:  Quantities in the Extraction System \u00c2\u00bf Naphtha 1 Sub-system were re-evaluated and determined that there is approximately 40,000 pounds of regulated flammable substances in a mixture, increasing the quantity from 16,000 pounds.  \r\n\r\nSection 1: Updated Flammable Quantities in the Extraction Unit as a result of removing\r\nKerosene from an Extraction Unit Sub-system and now charging the sub-system (Naphtha 2)  with Naphtha (thereby increasing the quantities of Flammables in the Extraction Unit). This increased the quantity of Flammables reported by approximately 21,000 pounds.\r\n\r\nSection 1:  Quantities in the Tank Farm were re-evaluated and determined that there is approximately 110,000 pounds of regulated flammable substances and non-regulated flammable substances in a mixture, increasing the quantity from 77,000 pounds.  \r\n\r\nSection 4: Worst Case Scenarios for Flammables \u00c2\u00bf As noted above, RMP Comp (as opposed to previous more refined models) was used in calculating the distance to a 1 PSI overpressure.

The written operating procedures are readily available to operators in the process units and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their jobs.\r\n\r\nTraining\r\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, FHRA has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process. After operators demonstrate through tests, skills demonstration, and other methods used to determine that they have adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they are allowed to work independently. In addition, all operators receive refresher training to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at\r\nthe highest level. All training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\r\n\r\nContractors\r\nFHRA uses contractors to supplement its workforce as part of routine practices and during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities. Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the refinery has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4)understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules,\r\nand (6) inform refinery personnel of any hazards that they find during their work. This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work.

The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and the equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service. This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready. The PSSR review team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness. A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\r\n\r\nMechanical Integrity\r\nFHRA has well-established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition. This program includes: (1) training, (2) written procedures, (3) regular inspections and tests, (4) correcting identified deficiencies, and (5) applying quality assurance measures. In combination, these activities form a system that reliably maintains the mechanical integrity of the process equipment.  Maintenance personnel receive training on (1) an overview of the process, (2) safety and health hazards, (3) applicable maintenance procedures, (4) emergency response plans, and (5) applicable safe work practices to help ensure that they can perform their job in a safe manner. Written procedures help ensure that work is performed in a consistent manner and provide a basis for training.

This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.\r\n\r\nSafe Work Practices\r\nFHRA has safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety. Examples of these include (1) Security control and badge reader systems that regulate the entrance presence and exit of support personnel, a Log Sheet to track personnel that have entered / exited covered processes (2) a work permit procedure, all work performed in the process area is to be performed under the direction of a work permit,\r\nlockout/tagout procedure is an integral part of the work permit to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous materials before process piping or equipment is opened, (4) a permit and procedure to control spark-producing activities (i.e., hot work), and (5) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space. These procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\r\n\r\nManagement of Change\r\nFHRA has a comprehensive system to manage changes to processes.

The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident. The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a\r\nrecurrence, and tracks response to the recommendations in the site's Action Item Management System. The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are accessible all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings. Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years so that the reports can be reviewed during future PHAs and PHA\r\nrevalidations.\r\n\r\nCompliance Audits\r\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, FHRA periodically conducts an audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented. Compliance audits are conducted at least every 3 years (last audit was conducted in April 2007). The audit team typically is an independent, autonomous group, and contains at least one or more individuals knowledgeable in the process being audited.

The following types of safety features are used where appropriate throughout the refinery:\r\nRelease Detection\r\n1. Hydrocarbon detectors with alarms\r\n\r\nRelease Containment/Control\r\n2. Major process relief valves that discharge to a monitored flare system to capture episodic releases.\r\n3. Automated shutdown systems for specific process parameters (e.g., high level, high temperature)\r\n4. Curbing or diking to contain liquid releases\r\n5.

In addition, FHRA has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment. Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties. The emergency response program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to refinery processes or other refinery facilities.  The emergency response program for the refinery has been coordinated with the Fairbanks North Star Borough mutual aid program. This coordination has been facilitated through the LEPC, Fairbanks North Star\r\nBorough Office of Emergency Management, and specific meetings with participants from the City of North Pole and the Fairbanks North Star Borough. FHRA has around-the-clock communications capability with emergency response organizations (e.g., fire department), who provide the means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response. The refinery provides refresher training to local emergency responders regarding the hazards of refinery operations.\r\n\r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\nDiligent compliance with our Risk Management Program forms the framework in which we will continue to improve the level of safety at FHRA. Some of the key components of the safety improvements we expect to achieve are as follows:\r\n- The Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) provisions serve as a tool to ensure continual evaluation of potential hazards, thereby leading to continual improvements in our safety standards.\r\n\r\n- The Mechanical Integrity provisions ensure that process equipment and instrumentation are designed, constructed, installed and maintained to minimize the risk of hazardous releases, thereby serving as an integral part of our safety program.\r\n\r\n- Compliance audits will ensure we maintain and increase our level of safety protection.\r\n\r\n-"

This summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\r\n\r\nEmployee Participation\r\nFHRA encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention. Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team. Employees\r\nhave access to all information created as part of the refinery accident prevention program. Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the refinery and addresses each accident prevention program element. In addition, the refinery has a number of initiatives that address process safety and employee safety issues.\r\nThese initiatives inc"

These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters, specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information. Specific departments within the refinery are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.  Chemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/ exposure treatment\r\nconsiderations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDS). This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known hazards associated with handling and exposure to the chemicals.  The refinery has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition, flow, pressure). The refinery ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using\r\nprocess controls and monitoring instruments, trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g. automated shutdown systems).  The refinery also maintains numerous other technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment. This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, etc. This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis\r\nFHRA has a comprehensive program to ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and contro"

      "SummaryText": "lled. Within this program, each process is systematically examined on a regular basis to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.  FHRA primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) technique to perform these evaluations. HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques. The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as\r\nengineering expertise. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\r\nIf ways are found to make processes safer, all appropriate individuals, including corporate management, are involved in implementing the improvements. FHRA tackles those changes which can have the greatest impact on safety first. All recommendations for improvement are tracked, to be sure that they are implemented in a timely manner. The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.  FHRA periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results. These periodic reviews are conducted\r\nat least every 5 years until the process is no longer operating. Both the HAZOP, and the What-If, Checklist technique are utilized during the Hazard Analysis Revalidation process. The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained. Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for implementation, and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\r\n\r\nOperating Procedures\r\nFHRA maintains written procedures that address all modes of process operations, including (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process.
