This is done through training of onsite personnel and contractors working on the site, the use of various safeguards to control hazards associated with potentially hazardous work, and the use of alarms during operations to detect anomalies in process operations.\n2.\tFacility and Regulated Substances\nMGC has one regulated substance, anhydrous ammonia, at the Mesa facility. The facility uses anhydrous ammonia and ammonium hydroxide to create ultra-pure ammonium hydroxide. The facility is subject to the Program Level 3 RMP requirements. [The OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation also applies to the facility because the anhydrous ammonia onsite exceeds the PSM limit of 10,000 pounds.]\nThe Covered Process includes the following:  anhydrous ammonia storage tank and piping to Ammonia Hydroxide Purification Plant.\n\u0095\tBulk liquid ammonia unloading station\n\u0095\tBulk ammonia storage \n\u0095\tAmmonia gas scrubber \n\u0095\tAmmonia drain evaporator offloading \n\u0095\tEquipment in ammonia service \nThe following sections briefly describe the elements of the MGC release prevention program that are in place at its stationary source. \n3.\tRelease Prevention Program at Killeen Plant \na.\tProcess Safety Information (PSI)\nMGC maintains PSI records onsite and at a third-party database APSM that describe chemical hazards, operating parameters, and equipment designs associated with the regulated substance and Covered Process.\nb.\tWorst-Case and Alternate-Case Release Scenarios\nInformati"

The methodology used to carry out these analyses was the hazard and operability (HAZOP) technique. The PHAs were undertaken by teams of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations. The PHAs were revalidated at least every five years. Findings and recommendations related to the PHAs were addressed in a timely manner. The most recent PHA for the Covered Process was completed on September 20-21, 2022. \nd. Operating Procedures\nMGC maintains written operating procedures to safely conduct activities in the Covered Process. These procedures address various modes of operation, such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown, and startup after a turnaround. The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in these procedures.\ne.\tTraining \nMPCA has a training program for employees tasked with operational processes and procedures. Refresher training is provided at least once every three years for employees that work with the Covered Process. MGC maintains records of the training that has been provided to employees.\nf.\tMechanical Integrity\nMGC has a preventive maintenance program for the equipment in the Covered Process. MGC carries out documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operation. Covered Process equipment examined by these checks includes, among others: pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls, and pumps.  \nMaintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance p"

Equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner. \ng.\tManagement Of Change (MOC)\nMGC has a written MOC process for the Covered Process to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment, personnel, and procedures. Process operators, maintenance personnel, or other employees whose tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to address the modifications. \nh.\tPre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR)\nMGC has a PSSR program for the Covered Process. The facility performs Pre-Startup Safety Reviews related to new processes and modifications of the Covered Process. The reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating, and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation. A completed PSSR is required prior to introducing hazardous materials to the process.\ni.\tCompliance Audits\nMGC conducts RMP compliance audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP regulation are being implemented. The last RMP compliance audit for the facility was completed in April 2022.\nj.\tIncident Investigation\nMGC investigates incidents that have resulted in, or could reasonably result, in a catastrophic release of anhydrous ammonia. These investigations are undertaken to identify the situations leading to each incident, as well as corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring. Incident Investigation reports related to the Covered Process are retained for a minimum of five years. \nk.\tEmployee Participation \nMGC has developed a written employee participation plan.

This facility has an emergency action plan that provides instructions to employees on how to respond to various emergencies, including releases of anhydrous ammonia from the Covered Process. Employees and contractors are also informed of hazards in the workplace. Employees who work with potentially hazardous substances receive training that includes emergency procedures.\nMGC coordinates with the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) so that the LEPC is aware of the Covered Process, the anhydrous ammonia, and the emergency procedures proposed in the MGC Emergency Action Plan. MGC has provided a copy of the Emergency Response Plan to the following local agencies: \n\u0095\tKilleen Fire Station No. 3\n\u0095\tKilleen Police Department \n\n6.\tPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\nThe facility does not have planned changes at this moment.
