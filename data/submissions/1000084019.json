This RMP executive summary and program submittal describes and details the key elements of the STP Risk Management Program (RMP), as well as the associated Process Safety Management (PSM) program elements.  This document also summarizes our existing health and safety programs; our internal management implementation procedures; emergency response procedures; and ongoing actions that are designed to prevent, eliminate or minimize impacts of accidental releases of digester gas to the environment. The STP is proud of its continuous dedication and commitment to ensuring accident prevention, employee safety and process safety, and as a result the STP has had an excellent record in preventing accidents from occurring.\n\n\n\n**In demonstration of the STP's commitment to eliminate or minimize the impacts of potential accidental releases, the STP formally discontinued the use of chlorine gas for disinfection and also discontinued the use of sulfur dioxide gas for the dechlorination.  STP fully decommissioned the facilities and equipment associated with the storage and use of chlorine gas and sulfur dioxide gas.  As a result, the STP has converted to the safer use of sodium hypochlorite for disinfection and sodium bisulfite for dechlorination.**\n\n\n\n(1)Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policy:\n\nThe STP is totally dedicated and committed to ensuring the prevention of any potential for accidental releases of toxic and flammables materials. The STP accidental release prevention program involves a unified approach that integrates proven technology, state of the art equipment, advanced safety training"

All applicable procedures of the State of Washington Department of Labor & Industries, Department of Ecology and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Prevention Program are adhered to, including key elements such as employee training, safety systems management, and emergency response procedures. \n\n\n\nAs a result, the STP comprehensively complies with the EPA Risk Management Program under Section 112 (r) of the Clean Air Act (CAA) Amendments of 1990, 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 68, and the State of Washington Department of Labor & Industries - Division of Occupational Safety and Health - Process Safety Management Program under Washington Administrative Code (WAC) 296-67.\n\n\n\n(2)Description of Facility and Regulated Substances\n\nThe STP is an integrated sewage treatment facility that provides both primary and secondary treatment of domestic and industrial wastewater prior to discharge to Puget Sound.  The 88-acre site takes in wastewater from 21 pump stations on the east and south sides of Lake Washington, an area of about 140 square miles.  The plant capacity is approximately 70 million gallons of sewage per day.  The treatment plant processes an average of 115 million gallons per day (mgd) wet weather flow and can handle an instantaneous maximum flow of approx. 325 mgd.  Sodium Hypochlorite (a non-covered chemical) disinfects all of the wastewater following treatment before being pumped to Puget Sound.  The digester gas results from the anaerobic biological waste treatment in the secondary treatment system.  The methane from the digester gas is primarily compressed and sold to a commercial gas pipeline system (Puget Sound Energy)for use as domestic natural gas and is also used onsite to fuel a cogeneration and fuel cell facility.  The STP is rated as a US-EPA and WA-DOE Class IV treatment plant.\n\n\n\nThe liquid tre"

The disinfected effluent discharges to Puget Sound through a multi-port diffuser located offshore in marine waters. \n\n\n\nAs for solids treatment, the primary and waste activated solids are blended in a tank and thickened. The thickened sludge is anaerobically digested in a system of digesters, and dewatered by centrifuges. The plant produces biosolids used in agriculture and forestry, reclaimed water used for in-plant processes and irrigation. Digester gas (methane) is also produced and this gas is primarily compressed and sold to a commercial pipeline for use as domestic natural gas and is also used onsite to fuel a cogeneration and fuel cell facility.\n\n\n\nThe facility complies with all applicable regulations and good engineering practices in the operation of only one process that has a greater than threshold quantity of hazardous chemical (methane/ flammable mixture) as defined in the RMP requirements. This process is the wastewater digester gas (methane/ flammable mixture) system. It is the policy of King County to meet and/or exceed all applicable federal, state, and local laws in the operation of all processes, and to design and operate the systems in accordance with the best industry standards to protect workers, visitors, and the public. \n\n\n\nThe STP digester gas was previously considered a system that was eligible for the exclusive fuel exemption, as the digester gas is used exclusively as a fuel for onsite processes or sold to a commercial gas pipeline system (Puget Sound Energy).\n\n\n\nHowever, a joint assessment and interpretation ruling by EPA Region 10 and the State of Washington Department of Labor & Industries, interpreted that the digester gas system's recirculation of digester gas is considered a \"process use\" and therefore is not eligible for exemption from the RMP regulation. \n\n\n\n(3) The "
