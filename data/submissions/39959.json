Our program minimizes risk by promoting a safer wastewater treatment operation through better process control and preventive maintenance.\n\nThis RMP program meets the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency found in 40 CFR part 68.   It is SDSD's goal to provide a safe and cost effective way for treating wastewater generated by residents and businesses. Present treatment operations at SDSD require the use of chlorine and sulfur dioxide. We respect the potential hazards involved with using these chemicals and SDSD has taken approprite steps to prevent their release.\n\nSince we submitted our RMP, there have been no substantive changes to the processes at our North and South Treatment Plants.  The North And South Plant uses chlorine to disinfect wastewater and sulfur dioxide to reduce the residual chlorine levels in treated water. The North and South Plants maintain 12,000 Ibs (6 one-ton cylinders) of chlorine on-site. The South Plant maintains 6,000 Ibs (3 one-ton cylinders) and the North Plant has 4000 lbs (2 one-ton cylinders) of sulfur dioxide onsite.  We began sulfur dioxide addition for dechlorination at our North Plant only recently (in January 2004).  We have been using this process at our South Plant for over eight years.   The new equipment at the North Plant is identical to that at the South Plant and all provisions of the RMP concerning SO2 have been implemented at the North Plant.  \n\nAccident History\nSince SDSD has been in operation there has not been no significant release of chlorine or sulfur dioxide. No SDSD employees have been injured by a chlorine or sulfur dioxide release. No off-site or public "

      "SummaryText": "receptors, human or animal, have been injured by an air release of chlorine or sulfur dioxide. During thet 43 years of treating wastewater, SDSD has never had a significant chemical accident of any kind.\n\nPrevention Program\nDue to the highly automated and fault tolerant delivery system, the likelihood of even a minor release of chlorine or sulfur dioxide is very low. The entire delivery system, beginning at the one-ton cylinders and ending at the chlorine/sulfur dioxide injectors, is maintained under constant vacuum pressure. This system automatically and instantaneously shuts down the flow of chlorine/sulfur dioxide in the event of a fault. The robust one-ton cylinders that chlorine and sulfur dioxide are stored in, and dispensed from, undergo rigorous integrity tests and are routinely inspected and reconditioned. These integrity tests and preventive maintenance are performed by the chemical distributor.\n\nNot only are SDSD's chlorination and sulfonation systems engineered to be very fault tolerant, but they are also operated in a safe manner. SDSD is very pro-active in accident prevention and preventive maintenance of their chlorination and sulfonation equipment and associated controls, including: routine upgrades, change-outs and rebuilding of disinfection delivery and storage equipment as recommended by equipment manufacturers.  Frequent mechanical integrity inspections on equipment and intrinsic and extrinsic safety controls for processes as well as frequent inspections from outside contractors and safety advisors to insure that operator training and district operating procedures are efficiently established. Our disinfection and dechlorination processes are well managed and safety is our highest concern.\n\nEmergency Response\nIn the event of an emergency release of chlorine or sulfur dioxide, SDSD has trained operators both onsite and on call around the clock. These operators are certified by the state to safely operate the chlorination and sulfonation equipment. "

      "SummaryText": "Moreover, these individuals receive frequent specific training for responding and managing chlorine/sulfur dioxide releases. SDSD operators are equipped and trained for chlorine/sulfur dioxide emergencies and coordinate emergency response activities with the South Davis Fire District.\n\nPlanned Changes\nSDSD's chlorination and sulfonation systems are engineered to be very fault tolerant and are operated in a safe manner. We recognize that extreme and unforeseeable events could potentially push these systems beyond what they were designed to withstand. Therefore, as technology changes and different means of disinfection become practical solutions, SDSD will research and implement new equipment and processes to further reduce the hazards associated with the storage of chemicals that may harm district employees, the public or the environment.\n\n\nCertification Statement\nAs the General Manager of South Davis Sewer District, I certify that the following document is SDSD's Risk Management Program and describes our current operations and best efforts for preventing and planning for emergency releases of chlorine and sulfur dioxide. This program also meets the requirements of EPA's 40 CFR part 68.  If you have any questions call me at 801-295-3469.\n\nTo the best of the undersigned's knowledge, information, and belief formed after reasonable inquiry, the information submitted is true, accurate, and complete.\n\nSincerely,\n\n\n\n\nDal Wayment, P.E.\nGeneral Manager\ndwayment@qwest.net\n\nFebruary 26, 2004"
