      "SummaryText": "We have adopted this Program in order to implement 40 C.F.R. 68, the federal requirements regulating Risk Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals.\n\nThis Program will help prevent the occurrence of, or minimize the consequences of, catastrophic releases by stating our policies and procedures for the management of process hazards in start-up, operation, inspection, maintenance and the other matters addressed in the federal standard.\n\nOur Program calls for maximum employee participation and includes all elements of the employee participation provisions of the standard.  We shall, as a minimum: (1) consult with employees and their representatives on the conduct and development of the process hazard review and other elements of the risk management plan, and (2) provide to our employees and their representatives access to the process hazard review and all other information required to be developed under that standard.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe La Joya Water Supply Corporation believes that preventative maintenance is the key to minimizing the potential for accidental releases.  Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) have been reviewed and revised to enable the employees to perform their work in a safe and efficient manner.\n\nThe La Joya Water Supply Corporation has taken steps to educate and inform the operators, supervisors, and maintenance crews in the appropriate response to an accidental release.  The training includes classroom training and operating procedures on the proper response to emergency situations. \n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nThe 492 Water Treatment Plant utilizes chlorine for disinfection of the treated water.  The maximum inventory and threshold quantity for chlorine is shown below.  The chlorine is stored outside.\n\nChemical                                                       Maximum Inventory (lb)              Threshold Quantity (lb)\nChlorine                                                      "

The RMP*Comp dispersion model was used to determine endpoint distances for both scenarios.  A dense-gas model is required since chlorine is heavier than air.  The model's input parameters are summarized in the table below.\n\nRMP*Comp Input Parameters\n                                                                             Worst-Case Scenario          Alternative Scenario\nWindspeed (m/s)                                                                1.5                                      3\nAtmospheric Stability Class                                                 F                                        D\nTemperature (0 F)                                                                77                                     77\n                                                                                      Chlorine                                Chlorine\nEnd Points (mg/l)                                                             0.0087                                 0.0087\n\nThe results of the air dispersion model are summarized in the table below along with the estimated population within the impact area. The population data was estimated using the Block Uniform Density Group Method in Landview III, which uses the 1990 U. S. Census data to estimate population.  The public and environmental receptors are listed in Section 8 of this plan.\n\nRMP*Comp Output Results\n                                                                              Worst-Case Scenario            Alternative Scenario\n                                                                                      Chlorine                                   Chlorine\nImpact Radius (miles)                                                         3                  "

This Program includes: safety information on the covered chemicals, hazard reviews, operating and maintenance procedures, training, compliance audits, incident investigations, and emergency response procedures.\n \nFive-year Accident History\n\nIn the last 5 years, there have not been any accidental releases from the covered process that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering-in-place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThe La Joya Water Supply Corporation has implemented a Risk Management Plan (RMP) that meets or exceeds the requirements of 40 CFR 68.  It is La Joya Water Supply Corporation's philosophy to continually improve the safe working conditions of its employees to minimize accidents and reduce the potential for either an on-site or off-site release.  With this in mind, La Joya Water Supply Corporation is planning on incorporating many of the RMP elements into other areas of the process not covered under 40 CFR 68 to improve the overall safety of the plant."
