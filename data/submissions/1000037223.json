      "SummaryText": "About our Facility:\n\n     The West Plant Facility is located in rural Columbia County, about five miles west\n\nof Magnolia, Arkansas.  Land use in the immediate vicinity of the site is primarily\n\nagricultural, with silviculture and animal operations predominating.  The plant is located\n\non the south side of a low hill or ridge between two intermittent streams.\n\n     The location of the plant is due to the presence of natural brine deposits located\n\nabout 1.5 miles beneath the plant.  These brines are withdrawn through a system of\n\nwells and processed to produce bromine and hydrogen sulfide, and then replaced into\n\nthe same geologic formation by a second system of wells.  \n\n     The West Plant produces bromine, sodium hydrosulfide, and\n\nhexabromocyclododecane.\n\n\n\nAbout our accidental release prevention and emergency response policies:\n\n     The West Plant Facility has very active accidental release prevention and\n\nemergency response programs.  It is the policy of the West Plant Facility to reduce the\n\nrisk of chemical release to the extent feasible.  The main vehicle for chemical risk\n\nreduction is the Process Safety Management (PSM) program.  When the OSHA PSM\n\nstandard was promulgated, existing programs were subsumed into the PSM program\n\nfollowing the OSHA standard.  \n\n     The Policy of the West Plant is to first prevent the occurrence of emergency\n\nsituations, but if prevention measures are unsuccessful, to respond to those situations\n\nin a professional and appropriate manner.  The site has an integrated Emergency Plan\n\nwhich follows EPA's \"One Plan\" concept.  West Plant personnel respond to\n\nemergencies on site with a trained fire brigade, HazMat responders, and a corps of\n\ntrained EMTs.  The emergency plan provides for coordination with local care givers, first\n\nresponders, law enforcement, and the county emergency response infrastructure\n\nthrough the county-wide emergency plan.  \n\n     Briefly, if a chemical incident appears to have the potential for off site "

If a situation has impact beyond the\n\nborders of Columbia County, the county-wide emergency plan provides for coordination\n\nwith adjoining counties and parishes.\n\n     All of our south Arkansas facilities use the same basic accidental release\n\nprevention and emergency response programs.  Using the same plan makes training\n\neasier and coordination with local off site responders better.  Details of the emergency\n\nplans (such as maps; locations of response equipment) are different due to the physical\n\ndifferences in the facilities.\n\n\n\nRegulated substances handled at the West Plant:\n\n     The West Plant was known to handle four listed chemicals in two processes. \n\nInformation on the handling and storage was gathered.  Three chemicals in two\n\nprocesses were found to be subject to the RMP rule.  The accidental release prevention\n\nand emergency response programs are exactly the same for covered and non-covered\n\nprocesses; covered and non-covered chemicals are both subject to both programs.\n\n     The Risk Management Program has been incorporated into the PSM program to\n\nprovide continuity.  A description of our risk management program is found below.  \n\n\n\nOur accidental release prevention program:\n\n     The West Plant Facility is subject to the OSHA PSM standard.  We have internal\n\nprocedures which drive compliance with both the OSHA PSM standard and the new\n\nEPA RMP standard.\n\n     We have compiled detailed information on all process (both covered and non-covered) \n\nwhich includes hazard information on each substance, technical process\n\ninformation, and process equipment information.  This information is used in the\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA).\n\n     PHA's have been conducted on all processes, and are repeated according to a\n\nregular schedule (maximum of 5 years) or when certain events trigger performance of\n\nthe PHA.

For each PHA, a team is formed which possesses the\n\nrequisite expertise in engineering, process operations, hazard analysis, industrial\n\nhygiene, safety systems, and emergency response.  Several standard methods may be\n\nused to analyze the available information, and more than one method may be applied\n\nto a process hazard analysis.  The PHA documentation is retained for the life of the\n\nprocess.  This information is used to eliminate hazards when possible, and mitigate\n\nthose hazards when elimination is not possible or impractical.\n\n     Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) exist when each process is first started\n\nup, and undergo continual review and improvement.  Some of the items included in\n\nSOP's are procedures for start-ups, shut-downs, routine or hazardous procedures,\n\noperation of safety and environmental control systems, and mitigation of process\n\nhazards.  SOPs are updated to reflect current operating conditions.  Each SOP is\n\nreviewed no less often than annually.\n\n     Training is the key aspect of accident prevention.

We manage process changes through a system that insures the\n\nimpact of a change is assessed and appropriately addressed before the change is\n\nimplemented.  Part of this program (Management of Change) is communication of the\n\nchange and anticipated effects to all affected employees, and training provided as\n\nnecessary.\n\n     To assure compliance with this program, regular audits are conducted. \n\n     We make every effort to minimize risk through training, preparation, and\n\nplanning.  Yet an incident may occur.  When an incident occurs, an investigation is\n\nperformed to determine the root causes for the incident and to recommend corrective\n\naction to prevent a reoccurrence.  These investigations are performed on minor (even\n\ntrivial) incidents.

Another essential\n\npart of the risk management program is the use of \"lock out/ tag out\" procedures. \n\nWhen a safe work permit is issued, the permit requires the permittee to assure that all\n\nsources of potential energy have been deactivated.  For instance, the permittee may\n\nperform the following procedures before working on a pump: Check the Safe Work\n\nPermit to make assure operations has purged and drained the pump; check the red\n\ntags in place to make sure the pump is isolated from the process; and place a personal\n\nlocking device on the electrical switchgear energizing the pump.
