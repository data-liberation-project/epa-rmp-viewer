      "SummaryText": "RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nGOLDEN GRAIN ENERGY, LLC\n\n\n\n\n\nGolden Grain Energy, LLC  (GGE) is a fully operational ethanol production facility.  GGE started operations in December of 2004.  At that time, GGE submitted an RMP for the facility in accordance with 40 CFR Part 68.  Golden Grain Energy, LLC is designed to produce approximately 150 million gallons of fuel grade ethanol per year.  DDGS and modified wet cake (MWDGS) are by-products of ethanol production and are sold to local cattle markets as animal feed.  Ethanol production activities fall under the SIC code of 2869, Industrial Chemicals, Not Elsewhere Classified.  \n\n\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Response Policies:\n\n\n\nGolden Grain Energy, LLC has a commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated in the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel as well as considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the facility.  Training personnel is also important to the facility and is considered a valuable prevention method.  Staff is trained on spill prevention and control methods as well as emergency action policies which are implemented at the facility.\n\nGolden Grain Energy, LLC's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, plant personnel will respond to contain the release as necessary.  GGE management is dedicated to safety, spill prevention and emergency action.\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances:\n\n\n\nThe GGE plant is located ~1.2 miles southwest of the Mason City city limits.  The site is located in the SW A? of the SE A? of Section 20 in Township 96 North, Range 20 West, and bounded on the west by the Union Pacific Railway, south by 240th Street, and undeveloped lands east and north.\n\nThe facility operates 24 hours per day, 7 days per week for the purpose of manufacturing fuel grade ethano"

      "SummaryText": "l from corn.  The regulated substance under the RMP program is Anhydrous Ammonia and Denaturant which is considered a flammable mixture.  Ammonia is used as a chemical processing aid and is consumed in the manufacturing process.  Natural Gasoline is used to denature the ethanol so it is impure prior to being shipped off-site in accordance with applicable regulations.  Denaturant is generally stored on-site in the denaturant and final product storage tanks.  \n\n\n\n\n\nFive Year Accident History:\n\n\n\nGGE ethanol facility has been subject to RMP criteria upon delivery of substances onsite.  \n\nIn the last five (5) years, GGE has had no reportable accidents.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\n\n\nGGE is included in the Mason City, Iowa Community Response Plan.  Therefore, GGE does not have its own Emergency Response Plan for emergencies requiring a high level of emergency support.  In the case of an incident requiring high level emergency response, GGE would call 911 for fire and other emergency equipment.  \n\nFurthermore, GGE has a commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated in the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel as well as considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the facility.\n\nGGE's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, plant personnel will respond to contain the release as necessary. The ethanol tanks, final product tanks, and denaturant tank are all located in a large bermed Tank Farm containment area.  This area is separated from the plant and equipped with a fire suppression system.  A release from one of these tanks would not be able to migrate off-site, and a fire could be quickly extinguished.  \n\nThe ammonia tank has a manual shut off valve for any release that may happen with that vessel.  \n\n\n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\n\n\nGGE is subject to RMP Preventio"

      "SummaryText": "n Program Level 3.  Through completion of this RMP and similar efforts regulated by OSHA's Process Safety Management standard at 29 CFR 1910.119, GGE has complied with the EPA requirements at 40 CFR Part 68.115(d). Process safety information, safe work practices such as Hot Work, Confined Space Entry and Lockout/Tagout, and operations and maintenance procedures are documented on-site. Periodic functions such as process hazard analyses (PHA), training, management of change, pre-startup safety reviews, and incident investigation are conducted on a regular basis.  The denaturant tank is equipped with high level alarms as well as a berm that surrounds the entire tank farm.  The anhydrous ammonia tank is equipped with a manual shut off valve.  These chemical specific prevention measures minimize the risk for an RMP reportable incident.  Compliance audits of the RMP Prevention Program will be conducted on a regular basis to assure compliance with EPA and OSHA regulations. \n\n\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nAs previously mentioned, GGE is committed to the protection of its employees, the greater community and the environment from hazardous substances used in the ethanol fuel production process. GGE management is committed to promoting a safe work environment. GGE will continue to provide its employees with the necessary training, tools, and ongoing support needed to conduct their work safely and to operate the ethanol production process in a safe and efficient manner. In addition, GGE has four audits per year by third parties: two for safety, one for fire, and one for equipment hazards.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
