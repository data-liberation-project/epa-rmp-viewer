Yuma Express Cooling, LLC leases the site including stationary refrigerating equipment to Dandy Cooling Company, LLC, the current tenant.  Separately, Dandy leases portable refrigerating equipment from WPS. Maintenance of the entire refrigerating system is the responsibility of WPS which has offices and staff about 100 yards from the site. WPS and Dandy work together to implement the Risk and Process Safety Management Plan, which is in the name of Yuma Express Cooling, LLC - Site # 2.

The PSM Program is specifically intended to prevent accidental releases & promote the safe operation of ammonia-handling equipment and processes. PSM is an integral part of daily Plant operation. The written PSM document is maintained in the site's RMP/PSM Plan.\r\n\r\nAs noted above WPS is the company that inspects and performs mechanical maintenance of the ammonia refrigeration equipment.  Schedules and written procedures for the operation and maintenance of ammonia-handling equipment, including the steps to be taken in the event of a release or threatened release, have been developed.  The written procedures include necessary safety precautions for Plant operation, inspection, maintenance, and moving of portable equipment (Hydro-Vac&trade; Vacuum Tubes)."

Through a regular routine of inspect, discuss, assign and confirmation of completion, YEX2 and WPS have reduced equipment operational problems and also reduced the potential for releases.\r\n\r\nWPS actively encourages its ammonia Technicians to seek Certification through the Refrigerating Engineers and Technicians Association (RETA).  Technicians only perform tasks for which they have been pre-qualified.\r\n\r\nChemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\n\r\nIt has become apparent in the industry that a mishap while draining oil from the system is one of the most common incidents to occur. Special self-closing valves are now used as a permissive for oil drain flow. If a release were to develop during an oil-draining task, the mechanic simply releases the handle of the self-closing valve and flow is terminated. The facility uses these types of valves at each  oil drain point.\r\n\r\nOther release prevention steps taken at YEX2 - Site #2:\r\n-\tThe facility has fencing and gates to limit access to the facility and to increase the security of the facility from potential wrong-doers.\r\n-\tA Security Service is employed on-site to control casual visitors (truck drivers reporting to pick-up produce).  \r\n-\tCCTVs are employed for site monitoring\r\n-\tAn ammonia monitoring, sensing, and warning system is installed.\r\n-\tAn Ammonia-Water Diffusion System was installed under supervision of the Yuma Fire Dept.\r\n-\tThere is a controlled pressure receiver installed for daily operational swing capacity.\r\n-\tAn automated evaporative cooling water sprinkler system is installed over the site's High Pressure Receiver vessel.

The facility was built in 1987; an expansion and upgrade project was completed in the latter part of 2011.  The facility provides pre-cooling refrigeration effect for the removal of field heat from freshly harvested vegetables (produce) and subsequent short-term refrigerated storage prior to shipment to destinations throughout the country. The product that comes to the facility for pre-cooling and subsequent short-term storage is on-site generally four days from harvesting. The facility is a seasonally operated plant with product harvest periods beginning in mid-November and finishing in early April. \r\n\r\nThe Regulated Substance in use is Anhydrous Ammonia, CAS #7664-41-7, which is used in a closed-loop mechanical refrigeration system. Pressure and temperature controls are installed in accordance with appropriate standards, including isolation and overpressure relief valves. At certain times of the year portable cooling equipment is required to augment the fixed equipment at the facility. Due to the seasonal operation of the Plant, the majority of ammonia refrigerant is removed and placed in ASME certified storage vessels at the end of each season.  These vessels are located nearby at the WPS Yuma Shop, EPA RMP ID#100000122119.  The vessels are provided supervision, shade, traffic"

Only the Yuma Fire Department would respond to an emergency; support would be made available via WPS personnel trained to 29 CFR 1910.120(q) standards. Emergency equipment is maintained under the control of WPS. Written ammonia emergency procedures are detailed in the facility's Thirty Minute Plan.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 2022\r\n\r\n1.1 Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n\r\nThe Yuma Express Cooling, LLC - Site #2 (YEX2) Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies are to simply not have accidental releases or emergencies. The company endeavors to execute these policies through the implementation of its Safety Program. The company safety program includes but is not limited to a comprehensive Process Safety Management (PSM) Program. The PSM program is executed through Western Precooling Systems (WPS), the business owner.  WPS has offices and staff about 100 yards from the facility.  PSM is specifically designed and intended to prevent accidental releases. It is the primary goal of YEX2 and WPS to protect employees, visitors, and neighbors from harm due to company operations. \r\n\r\nYEX2 has adopted a non-responding facility policy; has an established Emergency Action Plan and has taken the steps necessary to be included in the community emergency plan.  An Emergency Coordinator has been established and coordination with the State Emergency Response Commission (SERC), Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and Fire Department is performed on an ongoing basis.  Emergency response pre-planning is coordinated and kept current through the annual submittal of appropriate EPCRA Tier II reports and periodic tours of the facility by the Fire Department. WPS is also an originator and long-term sponsor of the Yuma Area Ammonia Safety Day (YAASD).  The Safety Day includes specialized classes and promotes ammonia safety.  Yuma City Fire Department is on the invitation list and has been an attendee. The WPS Emergency Coordinator is also a member of the Yuma County LEPC.\r\n\r\nWPS policy includes maintaining appropriate emergency capabilities and to deal with emergencies safely if and when they do happen.
