      "SummaryText": "1.  RMP Executive Summary\n\n1.1  Introduction \n\nChemicals are widely used in industry, in the home, in the environment.  They are transported on roads, water, and railways.  We at the Robert A. Weese Water Filtration Plant (Weese WFP) use chemicals, too.  For example, we use chlorine and ammonia to disinfect our water supply to provide a safe drinking water to our customers.  Storing large qualities of chlorine and ammonia can be a hazard.  We take our safety obligations in storing and using these chemicals as seriously as we take providing the public safe disinfected water.  The following document describes what could happen if there were to be an accident, the steps we take every day to ensure safety, and what to do in event of an emergency.\n\n1.2  Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe City of Oceanside and the Weese WFP accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates proven technology, staff training on operation and maintenance practices, and tested management system practices.  All applicable procedures of the State of California and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Prevention Program are adhered to, including key elements such as training, systems management, and emergency response procedures.  \n\nThis document complies with the EPA Risk Management Program, under Section 112 (r) of the Clean Air Act (CAA) Amendments of 1990, 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 68 and the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program under California Code of Regulations (CCR) Title 19, Division 2, Chapter 4.5.  Weese WFP has two chlorination systems that use chlorine gas fed from liquid chlorine containers and an aqueous ammonia system that provides a small amount of ammonia in the water to limit the formation of possible harmful disinfection by-products.  This document summarizes our existing health and safety programs, our internal response, procedures, and ongoing actions that are designed"

Weese WFP has prepared an emergency action plan to handle any potential accidental releases.  This plan will be reviewed by the San Diego County Hazardous Material Management Division (HMMD), which is a member of the Local Emergency Response Planning Committee (LEPC).  To date, we have an excellent record in preventing accidents from occurring.\n\n1.3  General Facility and Regulated Substances Information\n\nWeese WFP is a water treatment plant located at 3885 Silverleaf Lane in Vista, California in rural San Diego County.  Owned and operated by the City of Oceanside, it consists of a 25-million-gallon-per-day (mgd) water filtration plant.  The filtration plant finishes raw water that is supplied by either the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California or the State Project.  \n\nThe processes at Weese WFP include:\n\u00b7 Flash mixing\n\u00b7 Flocculation\n\u00b7 Filtration\n\u00b7 Chlorination\n\u00b7 Chloramination\n\nThe facility currently stores chlorine and aqueous ammonia (24 percent), both regulated toxic substances under RMP and CalARP.  Chlorine is used for the chlorination of the plant effluent in the Chlorine Contact Tank.  Gaseous chlorine is drawn from the storage vessel as a gas and injected.  Prior to discharging the treated water into the distribution system, aqueous ammonia is injected into the chlorinated water to convert the residual chlorine to chloramines.  \n\nChlorine is stored in 4 1-ton storage containers in the chlorine building, where the chlorine process is located.  This chlorine storage exceeds the listed threshold quantities in the RMP and CalARP Rules. \n\n1.4  Summary of the Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps \n\nWeese WFP is in compliance with Federal and State Process Safety Management (PSM) requirements.  Chemical-specific prevention steps include availability of self-contained escape breathing apparatus, worn by the operators"

      "SummaryText": "during connection and disconnection of the chlorine and ammonia supplies; awareness of the hazardous and toxic properties of chlorine and ammonia; and the presence of chlorine detectors and alarms.\n\nChlorine leak detector monitors continuously for leaks in the in the chlorine storage room.  The leak detectors are set to alarm at 0.5 ppm.  At 0.5 ppm, an alarm is activated in the control room, and alarm and flashing lights are activated inside and outside the chlorination building.  In addition to the audible and visual alarms to alert operators near the chlorine building, the central computer sends an alarm to all SCADA monitors, the scrubber is activated and the vent fan is locked out. All 1-ton chlorine containers are equipped with fusible metal type safety relief devices, called fusible plugs.  Most 1-ton containers have six fusible plugs, three at each end, spaced 120 degrees apart.  In the event of a fire or other high temperatures, the fusible plug is designed to melt between 158\u00b0F and 165\u00b0F to relieve pressure and prevent a catastrophic rupture of the container.\nIn the event of an aqueous ammonia leak, where the chemical will drain into the floor drain system, plant staff would suspend recovery of backwash water.  (The terminus of the floor drain system in the chemical storage and feed areas are the primary sludge beds.)  The floor drain is normally closed and would need to be manually opened to drain.  A determination would then be made as to the effect of the spill, and cleanup or salvage operations would be undertaken.\n\nThe chloramination process is a simple gravity system.  Ammonia dosage is manually adjusted and fed by gravity into the plant effluent lines in a vault beneath the tank.  The ammonia tank is surrounded by a concrete containment area designed to hold the entire contents of the ammonia tank.\n\nThe chlorine and ammonia processes are checked twice a day as part of the normal rounds at this facility. Emergency showers and eye wash stations are pr"

The equipment provides a 30-minute air supply with back carrying harness and pressure gage.  Fire extinguishers are available at 13 sites.\n\nAccess to Weese WFP is controlled by a fence and gate, which is locked between the hours of 4 p.m. and 7 a.m.  Visitors and contractors must be approved by Weese WFP staff prior to entry into the facility.
