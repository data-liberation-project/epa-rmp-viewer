Although we will not respond to this occurance, we have as mentioned trained our staff on how to prevent this occurance, recoginize this occurance and how to evacuate the premisis whether on or off-site and how to contact the proper agencies and responders.   Edwards Chemicals, Inc. is constantly looking for available information on how to better train, prepare and educate our employees.  In this vain we have a full time Safety Administrator, who keeps updated on the new standards pertaining to the proper storage and handling of chlorine, as well as a safety committee that is randomly chosen quarterly and includes all areas of staffing."

Edwards Chemicals, Inc. is a chemical distribuitor to municipalities and industries as well as being a custodial product distribuitor to municipalities, industry and school districts.   Our facility is located at 515 Middleton Street, Saint Joseph, MO  64505.  The toxic chemical that is stored witin our facility is that of chlorine in 150# cylinders.  The most that is stored at any given point is 70 cylinders or 10,500#'s.  We are dedicated to the safety our our employees and our community, as well as those communities we service.  We are continually training our staff on the proper procedures and protocol for handling chemicals.  We have requested and received onsite consulatation in the last 12 months from the Missouri Department of Labor, Missouri Department of Natural Resources and the local Fire Marshall, to audit our policies, procedures and programs as well as an unscheduled on-site inspection by our insurance carrier. We are proud that during these consultations no major itmes were noted and that all suggestions by these agencies have been put into place, with proper training given to our staff.  A site hazard assessment was completed on May 17th, 2002 and noted items have been addressed and/or corrected.  The management of Edwards Chemicals, Inc. in dedicated to the safety programs instituited by our Safety Administrator, and management is apprised of all safety issues at weekly management meetings. In the event of a gas chlorine release on-site, we have been listed in the Buchanan County LEPC emergency plan and have trained our staff how to detect a leak and how to evacuate the builidng and contact the LEPC as well as our emergency response contractor A&M Enviromental Response.  Although not required we have developed and implemented an emergency response program, to ensure that all staff members are trained and knowledgeable in the proper steps to ta"

In the event of an off-site release the drivers have been trained in how to contact the appropriate agencies, secure the area and contact our emergency response contractor, our inside staff has also been trained on the proper procedures if this situation occurs.  Post 9-11, we have also institued many additonal security measures, such as a daily cylinder inventory report,  training for our staff on how to recognize any strange behavior by persons  who may be targeting our warehouse and/or our cargo during deliveries off-site, we have also d trained our staff on how to notify the proper authorities in the event of a security breech on or off-stie. In our hazard assessment, we determined that it would enhance our security to move the storage location of the gas chlrone cylinders and to make a more secure area to store them in the facility, which we have done.  We have installed global positioning satillte systems on our delivery trucks to be able to rapidly identify and locate a vehicle in the event of its theft, or a reported suspicous activity.  We have assigned all of our drivers, warehouse staff and management with celluar phones so they could immediately notify appropriate persons in the event of a chemical release, security breech or any other necessary reason for contact.  As noted we have identified a concern would be a fire in the facility and cylinders being exposed to high temperatures thus rleasing a chlorine vapor gas.  As previously noted we have requested and received an on-site consultation from the Fire Marshall and have developed a \"grab and go\" file containing all relative MSDS sheets, daily cylinder inventory reports, emergency contact lists, emergency procedures as well as a facility layout.  We have also prepared a file that our drivers carry with them daily that includes relevant MSDS, emergency contact information and emergency procedures.
