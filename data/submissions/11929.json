      "SummaryText": "The City of Russellville has had water treatment plant for the majority of this century. City of Russellville currently treats approximately 2.4 million gallons per day of drinking water. Russellville currently supplies drinking water for the residents of Russellville. The City of Russellville employs 190 plus people. An RMP covered chemical, chlorine is used in the treatment of the city drinking water. The water treatment plant is located at North Main and West First Streets. Worst Case Scenario Chemical: chlorine gas. Assumptions: 1.) Catastrophic failure of our two 1ton cyclinders. 2.) Failure of all safety systems. 3.) Worst-case weather conditions (stable, low wind speed) 4.) Total release of entire contents of two 1ton cyclinders (4000 lbs) in 10 minutes. Estimated Distance to Toxic Endpoint: 1.3 miles. Alternative Release Scenario Chemical: chlorine gas. Assumptions: Both 1ton cyclinders rupture releasing 4000 lbs of chlorine gas in 10 minutes in an enclosed space, in direct contact with outside air. Urban surronddings with many obstacles in the immediate area. Estimated distances to toxic endpoint: 0.2 miles. Accident Prevention: 1.) All water plant operators are trained in product handling and safety procedures. 2.) Cyclinders and feeders are inspected to ensure structural integrity. 3.) Access to the chlorine area is restricted to operation personnel and enclosed by steel protective fence and both cyclinders are enclosed by a building. Emergency Response: 1.) Trained Hazardous Material Response personnel are available in the event of any release. 2.) Alarm and notification systems are in place. 3.) We have an LEPC that will coordinate notification and clean-up activities with outside responders.  Five-Year Accident History. There have been no releases of chlorine gas at this facility in the past five years that have had an impact on the community or that meet the EPA RISK Management Program reporting guidelines. In the current operating history of this fac"

      "SummaryText": "ility there have been no incidents that would be reportable per the RMP requirements.  Chemical Fact Sheet: Chemical Chlorine. What are the common uses? 1.) Disinfect drinking water and disinfection of wastewater. How is it transported? Shipped by Truck. How is it stored? In steel cyclinders. How it used at the water treatment plant? Disinfect drinking water. First Aid For Chlorine Exposure General: 1.) Be cautious, do not become a casualty yourself. 2.) Prompt treatment is essential. Firmness and assurance to exposed persons will assist in alleviation anxiety. 3.) Innediately remove exposed person to an uncontaminated area. 4.) Remove any contaminated clothing and wash contaminated parts of the body. 5.) Never give anything by mouth to an unconscious person. 6.) Call a physican, obtain medical assistance."
