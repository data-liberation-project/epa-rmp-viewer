This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nPuget Sound Refining Company, located in Anacortes, Washington, operates a variety of processes to produce petroleum products (e.g., natural gas, propane, butane, gasoline) from raw crude oil.  The refinery has several regulated flammables, such as propane, butane, etc.  In addition, the refinery uses and/or processes ammonia and hydrogen sulfide, which are also regulated substances.\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT RESULTS\n\nThe worst-case scenario (WCS) associated with toxic substances in Program 3 processes at the refinery is a catastrophic failure in the Boiler House/Cogeneration Anhydrous Ammonia Tank, resulting in a release of 103,000 lb of Anhydrous Ammonia gas over a 10-minute period. Although we have numerous controls to prevent such releases and to manage their consequences, no credit for administrative controls or passive mitigation measures were taken into account in evaluating this scenario. The toxic endpoint for this substance is 0.14 milligrams. No Program 1 or 2 processes containing regulated toxic substances were identified at the refinery.\n\nThe alternative release scenario (ARS) for the Ammonia is a failure of the same tank resulting in a release of 103,000 lb of Ammonia gas over a nine minute period. The nine minute release duration is the approximate time necessary to depressurize the tank through a four inch hole in the vessel. Th"

There are no offsite consequences expected with this scenario.\n\nThe WCS associated with a release of flammable substances in Program 2 and 3 processes at the refinery is a vapor cloud explosion (VCE) involving the full inventory of the largest storage tank containing normal Butane. No administrative controls are in place to limit the storage inventory in the tank; therefore, the full tank inventory of 2,340,000 lb is assumed to release, completely vaporize, and ignite, resulting in a VCE, with a 1-psi overpressure.  Although we have numerous controls to prevent such releases and to manage their consequences, no credit for passive mitigation measures was taken into account in evaluating this WCS.\n\nThe ARS for flammable substances at the refinery is a VCE resulting from the release of n-butane from a rail car located at the railcar loading rack facility (154,000 lb released over a 10-minute period). This event was selected as being a practical scenario for use in emergency planning and response.  Although we have numerous controls to prevent such releases and to manage their consequences, no credit for administrative controls were taken into account in evaluating this scenario.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nPuget Sound Refining Company has had one RMP-related accident over the past 5 years; a fire on its Delayed Coking Unit.  There were six worker fatalities due to a November 25, 1998 Delayed Coking Unit fire.  That event did not result in injuries or other offsite impacts as defined by the RMP beyond the refinery fence line.  For the previous five years, there has not been any other injury inside or outside of the refinery caused by an RMP-covered accidental release of RMP-listed materials.  We investigate accidents to determine ways to help prevent similar accidents from occurring. \n \nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM STEPS\n\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevent"

Because processes at the refinery that are regulated by the EPA RMP regulation are also subject to the OSHA PSM standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nPuget Sound Refining Company encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team. Employees have access to all information created as part of the refinery accident prevention program.  Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the refinery.  In addition, the refinery has a number of initiatives under way that address process safety and employee safety issues. Through the BEST (Behavioral Education for a Safer Today) Program, employees have designed and implemented a behavior based safety program which encourages modifications to behavior to work safer.  This program utilizes peer observations of work practices and participation on safety teams.  The program has the stated goal that \"We all return home healthy and safe.\" The teams typically have members from various areas of the plant, including operations, maintenance, engineering, and plant management.  PSRC has also implemented the Paper, Allied-Industrial, Chemical and Energy Workers International Union (PACE) Triangle of Prevention (TOP) program to improve safety.  Major elements of TOP are 8 hours of safety training for all employees, a root cause incident investigation program, an expanded safety metric for tracking progress, and a full time Union Health & Safety Representative.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nPuget Sound Refining Comp"

These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  Specific departments within the refinery are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information. Chemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response / exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs). This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns.  The refinery process uses controls and monitoring instruments, trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems). \n\nThe refinery also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, etc. This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nPuget Sound Refining Company has a comprehensive program to help identify and control recognized hazards associated with the various processes. Within this program, each process is systematically examined to recognize hazards and to verify that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\nPuget Sound Refining Company primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations.

Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  All approved mitigation options being implemented in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and that documentation is retained.  It is Puget Sound Refining Company's policy to resolve all open findings in a timely manner.  The time necessary to resolve a finding varies, depending on the nature of the finding and circumstances.  For example, as a general rule, findings are resolved within two years or less, unless the resolution of the finding requires a unit or plant shutdown to complete, or other conditions limit the ability of the plant to resolve the open finding. \n\nPuget Sound Refining Company periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating. An electronic tracking system is used to manage and document the results and findings from these updates. \n\nOperating Procedures\n\nPuget Sound Refining Company maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process. These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.

There is a training program that is designed to provide new operators with basic training in refinery operations if they are not already familiar with such operations.  After attending the training program, new operators are paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently. In addition, operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to help maintain their skills and knowledge.  This refresher training is conducted at least every three years.\n\nContractors\n\nPuget Sound Refining Company uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the refinery has procedures in place so that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform refinery personnel of any hazards that they find during their work. This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work.

The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and the equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready.  The PSSR review team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness.  A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nPuget Sound Refining Company has well-established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition.  The basic aspects of this program include: (1) conducting training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) addressing findings identified, if any, during inspections and tests, and (5) applying quality assurance measures.  In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process equipment.\n\nMaintenance personnel receive training on (1) an overview of the process, (2) safety and health hazards, (3) applicable maintenance procedures, (4) emergency response plans, and (5) applicable safe work practices to help ensure that they can perform their job in a safe manner.  Written procedures help ensure that work is performed in a consistent manner and provide a basis for training.  Inspections an"

      "SummaryText": "d tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended, and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels).  If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service (if possible), or a MOC team will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to verify the safe operation of the equipment.\n\nAnother integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance. Puget Sound Refining Company incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs.  This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made. \n\nSafe Work Practices\n\nPuget Sound Refining Company has long-standing safe work practices in place to help maintain worker and process safety.  Examples of these include (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous materials before process piping or equipment is opened, (4) a permit and procedure to control spark-producing activities (i.e., hot work), and (5) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space.  These procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\n\nManagement of Change\n\nPuget Sound Refining Company has a comprehensive system to manage changes to processes.  This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be reviewed pursuant to the MOC process before being implemented.  Changes are reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate c"

Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures, are updated to incorporate these changes.  In addition, affected personnel are provided any necessary training on the change.\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nPuget Sound Refining Company promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a reportable fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury.  The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and to develop action items that may help prevent a recurrence of the incident.  The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to refinery management for review. Actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all affected personnel whose job tasks are relevant to the incident findings including contract employees where applicable. Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years so that the reports can be reviewed during future PHAs and PHA revalidations. \n\nCompliance Audits\n\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, Puget Sound Refining Company periodically conducts an audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented.  Compliance audits are conducted at least every 3 years. The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to refinery management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding is docu"

The accident prevention program summarized in this document is applied to all Program 2 and 3 EPA RMP-covered processes at Puget Sound Refining Company. Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by (1) equipment failures and (2) human errors.\n\nIn addition to the accident prevention program activities, Puget Sound Refining Company has safety features on many units to help (1) contain/control a release, (2) quickly detect a release, and (3) reduce the consequences of (mitigate) a release.  The following types of safety features are used in various processes:\n\nRelease Detection\n\n1. Hydrocarbon detectors with alarms\n2. Hydrogen sulfide detectors with alarms\n3. Ammonia detectors with alarms\n4. Sulfur dioxide detectors with alarms\n\nRelease Containment/Control\n\n1. Process relief valves that discharge to a flare to capture and incinerate episodic releases\n \n2. Scrubber to neutralize chemical releases\n \n3. Valves to permit isolation of the process (manual or automated)\n \n4. Automated shutdown systems for specific process parameters (e.g., high level, high temperature)\n \n5. Vessel to permit partial removal of the process inventory in the event of a release \n \n6. Curbing or diking to contain liquid releases\n \n7. Redundant equipment and instrumentation (e.g., un-interruptible power supply for process control system, backup firewater pump)\n \n8. Atmospheric relief devices\n\nRelease Mitigation\n\n1. Fire suppression and extinguishing systems \n \n2. Deluge system for specific equipment\n \n3. Trained emergency response personnel\n \n4.
