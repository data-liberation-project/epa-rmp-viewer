      "SummaryText": "CORPORATE COMMITMENT\n\nWeyerhaeuser Company\u00bfs Flint River Operation (Weyerhaeuser FRO) has a basic commitment to responsible stewardship of the environment, protection of the community, protection of employee health, and assurance of product safety that extends to the processes covered by Risk Management Program (RMP) requirements. Weyerhaeuser FRO has developed management systems in compliance with various applicable regulations to prevent the release of regulated substances especially in locations that may cause detrimental effects to employees, the community, or the environment.  This is accomplished through a systematic evaluation of process design, process technology, operational procedures, maintenance activities, non-routine procedures, emergency preparedness, training, and several other factors.\n\nWeyerhaeuser FRO has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the facility\u00bfs processes. Weyerhaeuser FRO\u00bfs policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n\nWeyerhaeuser FRO plans to meet or surpass all regulatory requirements.  In the attempt to accomplish this goal, the management systems at this facility have been developed in such a way that the hazards are identified, understood, and controlled to prevent accidents.  The RMP regulated chemicals include chlorine dioxide and chlorine.\n\n\nMILL DESCRIPTION\n\nThe Flint River Plant produces bleached communition (fluff) pulp from cellulose fiber using the Kraft process. The plant is organized into five main units encompassing several operational process areas. The five units include: the woodyard and water/wastewater treatment; pulping, which includes chip digestion,"

      "SummaryText": "oxygen delignification, and bleaching operations; pulp finishing; utilities, which includes steam/power generation and chemical recovery; and plant maintenance. A brief description of the production process is provided below.\n\nRoundwood (logs), purchased wood chips, and woodwaste fuel (bark) are received and processed by the woodyard. Major woodyard operations include debarking, chipping, and screening for thickness and sizing. The pulping operation includes chip digesting with chemicals (liquors) and steam, brownstock diffussion washing and screening, and reaction with oxygen to dissolve lignin that holds the cellulose fibers of the wood chips together. Whitening of the delignified pulp is accomplished in the bleaching sequence. The bleached pulp is then formed, dried, cut into small rolls, wrapped, weighed and then shipped off-site.\n\nThe primary functions of the utilities unit include: cogeneration of electricity, generation of compressed air and chilled water for the plant, regeneration of white liquor, recovery of lime, and combustion of non-condensable (TRS) gases. The major emission units in the utilities are a bark boiler, recovery boiler, smelt dissolving tank, and calciner. Raw river water and well water are treated on-site for use in the utilities unit and wastewater generated by the plant is treated prior to surface discharge to the Flint River.\n\n\nREGULATED SUBSTANCES AND PROCESSES\n\nWeyerhaeuser FRO operates two processes that have more than a threshold quantity of a regulated substance. The two processes are:\n\n1)  Chlorine dioxide generation and storage: The largest chlorine dioxide solution tank at the facility has a maximum capacity of 491,000 gallons. The maximum working volume in the tank is administratively controlled to a maximum capacity of 220,000 gallons. The chlorine dioxide concentration in solution can be as great as 11 g/L. This is equivalent to about 20,381 lb of chlorine dioxide.\n\n2)  Water treatment: This process utilizes chlorine stored"

The maximum amount stored in one area is four cylinders.\n\nBoth of the above processes are regulated under RMP Program 3. \n\n\nPREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nWeyerhaeuser FRO has developed and implemented an accidental release prevention program to continuously comply with OSHA\u00bfs 29 CFR 1910.119, Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals and EPA\u00bfs 40 CFR Part 68 Subpart D, Accidental Release Prevention provisions in the Risk Management Program.  The prevention program thus developed and implemented consists of twelve elements which are listed below.\n\n\u00b7Process safety information.\n\u00b7Process hazard analysis.\n\u00b7Operating procedures.\n\u00b7Training.\n\u00b7Mechanical integrity.\n\u00b7Management of change.\n\u00b7Pre-startup review.\n\u00b7Compliance audits.\n\u00b7Incident investigation.\n\u00b7Employee participation.\n\u00b7Hot work permit.\n\u00b7Contractors.\n\nSome elements of the prevention program are intended to ensure that designs are reviewed so that any new processes and/or equipment are in conformance to safe design principles.  The remainder of the elements ensure that normal operation, maintenance and control of hazards prevent inadvertent changes outside the safe design and operating envelope.\n\nWeyerhaeuser FRO\u00bfs processes and procedures are in line with US EPA\u00bfs assessment that, \u00bfPrevention of accidental releases requires a holistic approach that integrates technologies, procedures, and management practices.\u00bf  Therefore, Weyerhaeuser FRO\u00bfs prevention program is designed to provide for ongoing management of highly hazardous substances.  It is not a list of \u00bfonce and done\u00bf actions.  Rather it provides a means for assuring safe operations throughout the life of the facility.  To this end, Weyerhaeuser FRO utilizes modern computer management techniques in coordination with plant-wide awareness to ensure continued fulfillment of prevention requirements.\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY AT WEYERHAEUSER FRO\n\nWeyerhaeuser FRO has an outstanding record of accident prevention over the past five years.

However, as presented in the data elements of this RMPlan, Weyerhaeuser FRO is reporting one on-site accident involving employees during 2002.  \n\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT\n\nThe hazard assessment evaluates the offsite consequences of accidental releases on public and environmental receptors.  Pubic receptors are offsite residences, institutions (such as schools and hospitals), commercial and office buildings, parks, or recreational areas inhabited or occupied by the public at any time where members of the public could be exposed to toxic concentrations, radiant heat, or overpressure, as a result of an accidental release. Environmental receptors are natural areas such as national or state parks, forests, or monuments; officially designated wildlife sanctuaries, preserves, refuges, or areas; and federal wilderness areas, that could be exposed at any time to toxic concentrations, radiant heat, or overpressure greater than or equal to the endpoints in the risk management program rule, as the result of an accidental release.  For this RMP, Weyerhaeuser FRO has modeled a single worst-case release for the site and an alternative release for each of the two regulated substances chlorine dioxide and chlorine.  Information about these releases are contained in the RMP Data Elements.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nWeyerhaeuser FRO maintains a comprehensive written emergency response program to protect plant workers, the general public and the environment.  The program includes plans and procedures for responding to a wide range of events, caused either naturally or accidentally, which have the potential to result in a release of a regulated substance. Weyerhaeuser FRO\u00bfs emergency response program utilizes the Incident Command System (ICS) which parallels the National Interagency ICS.  This is an \u00bfall"

Periodic emergency drills are conducted within the plant to maintain preparedness and to identify areas for improvement.  The emergency response program is updated when necessary, based on modifications made to the plant processes or facilities.  In addition, the plant has an emergency preparedness program that addresses maintenance, inspection and testing  of response equipment as well as instructions and training that govern use of this equipment.\n\nThe overall emergency response program is coordinated with the Local Emergency Planning Commission (LEPC).  This coordination includes periodic meetings of the committee, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials, and industry representatives. Weyerhaeuser FRO has around-the-clock communications with the County Sheriff\u00bfs office (county communication point of contact) and the LEPC to ensure notification of the public in event of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating a quick response.\n\nWeyerhaueser\u00bfs safety program incorporates continuous improvement through use of employee involvement and on-going evaluations of in-plant safety and program effectiveness.  Under the RMP program, as well as its existing PSM and earlier SARA Title III Community Right-to-Know Act compliance programs Weyerhauser has organized its management system to effectively address hazards and potential risks.  Both the advanced planning aspects of process design, operating procedures, and emergency preparedness, and the operational elements of system maintenance, safe operating practices and ongoing personnel training are necessary to support a continual improvement in facility safety.
