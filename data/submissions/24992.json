This document consists of the executive summary and registration data elements (68.155 through 68.185).\n\n1.0    RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nThe Custom Ribs Company facility in Denison, Iowa has a good record in preventing releases of anhydrous* ammonia.  As part of their release prevention program, the plant has developed a well documented Process Safety Management (PSM) program.  More information about this aspect of the prevention program is discussed in Section 4.0 of this Executive Summary.\n\nThe facility has implemented an Emergency Action Plan \"Ammonia Response\" which is to ensure the safety of its employees', the community, and the environment.  This detailed emergency response program includes procedures for handling an emergency - the established action plan and appropriate personnel involved in containing an ammonia release - HAZMAT Team.  As part of this program, there is emergency response training and medical surveillance of the HAZMAT team prior to and after an incident.  All of these components make the Emergency Action Plan a thorough and comprehensive plan for release prevention and emergency response.  The emergency response policies at the Custom Ribs Company facility ensure that there is emergency response coverage 24 hours - 7 days per week. \n\n*From this point in the Executive Summary, anhydrous ammonia will be synonymous with ammonia.\n\n2.0    PROCESS DESCRIPTION AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nCustom Ribs Company is a producer of ribs and other meat products. The NAICS code for the processes at this facility is 311612.   Many areas of the plant are refrigerated to preserve the meat products.  Custom Ribs Company has one regulated substance under 40 CFR 68: ammonia.  Ammonia is used as a refrigerant in the refrigeration of the products in the various areas of the plant.\n\nThe ammonia threshold for triggering applicability to 40 CFR 68"

      "SummaryText": " is 10,000 pounds.  The total quantity of ammonia stored in the refrigeration process is approximately 11,490 pounds.  The process exceeds the threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds as set by 40 CFR 68 and thus is regulated by the Risk Management Program.\n\n\n3.0    WORST-CASE AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system has associated hazards that can potentially affect on-site employees and the general public off-site if there is a release from the system.  Described below are the associated hazards and the worst-case and alternative release scenarios for the regulated chemical.  \n\nAmmonia is classified as a Group 2 Refrigerant per ASHRAE Standard 34-1989.  The dominant characteristic of this chemical is its toxicity.  It is a self-alarming chemical by its distinctive pungent odor.  Due to this odor, persons exposed to ammonia vapor will not voluntarily stay in areas of even small concentrations.  Ammonia will burn at a very narrow and high range of concentrations accompanied with a high ignition temperature.  Although ammonia is not poisonous, it is corrosive to human tissue.  Ammonia is readily absorbed into the moisture of the skin and, at high concentrations, can cause severe burns.\n\nThe risks to persons in an accidental release of ammonia include:\n\n1.    Corrosive attack of skin and other tissue (including lung tissue)\n2.    Freezing of skin and other body tissue when contacted by liquid ammonia\n\nBelow is a description of the release scenarios for ammonia and their off-site consequences:\n3.1    Worst-Case Scenario Description\n\nOne worst-case scenario has been developed for the Denison plant.  The largest potential release of ammonia would occur with a two and a half inch diameter puncture in the liquid portion of the high temperature receiver.  Taking the specific definition of the worst-case from 40 CFR 68.25, the vessel that can store the largest quantity of ammonia is the high temperature receiver.  The total quantity of ammonia in the system that ca"

Administrative controls are not applicable to this scenario.  It is assumed that 2,804 pounds is released into the atmosphere.  The release rate to the atmosphere is 280.36 lb./min.  For the worst-case release, regulations dictate that the release height is at ground level.  \n\nUnder Section 68.25(c)(1), a regulated toxic substance such as ammonia that is normally a gas at ambient temperature and handled as a liquid under pressure shall be considered to be released as a gas over a 10 minute period.  Thus, ammonia's physical state in the worst-case scenario is a gas.\n\nExhibit 4-4 from Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration was used to obtain the distance to endpoint which is 1.0 miles.  Rural dispersion coefficients were used as well as a wind speed of 1.5 m/s and an atmospheric stability class of F. The estimated affected residential population is 879 people.  The types of affected receptors are listed in the Data Elements section.\n\n3.2    Alternative Release Scenario Description\n        \nThe alternative release scenario is an ammonia release from a flange gasket or valve packing leak on a high pressure liquid line.  The opening is assumed to have a diameter of one-quarter inch, and is located fifteen feet above ground level.  Administrative and passive controls are not applicable to this scenario.  Active mitigation of the release is human intervention.    \n\nThe release duration is 20 minutes.  The ammonia vapor release rate is 59.7 lb/min.  Exhibit 4-5 from Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration was used to obtain the distance to endpoint which is 0.20 miles.  Rural dispersion coefficients were used as well as a wind speed of 3.0 m/s and an atmospheric stability class of D.  The estimated affected residential population is 11 people.

At Custom Ribs Company, ammonia falls under the RMP Program 3 Prevention Program which is identical to the OSHA PSM program.  EPA has said that if the process is in compliance with OSHA PSM, then it is compliance with RMP Program 3. \n\n5.0    FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe review of Custom Ribs Company' accident history includes the following range of dates: June 21, 1994 - June 21, 1999.  There have been no accidental releases at this facility meeting 40 CFR Part 68.42(a) criterion.\n\n6.0    EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nAs mentioned previously, the Custom Ribs Company facility has developed an OSHA hazardous substance emergency response program called Emergency Action Plan.  The plan includes procedures for the response to an ammonia release.  This plan contains specific procedures for:  coordination with local authorities, emergency communication, emergency notification procedures, emergency evacuation procedures, notification of response groups, roles and lines of authority, emergency recognition and prevention, safe distances and places of refuge, and personal protective equipment and emergency equipment (anhydrous ammonia emergencies).\n\nThe Emergency Action Plan consists of all notifications and plant evacuation procedures in the event of an ammonia release.  The purpose of this plan is to summarize the existing policies, procedures, and plans of action to protect the team members of this facility and the general public from dangers associated with these emergencies and provide for the notification in event of an emergency.\n\n7.0    PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nBased on the completed Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) for ammonia, the following change will be made:  any new pipes that have been added to the facility will be updated on the b"
