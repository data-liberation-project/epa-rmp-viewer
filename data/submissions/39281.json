The Safety Coordinator administers the facility's safety and environmental policies.  The Safety Coordinator periodically evaluates the health and safety practices of facility employees to ensure compliance, and oversees implementation of the safety and environmental programs.  These programs include forklift safety, hazard communications, lockout/tagout, Hazardous Materials Emergency Business Plan, employee safety manuals, manufacturer's documentation, Emergency Response, as well as the Risk Management Plan.  In addition, Alta-Dena Certified Dairy has established a `PSM Committee?, which periodically convenes to assess the effective implementation of the facility?s Risk Management Program and to assign responsibility for the enhancement of any items found to be unsatisfactory.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nAlta-Dena Certified Dairy makes high quality dairy products with unrivaled flavor, freshness and nutrition. From fluid milk to cheese, all natural and organic products, Alta-Dena Certified Dairy's products meet exceptionally high standards. All our milk comes from family farmers under contract to Alta-Dena Certified Dairy. Our farmers feed their cows a nutritious diet including wholesome alfalfa hay, which increases milk nutrition and flavor. \n\nAlta-Dena Certified Dairy uses a regulated substance in order to meet production requirements.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe facility complies with the following risk management regulations:\n\n1) OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM),\n2) EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP); and\n3) OES California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program.\n\nThese regulations"

The following summarizes the key compliance programs that have been implemented by Alta-Dena Certified Dairy to prevent the accidental release of a regulated substance from the facility.  The written Operating Procedures ensure that the regulated process is operated in a safe manner.  The Training program ensures that personnel fully understand how to perform their jobs in a safe manner.  The Mechanical Integrity program ensures that the regulated process system is in proper working condition based upon routine testing, inspections, and maintenance according to manufacturer's specifications and industry standards.  The Management of Change program ensures that process modifications are implemented in a safe manner.  The Pre-Startup Safety Review program ensures that adequate safety measures are in place before a regulated substance is introduced into a process.  The Hot Work Permit program ensures that Alta-Dena Certified Dairy's employees and contractors perform hot work (e.g. welding) in a safe manner.  The Contractor Safety program ensures that contractors understand the hazards associated with the facility?s regulated processes and must take specified precautions to safely complete job requirements.\n\nIt is important to note that the regulated process has been designed with several safety features to prevent an accidental release. Key equipment is equipped with operating limit indicators, alarms, and switches to monitor the operation of process. \n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nBased on the Alta-Dena Certified Dairy Hazard Assessment Update Report (05/04/2004), there have been no reportable releases of a regulated substance at the facility over the past five years (May 1999 - May 2004.)\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe facility has an Emergency Response Plan (plan) in effect at the facility.  This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:  \n\n? save lives;"

This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations.  Facility personnel receive annual training regarding the emergency procedures and the Emergency Response Team holds regular drills.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nIn May 1999, the regulated process was thoroughly examined for safety hazards by way of a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA).  In addition, a Revalidation of the initial Process Hazard Analysis was conducted in March 2004.  The PHA Revalidation consisted of a:\n\n? Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) study;\n? series of safety checklists; and\n? facility inspection.\n\nThe mitigation measures include additional training, key maintenance-related tests/inspection, and enhanced emergency response policies and procedures.  All recommendations resulting from the revalidation study are due to be completed by January 2006."
