Facility accidental release and emergency response policy.\n\nThe management and employees of Evergreen FS, Inc. - Maroa Plant are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2.  The stationary source and the regulated substance handled\n\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient.  Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel and authorized contractors.\n\nThe maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia that can be stored would be 540,000 pounds, this would include the nurse tanks normally stored.\n\n3.  The accidental relrease prevention program.\n\nThis facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations.  This facility has implemented the provisions of Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1, published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc., as adopted by state regulation and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia.\n\n4.  Five year accident history.\n\nThere have been no accidental relreases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that:\n-  have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor\n-  to our knowledge have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, shelter in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n5.  The emergency response program.\n\nThe facility has:\n-  a written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA st"
