A well organized safety program provides a safe working environment and promotes increased efficiency at all levels. (IIPP)\n\nFACILITY\nWRP #10 is a wastewater treatment plant that treats domestic wastes.  This facility uses chlorine stored in 1-ton containers to disinfect a tertiary effluent before the effluent is discharged to irrigation customers.  The plant is manned 24 hours a day and in addition the process is also monitored 24 hours a day at the district headquarters located in Coachella.\n\nACCIDENT HISTORY\nNone to report\n\nWORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO\nThis facility used EPAs \"Risk Management Program Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants (40 CFR Part 68)\" for performing offsite consequence analysis (OCA) for the worst-case leak scenario.\n\nThe worst-case leak scenario is described in the compliance guide as the largest container losing all of it's contents in 10 minutes, this equates to a 200 lb/min leak of chlorine gas.  This facility is in a urban area and using the tables given in the compliance guide, a leak of this magnitude would effect a radius from the plant to 1.3 miles.\n\nIt is unlikely that a leak of this magnitude would occur because the process system is under a vacuum that will automatically shut off the supply should the process system be adversely affected.  The chlorine process is inspected daily and monitored 24 hours a day for process leaks.  All plant operators and a Chlorine Response Team are trained to respond to and stop process leaks.\n\nALTERNATIVE LEAK SCENARIO\nThis facility used EPA's \"Risk Management Program Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants (40 CFR Part 68)\" for performing OCA for the alternative leak scenario.\n\nA Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) was performed on the chlorine system at WRP #10 and i"

      "SummaryText": "t was determined that a more likely (yet not likely) leak scenario than the worst-case scenario, would be from the valve assembly on the supply valve on the 1-ton containers since most leaks do occur from the valve assemblies or fusible plugs.  This could occur through an earthquake, vandalism or material defects, but the mitigating factors that make these situations unlikely will be explained in another paragraph.\n\nUsing the EPAs guide, a leak as described above would come from a 5/16 inch opening (size of opening in valve body) producing a release rate of 15 lbs/min effecting radius of 0.1 miles from the plant.\n\nIt is unlikely that a leak described above would occur because of the following:  The process system is inspected daily; the chlorine system is monitored 24 hours a day for process leaks, and the alarms self test daily and manually tested weekly; all 1-ton containers are bound with two chain binders each to prevent movement in case of an earthquake; all 1-ton containers are inspected prior to acceptance for defects and finally all plant operators and a Chlorine Response Team are trained to respond to and stop process leaks.\n\nRESPONSE TEAMS\nChlorine response and any work with chlorine connections require three employees (First Person, Second Person & Third Person).  All plant operators are trained in emergency response.  The crew of employees trained in response to chlorine leaks at domestic well sites have been trained to respond to chlorine gas leaks at the WRPs as well.  This two person crew will respond to plants after hours with the standby operator to unmanned plants or to plants that need assistance.  There will always be three employees on call with pagers ready to respond to chlorine leaks.  The employees on call for chlorine response are rotated weekly.\n\nTRAINING\nChlorine response personnel are scheduled quarterly to be trained in use of Emergency repair kits, personal protective equipment and emergency response procedures; scheduled annually to b"

The district has purchased a 1-ton container and a 150 lb cylinder to practice emergency repairs.\n\nALARMS\nWRP #10 is equipped with chlorine gas detectors that will alarm at 1.0 ppm and a 3.0 ppm at the plants alarm page of the computer and to the Control Operator located in Coachella.  The Control Operator will be able to let the responders know which alarm is activated.  The chlorine gas concentrations are also transmitted to a LED readout located on the chlorine container storage dock.\n\nThes detectors are programmed to test every 24 hours, in addition to this the operators perform manual test weekly on the chlorine alarms to ensure a properly working detection system.\n\nCALL OUTS\nWRP #10 has a chlorine gas detector that will alarm at the site both audibly and visually.  The alarm will also transmit to control when there is a gas leak.\n\nWhen a chlorine gas leak alarm occurs at WRP #10, the plant operators will respond to the leak with three operators.  The WRP #10 standby operators or Chlorine Response Team, (in that order) can be dispatched to WRP #10  if the plant staff is unable to respond to the leak with a three person team or if more assistance is needed.\n\nRESPONSE TO MINOR LEAKS\nTwo employees will respond with SCBA's , chlorine repair kit \"B\" , gloves and a bottle of 26 degree Baume Ammonia.  The Third Person will also respond with a SCBA and stay near the truck radio.\n\nThe First and Second Person will don their SCBAs, keeping each other in sight at all times.  Using the Ammonia they will locate the leak.  Once the leak is located and is confirmed to be a system leak and not a vessel leak, the gas supply on the container can be shut off by turning the valve clockwise one full turn.  When this has been done the Third Person will let control know whether repairs have been made or if further assistance is needed.\n\nRESPONSE TO MAJOR LEAKS\nSame as above accept the response team will wear fully en"

The Third Person will notify control to send police and fire department personnel to the scene to secure and evacuate the surrounding area if necessary.

This change will completely enclose the chlorine storage and use area and will be provided with a scrubber that will be capable of handling a 2,000 lb chlorine leak."
