Inspections, maintenance and employee training are important components of our accident prevention program. This resubmission intends to reflect the removal of ammonia from the process in December 2022. The ammonia tank is to be removed from the site by the end of 2023.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES:\nThe owners, management, and employees of Redfield Energy, LLC are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of denaturant by utilization of proper equipment, regular inspections and maintenance and training of all persons that work with the materials. Should an accidental release occur, the facility has orientated the local fire department and the local emergency planning committee so they can plan for response to any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment. The facility also has prepared an Emergency Action Plan that addresses response to incidents and evacuation.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF STATIONARY SOURCES AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED:\nThe primary activity at Redfield Energy, LLC is the production of ethanol from corn. The facility uses natural gasoline as a denaturant for the final product. Natural gasoline is a flammable mixture received by truck that contains pentane and iso-pentane, among other ingredients.\n\nOFF-SITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS RESULTS:\nWorst Case Scenarios:\nFlammable Mixture (Denaturant): The flammable mixture stored onsite is natural gasoline, typically referred to as denaturant. Natural Gasoline is stored onsite as denaturant in order to denature ethanol prior to shipment off-site. Natural gasoline is stored in a steel tank in the facility tank farm. The tank is located within a diked containment structure that contains and impermeable liner with gravel overlay. A facility-specific SDS was used to determine RMP applicability, which is included as part of"

The worst-case scenario used is the release of the entire contents of the denaturant tank, causing a vapor cloud explosion. RMP Comp was used to determine the worst-case distance to endpoint, the model results are also provided as part of the RMP documentation file at the facility. Population data was obtained using Circular Area Profiling System (CAPS) which incorporates 2020 U.S. Census Data. Public receptor information (i.e. schools, hospitals) was obtained using Google Earth. The James River is located within the worst-case distance to endpoint for denaturant.\nThe Flammable Mixture onsite qualifies as a Program 3.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS:\nRedfield Energy, LLC has implemented Process Safety Management and Risk Management Plan Prevention Programs to manage the use of its covered materials. These programs cover employee participation, process hazard analyses, training, standard operating procedures, mechanical integrity, emergency response, compliance audits, hot work and other safe work practices, process safety information, management of change, prestart- up safety reviews, incident investigations, and trade secrets.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\nThere have been no accidental releases of covered materials at this facility in the past 5 years.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM: \nThe facility has a written Emergency Action Plan in accordance with OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.38 and provides state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III of EPCRA.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY: \nSafety improvements are an on-going process at the facility. Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe practices and operations. Redfield Energy, LLC has and will continue to coordin"
