The Facility Policy:  The owners, management, and employees of Illiana Seed are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia by utilization of proper equipment, regular inspections and maintenance and training of all persons that work with the material.  Should an accidental release occur, the facility has orientated the local fire department and the local emergency planning committee so they can plan for response to any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information:  The primary activity at the facility is the storage of anhydrous ammonia for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient.  The maximum quantity stored would be 140,196 pounds in the facilities 1 x 30,000 gallon storage tank. We also store nurse tanks at this location.\n\n3.  The worst-case release scenario: NOT DISCLOSED\n\nThe alternative-case release scenario: NOT DISCLOSED\n\n4.  The accidental release program:  The facility complies with  the Rules and        \n     Regulations relating to The Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia and Low Pressure \n     Nitrogen Solutions, Equipment, Containers and Storage Facilities.
