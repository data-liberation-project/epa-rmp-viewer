(FC) accidental release prevention policy involves, but is not limited to technologies, procedures, and management practices. All applicable procedures of the ANSI  K-61.1 - 1989 Safe Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, as adopted by the Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship (IDALS), are adhered to. The FC emergency response policy involves the preparation of response plans which are tailored to each facility and to the emergency response services available in the community, and is in compliance with the EPA Emergency Response Program requirements.\n\n2. The FC facility at Plainfield is in the business of selling anhydrous ammonia to farm customers as a form of nitrogen fertilizer. The facility has 2  anhydrous ammonia storage tank(s) with the maximum capacity of 161,500  lbs. of anhydrous ammonia, with the largest tank capacity of 110,500 lbs. of anhydrous ammonia. The location includes anhydrous ammonia storage tanks, nurse tank filling risers, electrical panels, lighting, and anhydrous ammonia safety equipment. This facility has 40 ammoina nurse tank trailers with a total storage capacity of 170,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia or a total of 331,500 pounds with storage tanks included in the total. The facility is manned during spring and fall fertilizer season normal business hours.\n\n3. The off-site consequence analysis includes two anhydrous ammonia release scenarios, identified as worse case release and alternative scenario. The first scenario is defined by EPA, which states that the owner or operator shall assume that the maximum quantity in the largest vessel is released as a gas over 10 minutes due to an unspecified failure. The alternative scenario is defined as more likely to occur than the worst-case release scenario.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario at FC - Plainfield involves a failure on the largest anhydrous"
