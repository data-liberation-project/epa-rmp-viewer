The PSM/RMP Coordinator is responsible for the management of these ammonia safety programs.\r\n\r\nB.  Ammonia is the only substance covered by the Risk Management Plan Regulations at this facility.\r\n\r\nC.  Description of the Risk Management Plan\r\nThe facility has a PSM/RMP Program that complies with both OSHA's Process Safety Management Standard and EPA's Risk Management Program Rule.  The PSM/RMP Program consists of the following elements:\r\nManagement Systems\r\nEmployee Participation Program\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis\r\nOperating Procedures\r\nTraining Program\r\nContractor Safety Program\r\nPre-Startup Safety Review Procedures\r\nMechanical Integrity Program\r\nHot Work Permit Procedures\r\nManagement of Change Procedures\r\nIncident Investigation Procedures\r\nCompliance Audit Procedures\r\nEmergency Action Procedures\r\nHazard Assessment\r\n5 Year Accident History\r\n\r\nD.  Five-Year Accident History\r\nThere have not been any ammonia-related accidents at the facility over the past five years that resulted in offsite consequences as outlined in the Accident History Section of the RMP Submittal.\r\n\r\nE.  Description of the Emergency Response Program\r\nAn Emergency Action Plan (EAP) has been implemented at the facility.  The EAP contains procedures describing how the facility will respond to ammonia spills and other emergencies, including evacuation procedures.  The program has been coordinated with local response agencies. \r\n\r\nF.  Planned Changes to Improve Safety\r\nWe have identified potential changes to improve the safety of our ammonia refrigeration system.  All potential changes are documented through meeting notes and/or action lists associated with the PSM/RMP Program."

      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\r\nBonduelle Americas Oakfield facility (BAO) produces various vegetable products at our facility located in Oakfield, New York.  BAO has a strong commitment to operate our facility in a safe and responsible manner.  Ammonia is used at our facility as the cooling medium in our refrigeration system.  The ammonia is contained in a closed loop system; it is designed to remain inside the piping and vessels in our facility.  We believe that ammonia provides the safest and most efficient cooling choice for our operation.\r\n\r\nDescription\r\nThe facility is located on approximately 23 acres and contains various manufacturing buildings, adjoining warehouses, and parking areas.\r\nThis Facility is a frozen vegetable processing plant, which produces bulk frozen peas, green beans, cut corn, Butternut squash, and rutabaga. These vegetables are locally grown and transported to our facility for processing. \r\nThe ammonia refrigeration process at the facility consists of various pumps, compressors, and condensers that are used to change the state of NH3 from a gas to a liquid and is a closed system. The system operation is very similar to the operation of a household refrigerator. We have two independent systems, with the largest system containing 28,441 pounds. The other system contains 21,276 pounds. The total ammonia inventory on site includes 49,717 pounds.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.  Describe the Accident Release Prevention and Emergency Policies\r\nBAO takes many precautions to prevent or minimize accidental releases of ammonia from the refrigeration system.  These precautions include safety controls (alarms and automatic shutdown devices) which are designed to identify and prevent potentially unsafe conditions such as pressure increases that could cause a system failure.  BAO has also implemented a preventive maintenance program which is designed to maintain the ongoing integrity of the systems, a training program designed to ensure that the systems are operated by qualified associates"
