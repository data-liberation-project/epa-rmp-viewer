The maximum quantity stored would be 79,560 pounds in an 18,000 gallon storage tank.*Note: Maximum quantity allowed to be stored is 85% of storage tank size.\n\n\n\n3.  The worst case release scenario and the alternative release scenario\n\n    A.  The worst case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of the storage tanks over a 10 minute time span.  The maximum quantity released would be 79,560 pounds, which represents the volume of the tank at 85% capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the toxic endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 0.83 miles.\n\n    B.  The alternative release scenario is baased ona release from a break in a transfer hose.  The distance to the toxic endpoint is 0.59 miles.\n\n\n\n4.  The accidental release, prevention program\n\n     A.
