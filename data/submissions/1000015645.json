Prior to this date, the facility was operated by Armour Eckrich Branded Meats, LLC (Smithfield Foods) for the processing and storage of meat products.  Major modifications to the building and the ammonia refrigeration system began in early 2009.  The facility was re-entered into production in February 2011.  The facility will continue to be utilized as a meat processing and storage facility.\n\n\n\nThe last RMP was submitted in September of 2008 and a De-registration Letter forwarded in mid 2009 as the ammonia was removed from the property.  \n\n\n\n1.    Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nThe Hillshire Brands Company is strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety. This commitment is inherent to our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with our regulated process.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, The Hillshire Brands Company has proactively partnered with the Kansas City Kansas Fire Department to provide properly trained and equipped hazmat responders that are available to control and mitigate the effects of a release.  We also will coordinate such events with the Wyandotte County LEPC (Local Emergency Planning Committee) for additional support.\n\n\n\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nThis facility begain operations as a meat processing plant with anhydrous ammonia refrigerated warehousing in december of 2010.

The only RMP regulated substance present at our facility is ammonia, utilized as the primary cooling media in the closed-loop refrigeration system.\n\n\n\nThe facility has two separate ammonia closed loop refrigeration systems (FES System #1 & Frick System #2).  The Plant has Anhydrous Ammonia in excess of the 10,000 pound reporting quantity.  Due to the quantity and characteristics of the systems, as well as Process Safety Management (PSM) applicability, this facility is covered under Program 3 of the Risk Management Program regulations (40 CFR Part 68).\n\n\n\n3.    The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical - Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nOur facility has taken the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR Part 68.  Our facility is also subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119, as well as the EPCRA Section 302 and 311/312 notification/reporting requirements.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the accidental release prevention program that is in place at our facility.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\n\n\nSara Lee Corporation maintains a detailed record of process safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters, and equipment designs associated with the ammonia refrigeration system.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\n\n\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies so that hazards associated with our ammonia refrigeration system are identified and controlled efficiently. The methodology used to carry out these analyses is the What If Scenarios.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in refrigeration engineering and process operations, and are reevaluated at a minimum of every five (5) years. Any findings related to the process hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\n\n\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities related to our ammonia refrigeration system, The Hillshi"

The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to all operators who work with the ammonia refrigeration system.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\n\n\nA comprehensive training program is in place so that employees who are working with the ammonia refrigeration system are competent in all relevant operating procedures. Refresher training is provided at least every three (3) years and more frequently as needed.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\n\n\nThe plant uses a Computerized Maintenance Management System (CMMS) for control scheduling and accomplishment of preventative maintenance on components of the refrigeration system.  Preventative maintenance checks include among others; pressure vessels, piping systems, pressure relief valves, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in applicable maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\n\n\nManagement of Change\n\n\n\nWritten procedures are in place to manage the changes in ammonia system's technology, equipment, and procedures.  Facility maintenance personnel, or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by an ammonia systems modification, are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification.\n\n\n\nPre-startup Reviews\n\n\n\nPre-start up safety reviews are conducted any time the ammonia refrigeration systems, or any of its components, are opened for repairs, tie-ins, or modifications.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating procedures, and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\n\n\nCompliance A"
