Inkster Terminal in Taylor Michigan, hereafter referred to as the Inkster Terminal, we are committed to providing a safe work environment for employees and to being a responsible corporate citizen. We believe that excellent performance in the areas of health, environment, safety and security goes hand-in-hand with operational excellence and financial success.   In fulfilling this commitment, we will comply with regulatory requirements and provide and maintain a safe working environment using acceptable and proven business practices. All Sunoco Logistics employees will strive to identify and eliminate hazards which could result in injury and illness, damage to the environment, property damage, and security losses.\n\nThe Inkster Terminal is operated and maintained in a manner that protects the environment, as well as the health and safety of our employees, contractors and the community in which we operate.  We promote health, safety, and the environment through programs of awareness, compliance, prevention and protection.  These programs include a combination of accidental release prevention and emergency response planning.  This summary provides a brief overview of the risk management activities that we have designed and implemented.\n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe primary function of the Inkster Terminal is to receive, store and transfer liquid petroleum gas (Propane, Butane, mixed Butanes).  The LPG is stored in 8 underground caverns ranging in  from ~100,000 to 150,000 bbls each for a total storage capacity of approximately 1,000,000 bbls.  LPG enters and leaves the facility through Department of Transportation (DOT) Part 195 Regulated underground pipelines.  The facility also has propane dryer and a propane loading facility to fill tanker trucks.\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAMS\n\nOur accid"

      "SummaryText": "ental release prevention programs and emergency planning and response programs help us effectively manage the hazards posed by our regulated substances to our employees, the public, and the environment.  The covered process is regulated by the EPA Risk Management Program regulation 40 CFR Part 68, and the OSHA Process Safety Management standard 29 CFR 1910.119. The following accident prevention programs are in place at the Inkster Terminal:\n\n\n\n1)    Employee Participation\n\n2)    Process Safety Information\n\n3)    Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) with Risk Assessments\n\n4)    Standard Operating Procedures\n\n5)    EHS Operator Training\n\n6)    Contractors \n\n7)    Pre-startup Safety Review\n\n8)    Mechanical Integrity with Preventive Maintenance\n\n9)    Work Permits\n\n10)    Management of Change\n\n11)    EHS Accident or Potential Catastrophic Event Investigation\n\n12)    Emergency Response\n\n13)    Compliance Audits\n\n14)    Trade Secrets\n\n \n\nWORST-CASE AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nOur worst-case scenario is the failure of the piping leading to cavern 3 (propane) leading to a 10-minute release followed by a vapor cloud explosion.  The resulting distance to the endpoint extends off-site, and public receptors are within the distance to the endpoint.  Our alternative release scenario is the failure of the propane dryer causing the estimated contents (7,281 lbs propane) to be released over a 10-minute period followed by a vapor cloud explosion.\n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe Inkster Terminal has not had an incident in the last five years involving LPG or propane that caused deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place scenarios.  However, there was one incident in the last five years that resulted in a fire on the vent stack system.  The fire self extinguished after LPG venting ceased.  This incident did not have any further onsite or offsite consequences.   This event was mitigated through replacement of the entire truck loading system, including the propane dryer. No furthe"

      "SummaryText": "r issues have been observed in this system.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM \n\nThe Inkster Terminal maintains compliance with local, state and federal regulations including OSHA CFR 1910.120, Oil Pollution Act of 1990 and SARA Title III. The programs are reviewed and updated on an annual basis, or more often if required.  Our Emergency Response Plan provides the essential planning and training for protecting employees, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.  Contained within the Plan are written procedures that outline the actions to be taken for various types of emergencies that could occur in the terminal.  These emergencies may include: airborne releases of chemical substances, spills to the water or ground, fires, explosions, personnel medical emergencies.  The Programs address the aspects of emergency response including:\n\n\n\n?    Information on emergency organization (Incident Command System), including roles and responsibilities of personnel responding to the incident\n\n?    Procedures for notifying employees that a release has occurred\n\n?    Procedures for plant evacuation and accounting of personnel\n\n?    Procedures to notify local emergency response organizations and other appropriate authorities that a release has occurred\n\n?    Guidance on proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures\n\n?    Procedures for post incident cleanup and decontamination\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nWe are continually striving to make the Inkster Terminal the safest and most reliable workplace possible for our employees, our neighbors and our community.  The facility's focus is safe, reliable, and environmentally sound operations.  The goal of the Inkster Terminal is to demonstrate continuous improvement in our health, environmental and safety performance.  In addition, we will work cooperatively with our neighbors to ensure the health, environment, safety and security of the Inkster Terminal and surrounding community.\n\n"
