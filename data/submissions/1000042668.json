      "SummaryText": "SI Group, Inc. - Texas Operations (SIG-TX) is a chemical manufacturing complex that produces various alkylphenols and is required to submit a Risk Management Plan due to the use of isobutylene and butylene as raw materials.  The site has systems in place to ensure identification and response to emergencies.  SIG-TX has never had an accident involving the release of a regulated substance that caused death, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuation, or sheltering-in-place.  The facilities are operated in strict accordance with written operating and maintenance procedures.  SIG-TX has partnered with OSHA as a Voluntary Protection Program Star Site.  The site is also certified to the Responsible Care 14001 standard, which provides a systematic focus on environmental, health, safety and security as a indicator of the importance of these issues to site and corporate management. SIG-TX has a highly trained Emergency Response Team which coordinates resources with other CAER (Community Awareness and Emergency Response)and LEPC (Local Emergency Planning Committee) members, and conducts training drills in emergency preparedness, HAZMAT training, medical response, a written emergency response plan, and fire-and-rescue techniques to ensure a safe environment for our employees and the public. SIG-TX conducts approximately 100 hours of training per year per employee in order to provide a qualified workforce. Our systems approach insures continual operational improvement by strict attention to changes in the operations through a MOC (Management of Change) process, a thorough review of potential incidents that could lead to accidental releases, and verification of effectiveness of process control."
