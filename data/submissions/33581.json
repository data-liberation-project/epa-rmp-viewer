Box 1066, East Brunswick, New Jersey 08816.  \n\nAfter reviewing the facility operations and the RMP regulations, it was determined that the entire facility is considered one process.  Plumrose USA receives meat products that have been processed off-site and slices the products for packaging.  From the time the meat products are received and throughout the processes conducted, the facility maintains a cool temperature utilizing an Ammonia (anhydrous) refrigeration process.  Based on the facility processes and applicable regulations, it was determined that the facility is subject to Program 3 of the RMP regulations.  \n\n(c) General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nProcess Safety Information - Plumrose USA will complete a compilation of written process safety information to be used in conducting the process hazard analysis (PHA).  The PHA will be conducted using the process safety information gathered in order to identify and understand the hazards posed by the Ammonia refrigeration process. This process safety "
