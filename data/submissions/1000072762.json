The fire was quickly extinguished by plant personnel and the only impact from this incident was significant on-site property damage.  Details of this incident are included in Section 6 of the RMP.  Due to the enhanced PSM/RMP program at WTG, this incident was identified as subject to RMP reporting requirements; therefore, it is being reported at this time as part of the RMP renewal.\r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\r\nWTG Benedum will continue to improve its safety and environmental performance through emphasis on the continued development of it's PSM Program.  Improvement plans include process engineering support to update critical PSI data for the site; operating procedures written for each mode of operation and to include consequences of deviations; an operator certification training program established from the new operating procedures, new process hazard analysis (PHA) procedure and team structure ensuring employee involvement, new MI program incorporating the implementation of all new inspection procedures and frequencies all to be carefully reviewed, and recommendations for improvement generated using WTG's new compliance audit process."

Promoting the health and safety of co-workers, contractors, customers, and communities is the responsibility of all WTG employees.  WTG will meet all applicable laws, rules and regulations.\r\n\r\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled:\r\nBenedum Gas Plant (Benedum), located in Midkiff, Upton County, Texas, is a natural gas liquids recovery plant that produces pipeline specification natural gas and natural gas liquids (NGL, also known as Y-grade) from low pressure field gas and high pressure natural gas collected throughout the upstream gathering system.  Benedum treats and processes flammable gas and liquid mixtures in an amount greater than the threshold quantify containing any of the following RMP-regulated constituents:\r\n\u00bf\tMethane\r\n\u00bf\tEthane\r\n\u00bf\tPropane\r\n\u00bf\tIsobutane\r\n\u00bf\tButane\r\n\u00bf\tIsopentane\r\n\u00bf\tPentane\r\n\r\nThe only RMP-regulated toxic constituent present at Benedum, which is part of the amine treating process, is hydrogen sulfide; however, quantities at this facility are well below the threshold quantity. \r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:\r\nWTG is committed to ensuring a safe work environment for all its employees, contractors, and vendors.  The Benedum Gas Plant has a detailed Emergency Action Plan and has coordinated with the community's local responders through mock emergency simulations in order to introduce the local responders to the facility and its personnel.\r\n\r\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program:\r\nThe Benedum process is covered by OSHA 29 CFR 1910.119, Process Safety Management of highly hazardous chemicals (PSM) regulation.

The PSM elements are implemented to satisfy the PSM/RMP requirements since the Benedum Gas Plant qualifies as a program level 3 RMP process.\r\n\r\nEmployee Participation:\r\nEmployee participation is the foundation block to an evergreen and integrated PSM program.  Thus, the current PSM improvement initiative is heavily focused on this key element as employees are becoming more actively involved in the implementation of each element of PSM.\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information:\r\nComprehensive reviews of the available process safety information (PSI) have been conducted.  Updates to maximum intended inventory (MII) and piping and instrumentation diagrams (P&IDs) have been completed.  A comprehensive electronic web-based system utilized for timely access to information has been built, implemented and made available to all personnel involved with operating the process.  \r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA):\r\nA new PHA team including experienced operating personnel (operations and maintenance), WTG engineers, Process Control personnel, safety representatives, and PSM representatives is planned to conduct a new PHA in October of 2018.  Results and recommendations from these analyses will be actively shared with employees.  Additionally, a process safety tracking tool has been developed and implemented for the interactive tracking of PHA action items to closure.\r\n\r\nOperating Procedures:\r\nWritten operating procedures reference PSI are available.  A written mentorship training program has been developed, implemented, and documented per employee.  A technical review of operating procedures is currently underway while also being formatted into a standard operating procedures format across WTG will be completed.  WTG will also be publishing operating procedures to the company's electronic web-based system.\r\n\r\nManagement of Change (MOC) and Pre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR):\r\nImpr"

Extensive PSSR checklists for applicable disciplines (electrical, instrumentation, procedures, etc.) have been developed and implemented.  These checklists are Appendices to the Company's MOC procedure and are available online from the company's electronic web-based process library. \r\n\r\nMechanical Integrity (MI):\r\nIn addition to the ultrasonic thickness testing program already in practice at Benedum, a complete third-party MI gap assessment has been completed.  This has resulted in the development of revised comprehensive inspection standards and procedures along with a specialized inspection program structured specifically for Benedum.\r\n\r\nIncident Investigation:\r\nWTG investigates all PSM incidents.  Throughout the PSM program assessment process, incident investigation procedures are being reviewed and will be updated as necessary.  A mix of WTG personnel will be provided investigation methodology training to further enhance the program and ensure root cause is consistently identified.  A process safety tracking tool has been developed and implemented to track action items and incident investigation corrective actions to closure.\r\n\r\nCompliance Audits:\r\nTo meet compliance with PSM/RMP, WTG conducts compliance audits every three years to verify all PSM/RMP element requirements are being satisfied.
