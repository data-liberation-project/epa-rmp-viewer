There have been no chlorine or sulfur dioxide incidents in the most recent five-year history period. \n\nThe wastewater treatment plant has initiated a project to install ultraviolet lighting as its means of achieving the required disinfectant of wastewater. This technology has been proven at many sites in North Carolina and throughout the United States. The use of ultraviolet technology  will eliminate the need to chlorine and sulfur dioxide. The project is schedule to begin operation is late 2001.\n\nIn 1994 and 1995, a Process Safety Management (PSM) program was initiated at the plant using a consulting organization. A PSM Compliance Manual was developed for the site. Key items included in the manual were:\n\n- Written site specific procedures for Employee Involvement, Management of Change, Incident Investigation, Pre-Startup Reviews and Self Audits.\n\n- Chlorine safety information as required by the regulations\n\n- Standard Operating Procedures for chlorine and sulfur dioxide management\n\n- Chlorine and sulfur dioxide systems maintenance procedures\n\nNext, these additional steps were implemented to complete the PSM program.\n\n- Training on PSM and its key components including Management of Change, Mechanical Integrity  and Incident Investigation.\n\n-Conducting  Process Hazards Analyses for the chlorine and sulfur dioxide processes\n\n-Developing an initial Emergency Response Plan\n\n-Training in support of the certification of operators\n         \nThe Superintendent and several plant operators are meeting several times per year to review and update procedures and to maintain compliance with all aspects of the RMP regulation.\n\nIn addition to RMP compliance, the chlorine and sulfur dioxide delivery systems have been upgraded to vacuum processes over the past 10 years. This process has pro"

      "SummaryText": "ven to greatly reduce leaks by reducing the amount of equipment that is exposed to pressurized chlorine.\n\nTo further understand chlorine risks, a consulting firm was contracted to conduct Offsite Consequence Modeling Analysis, as required by EPA's Risk Management Program. Both a Worst Case and an Alternative Case chlorine release scenarios were studied for each site.\n\nThe Worst Case modeling showed the potential impact of a full, 2000 pound cylinder of chlorine or sulfur dioxide released in 10 minutes. This resulting chlorine and sulfur dioxide plumes extended  0.9. miles. For the Alternative Case, a more typical possible release of 60 pounds, 3 pounds/minute for 60 minutes, was modeled. The modeling indicated that a plume extending 0.1 miles would result.\n\nThe results showed that the risk of offsite chlorine or sulfur dioxide exposure is low due to the favorable location of the plant.\n\nThe Wastewater Treatment Plant is located south of the city. All chlorine and sulfur dioxide is stored inside a building. This location will assist in any emergency by initially containing any leak. Also, due to the location of the plant, the most likely scenario would be for the chlorine or sulfur dioxide (both heavier-than-air gases) is to be contained by the bodies of water surrounding the plant. Depending on direction, a release can fall to the Neuse River and follow the river until the chlorine or sulfur dioxide cloud disperses. Alternately, the release can fall into the large equalization ponds adjacent to the plant These ponds would tend to contain a release within their banks. In addition, the river banks are covered by heavy vegetation. This fact will also significant assist to contain any leak. Thus, a chlorine or sulfur dioxide release should result in no to minimum public exposure.\n\nIn addition to Risk Management Compliance, the organization has an active safety program. The City has an active Safety Committee. The committee meets monthly and its duties include"

      "SummaryText": "reviewing new safety procedures, accident investigations, safety surveys and safety communications. The Safety Department for the City also takes an active role in supporting the Wastewater Plant Safety Program. \n\nWithin the Wastewater Plant, there are monthly safety meetings to review an OSHA subject or discuss a safety issue. Routine training is conducted for topics such as:\n\n- Hazard Communications\n\n- Personal Protective Equipment\n\n- Lockout/Tagout\n\n- Confined Space\n\nAs a result of our programs, the plants have had an excellent safety record with no recordable injuries over the past three years. As mentioned earlier, there have no reportable chlorine or sulfur dioxide releases from the plants in the last five years nor in the history of the plant. The city has worked extensively to upgrade its safety program.\n\n\nReport by:\n                                                               \nKaren Brashear\nPublic Utilities Director"
