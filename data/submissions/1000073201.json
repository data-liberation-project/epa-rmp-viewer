      "SummaryText": "OVERVIEW: The Fagerdala facility produces foam using a blowing agent, isobutane. The isobutane is stored in a 6,000 gallon pressurized vessel outside of the facility and is fed as a liquid blowing agent through a metering system into the extruder to ultimately form a foam.   \n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response: The facility has a written Emergency Response Plan and Operating Procedures that include steps for emergency shutdown. Training and drills are conducted on the ERP per the policy document.\n\n \n\nRegulated Substances Handled: Fargerdala stores up to 6,000 gallons of isobutane.\n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps: Controls in place include grounding rods, static dissipation, interlocks, gas monitoring, and fire suppression. The facility also has multiple means of detecting an accidental release before a catastrophic event could occur, including routine inspections and detectors. The facility complies with applicable OSHA requirements, including 29 CFR 1910.119 (PSM).\n\n\n\nFive-Year Accident History: Fargerdala has not had an accident within the last 5 years.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program: The ERP includes designed roles and responsibilities for employees during an emergency, general plant safety rules, routine training and drills, inspections of safety equipment, incident reporting requirements, spill response procedures, and natural disaster procedures.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety: There are no current plans to improve safety. The facility is committed to a continual improvement model.\n\n"
