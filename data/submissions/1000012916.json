Presently the average daily flow is 10-MGD, design flow is 13-MGD.\n\nThe St. Cloud WWTF uses chlorine to disinfect the discharge effluent to the Mississippi River.  Chlorine is also used for process control measures.  Sulfur dioxide is used at the St. Cloud WWTF to eliminate the chlorine residual of the effluent before it reaches the Mississippi River.  The St. Cloud WWTF stores a maximum of 24,000-lbs of chlorine and 8,000-lbs of sulfur dioxide, both volumes are greater than the threshold limits stated is 40 CFR Part 68 and OSHA 29 CFR Part 1910.120 regulations.\n\nA requirement of the RMP is an Off-Site Analysis Assessment of the potential impacts of a worst-case and alternate-case release scenarios.  An assessment of these scenarios is included with the RMP documents.  There have been no reportable accidents at the St. Cloud WWTF in the last five years.\n\nActive administrative and mitigation control measures are utilized to prevent an accidental release.  Chlorine and sulfur dioxide gas detectors are in place and checked monthly.  An audible alarm will sound if chlorine gas or sulfur dioxide gas leak is detected.  An accidental release of chlorine gas would take place in a fire and explosion proof building, slowing the release rate and decreasing the distance of travel.  \n\nThe goal of the Prevention Program is to reduce the risk of an accidental release of chlorine or sulfur dioxide gas and prevent injury to the surrounding public and WWTF empl"

      "SummaryText": "oyees.  This is accomplished by specifying responsibilities and outlining safety procedures that will prevent and/or contain a chlorine or sulfur dioxide gas release.\n\nThe St. Cloud WWTF has an Emergency Action Plan (EAP) to comply with Federal Regulations 40 CFR 1910.38(a).  New employees are given EAP training. The EAP is reviewed annually for all other employees.\n\nIn accordance with the Risk Management Plan, the St. Cloud WWTF has a written procedure to respond to hazardous materials spills including chlorine and sulfur dioxide gas. \n\nThe purpose of the EAP is to ensure the safety and well being of the users of the wasteawater treatment system and St. Cloud Public Utilities employees during times of emergency operations.  The plan identifies necessary administrative and employee actions during emergencies.  It does not cover all possible crisis or emergencies that may occur, but the actions indicated in the plan will assist in any type of emergency. \n\nElements addressed in the EAP include escape procedures and exit routes, critical plant operations, accounting for employees, rescue and medical duties, reporting emergencies, alarm systems and notification of emergencies and types of evacuations.\n\nThe Public Utilities Administration is committed to safety by providing annual employee right to know, bloodborne pathogen, lock out - tag out, emergency action plan, risk management plan and confined space entry procedure training.  Administration supports regular Hazard Control Meetings and Monthly City Safety Committee Meetings and provides personal protection equipment to all employees.  The City of St. Cloud will continue to make safety a high priority and is committed to employee training and improving the current safety policies and programs."
