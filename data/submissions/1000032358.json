If an accidental release should occur, the Facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment. A detailed Consolidated Emergency Response/Contingency Plan (CCP) has been developed and will be implemented in the event of an accidental release.\n\n\n\nES - 2.0  FACILITY INFORMATION\n\n?*  The Facility is a retail agricultural facility whose primary activity is the storage and sale of fertilizers in addition to the sale of pre-packaged agricultural chemicals to agricultural operations in Northern California.\n\n\n\n?*  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and converted to aqua ammonia. The aqua ammonia is stored, dispensed, and distributed for application as crop production nutrient. \n\n\n\n?*  Anhydrous ammonia is received by truck (and intermittently, by railcar) and stored in four storage tanks (bullets). The bullets have the following liquid (water) capacities\n\n\n\nVessel           Vessel Capacity     Maximum Volume      Amount of NH3 \n\nBullet 1         15,000 gals             12,750 gals                65,535 lbs\n\nBullet 2         18,000 gals             15,300 gals                78,642 lbs\n\nBullet 3         14,000 gals             10,200 gals                52,428 lbs\n\nBullet 4         12,000 gals             11,900 gals                61,166 lbs\n\nTotals           59,000 gals             50,150 gals               257,771 lbs\n\n\n\nThe maximum amount of anhydrous ammonia on site is 257,771 lbs.\n\n\n\n??

The most recent review of safety information pertaining to the covered processes took place on March 25, 2016. \n\n\n\nHazard Review:  A hazard review of the regulated processes is conducted every five years or as needed by changes in the processes. The most recent update of the hazard review was conducted on September 29, 2016. Results indicate that no high risk hazards were identified through the hazard review update.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures:  Written standard operating procedures have been developed for the covered processes and are reviewed and revised as needed. The operating procedures were last reviewed on March 25, 2016.\n\n\n\nTraining:  The Supply Division Facility staff, and Butte County Rice Growers Association corporate staff, understand that incidents involving the accidental release of regulated substances can be reduced by having trained operations and maintenance staff. A training program, which incorporates specific operating procedures and safe work practices, is an essential element of an effective prevention program.

The maintenance program includes equipment inspection, preventative maintenance, recordkeeping, and training. The latest equipment inspections were conducted on March 25, 2016. The most recent review of maintenance procedures was conducted on March 25, 2016.\n\n\n\nRMP Change Management:  Operation, safety, and environmental issues must be reviewed prior to initiation of a process change to ensure that they do not compromise the operational safety and integrity of the Anhydrous Ammonia Process, and to minimize adverse effects to worker safety and public health. The Facility RMP Change Management (RMPCM) procedures are used to evaluate all changes to process materials, controls, equipment, and procedures.\n\n\n\nPre-startup Review:  The pre-startup review applies to additions or modifications to the Anhydrous Ammonia Process that require the safety information to be revised or updated. Whenever changes in affected processes are identified or planned, they must be evaluated as to the need for a pre-startup safety review. This assessment is undertaken in conjunction with the RMPCM review. Additionally, a pre-startup safety review is performed in conjunction with the RMPCM review when the proposed change requires modifications to the safety procedures.\n\n\n\nCompliance Audits:  Periodic compliance audits to assess the effectiveness of the written plan must be conducted every three years.
