Agrium encourages employees to read, review and provide comments on all PSM/RMP documents.  \n\n\tHot Work Permits\n\tHot work is defined as work that could generate a flame, intense heat, or sparks as a result of electric or gas welding, cutting, blazing, abrasions or similar operations.  A permit is required for all work to be conducted in the terminal except for the machine shop.\n\nAgrium is committed to the implementation of the RPP to ensure safe operations of its plant and to prevent accident. \n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nAgrium has an Emergency Response Program (ERP) in place to respond to releases of hazardous material at this facility.  All Agrium employees are part of the emergency response team together with the local fire department and LEPC.  All Agrium employees are trained in emergency response procedures, first aid and CPR.  \n\nAgrium is working closely with the local fire and LEPC in responding to emergency.  Agrium also keeps the fire department informed of any new hazardous materials that are introduced into the workplace.  The other outside agencies that will be involved in responding to emergencies at Agrium include the County Sheriff, Highway Patrol, local hospital, and outside contractors that are needed for such operations as containment, cleanup, material handling, etc.\n\nAll reportable releases of hazardous material"

The audit team will include one person knowledgeable in audit skills and techniques and team members with appropriate technical expertise.  \n\t\n\tManagement of Change (MOC)\n\tAgrium's MOC system was developed to ensure that changes at Agrium will not result in undetected unsafe situations and employees will be aware of all changes and their implications.  The Agrium's MOC system includes the following considerations before any changes take place:\n\t\n\t- the authorization requirements for the change.\n\t- the technical basis for the proposed change\n- the impact of the change on health and safety.\n- the necessary time for the change.\n- required modification to Operating Procedures.\n\t\n\tAfter changes are made, all employees will be informed about the change and training will be provided to the employees prior to startup of the modified process.

      "SummaryText": "implemented an RMP program at the Garner Terminal and submitted an RMP to EPA in 1999.  The Agrium's risk management program includes an offsite consequence analysis of a potential accidental release, a five-year accident history, a release prevention program, and an emergency response program.\n\nThe RMP rules required that the RMP be updated at least every five years.  Agrium is updating the RMP for the Garner Terminal to comply with the rules.  However, offsite consequence analysis was not discussed in this Executive Summary as it was not required by the revised RMP rules published in CFR on April 9, 2004.\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nThe five-year accident history involves an examination of the effects of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the five years prior to the RMP update.  The five-year accident history covers:\n\n\t- the release of ammonia from Agrium's facility.\n\t- the release that caused at least one of the following:\n\t\t- On site deaths, injuries, or significant property damage (40 CFR\n\t\t  part 68.42(a)); or\n\t\t- known offsite deaths, injuries, property damage, environmental \n\t\t  damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place (40 CFR Part 68.42\n\t\t  (a)).\n\nDuring the last five years, the Garner Terminal has had no releases that caused death, injuries, property damage, or environmental damage either on or off site.\n\nRelease Prevention Program\n\nAgrium has a Release Prevention Program (RPP) in placed to prevent accidental releases of hazardous materials at this facility.

      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\nAgrium U.S. Inc.\nGarner Terminal\n\nBackground\n\nAgrium U.S. Inc. Garner Terminal receives anhydrous ammonia from pipeline and dispenses anhydrous ammonia to tank trucks for fertilizer application.  Both of the transfer processes are accomplished with ammonia transfer pumps.  The Garner Terminal also stores liquid anhydrous ammonia in a pressure vessel within its facility.  \n\nThe liquid anhydrous ammonia stored in the pressure vessel is pressurized under atmospheric temperature.  The pressure vessel has a capacity of 165 tons.  As the results, the maximum amount of anhydrous ammonia that could be stored in the Garner Terminal is 155 tons.  \n\nRationale for Risk Management Program Development, Implementation, and Update\n\nThe 1990 Amendments to the Clean Air Act (CAA) require Environmental protection Agency EPA) to issue a rule specifying the type of actions to be taken by facilities to prevent accidental releases of substances into the atmosphere and reduce their potential impact on the public and the environment.  As the results of the 1990 Amendments, EPA issued the Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions (part 68 of Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR)) that requires affected facilities to develop and implement a risk management program.  The affected facilities include any facilities that handle, manufacture, store, or use above the specified threshold quantities of toxic substances in a process, including ammonia.  The threshold quantities for ammonia to trigger the development and implementation of a risk management program are 10,000 pounds.\n\nThe risk management program is designed to prevent accidental releases of substances that can cause serious harm to the public and the environment from short-term exposures and to mitigate the severity of releases that does occur. Since Agrium is handling more than 10,000 pounds of ammonia, it is required to develop and implement a risk management program.  To comply with the RMP rules, Agrium"
