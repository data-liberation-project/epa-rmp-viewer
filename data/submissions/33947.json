The OLS Energy-Chino Cogeneration Facility (Cogeneration Facility) also uses ammonia for reducing the emissions of nitric oxide from the steam generator exhaust. The Cogeneration Facility's ammonia handling process is subject to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program and Plan and also to the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program.  These Programs require the following information in the executive summary of the Risk Management Plan:\n\n? Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies.\n? General facility and regulated substances information.\n? Offsite consequence analysis results.\n? Summary of the accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps.\n? Five-year accident history summary.\n? Emergency response program summary.\n? Planned changes to improve safety.\n\nThe above information for the OLS Energy-Chino Cogeneration Facility is provided below.\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe OLS Energy-Chino Cogeneration Facility accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates proven technology, trains staff in operation and maintenance practices, and uses tested and proven management system practices.  All applicable procedures of the State of California and EPA's Prevention Program are adhered, including key elements such as training, systems management, and emergency response procedures.  The Cogeneration Facility is a non-responding facility, which means that the facility employees will not respond to accidental release.  Instead, the facility has coordinated with local response agencies (Chino Fire Valley Fire Department) to respond to any ammonia release that may occur at the facility.

The Cogeneration Facility has an excellent record in preventing accidents from occurring.\n\nGeneral Facility and Regulated Substance Information\n\nThe Cogeneration Facility, operating since 1988, is located at 5601 Eucalyptus Avenue in the City of Chino, in San Bernardino County.  Ammonia is used for the reduction of nitric oxide from the steam generator  exhaust.  Ammonia is stored in a bulk storage tank, which is designed to hold 10,936 gallons of ammonia.  However, operating procedures (administrative control) specify that maximum quantity of ammonia in the tank should be 85% of the tank design capacity.  This ammonia storage exceeds the listed threshold quantities in the EPA and CalARP RMP rules.  It also exceeds the listed threshold quantities in the federal and California Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Standards.\n\nAmmonia is brought to the Cogeneration Facility and transferred to the bulk ammonia storage tank.  The tank is equipped with an electrically heated vaporizer to maintain adequate vaporization and constant pressure in the storage tank during ammonia withdrawal. Vaporized ammonia is withdrawn from the tank and diluted with ambient air prior to injection into the plant's Heat Recovery Steam Generator (HRSG) Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) zone.  The ammonia system contains the following instrumentation and controls to ensure safe operation of the system:\n\nStorage Tank Fill and Outlet Lines: Excess flow check valves (EFCV) are installed in the storage tank nozzles for the vapor return line, inlet and outlet lines of the vaporizer, drain line, and vapor supply line.  The EFCV closes the line in the event of a break to minimize the escape of ammonia to the atmosphere.  \nLeak Detectors: Two ammonia detectors are installed near the stora"

A signal is sent to a local audible alarm and remotely to the DCS located in the Control Room.\n\nStorage Tank: The tank is equipped with high pressure and high high-pressure alarms.  A water deluge system is available to cool the tank and reduce the pressure.  In addition, the tank is provided with a dual pressure relief valve to protect the tank integrity during overpresurization.\n\nAmmonia Vaporizer: High pressure or high temperature will shut down the vaporizer heater.  The vaporizer is also provided with a pressure relief valve.\n\nAmmonia Dilution System: To prevent ammonia concentrations in the dilution air stream from reaching explosive limits, power or blower failure will cause a flow control valve to close; thus stopping the ammonia flow from the storage tank.\n\nThe Cogeneration Facility is also provided with an emergency generator, which will be operational in 5 to 10 minutes on loss of main source of power.  \n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis Results\n\nThe offsite consequence analysis includes consideration of two ammonia release scenarios, identified as \"worst-case release scenario\" and \"alternative release scenario\". The first scenario is defined by EPA, which states that \"the owner or operator shall assume that the ... maximum quantity in the largest vessel ... is released as a gas over 10-minutes,\" due to an unspecified failure. The alternative scenario is defined as \"more likely to occur than the worst-case release scenario\".\n\nPlease refer to Off-Site Consequence (OCA) data on site at OLS Energy - Chino Cogeneration Facility.\n\nSummary of the Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe Cogeneration Facility is in compliance with Federal and State Process Safety Management requirements.

This PHA was updated in April 1999 and again in June 2004.

This PHA was further reviewed in April 1999 and again in June of 2004 under the RMP and CalARP program requirements.  Based on this PHA review, three additional recommendations were made to improve the safety of the ammonia process.  It is expected that the recommended actions will be evaluated and implemented by August 2004.  The implementation of these recommendations will further improve the safety of the ammonia system."
