The water plant utilizes coagulation, settling, filtration, and chemical feed processes to treat approximately 10 million gallons of water per day, the source of which is an on-site reservoir.\n\nOne of the chemicals which is used by the plant is chlorine.  Chlorine is used to disinfect the water at various locations in the treatment process including dosing of the finished water as it leaves the treatment plant. Chlorine is used as a gas but stored under pressure as a liquid in 2000 pound containers.  The plant has up to 60,000 pounds (30 containers) of chlorine on-site. The chlorine, drawn from a common pipe header under vacuum for additional safety, is added at a prescribed dosage rate into the water by means of a rotometer on the chlorinator, which the operator can adjust to respond to changes in water quality.\n\nAs the Williams Water Treatment Plant has more than 2500 pounds of chlorine on-site, it must comply with the provisions of EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP).  Also, as North Carolina is an OSHA Plan State, the plant is subject to Prevention Program 3 requirements.  Additionally, the plant is subject to OSHA's Process Safety Management Program (chlorine limit of 1500 pounds).\n\nThe City is committed to reducing the risk to its employees and the public of injury from the accidental release of chemicals, including chlorine gas.  This commitment is exhibited through an extensive employee training and safety program, continuing maintenance on process equipment, emergency response coordination such as drills with local emergency responders, public education,"

In addition to the vacuum delivery system which stops the flow of chlorine gas in the event of a piping or equipment failure, the chlorine container storage area and the chlorinator room are continuous monitored for any possible chlorine leaks.  If a leak should occur, the operator is notified immediately through an alarm system.  \n\nAll major chlorination components are backed-up with on-line redundant equipment.  \n\nAll water treatment plant operators are trained in the handling and administering of chlorine.  This training includes the use of chlorination and safety equipment, identification of potential hazards, and response to accidental releases of chlorine gas.  \n\nThe plant has a detailed Emergency Response Plan which outlines the response measures to be taken by plant personnel in the event of a chlorine leak.  Plant personnel have been trained in the use of equipment to correct small-scale leaks.  This training also includes the recognition of when additional assistance from local emergency responders such as the City HAZMAT squad is needed to correct the problem and notify the immediate public if necessary.\n\nCity personnel including management, operators, and maintenance have conducted a process hazard analysis (PHA), a brainstorming session to identify possible chlorine release situations, causes, consequences, and identify (or recommend) safeguards and corrective actions to prevent the release from occuring.  This analysis involved situations ranging from the container rupture during delivery, to chlorine equipment failure, to acts of nature.  Any deficiencies in the response to a release situation were identified and a plan of action was formed to resolve the deficiency.\n\nUnder EPA's Risk Management Pro"

      "SummaryText": "gram, the City applied EPA's computer program \"RMP*Comp\" to determine the off-site impacts of a release of chlorine.  Two scenarios were modeled.  The first scenario modeled a worst-case release condition, with model parameters and criteria set by EPA.  \n\nUnder the worst-case scenario of the release of 200 pounds of chlorine per minute for ten minutes, an impact area of 1.3 miles around the treatment plant was identified.  This radius represents the distance the chlorine vapor cloud will travel before dissipating to a point that serious injury from short term exposure will no longer occur.  Public receptors in this area include an estimated residential population of 9831 people as well as churches, hospitals, Duke University, a college, grade schools, shopping centers, and recreational areas.  The area also includes Interstate 85 and Routes 70 and 147 and the Southern Railway.\n\nNo environmental receptors meeting EPA criteria (ie. national or state parks, forests, monuments, and officially designated federal wildlife santuaries, preserves, refuges, or areas that can be identified on local U.S. Geological Survey maps) were identified within the worst-case impact area.  \n\nA release of chlorine under the worst-case scenario is very unlikely.  The City has a number of preventive measures in place to minimize the likelihood of such a large release including standard operating procedures and continuing training of employees on the use of container unloading equipment (the time at which a worst case scenario is most likely to occur). \n\nTo reflect a more likely release situation, the City also modeled an alternative release.  Under the alternative release scenario an impact area of less than a 0.1 mile radius was identified.  The alternative situation involved the release of chlorine within the storage room due to a failure in the common pipe header or container piping and valves (before the vacuum regulator).  The impact radius of the alternative release scenario was reduce"

This can be directly attributed to plant personnel's high level of effort toward safe chlorine handling and use.\n\nAs noted, the Emergency Response Plan for the plant includes provisions for emergency medical treatment and  procedures for the summoning of outside assistance for a large chlorine leak.  Outside assistance is provided by the City of Durham Fire Department and the City HAZMAT Team.  Outside responders are familiar with the plant chlorination system and have recently completed an on-site training  in conjunction with plant personnel.  The emergency responders will be responsible for a majority of public notification in the event of a chlorine release (the City will make the first contact with the golf course and Duke Public Safety).\n\nThe City of Durham is in the process of the conversion of the chlorination system at the Williams Water Treatment Plant from chlorine gas to liquid sodium hypochlorite.  Similar work at a later date will also be completed at the City's Brown Water Treatment Plant.  The construction of sodium hypochlorite system at the Williams Plant is scheduled to be completed in late 1999.  The conversion to sodium hypochlorite at each plant will eliminate all off-site public and environmental impacts of a gas release and increase the level of safety for palnt personnel as well.  Following the conversion, the provisions of the Risk Management Plan will no longer apply for either treatment plant."
