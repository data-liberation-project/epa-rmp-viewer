Facility Policy.\n\nThe owners, management and employees of United Suppliers, Inc.(the facility) are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the Mills County LEPC, local fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate and minimize the impacts of the release to the people and the environment.  \n\n2.  FACILITY INFORMATION.    The primary activity at this location is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to Retail Agriculture Dealers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received and blended into liquid grade fertilizers.  This blending operation normally takes place for approximately a week in the early spring and a week in the late fall.   This blending operation is performed by a T-Reactor.  The T-Reactor is a process of combining anhydrous ammonia, phosphorous and water.   Phosphorous is supplied as wet-process superphosphoric acid.  The standard grades produced by this process are 10-34-00 and 11-37-00.  The maximum  quantity of anhydrous ammonia on hand during the blending operation would be approximately 130,000 pounds.\n\n3. Worst-Case Scenario and Alternate Release Scenario\n\na. The worst-case scenario would be the release of the total contents of the storage tank released as gas over a period of 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 130,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards and administrative contols.  The distance to the end point (point of dispersion to 200 parts per million, or ppm) is 1.1 miles.  \n\nb. The alternate release scenario,  is a release from a break in a 3-inch transfer hose followed by release of ammonia for 2 minutes before an automatic or manual shut-off intervenes and stops the flow of"

Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe facility has been reviewed for general compliance with the provisions of Safety Requirements for the Storage and handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1, published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc. (ANSI), and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, Storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia.  The ANSI Standard has been adopted by reference by Iowa Administrative Code Part 21-Chapter 43-Rule 43.6(200)-Standard for the storage and  handling of anhydrous ammonia.  The OSHA standard is referenced in this RMP Registration Form, see Section 8.3.(b).\n\n5. Five-Year Accident History\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that: have caused any deaths, injuries or significant property damage at the facility; nor to our knowledge, has there been any releases which resulted in off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.  \n\n6. Emergency Action Program.\n\nThe facility has:\n\n  a.    a written Emergency Action Plan, in accordance with OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.38;\n\n  b.     provided state and local authorities with the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III   (EPCRA).\n\n  \n7.  Safety.\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no additional specific safety recommendations regarding storage or use of anhydrous ammonia for implementation at this time."
