      "SummaryText": "Risk Management Plan Executive Summary\nEquistar Chemicals, LP\nLaPorte Complex\n\n1. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nEquistar is committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program in place that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with our processes.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, our trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  We are also coordinated with Channel Industries Mutual Aid which provides additional emergency response expertise.\n\n2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe LaPorte plant's primary activities encompass olefins and polymer and resins manufacturing.  The LaPorte plant manufactures or utilizes 7 regulated substances; butadiene, isobutane, butene, butane, ethylene, acetaldehyde, and vinyl acetate monomer. \n\n3. The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\n\nMethodology given in the RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance by the EPA using tables and equations has been employed to perform worst and alternative case release scenarios.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 3 toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from vinyl acetate monomer storage in the polymers and resins manufacturing process.  The scenario involves the release of approximately 2,600 pounds of vinyl acetate monomer.  Under worst case weather conditions, the maximum distance of approximately 0.4 miles is obtained corresponding to an endpoint of 0.26 mg"

The scenario involves the release of approximately 3,000,000 pounds of butadiene.  It is assumed that the entire quantity is released as a vapor, which finds an ignition source, with 10 percent of the released quantity participating in a vapor cloud explosion.  Under worst case weather conditions, the maximum distance of approximately 1.2 miles is obtained corresponding to an endpoint of 1 psi overpressure.  \n\nThe alternative release scenario submitted for Program 3 toxic substances involves a release from vinyl acetate monomer storage in the polymers and resins manufacturing process.  The release is assumed to result from a piping failure.  The scenario involves the release of approximately 10,000 pounds of vinyl acetate monomer in 31 minutes.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance of approximately 0.30 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.26 mg/l.\n\nThe alternative release scenario submitted for Program 3 flammable substances involves a release from the 1-butene railcar unloading station located in the polymers and resin manufacturing process.  The release is assumed to result from a piping failure.  The scenario involves the release of approximately 55,000 pounds of butene. Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance of approximately 0.20 miles is obtained corresponding to an endpoint of 1 psi overpressure.  \n\n4. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe LaPorte plant has taken the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR Part 68.
