The refining process is very complex and involves the use of flammable materials and various chemicals. Silver Eagle takes every precaution to ensure that flammable materials and chemicals are handled and stored safely and in accordance with industry standards. Employees are trained so that they can safely do their jobs and protect human health and the environment.\n\nOne of the main products produced at the refinery is gasoline. Gasoline must meet seasonal specification in order to be marketed. One of the specifications is Reid Vapor Pressure (RVP). The vapor pressure of the gasoline is crucial to proper ignition. Butane can be utilized to make gasoline meet the required RVP specifications. Butane also enhances the gasoline octane characteristics. \n\nSilver Eagle has installed equipment to unload butane railcars and trucks into its gasoline blending system. The butane unloading system has been installed to meet National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) and American Petroleum Institute (API) standards. This system includes emergency shut off valves, check valves to prevent back flow and excess flow valves that shut off automatically in case of an unloading hose failure. Unloading procedures have been developed to meet Department of Transportation (DOT) requirements. Refinery personnel are routinely trained about unloading procedures.\n\nIn conjunction with the butane unloading system, Silver Eagle has prepared a Risk Management Plan in accordance with federal regulations (40 CFR Part 68).
