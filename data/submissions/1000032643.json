The facility is staffed year-round and also employs a large seasonal workforce during certain portions of the year; the timing is dependent on berry variety and harvest seasons.  The plant produces fresh and frozen fruit, purees, and concentrates. In 2007 the facility installed a system with over the threshold quantity (TQ) of anhydrous ammonia. Two other systems (used during summer production) are located onsite, however, both are under TQ and are not located so as to be affected by the other systems.\n\n\n\nChemical of Concern\n\nThe facility uses anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant in a closed-loop system to cool, freeze and store fruit products.  Ammonia is the safest refrigerant available and has excellent warning properties; it is extremely pungent at levels far below dangerous concentrations. Ammonia is contained in 3 separate systems in the facility. The areas are not co-located and have no connecting pipes.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program \n\nThe facility implements a prevention program to comply with the requirements of the Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (OAR 1910.119), which is designed to prevent accidental releases of all chemicals held in quantities over given thresholds.  The PSM program addresses all required elements including employee participation, process safety information and system drawings, operating procedures, hot work permits, management of change, mechanical integrity, training, pre-startup review, compliance audits, process hazard analysis, contractor safety, incident investigation and emergency response.  The system h"

      "SummaryText": "as built in safety features including high level controls and indicators, pressure relief valves, automatic and manually controlled valves and shutoffs, check valves, multiple leak detectors and emergency shutdown devices. System operation is monitored by a modern computer system 24/7.\n\n\n\nThe system is appropriately designed, maintained, and operators are trained to minimize the risk of releases.  Management is committed to maintaining a safe facility.\n\n\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nPer the requirements of 40 CFR 68.42, facilities must include a five-year accident history for all accidental releases from covered processes that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.  There have been no such accidents at this facility in the past five years.\n\n\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nThe facility maintains a written emergency response plan per OAR 437-002-1910.120 to facilitate safe response to potentially uncontrolled ammonia releases.  The plan identifies personnel designated and trained to conduct the necessary duties during a response.  Responsibilities include notification of and communication with local responders and authorities, coordinating and conducting responses, as well as maintenance of emergency equipment and trained personnel. Evacuation alarms are installed throughout the facility.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nSafety at the facility is improved continuously through the process hazard analysis process, safety meetings, employee suggestions, accident, incident and near-miss investigations, and as the result of internal and external audits and inspections. Upgrades will be planned on an ongoing basis as needed to keep the system in safe working order.\n\n"
