The paint line utilizes Alodine 47S which is used to pre-treat the aluminum prior to painting. \n\nPaint Pre-Treatment Overview \n\nIn order to comply with the American Architectural Manufacturers Association (AAMA) 2605 and U.S. Military,Mil-C-5541 standards, Sierra Aluminum uses Alodine 47S, manufactured by Henkel Surface Technologies, which contains 19% to 20% Hydrogen Fluoride in the aluminum pre treatment stage. AAMA 2605 and Mil-C-5541 require a chromate pre-treatment process to meet their corrosion and durability requirements. Alodine 47S is a coating that is applied to the surface of the extruded aluminum prior to painting the aluminum. Worst case scenario in our example would be a breach of the largest vessel, a drum containing 470 lbs. of 20% HF Solution.\n\nThe equations used are in Appendix D of the Risk Management Program Guidance for Offsite Consequence Analysis. See Excel Spread Sheet for Values.\n\nDrum contains: H2O = 373.61 lbs.\n                       HF    = 96.39 lbs.\n\nSpill would take place in the building with a volume of 2940000 FT?. at 25 deg C. \n\nThe toxic end point of one tenth the IDLH of 30 = 3 ppm our analysis indicates a ppm of no greater than 2.25 at the building perimeter. This would qualify our process as a "
