This process consists of interconnected equipment and piping to which the prevention program is common and applied equally.  Several common types of safeguards such as process gas detection systems, relief and vent systems, and automatic shutdown systems are provided throughout the process.  For efficiency, the process is subdivided into several areas for conducting Process Hazard Analyses (PHAs).  The timing of these PHAs of the process sections are different as follows:  100 Area - 04/2009, 150 Area - 10/2004, 200 Area - 12/2005, 250 / HCIN - 03/2006.",
