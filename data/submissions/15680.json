If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to notify the Mondovi Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency.\n\nMondovi Foods is processor of Pet Food related products. We use propane for back-up power supply. The pilot on the vaporizer is lit in December and stay lit until April. When the local Gas Company inform us that there will be a power interruption, we will use the propane for back-up power supply. Normally, the power can be interrupted from 6 to 48 hours. The propane tank at this facility has a 15,000 gallon capacity. The tanks are normally filled to half of its capacity.\n\nOur worst case- scenario is failure of the 15,000 gallon storage tank resulting in a vapor cloud explosion. The resulting distance to the endpoint is .18 miles. There are public receptors within this distance. Our alternative case scenario is determine to be identical to the worse case scenario, the difference will be maximum computed release rates. The estimated population within the endpoint is 300.\n\nMondovi Foods complies with the EPA's accident prevention rule and all applicable state and local codes and regulations. The propane system is designed, installed and maintained in accordance with NFPA-58.\n\nWe have had one incident in the past five years. The incident did not result in any deaths, injury, property damage or harm to the environment.\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving our propane system, it is our policy to notify the Mondovi Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency. We have discussed this policy with the fire department; and they are familiar with our propane system."
