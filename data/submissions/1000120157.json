      "SummaryText": "fication\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system at Cali-Cold Storage consists of vessels, equipment, and valves which are interconnected by piping. As such, the refrigeration system at Cali-Cold Storage is treated as a single process.\n\n1.3.1 General \n\nWe inform our employees engaged in process operations of the dangers of an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia in annual safety meetings. During these meeting we also discuss preventative measures, such as evacuation, in order to be prepared for a release.\n\nCali-Cold Storage has also conducted an off-site consequence analysis of worst-case and alternative release scenarios for the ammonia refrigeration process. These are for the purposes of informing the public in the event of an accidental release. The results of the analyses are reported in PSMWriter and hard copy binders. \n\n1.3.2 Anhydrous Ammonia\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration process at the Cali-Cold Storage facility is an integral part of the overall business and operates most of the year. It is extremely important that this process is maintained and operated in a safe and efficient manner. Management is committed to making sure that employees are made aware of the potential danger of an ammonia leak.\n\nOur refrigeration personnel monitor the ammonia refrigeration process and keep records of all procedures and transactions that pertain to ammonia. In addition, the process is checked frequently by one of the outside refrigeration contractors that we use. \n\n1.4 Five Year Accident Histor\ny\nCali-Cold Storage has had no accidental release within the last five (5) years.\n\n1.5 Emergency Action and Response Plan\n\nCali-Cold Storage\u0092s emergency action and response program has been developed to satisfy the following requirements:\n- Cal/OSHA\u0092s Emergency Action Plan \u0096 Title 8 CCR \u00a73220\n- U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration\u0092s (OSHA) Emergency Action Plans \u0096 Title 29 CFR \u00a71910.38\n- Cal/OSHA\u0092s Process Safety Management [Emergency Response Program Requirements] \u0096 Title 8"

In lieu of responding to accidental releases, Cali - Cold Storage is implementing the following protocols:\nThe facility is included in the community emergency response plan developed under Title 42 USC \u00a711003.\nSince the only regulated chemicals at the facility are flammable substances, Cali - Cold Storage coordinates emergency response actions with the local fire department. This line should only be kept if the facility is only subject to the program because of flammable substances.\nAppropriate mechanisms are in place to notify emergency responders when there is a need for a response.\nAnnual emergency response coordination activities are performed (Section 1.5.1).\nAnnual notification exercises are performed (Section 1.5.2).\n\n1.5.1 Emergency Response Coordination Activities\n\nThe purpose of emergency response coordination activities is to coordinate response needs with local emergency planning and response organizations. The intent is for local response organizations to be made aware of the regulated substances at Cali - Cold Storage, their quantities, the risks presented by the covered processes, and the resources and capabilities at our facility to respond to an accidental release of a regulated substance.

The coordination records will include the names of individuals involved and their contact information (phone number, email address, and organizational affiliations), dates of coordination activities, and nature of coordination activities.\n\nThe disclosure of information classified or restricted by the Department of Defense or other Federal agencies or contractors of such agencies is controlled by applicable laws, regulations, or executive orders concerning the release of that classified or restricted information.\n\n1.5.2 Emergency Response Notification Exercises\n\nAt least once per calendar year, Cali - Cold Storage will conduct an exercise of the facility\u0092s emergency response notifications mechanism. The facility will record each notification exercise utilizing PSMWriter.\n\nAlternatively, the facility may meet the notification requirements through other exercises conducted to meet other Federal, state or local requirements, provided that the necessary notification is performed. Additionally, if a notification is made in response to an accidental release, this would also satisfy the notification requirement.\n\n1.6 Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nCali-Cold Storage has implemented many policies and procedures to promote overall plant, worker and public safety. Nevertheless, Cali-Cold Storage continually strives to improve in all areas, including safety.\n\nBy utilizing PSMWriter software, all necessary employees have access to every aspect of the RMP-PSM program.

In addition, PSMWriter tracks all RMP-PSM related events so that Cali-Cold Storage\u0092s management team can ensure that the RMP-PSM program is being implemented.\n\nCali-Cold Storage has implemented all aspects of the RMP-PSM program. When a RMP-PSM program requirement is completed (i.e. mechanical integrity inspection, process hazard analysis, compliance audit, etc.) any specific action items related to that event are entered into PSMWriter, assigned a responsible person, and given a due date. Once the action item has been completed, the resolution can be documented using PSMWriter as well. A list of current or past due action items can be accessed at any time by those with access to PSMWriter.\n\nIn addition to utilizing PSMWriter to create, schedule, track, and document events, Cali-Cold Storage has also entered into a contract with Resource Compliance to obtain help with RMP-PSM program implementation.\n\nFor the future, Cali-Cold Storage now thinks of the RMP-PSM program as a \u0093living document\u0094. It is an interactive framework that guides safe action for Cali-Cold Storage employees, but allows for feedback and continual improvement. Through the RMP-PSM program Cali-Cold Storage will continue to maintain overall plant worker and public safety."
