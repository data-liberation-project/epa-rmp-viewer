Multistar Industries, Inc. also transfers Trimethylamine (TMA) from rail cars to cargo tank trailers for delivery to an off-site consignee.   Anhydrous Ammonia (NH3) and Trimethylamine (TMA) are the only Process Safety Management and Risk Management Planning regulated substances present at the Multistar Industries, Inc. Othello, Washington facility.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:\n\n\n\nMultistar Industries, Inc. is committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  Our comprehensive accidental release prevention program covers the design, installation, operation and maintenance of the Anhydrous Ammonia.  It is our policy to implement appropriate control measures to prevent possible releases of anhydrous ammonia and Trimethylamine.  Unforeseeable, if such a release does occur, our highly trained personnel are available to mitigate the effects of the incident.  We are also completely coordinated with the Adams County Volunteer Fire Department.\n\n\n\nWorst Case Release Scenario and the Alternative Case Release Scenario:\n\n\n\nThe Worst Case and Alternative Case release scenarios were developed using the methodologies provided in the EPA's RMP Comp and Marplot 5.1.1 software programs.  \n\n\n\nThe Worst Case Release Scenario for anhydrous ammonia involves the presumed rupture of the largest storage tank, a stationary tank containing 160,000 pounds of liquid anhydrous ammonia, due to a railroad switching accident where an inbound tank car is derailed and punctures the stationary tank.  The Worst Case Release Scenario for Trimethylamine involves the presumed rupture of a rail car containing 156,988 pounds of Trimethylamine due to a railroad switching accident where an inbound tank car is derailed and punctures a Trimethylamine tank car located on the rail siding.\n\n\n\nThe"

      "SummaryText": " Alternative Case Release Scenario for anhydrous ammonia involves the presumed failure of a transfer hose during the loading of a truck cargo tank.  The scenario assumes that when the transfer hose fails, the excess flow valve on the stationary railroad tank car temporarily freezes open, resulting in the loss of 2,000 pounds of liquid anhydrous ammonia.  The Alternative Case Release Scenario for Trimethylamine involved the presumed failure of a transfer hose during the transloading of Trimethylamine from a rail car to a tank truck.  The scenario assumes that when the transfer hose fails, and the excess flow valve on the Transloader temporarily freezes open, resulting in the loss of 2,000 pounds of Trimethylamine.  \n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Program:\n\n\n\nMultistar Industries, Inc. has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements required by 40 CFR Part 68 of the EPA.  In addition, our facility is subject to the WISHA Process Safety Management Standard Chapter 296-67 WAC.  Our facility is also subject to EPCRA Section 302 reporting requirements.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the accidental release prevention program that is in place at our facility.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information:\n\n\n\nMultistar Industries, Inc. currently maintains a detailed record of written process safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment design information associated with our Ammonia Storage and Repack System and TMA Transfer System.\n\n      \n\nProcess Hazard Analysis:\n\n\n\nThe methodology used to complete our Process Hazard Analyses is the What-If Checklist.  The Process Hazard Analyses are completed by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are re-validated at an interval of at least every 5 years.  Any corrective actions noted from the hazard analyses are completed in a timely manner.\n\n\n\nOp"
