The scenario assumes that when the transfer hose fails, the excess flow valve on the stationary railroad tank car temporarily freezes open, resulting in the loss of 2,000 pounds of liquid anhydrous ammonia.  The Alternative Case Release Scenario for Trimethylamine involved the presumed failure of a transfer hose during the transloading of Trimethylamine from a rail car to a tank truck.  The scenario assumes that when the transfer hose fails, and the excess flow valve on the Transloader temporarily freezes open, resulting in the loss of 2,000 pounds of Trimethylamine.  \r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Program:\r\n\r\nMultistar Industries, Inc. has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements required by 40 CFR Part 68 of the EPA.

      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary:\r\n\r\nStationary Source and the Regulated substances Handled:\r\n\r\nMultistar Industries, Inc. operates a bulk anhydrous ammonia storage and distribution facility.  Multistar Industries, Inc. also transfers Trimethylamine (TMA) from rail cars to cargo tank trailers for delivery to an off-site consignee.   Anhydrous Ammonia (NH3) and Trimethylamine (TMA) are the only Process Safety Management and Risk Management Planning regulated substances present at the Multistar Industries, Inc. Othello, Washington facility.\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:\r\n\r\nMultistar Industries, Inc. is committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  Our comprehensive accidental release prevention program covers the design, installation, operation and maintenance of the Anhydrous Ammonia.  It is our policy to implement appropriate control measures to prevent possible releases of anhydrous ammonia and Trimethylamine.  Unforeseeable, if such a release does occur, our highly trained personnel are available to mitigate the effects of the incident.  We are also completely coordinated with the Adams County Volunteer Fire Department.\r\n\r\nWorst Case Release Scenario and the Alternative Case Release Scenario:\r\n\r\nThe Worst Case and Alternative Case release scenarios were developed using the methodologies provided in the EPA's RMP Comp and Marplot 5.1.1 software programs.  \r\n\r\nThe Worst Case Release Scenario for anhydrous ammonia involves the presumed rupture of the largest storage tank, a stationary tank containing 160,000 pounds of liquid anhydrous ammonia, due to a railroad switching accident where an inbound tank car is derailed and punctures the stationary tank.  The Worst Case Release Scenario for Trimethylamine involves the presumed rupture of a rail car containing 156,988 pounds of Trimethylamine due to a railroad switching accident where an inbound tank car is derailed and punctures a Trimethylamine tank car located on the rail siding.\r\n\r\nThe"
