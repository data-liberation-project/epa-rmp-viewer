      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\r\n\r\nSmithfield is engaged in the production of pork products for human consumption.  The facility is located at 1780 Smithfield Way, Kinston, N.C.  The NAICS code is 31162.  The facility has approximately 700 full time employees and operates 24 hours/day, 7 days/week, 52 weeks/year.\r\n\r\nThis Plan informs all interested parties that this facility is participating in the OSHA Process\r\nSafety Management (PSM) program defined in 29 CFR 1910.119 and the EPA Risk Management\r\nProgram (RMP) defined in 40 CFR Part 68. These programs provide for the implementation of detailed\r\nPrevention and response procedures when storing and handling hazardous chemicals. The program objectives are to ensure worker and public safety and to provide environmental protection.\r\n \r\nAnhydrous ammonia is the only substance at the facility that is regulated under the PSM and RMP\r\nprograms. This is the same type of ammonia commonly sprayed on fields by farmers to fertilize crops.\r\nAnhydrous ammonia is used as a refrigerant throughout the plant to maintain desired meat\r\ntemperatures in coolers, freezers and working areas. Expelling heat caused from altering the ammonia between a liquid and a gas state creates refrigeration in the facility. This refrigeration system consists of a series of compressors, condensers, evaporators, vessels, piping and valves.\r\n \r\nThe offsite consequences of analysis was determined utilizing the online browser based RMP comp and the population data is based upon information pulled from Marplot in June 2016. How to determine the WCS & ARS was derived from the Supplemental Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration Facilities (May 2004).\r\n\r\nThe ammonia refrigeration system is operated with a variety of safety devices employed within the\r\nsystem, included are: high and low level automated shutdown systems and high and low pressure automated shutdown systems. Alarm systems are utilized to provide early detection of problems within the system befo"
