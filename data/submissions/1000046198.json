Kemps Ice Cream uses Anhydrous Ammonia as a refrigerant at this facility to provide cooling for the production and storage areas. The Kemps Ice Cream refrigeration system is a closed loop system with normal operating pressures that range between a low side of 3 psi to a high side of 185 psi. The systems maximum intended inventory is 13,500 pounds.\r\n\r\nWorst-case Release Scenario for a Toxic Release\r\nThe Kemps Ice Cream worst-case release is the catastrophic failure of the High Pressure Receiver in the ammonia system. The maximum capacity of the High Pressure Receiver is 8,130 pounds at 100% full. The normal operating level in the HPR is 4,808 pounds, so the worst-case release scenario takes in account the possibility the vessel would be 80% full holding 6,922 pounds. Using the RMP Comp program downloaded from the EPA Home Page the calculated toxic endpoint was 1.4 miles down wind. Based on the census data provided the population within the radius of the toxic endpoint is 13,000, within the area.\r\n\r\nThe worst-case release is the catastrophic failure of the High Pressure Receiver in the ammonia system. The vessel capacity of the High Pressure Receiver is described above. Although the worst case scenario is a requirement by the RMP ruling it is not a likely scenario to take place. Kemps Ice Cream Company follows the industrial standards to assure proper material is used in the ammonia refrigeration system.

The alternative release was a pressure relief valve function or failure was the most likely cause of an ammonia release. Using the tables provided a pressure relief valve release of 10 minutes releasing 117lbs/mn from the High Pressure Receiver. The toxic endpoint for the release would be .60 miles down wind. The estimated population within the distance would be 7,800 people.

The facility has also established annual retraining for all personnel that are on the HAZMAT Team as well as periodic spill drills and plant wide evacuation drills to assure all employees are prepared in the event of an ammonia release.
