Under this scenario, the toxic endpoint of <0.1 mile does not include any residential or environmental receptors.  However, other industrial and warehousing facilities are within this radius.

Procedures have been implemented for hazard evaluation, emergency response, and employee training.  In addition, the facility has a containment system which features sealed floors sloping away from all openings for primary containment.  The inside primary containment provides a 246,000-gallon capacity and the outside secondary containment provides a 113,118-gallon capacity, and has special rubber liner.\n\nIn the past five years, no accidental release has occurred.\n\nJWC has implemented an emergency response plan which contains the following elements:  Emergency Contacts; Written Program Availability, Review, and Updates; Pre-Emergency Planning and Coordination with Outside Parties; Personnel Roles, Lines of Authority, Training, and Communication; Emergency Recognition and Prevention; Safe Distances and Places of Refuge; Site Security and Control; Evacuation Routes and Procedures; Decontamination; Emergency Medical Treatment; Emergency Alerting and Response Procedures; Critique of Response and Follow-Up; Emergency Response Plan Review; Training Requirements; and Signs and Symptoms of Anticipated Emergencies.\n\nThe emergency response plan is updated at least annually whenever a new product, process, or personnel change occurs that could affect the procedures and information contain therein.  Employee training is conducted prior to assignment to tasks requiring emergency response techniques and at least annually thereafter.\n\nThere are no planned changes to the safety program."
