Each process is systematically examined to identify potential hazards, controls in place to manage these hazards, and recommended additional controls, as appropriate. \n\n\n\nThe West Memphis Terminal uses the \"what if\" methodology, which is conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  The team identifies and evaluates potential hazards of the process as well as accidental prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and / or mitigation measures.  \n\n\n\nAs a minimum the West Memphis Terminal performs periodic PHA reviews or revalidations every 5 years as long as the process is operating.\n\n\n\nPHA findings and recommendations and their resolution are documented.  The West Memphis Terminal has implemented a system to address and resolve all PHA findings and recommendations in a timely manner through a written schedule.  All PHA findings and recommendation resolutions are communicated to all effected employees.  All recommendations must be resolved by management.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures:  The West Memphis Terminal has developed and implemented written operating procedures that describe the tasks that terminal operators and transport drivers must perform, the safe process operating parameters that must be maintained, and safety precautions for operations and maintenance activities.  The West Memphis Terminal written operating procedures address various modes of process operations, including:  (1) initial start-up,  (2) normal operations,  (3) temporary operations,  (4) emergency shutdown,  (5) emergency operations,  (6) normal shutdown, and  (7) start-up after turnaround.\n\n\n\nContractors:  The West Memphis Terminal has developed and implemented a program to ensure that cont"
