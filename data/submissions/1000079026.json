ACSC will utilize its Risk Management Program to minimize potential risks, associated with the use of sulfur dioxide, to its employees, the community, and environment.  ACSC will comply with applicable safety, health, and environmental regulations; identify, report, and promptly correct unsafe conditions; train personnel to safely perform their job duties; and work to maintain a safe workplace.\r\n\r\nACSC Crookston stores sulfur dioxide in a single, steel, aboveground storage tank located outdoors. The maximum amount of product stored in the 18,000 gallon tank is 14,400 gallons based on an 80% fill capacity operational control. With a density of 12.2 lbs/gallon at 14\u00b0F, it is estimated the tank holds approximately 14,400 gallons of product. Sulfur dioxide is delivered to the plant by tanker truck. Aqueous sulfur dioxide is pumped out of the tank into process piping which branches into one of two process endpoints where the liquid is vaporized for application. Approximately 75% of the sulfur dioxide is used in the diffuser water supply and the remaining 25% is used in the sulfitation of 'thin juice'.\r\n\r\nACSC relies on several safeguards as part of it accidental release prevention program including in-plant alarms and pressure relief valves.  ACSC's design engineers and suppliers use recognized design codes and standards for the equipment and system components.  The plant's standard operating procedures specify safe practices to be used at the plant and the maintenance program establishes proper testing, calibration, and cleaning procedures.  Hazard communication is encouraged between management, operators, and employees through the process hazard analysis, process safety information reviews, training, safety briefings, and procedure reviews.  \r\n\r\nACSC Crookston has had no accidents"

A review of ACSC's Emergency Action Plan has been coordinated with the Crookston Fire Department.  \r\n\r\nACSC employees regularly participate in safety training and safety reviews.  ACSC also hosts the local Fire Department to facility walk-throughs, receives annual insurance carrier facility safety inspections, conducts third party audits to identify potential improvements, conducts regular pipe integrity testing, and offers ACSC employees awareness and refresher level training. This Risk Management Plan and the information used to prepare it are made readily available to all ACSC employees."
