      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary [40 CFR 68.155]\nCargill owns and operates a wet corn milling facility located in Hammond, Indiana that produces corn syrup and various starches for food and industrial uses.  The facility uses propylene oxide in excess of the RMP threshold quantity. Propylene oxide is listed in the RMP rule under 40 CFR 68 due to toxicity and has a threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds. The RMP program is considered Level 3 because the regulated chemical is also subject to the OSHA process safety management program standard, 29 CFR 1910.119, and public receptors are within the impact distance identified in the worst-case release scenario.  \n\nCargill\u0092s starch modification process uses propylene oxide as a reactant to produce various starch products.  The calculated on-site maximum intended propylene oxide inventory is 370,540 lbs, which includes (1) propylene oxide storge tank (200,540 lbs) and (1) propylene oxide railcar (170,000 lbs).\n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at the stationary source [40 CFR 68.155(a)]\nThe Cargill Hammond facility is strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety. This commitment is demonstrated by Cargill\u0092s comprehensive accidental release prevention program that encompasses design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training to help prevent releases of RMP regulated substances (propylene oxide). Additionally, robust engineering controls are in place to prevent possible releases of propylene oxide.\n\nThe stationary source and regulated substances handled [40 CFR 68.155(b)]\nThe Cargill Hammond facility is covered by the RMP rule because it uses propylene oxide in excess of the RMP regulatory threshold. Propylene oxide is used in the facility's starch production process and is a RMP listed chemical due to toxicity.\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps [40 CFR 68.155(c)]:\nThis document includes program review dates"

Cargill has a program in place to comply with the provisions of the accidental release prevention regulations under 40 CFR Part 68. The following sections briefly describe the elements of the existing release prevention program.\n\nProcess Safety Information [40 CFR Part 68.65]\nCargill maintains a detailed record of RMP regulated process safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with the starch modification propylene oxide process.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis [40 CFR Part 68.67]\nComprehensive analyses ensure that hazards associated with RMP regulated processes are identified and controlled efficiently. The methodology used to carry out these analyses is a HAZOP which is conducted by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at least every (5) years.  HAZOP findings are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures [40 CFR Part 68.69]\nTo ensure safe operations, Cargill maintains detailed written operating procedures for its RMP regulated processes. These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations and normal shutdown. These procedures are reviewed / updated annually and are readily accessible to personnel operating this process.\n\nTraining [40 CFR Part 68.71]\nCargill has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating RMP regulated plant processes are competent in the applicable operating procedures. Refresher training is provided at least every three years and more frequently as needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity [40 CFR Part 68.73]\nCargill carries out documented maintenance checks on RMP regulated process equipment to ensure proper operations. Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed. Equipment deficie"

Facility operators or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training regarding the modification(s).\n\nPre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR) [40 CFR Part 68.77]\nCargill conducts Pre-Startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs) on new processes and modifications to existing processes involving RMP regulated chemicals.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating, and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits [40 CFR Part 68.79]\nCargill conducts triennial audits to determine whether the provisions set out under the USEPA RMP and OSHA PSM regulations are being implemented. Audit findings are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nIncident Investigation [40 CFR Part 68.81]\nCargill promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a RMP regulated substance. These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  Corrective actions are completed in a timely manner.  Incident investigation reports are retained for a minimum period of 5 years.\n\nEmployee Participation [40 CFR Part 68.83]\nCargill believes that PSM/RMP and accident prevention is a team effort. Employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.

Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of the contractor's safety performance is conducted. Cargill\u0092s policy is to inform contractors of known potential hazards associated with the contractor's on-site work and any RMP regulated process that they would be working on / around.  Contractors are also informed of the emergency response procedures in the event of an accidental release of a RMP regulated substance.\n\nThe five-year accident history [40 CFR 68.155(d)]:\nIn the past (5) years, there have been no accidents involving propylene oxide that resulted in any on-site deaths, injuries, or significant property damage; or that resulted in any offsite deaths, injuries, property damage, environmental damage, evacuation, or sheltering in place.\n\nThe emergency response program [40 CFR 68.155(e)]:\nIn the event of an incident, Cargill has systems in place to respond quickly.  Processes can be shut down on an emergency basis and the facility has a plan in place for evacuations and notification of local emergency response agencies.  Cargill has also coordinated its RMP regulated chemical response needs with local emergency planning and response organizations on a regular basis. \n\nPlanned changes to improve safety [40 CFR 68.155(f)]:\nIn an effort to continually improve Cargill\u0092s PSM/RMP programs, Cargill has an internal process for reviewing open recommendations from PSM/RMP audits and PHAs and completing them in a timely manner.
