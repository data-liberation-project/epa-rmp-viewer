The technical information herein may be used as a training reference in initial and recurring operator and maintenance training. Training on process fundamentals, operations, and maintenance, coupled with the recommended process modifications discussed below, will reduce the potential hazards to plant personnel and the surrounding community.\nAn Emergency Response Program and an Incident Investigation Program are included. These two programs should be an integral part of both initial and recurring training.\nA Risk Management Plan (Plan), as required by the EPA, is included at the end of the main body of this document. It consists of a summary of data elements that must be submitted to the EPA which will eventually be uploaded onto a public access data base. The Plan has an Executive Summary that follows a required EPA format, and is intended to inform the public of the WTP's proactive stance toward protection of the environment and the surrounding community.\n\nHazard Assessment\nThe Hazard Assessment is comprised of a Worst Case and Alternative Release Scenario each for the chlorine system, as well as a 5-Year Accident H"

The Hazard Assessment was conducted as an initial screening procedure as part of determining into which Program Level (I, II, or III) the WTP falls. \nResidences lie within the EPA-defined endpoint concentrations of WTP's Worst-Case releases. Therefore, the plant is ineligible for Program I. Because Texas public utilities are currently excluded from Program III, the WTP is included in Risk Management Program II.  \n\nWorst Case Scenario\nThe Worst Case Scenario was defined as a ton container (2,000 pounds) of chlorine being released by a catastrophic event within 10 minute duration. Mitigation factor of 0.55 was allowed for this process due to the enclosure covering it. This scenario was developed and modeled using the EPA approved dense gas dispersion model DEGADIS 2.1. The toxic endpoint for chlorine was determined to be 1.55 miles.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario\nThe Alternative Release Scenario of chlorine was also modeled using DEGADIS. Source term estimation of approximately 175 pounds released was derived from a scenario of pressurized flexible tubing failure. The dispersion model estimated the 3 ppm chlorine footprint to extend to 0.26 miles.\n\n5 Year Accident History\nNo accidents have ever occurred at the plant involving either onsite or offsite consequences within the last five years.\n\nManagement Program\nThe Management Program consists of the Document Management System described below.\n\nDocument Management System\nA Document Management System was established to attribute responsibility for the development, implementation, and maintenance of the Risk Management Program. The Program must be updated every three years, or any time a covered process undergoes a physical or administrative modification.  The Document Management System is largely a function of the Risk Management Program Team, listed below in Table ES-2.\n\nRisk Management Program Team\nThe following members are responsible for the Risk Management Program development, implementation, and"

It is comprised of Safety Information, Hazard Review, Operating Procedures, Training, Maintenance, Incident Investigation, and \tCompliance Audit procedures.  Each has an entire chapter devoted to it in this RMP, and is described in more detail below.\n\nSafety Information\nSafety Information is divided between Chemical Safety Information, and Process Safety Information.  Each is described below.\n\nChemical Safety Information\nComprehensive chemical data is provided in this section to include regulatory reporting and action thresholds, health hazards and chemical exposure limitations, as well as detailed physical properties of each regulated substance. This information was compiled from numerous sources, and is intended to be a one-stop source for the reader seeking data on these substances. The physical data will provide useful information in the inevitable event the plant processes are modified, thereby requiring revisited dense gas dispersion modeling.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nProcess Safety Information was meticulously compiled on each system studied. Specifications are collocated in one place for easy reference. Details such as Maximum Intended Inventory, Safe Upper and Lower Temperatures, Safe Upper and Lower Pressures, and Codes and Standards Used to Design, Build and Operate the Process are provided in this section.

The team consisted of facility management, process operating and maintenance experts, outside process design engineers, and consultants knowledgeable in the Hazard Review process itself. The Hazard Review technique used was a hybrid Hazard and Operability Study (HAZOP), in the form of a \"What If\" analysis. The \"What If\" was developed from HAZOP experience at similar treatment facilities.\n\nRecommendations\nThe result of the Hazard Review is a set of recommendations for the plant to implement. The Rule under 40 CFR 68.50 requires the City of Cedar Park to ensure that problems identified are \"resolved in a timely manner.\"  For those items that can not be promptly resolved, it is recommended that a schedule be developed that addresses those issues, with personnel responsibility assigned for each.  \nPlease note that these are not the recommendations of Camp Dresser & McKee Inc.  Rather, they are Plant recommendations developed by the Hazard Review Team with a consensus from all team members.  CDM's role was simply to facilitate the Hazard Review process. \nThe results of the Hazard Review were tabulated and a summary of the recommendations is provided below. \n\nAdministrative and Operational Recommendations\nVendor audits were recommended to verify quality assurance and quality control on chlorine packaging. The City of Cedar Park should be interested in container hydrostatic testing and pre-shipment inspection. Look for inspection reports from appropriate oversight agencies. If at all possible, it was recommended to investigate contractual control over the vendor. In other words, use contract language and specifications to ensure the arrival of safe ton containers along with high-quality chlorine. Hold the supplier responsible for liability and monetary damages associated with defective ton containers and/or chlorine.\nEspecially important is to supervise the chlorine supplier during unloading procedure.

The following were highlighted during Hazard Review as particularly important to operating/maintenance personnel, and the community.\nThe first, and most general, is to verify training on plant operating and maintenance procedures. These procedures were developed in conjunction with the plant operating and maintenance staff and should incorporate all of the safety concerns that arose during the Hazard Review.\nEnsure operators understand the hazard associated with exposing oil, grease, petroleum products, or other combustibles to chlorine gas. Use only non-reactive, approved lubricants on the chlorination system. Use good housekeeping in the area, and store no combustibles around the chlorination equipment.\nFinally, ensure that the City\u00c2\u00bfs Emergency Response policy is implemented and the staff trained. If a leak, occurs the person discovering the leak should ensure the plant siren is activated, then dial 911, implement two-way walkie-talkie for fire department notification and communicate the emergency. Then, evacuate the plant proceeding to the predetermined staging area for roll call, decontamination, and medical treatment.\n\nRecommendations for Further Study\nThe following recommendations were tabled for further study. These studies should compare various configurations, as well as equipment manufacturers and models, with both economic and non-economic costs.\nThe WTP Superintendent suggested that a potential confined space issue might arise if the building were enclosed to accommodate emergency scrubbing. The Team agreed that this issue should be addressed as part of the scrubber design.\nThe Team recommended looking at 911 for emergency notification and to implement two-way walkie-talkie for fire department"

This allows a direct dial of emergency response officials in case of chlorine leak detection.\nA plant siren is recommended that will be audible to all facility personnel whether in or out of doors. This siren may be directly coupled to the leak system, or be manually activated or both.\nThe WTP Superintendent recommended a small weather station (wind vane and anemometer) in lieu of windsock. The City Fire Chief also prefers this arrangement. Software exists to automatically transmit wind direction and speed to the emergency response officials.\nThe Hazard Review Team recommended a backup power generator, although it was not a hazard-driven recommendation. The generator capacity should be determined as a result of a proper load distribution and need analysis assuming a hypothetical power outage.\nConsider implementation of a computerized Maintenance Management System (MMS).\nThe last items recommended for further consideration are redundant leak detectors with sensor self-test features. These incorporate built-in chlorine gas generators for better calibration.\n\nOperating Procedures\nChlorination System Operating Procedures have been amended for the WTP. They provide system descriptions, specifications, and operating procedures for the chlorine system. Procedures include Initial Startup; Normal, Temporary, Abnormal, Emergency Shutdowns and Operations; Startup Following a Shutdown or Major Change; and Consequences of Deviation. Also included are Troubleshooting Procedures.\n\nTraining \nTraining is required by EPA to be included in the Risk Management Program. A program has been developed with guidelines on how to conduct regular and structured plant training. Training Record Forms are included with the Program for the required training documentation.

State and federal regulators will most surely expect to see documentation and recordkeeping associated with the Maintenance Program. \n\nIncident Investigation\nAn Incident Investigation Program has been developed. The EPA has established strict guidelines to follow in the aftermath of any release involving either the chlorine system. The Incident Investigation Program outlines key milestones that must be accomplished within 24 hours of any covered incident, and the actions that must occur subsequently. Ultimately, it is desired that the plant learn from the incident and take action to prevent similar incidents in the future. Incident Investigation Report Forms are included, and must be maintained for a minimum of five years after each incident.\n\nCompliance Audits\nInternal Compliance Audits must be conducted every three years to verify compliance with the programs and procedures contained in this document. The WTP Superintendent must certify that the Risk Management Program team has evaluated compliance with the provisions of the Program, and verify that the procedures and practices are adequate and are being followed. Audit Report Forms are provided, the two most recent of which must always be maintained. This means that in the year 2010, the Compliance Audit Report for the year 2004 may be discarded.\n\nEmergency Response Program\nThe Emergency Response Program is included as part of the Risk Management Program, in case a significant release ever occurs. As in all the above programs, it is important to review this program regularly. The Rule, 40 CFR 68.95 requires training for all employees \"in relevant procedures\" of the Emergency Response Program.\nIt is recommended that training on the specific plant procedures take place upon initial employment and every three years thereafter, as with most of the other RMP training programs.
