              "Description": "Program 3 Prevention Program\n\nThe City of Placerville WasteWater Treatment Plant (WWTP) accidential release policy involves an approach to integrate technology, procedures and management practices, and is in compliance with all applicable EPA Prevention Program requirements.\n\nChemical specific prevention steps include availabilty of self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA), awareness of the hazardous and toxic properties of chlorine and sulfur dioxide, presence of chemical leak, a chemical scrubber system and chemical leak detectors.\n\n1.  Safety Information\n\nThe WWTP has developed and maintains written safety information about the chlorination process comprising of:\na.  Hazards posed by the chlorination/dechlorination process,\nb.  The technology of the chlorination/dechlorination process,\nc.  The equipment used in the chlorination/dechlorination process,\nThe chlorination/dechlorination process is designed in complinance with recognized and generally accepted good engineering practices.  The operation of the facility adheres to the guidelines of the Chlorine Institute.  The WWTP will update this safety information if a major change occurs that makes the information inaccurate.\n\n2.  Process Hazard Analysis\n\nThe WWTP conducted a process hazard analysis  (PHA) appropriate to the complexity of the chlorination/dechlorination process, for the purpose of identifying, evaluation, and controlling hazards involved in the process using the What-If/Checklist methodology.  The following required items were identified:\na.  The hazards associated with chlorine and sulfur dioxide, and the chlorination/dechlorination process.\nb.  Possibility of equipment malfunctions or human errors that could cause an accidental release.\nc.  The safeguards used or needed to control the hazards or prevent equipment malfunction or human error.\nd.  Steps used to detect or monitor releases.\nAll equipment was inspected during the PHA; it was determined that the chlorination/dechlorination facility was designed, build, and operated in accordance with applicable codes and industrial guidelines.  The results of the PHA are documented.  The PHA will be updated at least once every 5 years.  The WWTP will also conduct reviews whenever a major change in the process occurs; all issues identified in the review will be resolved before startup of the changed process occurs.\n\n3.  Operating Procedures\n\nThe WWTP has prepared written procedures that provide clear instructions or steps for safely conductingt activities associated with the chlorination/dechlorination process.  They are consistent with the applicable safety information.  The following procedures are included in the WWTP operation manaual for chlorination and dechlorination.\n1.  Steps for each operating phase: initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown operations, startup following a normal or emergency shutdown or a major change that requires a PHA, emergency operations and normal operations.\n2.  Operating limits showing consequences of deviation and steps required to correct ar avoid deviation.\n3.  Safety and health considerations that address properties of chlorine and sulfur dioxide; precautions to prevent exposure; and controls to be taken if exposure occurs.\n4.  Safety systems and their functions were also reviewed during the PHA.\n\n4.  Training\n\nThe WWTP ensures that each employee presently operating the chlorination/dechlorination process, and each employee newly assigned to this process have been trained or tested competent in the operating procedures listed above that pertain to their duties.  Thaining documentation files include a written certificationfor each employee assigned to operate the chlorination process that the employee has the required knowledge, skills, and abilities to safely carry out the duties and responsibilities as provided in the operating procedures.\n\nRefresher training is provided yearly to each employee operating the chlorination/dechlorination process to ensure that the employee understands and adheres to the current operationg procedures of the process.  The WWTP ensures that operators are trained in any updated or new procedures prior to startup of a process after a major change.\n\n5.  Mechanical Integrity\n\nThe WWTP has a preventive maintenance program to ensure the mechanical integrity of the chlorination/dechlorination system components, including the functions of inspection and testing, deficiency correction, and quality assurance.  the WWTP performs these functions on the following equipment connected with the chlorination/dechlorination process:  chlorine and sulfur dioxide pressure vessels; piping system; relief and vent systems; emergency shutdown systems; chemical scrubber system; controls; pumps; and leak detection systems.\n\n6.  Management of Change\n\nThe WWTP has implemented written procedures to nanage changes (except for replacement-in-kind) to process chemicals technology, equipment, and procedures; and, changes to stationalry sources that affect the chlorination/dechlorination process.  Necessary forms and procedures assure that the following considerations are addressed prior to any change: the technical basis for the proposed change; impact of change on safety and health; modifications to operating procedures; necessary time period for the change, and authorization requirements for the proposed change.\n\nEmployees affected by a change in the process are informed of and trained in the change prior to start-up of the process or affected part of the process.  Safety information and operating procedures are updated accordingly.\n\n7.  Pre-Startup Review\n\nWritten procedures have been developed to allow for operators to perform a pre-strartup safety review for new or modified chlorination/dechlorination equipement, or where modification to the process is significant enough to require a change in the process safety information.  The pre-startup review confirms: construction and equipement is in accordance with design specifications; safety, operating, maintenance, and emergency procedures are in place and are adequate; a PHA is performed for new chlorination/dechlorination operations or facilities; and, all employes involved in the process are trained.\n\n8.  Compliance audits will be conducted every 3 years to verify that the procedures and practices followed are adequate and are being followed.  At least one person knowledgeable in theprocess will conduct the audit; a report will be developed; appropriate response will be documented; deficiency correction will be documented; and, the two most recent audit reports will be retained.\n\n9.  Incident Investigation\n\nThe WWTP will investigate each incident which resulted in, or could reasonably have resulted in a catastrophic release.  The investigation will be initiated as soon as possible, but not later than 48 hours following the incident.  A incident investigation form has been developed that addresses all key factors of the incident and asks for recommendations resulting from the investigation.  Recommendations will be promptly addressed, resolutions and corrective actions will be documented.  Findings will be reviewed with all affected personnel.  Investigation summaries will be retained for 5 years.\n\n10.  Employee Participation\n\nManagers and operators of the WWTP chlorination and dechlorination facilities participated in the process hazard analysis.  The PHA has been made available to affected employees.\n\n11.  Hot Work Permit\n\nA hot work permit process has been developed and implemented for hot work operations conducted on or near the chlorination/dechlorination process.  The permit documents the fire and accident prevention requirements and is implemented prior to beginning any hot work operations.  The permit is kept on the file until completion of the hot work.\n\n12.  Contractors\n\nContractors working on or near the chlorination station are required to comply with the regulatory provisions of process safety management.  A form has been developed to address the following:  contractor's safety program; informing contractor about hazards at the site; reviewing the emergency evacuation plans; recording contractor meetings about the hazards; requiring contracotrs to train their employees in the hazards of the process.\n\n13.  Emergency Response Program\n\nThe WWTP has developed and implemented a emergency response program that coordinates with local emergency responsers.",

Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policy\n\nThe City of Placerville Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP) accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates technologies, procedures, and nagement practices.  All applicable procedures of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Prevention Program are adheared to.  The WWTP emergency response program involves the preparation of response plans which are tailored to it's facility and to the emergency response services available in the comunity, and is in compliance with the EPA Emergency Response Program requirements.\n\n2.  Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe WWTP chlorination/dechlorination station has been installed to disinfect treated wastewater.  The station includes treatment plant offices, laboratory, chemical building, instrument rooms and chemical scrubber.  The amount of chlorine and sulfur dioxide connected feed manifold are 1 one-ton cylinder of each chemical.  There are a maximum of 8 one-ton cylinders of chlorine/sulfur dioxide in the chemical building.\n\n3.  Worst Case Release Scenarios and the Alternate Release Scenarios\n\nThe offsite consequence analysis includes consideration of two release scenarios, identified as \"worst case release\" and alternative scenario\".  Scenarios were conducted for both chlorine and sulfur dioxide releases.  The first scenario is defined by EPA, which states the \"the owner or operator shall assume that the \"....maximum quantity in the largest vessel...is released as a gas over 10 minutes\" due to an unspecified failure.  The alternative release scenario is defined as \"more likely to occur than the worst-case release scenario\".\n\nAtmospheric dispersion modeling has to be performed to determine the distance traveled by the chlorine and sulfur dioxide released before its concentration decreases to the \"toxic enpoint\" selected by EPA.  These levels are the Emergency Response Plannning Guide"

This is defined by the American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA) as the \"maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing irriversible or other serious health effects or symptoms which could impair an individual's ability to take protective action.\"  The residential population within a circle with a radius corresponding to the toxic endpoint distance has to defined to estimate the population potentially affected.\n\nThe works-case release scenarios at the WWTP involves 1) failure of a one-ton cylinder of chlorine; and, \n2) failure of a one-ton cylinder of sulfur dioxide.  The offsite consequence analysis for these scenarios was performed for the following conditions.  The conditions are pre-defined by EPA, namely release of the entire amount of gas in 10 minutes, use of the one-hour average ERPG-2 as the toxic endpoint, and consideration of the population residing within a full circle with radius corresponding to the toxic enpoint distance.  EPA set these conditions to facilitate the performance of the offsite consequence analysis.\n\nFor the worst-case scenario, EPA manadated meteorological conditions, namely stability F, wind speed of 1.5 m/sec, temperature (25 degrees C), and average humidity (65%) were used.  When atmospheric dispersion modeling charts were used for the worst case scenarios were performed using the EPA assumptions, Chlorine had a distance to toxic endpoint of 1.3 miles and an estimate of residential population potentially affected of 1000 was obtained.  For sulfur dioxide, a toxic endpoint of 1.3 miles and an estimate of residential population potentially affected was 1000.\n\nThe alternative release scenario involves the rupture of the flexible connectors (pigtails) connected to the one-ton containers.  The amount of chlorine (and sulfur dioxide) released is 540 lbs. at an average rate of one hour (the duration of t"

For chlorine, the estimated distance traveled to the toxic endpoint is .1 mile.  For sulfur dioxide, the estimated distance traveled to the toxic endpoint is .1mile.\n\nThis facility is provided with a chemical scrubber system that activates upon gas leak detection system.  This scrubber system will contain any uncontrolled releases of chlorine or sulfur dioxide during normal conditions.  The emergency response system is activated at the same time via a telemetry system to operators during normal working hours and off hours.\n\n4.  General Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe WWTP chlorine/dechlorination station accidential release prevention program is in compliance the the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) rule and this rule.  It is based on the follwing key elements:\n*  High level of training of the operators,\n*  Preventive maintenance program,\n*  Use of state-of-the-art process and safety equipment\n*  Use of accurate and effective operating procedures, written with the participation of the operators\n*  Performance of a hazard review of equipment and procedures\n*  Implementation of an auditing and inspection program.\n\nChemical-specific prevention steps include availability of self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA), awareness of the hazardous and toxic properties of chlorine and sulfur dioxide, presence of chemical leak detectors, and the use of a chemical scrubber system.\n\n5.
