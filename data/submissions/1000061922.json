AN UPDATED RMP WAS SUBMITTED ON CD ROM TO THE RMP REPORTING CENTER, BUT WAS NOT READABLE.  THEREFORE THE 2006 RMP FOR THIS FACILITY IS NOT ACCESSIBLE ELECTRONICALLY ON THE CDX WEBSITE.  HOWEVER A PRINTED COPY OF THE 2006 RMP SUBMISSION IS AVAILABLE AT THE COASTAL SUNBELT FACILITY AND HAS ALSO BEEN SENT TO THE RMP REPORTING CENTER.  \n\n\n\n1.  ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES.\n\n\n\nCoastal Sunbelt Produce (CSP)utilizes anhydrous ammonia which is considered hazardous by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).  The properties which make ammonia valuable as a refrigerant also necessitate certain safety precautions.  CSP strives to protect all its valuable resources and assets - both personnel and property.  We live and have families in this community.  We want to prevent exposure to all our personnel as well as nearby members of our community, existing natural resources, and the surrounding environment.  It is our policy to comply with Federal, State, and Local regulations.  Through continual, accurate training and various safety devices and procedures, we work to minimize potential releases.\n\n\n\nOur emergency response program has specific procedures for accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia as well as other emergencies.  We work in conjunction with the Savage Fire Department to prepare for necessary notification of all affected neighbors.\n\n\n\n\n\n2.  THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED.\n\n\n\nThe primary purpose of our facility is the temporary storage of refrigerated and frozen foods as well as non refrigerated goods.  We utilize anhydrous ammonia as the primary means for refrigeration and freezing.  An outside company is used to fill our main receiver tanks.  Piping then carries the ammonia to the needed refrigeration or freezing units.  Access to t"

THE WORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO(S) AND THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO(S), INCLUDING ADMINISTRATIVE CONTROLS AND MITIGATION MEASURES TO LIMIT THE DISTANCES FOR EACH REPORTED SCENARIO.\n\n\n\nWorst Case Scenario\n\nThe worst case scenario would be failure of our largest receiver. Mitigation strategy includes enclosure.  Worst case scenario calculations and documentation are available at the facility.    \n\n\n\nAlternative Scenario\n\nThe alternative scenario would be the release of ammonia due to a leak in a vessel.  Mitigation strategy includes enclosure.  Alternative scenario calculations and documentation are available at the facility.  \n\n\n\n4.  FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY.\n\n\n\nThis facility has not had a reportable release.  \n\n\n\n\n\n5.  THE RMP MANAGEMENT PROGRAM.\n\n\n\nThe management of the RMP program will be handled by Mr. Pat Barnes, Maintenance/Engineering Manager.  Mr. Barnes will coordinate the program with the cooperation and assistance of the employees and managers of Coastal Sunbelt Produce.\n\n\n\n\n\n6.  THE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND THE SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS.\n\n\n\nThe facility complies with all applicable Federal, State and Local regulations including the EPAs Accidental Release Prevention Rule.  Our personnel are trained and have access to our Written Programs.  Our Refrigeration Maintenance operators receive On-The-Job training (OJT).  They are given oral tests and are observed by senior maintenance in order to demonstrate proper job skills and knowledge.  Also, the ammonia system is operated, tested and maintained to the standard of International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration, the most stringent standards of the industry.\n\n\n\n\n\n7.  THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM.\n\n\n\nWe work with the Savage Fire Department regarding emergency preparedness in an ongoing continuo"

Our total ammonia Process Safety Program is in compliance.  Our program is improved continuously through regular updating of our written program and training of our technicians.  We also take advantage of new technologies when safer and more economical alternatives are available."
