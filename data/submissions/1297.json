The TOSHA permissible exposure limit for chlorine is represented by a ceiling value of 1 ppm.    NIOSH has assigned an IDLH value of 10 ppm for acute chlorine exposure.\nc.  Exposure to exposed skin or eyes can cause serious frostbite burns.\nd.  Inhalation of chlorine gas can lead to adverse acute health effects including:  irritation of the upper respiratory system, violent coughing, choking, nausea, dizziness, headache, vomiting, chest pains, shortness of breath and pulmonary edema.\n\nWorst Case Senario.  Chlorine is dropped during loading/unloading/handling, resulting in the rupturing of the cylinder or valve stem and the uncontrolled release of the contents of the cylinder.  Fire in or near chlorine room allowing the fusible plug to melt in cylinder or a faulty fusible plug.\n\nAlternate Senario.

The purpose of the plan is to aid the Town of Smyrna in its efforts to prevent or mitigate episodic releases of chlorine that could result in the catastrophic loss of personnel and property within the facility and possibly the surrounding community.\n\nOur Facility.  The Smyrna Water Treatment Plant utilizes chlorine as its primary disinfectant in the process of treating drinking water.  The chlorine is stored in a building approximately 100 yards from the main admistration and operations building.  The building usually contains 10 tons of chlorine.  The building is enclosed and with the only possible leaks occuring at the cylinder.  The room has constant video monitoring and a chlorine scrubber along with constant air monitoring of the room for chlorine.  This chlorine monitor activates the scrubber and sounds an audible alarm and sets off alarm lighting.\n\nChlorine presents physical properties and health hazards that would present immediately dangerous to life and health (IDLH) conditions in the event of an uncontrolled release gas.  The following section consists of a review of the inherent physical and health hazards associated with chlorine for emergency response personnel.\n\nPhysical Properties\n\na.  At room temperatures, chlorine is a gas.\nb.  If chlorine is cooled to 29.3 degrees F, it becomes an amber color liquid.  It is usually shipped as a liquid in order to save space.\nc.  If liquid chlorine escapes from a container it will usually be boiling and convert to a greenish-yellow color gas.\nd.  It has an irritating odor (bleach) and is 2 = times heavier than air, so it will usually gather low to the ground.\ne.  Chlorine is soluble"

The monitor will detect      \n          chlorine at 0 to 5 ppm.  The chlorine monitor is connected to the SCADA system to obtain constant\n          readings from the control room.\n\n          *Personal Chlorine Monitor\n\n          -Portable, personal monitors for chlorine are available for use during response to gas release \n           episodes.
