These two systems are nearly identical, with the exception of type of oil cooling used for the refrigeration compressors.  All other functions of the refrigeration systems are identical. The systems are monitored and controlled by a computer system.  This system is connected by auto dialer to the phone system so if there is any alarm conditions a refrigeration operator is notified and they must repond to clear the alarm condition. The system has ammonia detection in all refrigerated areas of the facility, with automatic showdown and pumpout if ammonia is detected. All pressure vessels have safety relief valves, and all compressors have high pressure safety cutouts. The computer control system will both unload compressors on high system pressure, or stop compressors to prevent a high pressure (ammonia release) condition. All employees who work at the facility are trained in the emergency action plan, and are instructed in what they should do if an ammonia release occurs. ",

      "SummaryText": "Evans Fruit Company operates a controlled atmosphere fruit storage facility warehouse in a rural area located a few miles south of Mattawa, WA. just off of State Highway 243.  The facility typically is loaded during the autumn over a several week period, then the fruit is held in storage for several months.  The last room may be held till close to the next fruit-loading season.  During the loading and unloading times there are a few forklift and truck drivers at the facility.  A refrigeration operator checks the operation of the system several times a week, while continuous monitoring and alarming is done by the facility computer control system.  Much of the time the facility is unattended, and due to the rural location there are very few people in the area.\n\nAmmonia is used as the refrigerant in the system.  Ammonia is a colorless gas with a pungent odor that is irritating to the eyes, nose and throat.  It is present as both a liquid under pressure, and as a vapor in the system.\n\nTo maintain a safe facility operation the Evans Fruit Company has developed an emergency action plan that provides instructions to all employees of what actions to take if an ammonia release is detected.  All refrigerated areas in the facility are monitored by an ammonia detection system, which will automatically shutdown and pump out any alarming area.  Any alarm would also be sent to the refrigeration operator by a dial up modem.  Also, the computer system will notify the refrigeration operator on any alarming or out of normal condition in the system (temperatures/pressures).  All employees at the facility receive annual training on the emergency action plan.\n\nThe facility has complied with both State and Federal regulations regarding ammonia used as a refrigerant, and has in place both the OSHA?s Process Safety Management standard (PSM) (29 CFR 1910.119), and EPA?s Risk Management Program (RMP) (40 CFR, Part 68).  These programs are readily available to on-site personal to help in maint"

      "SummaryText": "aining a safe operating facility.  As required by the RMP an ?Off-site Consequence Analysis? has been done for the facility to determine what impact the ?Worse Case?, and the more realistic ?Alternate Case? releases of ammonia would have to the surrounding area.\n\nThere have been no reportable releases of ammonia from the system during the last five years.\n\nTo deal with any possible release of ammonia Evans Fruit Company maintains an ongoing relationship with an experienced refrigeration contractor in Yakima, and with the Mattawa Fire Department.  In the event of a significant accident, the fire department is about fifteen minutes away; response from Yakima (owner, refrigeration contractors) is about ninety minutes.  Because of the rural location there are few or no persons being near the site, and because of the distance of responders from the plant, the emergency response strategy is essentially passive.  Ammonia canister masks are available onsite, and the fire department has keys to the facility. In the event of a large release, the release would most likely be over before a proper Haz-Mat team could be assembled on site.  In such cases, it is not expected or intended that persons would attempt to enter the facility until proper trained personnel with the appropriate PPE arrive."
