      "SummaryText": "\n1.0 Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe Kraft Foods facility in Medford, Wisconsin has an excellent record in preventing and minimizing releases of anhydrous ammonia (hereafter, anhydrous ammonia will be referred to as ammonia).  This facility has a thorough emergency training program for on-site emergency responders.  This facility has implemented an electronic preventive maintenance system that uses a real time database to track training and inspection dates and issue reminders to responsible groups.\n\nThe emergency response policies at this facility ensure that there is emergency response coverage, 24 hours - 7 days per week.  There are also adequate provisions for coordination with outside agencies, such as with the Medford Fire Department and LEPC, in the event of an emergency.\n\n2.0 Process Description and Regulated Substances\nAt this location, Kraft Foods manufactures pizzas and crusts.  The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for the primary process at this facility is 311412.\n\nKraft Foods has one regulated substance under 40 CFR 68 at the Medford, Wisconsin plant - ammonia.  The storage and process areas of the plant are refrigerated by ammonia to keep the products fresh and wholesome.  Ammonia has been widely used as a refrigerant in the food industry for decades.\n\nThe ammonia threshold for triggering applicability to 40 CFR 68 is 10,000 pounds.  The quantity of ammonia stored on-site is approximately 64,680 pounds.\n\nAmmonia is classified as a Group 2 Refrigerant per ASHRAE Standard 34-1989.  Its distinctive, pungent odor is very noticeable to most people, even in small quantities.  Ammonia is flammable in a very narrow and high range of concentration with a high ignition temperature.  It is not poisonous, but it can be corrosive to human tissue.  Ammonia is readily absorbed into the moisture of the skin and, at high concentrations, can cause burns.  The potential risks to people exposed to an accidental ammonia "

      "SummaryText": "release include irritation of respiratory tract, burning of skin and other tissue when contacted by ammonia vapor, and freezing of skin and other body tissue when contacted by liquid ammonia.\n\n4.0 General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThis facility has developed an OSHA PSM program for their ammonia refrigeration system.  Ammonia falls under the RMP Program 3 prevention program, which is identical to the OSHA PSM program.  EPA has stated that if the process is in compliance with OSHA PSM, it is in compliance with RMP Program 3.  Thus, Kraft's ammonia PSM has been reviewed and determined to be complete for the RMP document.\n\nThere are several key aspects of the prevention program:\n\n1. Utility personnel are present on site and assigned to the ammonia system, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, all year round.\n\n2. There is a plant-wide ammonia detection system which alerts the utility personnel and security area personnel, and both of these areas are staffed continuously.\n\n3. Most of the ammonia pipe work is located away from employee traffic patterns and machinery to minimize the chance of an ammonia release.\n\n4. The plant maintains good training, certification and employee awareness of operating procedures (monthly drills with emergency response team and an annual drill with the City fire department and the LEPC).\n\n\n5.0 Five-year Accident History\n\nThe review of this facility's accident history includes the following range of dates: June 21, 1994 - June 21, 2004.  To date, there have been no accidental spills or releases of ammonia at this facility for the past ten years.\n\n\n6.0 Emergency Response Program\n\nAs mentioned earlier, this facility has developed an emergency response plan, including, but not limited to, steps to address the following topics:\n\naccidental discharge of hazardous substances and hazardous waste into the environment\n\nthe measures to be taken to prevent an accident\n\ncountermeasures to be taken in the event "

If ammonia is in the outside atmosphere, the safest place to be is indoors with windows and doors shut and the ventilation system turned off."
