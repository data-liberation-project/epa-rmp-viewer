      "SummaryText": "The Bayport Polymers LLC Port Arthur site is Jointly owned and operated by TotalEnergies. The Complex at Port Arthur refines oil to produce gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, and petrochemicals to be used as building blocks for other products.\n\n\n\nProcess Description - Ethane Unit\n\nThe Ethane unit's main objective is to thermally crack feedstock using steam in steam cracking furnaces to produce lighter hydrocarbons.  The covered chemicals for this unit include flammables (methane, ethane, ethylene, propylene). \n\n\n\nBayport Polymers and TotalEnergies Port Arthur refinery understands the hazards associated with the use of covered chemicals and has an accidental release prevention plan in effect. This plan is based on the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Plan. In its plan, OSHA details training requirements for employees and precautions to be taken in manufacturing and maintenance of equipment when using hazardous materials.\n\n\n\nThere have been no offsite accidental releases the past five years, that has impacted the surrounding community. \n\n\n\nEmergency response is handled by refinery employees who are well trained in emergency response activities. If needed, the site also a member of the Sabine Neches Chiefs Mutual Aid Association. The Refinery utilizes and maintains Safer Systems monitors around the perimeter of the facility. \n\n\n\nThe planned changes to improve safety are to maintain and ensure operability of existing vent, alarm, interlock systems as well as maintaining equipment to ensure its integrity"
