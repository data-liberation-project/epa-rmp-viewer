The audit team collectively possesses the following skills and knowledge:\r\n\r\n?Ability to understand the prevention program requirements of the RMP regulation (49 CFR Part 68)\r\n?Capability to conduct interviews and collect audit data\r\n?Capability to document audit results\r\n?Knowledge of the process to be audited\r\n\r\nOur audit team members receive training in RMP regulatory requirements, interview techniques, and methods for data collection before participating in an audit.  They use a protocol or a checksheet that contains a series of questions that systematically address each requirement of the RMP regulation.  The team leader assigns each auditor specific RMP elements to cover in the audit.  Information obtained through field observations, interviews, and document reviews is documented, and weaknesses or noncompliances are identified.  At the conclusion of the audit, our audit team prepares a report that identifies any specific noncompliance issues that need to be addressed.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have a plant management committee that promptly reviews the audit findings, determines an appropriate response for each finding, assigns responsibility for implementation of a corrective action, and assigns a target completion date.  The corrective actions are placed in a tracking system and progress is monitored quarterly until open issues are resolved.

Formaldehyde in solution exists as a polymer and the equilibrium vapor pressure of formaldehyde above the liquid is less than that predicted for an ideal solution.  The equilibrium vapor pressure of formaldehyde above a 50% solution containing 1% methanol at 150?F has been experimentally determined to be 35 mm Hg.\r\n\r\n\r\nWorst Case Incident\r\n\r\nThe worst case incident is failure of the vessel containing the largest quantity of formaldehyde.  In the case of TRIMET, this is the failure of Tank 202, the primary process storage tank.  This tank stores a 50 weight percent aqueous solution of formaldehyde.  The total quantity of material held in the tank is maintained below 1,380,000 pounds by administrative controls.  The tank is inerted with nitrogen, insulated, and operated at 150?"

The greatest offsite radius resulted from failure of process water to the adsorber.  Analysis of this scenario is summarized below.\r\n\r\nFailure of process water to the adsorber.  In the unlikely event of failure of the water flow to the formaldehyde adsorber, 120 pounds per minute of formaldehyde vapor leaving the adsorber would be discharged to the process incinerator.  Under this condition, the incinerator would be overloaded and would shut down due to high temperature.  The formaldehyde vapor would be discharged to the atmosphere through the incinerator stack.  The facility is equipped with high temperature and low flow alarms.

In accordance with EPA guidance, the model assumed a 10% yield.  The endpoint of concern is an overpressure of 1 psig.\r\n\r\nOverpressure radius of 0.38 miles from the tank.

Release scenarios which are more likely to occur were evaluated.  None of the alternate scenarios resulted in an offsite consequence.  The failure of the underground liquid transfer line was the alternate scenario which would release the greatest quantity of propane.  This scenario is described below.\r\n\r\n\r\nLiquid Line Failure.  Catastrophic failure of the liquid propane line due to corrosion as it exits the ground at the evaporator.  It is assumed that the excess flow valve at the storage tank operates as designed.  The line will contain approximately 200 pounds of propane.  It is conservatively assumed that the release is 100% vapor.  The 1 psig overpressure radius to be approximately 200 feet.  An overpressure in excess of 1 psig will not extend beyond the plant boundary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\tIV. Five-Year Accident History\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe keep records for all significant accidental chemical releases that occur at our facility.  During the past five years there was one release in which 50 gals (407 # ) of formaldehyde was released through the waste water treatment plant during a 16 hour period. It was reported and did not result in any injuries, property damage, or environmental damage either onsite or offsite. no"

Prevention Program\r\n\r\n\t1.0 INTRODUCTION\r\n\r\n\r\nWe take a systematic, proactive approach to preventing accidental releases of hazardous chemicals.  Our management systems address each of the key features of successful accident prevention programs including:\r\n\r\n?Process safety information (PSI)\r\n?Process hazard analysis\r\n?Operating procedures\r\n?Training\r\n?Mechanical integrity\r\n?Management of change\r\n?Pre-startup review\r\n?Compliance audits\r\n?Incident investigation\r\n?Employee participation\r\n?Hot work permit\r\n?Contractors\r\n\r\nThese individual elements of our accident prevention program work together to prevent accidental chemical releases.  Our company and our employees are committed to the standard that these management systems set for the way we do business, and we have specific accountabilities and controls to ensure that we are meeting our own high standards for accident prevention.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t2.0 PROCESS SAFETY INFORMATION\r\n\r\n\r\nIn accordance with Section 68.65 of the RMP rule, we systematically control the creation, updating, and retention of written documentation associated with our process chemicals, process technology, and process equipment.  This information is essential for supporting all of the other elements of our risk management program.  We also use this information directly to ensure that our equipment is suitable for its intended use.\r\n\r\n\r\n2.1 Process Safety Information Details\r\n\r\nWe maintain the following chemical process information for each regulated substance in a covered process as well as for other hazardous materials in both covered and noncovered processes:\r\n\r\n?Toxicity information\r\n?Permissible exposure limits\r\n?Physical data\r\n?Reactivity data\r\n?Corrosivity data\r\n?Thermal and chemical stability data\r\n?Hazardous effects of inadvertent mixing of diff"

Our checklist contains a list of safety questions covering process considerations that must be addressed prior to startup.  The person responsible for the project or maintenance task prepares the Pre-Startup Safety Review Checklist and Approval Form and provides the names of the reviewer responsible for confirmation of each of the pre-startup review safety questions.  Each reviewer signs off on the checklist and approval form when satisfied that all assigned safety questions are complete and no problems exist.  All reviewers must sign off on the Pre-Startup Safety Review Checklist and Approval Form before startup can be authorized.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t9.0 COMPLIANCE AUDITS\r\n\r\n\r\nIn accordance with Section 68.79 of the RMP rule, we audit our RMP-covered processes to be certain that our prevention programs are effective.  Our compliance audit program seeks to confirm that RMP prevention program practices for the covered process are consistent with written programs, that the programs adequately address all requirements of the RMP regulations, and that management systems are in place to ensure continued compliance.\r\n\r\n\r\n9.1 Compliance Audit Details\r\n\r\nWe conduct and certify compliance audits of the prevention programs for RMP-covered processes at least every three years.  We integrate these audits into PSM audits.  Our audit teams consist of a team leader and an appropriate number of te"

Our program seeks to verify proper fabrication of new equipment, proper installation of new or repaired/replaced equipment, and use of suitable maintenance materials and spare parts in the preventive maintenance and repair tasks.\r\n\r\nWe have a comprehensive training program covering all MI issues.  Our program uses the procedures described previously.  For example, all mechanics are trained on hazards for all RMP-covered processes and on safe work practices.  Our maintenance personnel also receive training on safe maintenance procedures, preventive maintenance practices, and special skills requiring craft certification.  All training, as described above, occurs before employees perform tasks in RMP-covered areas independently.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t7.0 MANAGEMENT OF CHANGE\r\n\r\n\r\nIn accordance with Section 68.75 of the RMP rule, we evaluate and approve all proposed changes (i.e., modifications that are not replacements in kind) to covered process chemicals, technology, equipment, and procedures prior to implementation through our management of change (MOC) program.
