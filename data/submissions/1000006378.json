Woodgate receives propane by way of rail, unloads the propane, and then provides propane loading services for transport (tractor trailer) trucks. The facility consist of 13 above-ground storage tanks, a 12 spot tank-car unloading rack, and a total of 5 loading stations for trucks.\n  This facility complies with NFPA-58 requirements for LP-Gas storage, and it is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws. If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to notify the Stephens City Fire department and request that they respond to the emergency.\n  Our worst case scenario is the failure of our largest tank, a 47,400 gallon tank filled to the maximum amount allowed ( 88% @ 60F), resulting in a vapor cloud explosion. According to EPA's look-up tables, the distance to the endpoint is 0.4 mi. The worst case scenario could affect 110 residences.\n  This facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule and all applicable state and local codes and regulations. The facility was designed, installed and is maintained in accordance with NFPA -58 and state law.\n  Woodgate Petroleum Co., Inc. has never had an accident involving propane that caused death, injuries, property or environmental damage.\n  In the event of an emergency involving our propane facility, it is our policy to notify the Stephens City , VA fire department and request that they respond to the emergency.
