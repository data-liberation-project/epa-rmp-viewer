      "SummaryText": "1.  The primary goal of our Risk Management Program is to prevent or reduce the risk of accidental releases of substances that might expose employees, the public, or the environment to the hazards of toxicity, fire, or explosion.  Our policy is to implement the prevention measures outlined in the Process Safety Management and Risk Management Program regulations by focusing on the standards, procedures, and practices which govern individual processes, activities, or equipment.  As with any prevention program, one of the most important barriers to an incident is the performance and conduct of our people in integrating program requirements and safe work practices in their daily activities.\n\n2.  This facility manufactures private label household products including Bleach, Ammonia, and Fabric Softener.  Chlorine, which is used to manufacture Bleach, is the only regulated substance at this facility subject to this Risk Management Program.  Tank Cars delivered by rail are connected directly to the plant's processing system.  The maximum stored quantity of Chlorine on site is 360,000 pounds (2 full Tank Cars).\n\n3.  The Offsite Consequence Analysis was conducted using EPA's computer model \"RMP*Comp.\"  The worse-case release scenario (as structured by the regulation) is the failure of a single Tank Car containing 180,000 pounds of Chlorine with a 10 minute release.  The probability of this scenario is extremely low based on the construction standards, safety features and rigorous inspection/testing program that are incorporated into these Tank Cars.  The alternate release scenario chosen is a pipe leak equivalent to a flow rate just under the Tank Car's excess flow check valve limit (250 pounds/minute) with a 10 minute release.  The release rate in this alternate scenario is considered the most conservative in a class of credible events for the following reasons: Most leaks, should they occur, would be a small fraction of this value and would be manually isolated within sever"

If a large pipe leak did occur, it would more likely result in actuation of the excess flow check valve which would immediately and automatically terminate the release.\n\n4.  In addition to having a well trained, knowledgeable, and experienced staff that operate and conduct maintenance on this system, the prevention program at this facility combines a proactive approach toward ensuring mechanical integrity and operational safety with a simple design philosophy which reduces the number of components that could likely fail.  For example, daily checks are made on the piping systems that transport the Chlorine from the Tank Car to the processing system.  Any deficiencies found are immediately corrected.  At the end of each day, the Chlorine system is isolated from the Tank Cars and the process piping remains pressurized.  This prevents any moisture intrusion that would accelerate internal corrosion of piping components which prolongs the integrity of the system.  The valves on the Chlorine Tank Cars are inspected by the vendor after each return delivery and refurbished every 6 months.  From a design standpoint, the piping system is simple with minimal valves and components that could introduce leaks.  Expansion chambers are installed between valves to mitigate any unanticipated pressure increases that could challenge the design pressure of piping components.  A Safety relief valve installed on the Tank Car provides additional protection to overpressure events when the system is in service.  A plant program document has been developed that outlines the facility's implementation of the regulations associated with chemical safety and risk management.   \n\n5.  There have been no accidents at this facility involving the Chlorine unloading system.  A review of the 5 year history also reveals that any minor incidents involving this system have resulted in less than the reportable quantity.\n\n6.  The facility has an emergency response program that includes joint train"

Major improvements are planned on the Chlorine unloading system that includes piping system replacements and the addition of design features to incorporate a more defense-in-depth protection philosophy."
