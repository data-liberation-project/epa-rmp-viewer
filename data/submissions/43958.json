As a requirement of the Clean Air Act Amendments 112(r) Accidental Release of Hazardous Air Substances program, VeraSun Fort Dodge completed a risk management plan (RMP) for any chemical stored on-site that will be above the reporting threshold of 10,000 pounds.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nVeraSun Fort Dodge is committed to the protection of its employees, the greater community and the environment from hazardous substances used in the ethanol fuel production process, specifically pentane as a constituent of the natural gasoline used as the ethanol denaturant.  The denaturant is added to the ethanol to make the ethanol unfit for human consumption.  The ammonia is used for pH control directly in the process feed mixture to fermentation. It is the policy of VeraSun Fort Dodge to comply with all applicable federal, state, and local laws.  In the event of an emergency, including an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia and denaturant, it is the policy of VeraSun Fort Dodge to notify the Fort Dodge Fire Department and Webster County Sheriff Department and evacuate all employees at the facility.  \n\nRegulated Substances Handled\nThe facility produces fuel grade ethanol from corn and a process by-product known as dry distillers' grain with solubles, which is used as a livestock feed.  The fuel ethanol production process requires use of a denaturant (natural gasoline) which is reported to contain approximately 40 percent pentane, an RMP regulated substance.  The maximum amount of natural gasoline on-site is estimated to be 1,268,000 pounds (total pentane is 507,200 pounds).  The natural gasoline is stored in an above ground tank as a liquid and is introduced to the fuel ethanol in the final stage of production.  The denaturant tank is located in the facility's tank farm area which includes a secondary containment dike.  Anhydrou"
