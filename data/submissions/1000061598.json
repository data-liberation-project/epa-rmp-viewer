      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n \n\nA.   Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies  \n\nArcher Daniels Midland Company's three facilities, located in Cedar Rapids, IA strive to prevent and mitigate accidental releases of applicable substances under Section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act.  Specifically, those substances are anhydrous ammonia, anhydrous sulfur dioxide, chlorine, and pentanes contained as a mixture within our fuel-grade ethanol denaturant.\n\nOur commitment is reflected in our Risk Management Program (RMP), as codified in 40 CFR Part ?68, incorporates the following, where applicable:\n\n1.    Implementation of a management system, per 40 CFR ?48.15;\n\n2.    Conducting hazard assessments, per 40 CFR ?68.20 - ?68.42;\n\n3.    Implementing the prevention requirements, per 40 CFR ?68.65 - ?68.87; \n\n4.    Implementation of an Emergency Response Program, per 40 CFR ?68.90 - ?68.95; and\n\n5.    Submittal of Program Elements, per 40 CFR ?68.175. \n\n\n\nB.  Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe three stationary sources operated by ADM storing applicable Risk Management Program chemicals above their respective thresholds are two corn milling facilities (one wet type grind milling; one dry type grind milling) and one support facility, cogeneration.  The combined products produced by the corn milling processes are corn sweeteners, both liquid and dry packaged; fuel grade ethanol; dried corn starch, and dried co-products from corn milling.  The cogeneration facility provides steam and electricity to both facilities.\n\n\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is solely utilized at the cogeneration facility for minimizing NOx emissions from the boilers, through Selective Non-Catalytic Reduction (SNCR) chemistry.  Atmospheric emissions using this technology are regulated in accordance with our air quality permit established by Linn County Public Health Department, Air Quality Division.  Anhydrous ammonia was previously utilized at the Wet Mill as a separations aid for an ion exchange process.  In"

      "SummaryText": "ventory of anhydrous ammonia was reduced below the threshold quantity in February 2016.  Currently, inventory of anhydrous ammonia is centralized at the site's cogeneration facility.\n\n\n\nChlorine is utilized as a disinfectant for several of our cooling water systems.  ADM is evaluating a non-RMP listed, substitute material for this application.  Where feasible and without sacrificing effectiveness, chlorine is being substituted at these applications. Currently, chlorine is received and stored in 2,000 lb. cylinders at the wet mill and the cogeneration facilities.\n\n\n\nSulfur dioxide is used solely in the wet milling process as a manufacturing aid for separating the corn kernel into its viable components.  Sulfur dioxide is also a disinfectant that satisfies our necessary product quality requirements for food grade product applications.  The dual application of sulfur dioxide provides the necessary operational flexibility and minimizing extraneous chemical inventories for similar applications.\n\n\n\nPentanes (n-pentane and i-pentane) are RMP listed components of natural gasoline, used for denaturing ethanol for fuel grade applications.  The estimated quantity of pentanes are over-stated in accordance with threshold determinations (40 CFR ?68.115(b)(2)).  Because both n-pentane and i-pentane are represented by the supplier as being present in quantities greater than one percent, the entire weight of the mixture is managed as the regulated material.  Natural gasoline is stored in dedicated trailers and a dedicated bulk storage tank the Wet Mill before mixing.  Natural gasoline is stored in a dedicated bulk storage tank at the Dry Mill before mixing.  Emissions from these storage locations are regulated in accordance with our air quality permit established by Linn County Public Health Department, Air Quality Division.\n\n\n\nC.  General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nAccidental releases were evaluated for both gases and flammable liq"

To aid in estimating potential offsite impacts from these release scenarios, ADM utilized US EPA's recommended software (RMP*Comp, Ver. 2.01) to estimate the endpoint radius from the facility.  Having estimated the endpoint radius, ADM applied that value to MARPLOT, Ver. 5.0.3, for identifying the offsite populations and environmental receptors.\n\n\n\nA worst-case release scenario analysis for liquefied gases has been prepared per 40 CFR ?68.25(c) for Program 3 type evaluations.  Liquefied sulfur dioxide gas in full railcar delivered to the site is completely released to the atmosphere in 10 minutes.  By this extremely conservative basis, the endpoint radius to 1/10th the IDLH value is estimated at 16 miles in any direction.  In accordance with the provisions of 40 CFR 68.25(a)(2)(i) and (iii), only one worst-case release scenario needs to be determined for gases. \n\n\n\nA worst-case release scenario for pentanes has been prepared per 40 CFR 68(f) for Program 3 type evaluations.  For this type of evaluation, the entire contents of a full bulk storage tank are spilled instantaneously forming a liquid pool.  Because pentanes are liquid at room temperature, the 10 minute volatilization rate is estimated by the aforementioned software, assuming the entire contents as pentanes (n-pentane and i-pentane).  Using this extremely conservative basis, the endpoint radius of 1 psi overpressure is ? mile in any direction.  Worst-case release scenarios have been prepare for both n-pentane and i-pentane, resulting in identical endpoint radius to 1 psi overpressures. \n\n\n\nAlternative release scenarios have been prepared for each of the four materials, in accordance with 40 CFR 68.28(a). To develop the respective endpoint radius, in any direction, active and passive mitigation systems may be incorporated into the estimated value.  Alternative release scenarios are:\n\n\n\nSulfur dioxide          "

Supported by the various Program 3 requirements (Process Safety Information, Process Hazardous Analysis, Operating Procedures, Training, Mechanical Integrity, Management of Change, etc.) the facility continually identifies opportunities for improvement and implementation.  Examples include standardization of design through engineering specifications, to review and training on the operating procedures.  Increasing our focus and review of recognized and generally accepted good engineering practices whether through PHA or vendor supplied information.  Opportunities present themselves during mechanical integrity inspections, evaluations, and preventative programs that can be further evaluated with the management of change program.

Five-Year Accident History\n\nSince the last 5-year US EPA RMP update in April 2011, the ADM Cedar Rapids, IA facilities have not experienced an accidental release from our covered processes consistent with the requirements of 40 CFR ?68.42 regarding sulfur dioxide, anhydrous ammonia, chlorine, and pentanes. \n\n\n\nE.  Emergency Response Program\n\nEmergency response at this facility is coordinated with ADM personnel, contractors, the Linn County Local Emergency Planning Committee, and the City of Cedar Rapids Fire Department so that in the event of an accident, immediate emergency response measures will be implemented.  The facility maintains a written Emergency Action Plan, Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan, and Spill Prevention Control and Count"
