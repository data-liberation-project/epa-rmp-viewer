We also comply with the Kansas Department of Agriculture concerning safe handling and distribution of Anhydrous ammonia.

We are an agricultural based business.  We sell Anhydrous Ammonia to farmers for Fertilizer, for corn, wheat, etc. In addition we utilize propane as a fuel source for drying inbound commodities.  We have one Anhydrous tank, holding 12,000 gallons, and associated piping, valves and other miscellaneous equipment. The Propane tank holds 18,000 gallons, and has the associated piping, valves, etc.                                        The worst-case scenario for propane would be a failure of our 18,000 gallon storage tank, when filled to the greatest amount allowed (88% at 60F), resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  According to EPA's look-up tables, the distance to the endpoint is 0.4 miles.  There are two (2) homes  within the this distance, with approximately 6 people.                                                                                                                                      The worst-case scenario for our Anhydrous Ammonia would be failure of our 12,000 gallon tank, resulting in a gas release.  According to our guide, the distance endpoint is 1.02 miles.  Estimated population fo approximately 6 people.
