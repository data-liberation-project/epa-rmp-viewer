      "SummaryText": "The Metropolitan Water District of Southern California (MWDSC) wholesales drinking water to member water agencies throughout Southern California.  MWDSC provides approximately 60 percent of the drinking water used by nearly 16 million people living on the southern California coastal plain between Ventura County and the Mexican border.\n\nDisinfection is a critical process used by MWDSC in the treatment of its drinking water.  Disinfection helps to protect public health by killing pathogens in the water and preventing the spread of waterborne diseases.  The use of chlorine as a disinfectant in the treatment of drinking water and wastewater has been the dominant disinfection method in the United States since it was introduced, around the beginning of this century.  MWDSC currently utilizes bulk chlorine for disinfection at all of its water treatment plants.  The MWDSC Chemical Unloading Facility (CUF) plays a critical role in supplying chlorine for drinking water disinfection.  The chlorine at CUF is received in rail cars and then transferred to chlorine trailers which supply disinfection processes at various MWDSC water treatment facilities.\n\nAs one might expect from its superior disinfection properties, chlorine is a hazardous substance.  Thus, storing and handling chlorine can present a risk to employees and the public without proper precautions.  MWDSC regards safe practices in the storing and usage of chlorine to be of primary importance and has an excellent safety record with chlorine.\n\nThe CUF's chlorine handling process is subject to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program Rule (RMPR) and also to the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program regulation.  Both of these regulations require submission of a Risk Management Plan (RMP).  An integral part of the RMP is a summary of policies and procedures followed to safely operate the facility, including a description of the possible consequences in case of an accident an"

The Transfer Building is located approximately 100 feet west of the Main Office Building.  Empty and full chlorine trailers,  are stored in a paved storage area west of the Transfer Building.  In addition, a chlorine rail car may be occasionally located in an area, immediately east of the Transfer Building.  The evaporators and the chlorinators are located in the Control Building No. 3 adjacent to the Transfer Building . The maximum quantity of chlorine present at the CUF at any given time is more than the listed threshold quantities in the EPA and CalARP rules.  It is also more than the listed threshold quantities in the federal and California Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Standards.  \n\nChlorine leak sensors are provided in the Control Building No. 3 and chlorine vent boxes, located outside the building.  In addition, each rail car and chlorine trailer angle valve, which is connected during the unloading process is provided with a remotely actuated (pneumatic) emergency shutoff system.  In case of a major chlorine leak, chlorine supply from the rail car or chlorine trailer can be stopped by closing the shutoff system from any of the five control panels: at the unloading platform, at the east and west sides of the north wall of the Transfer Building, in Control Building No. 3, and in the Main Office center wall. \n\nThe chlorine sensors will trigger alarms on the Main Control Board (Mills Plant control room and the gas detector monitoring station).  Once alerted, fully trained personnel, including the CUF personnel will respond to assess the chlorine leak on a 24-hour basis.\n\nEmergency shower and eye wash station is also provided in the chlorine unloading area.\n\nThe chlorine leak detectors are connected to an uninterruptible power supply (UPS) system.

Depending on the severity of the accidental release, external resources such as the Riverside County Fire Department will be called to aid in handling a chlorine release.  As part of the emergency response program, the CUF has developed and implemented a Hazardous Materials and Hazardous Waste Contingency Plan (HMHWCP) for the purpose of protecting plant employees, public health and the environment.  The HMHWCP has a special focus on responding to chlorine emergencies.\n\nThe HMHWCP plan is being coordinated with local response agencies (Riverside County Fire Department).  The main elements of the emergency response plan are: (1) chlorine response flow chart, responsibilities of various personnel at the facility, duties of on-scene incident commander, HazMat responder team, (2) details of emergency recognition and prevention at the facility, (3) procedures for planning and coordination with off-site emergency response organizations, and (4) details of the training program for all HazMat responders. \n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nNumerous changes to improve safety (recommended actions) were previously identified for the chlorine unloading process in 1992, 1995 and 1998, when Process Hazard Analyses (PHAs) conducted under the California Risk Management and Prevention Program (RMPP) guidelines, Process Safety Management Program and Risk Management Program were prepared for the CUF.
