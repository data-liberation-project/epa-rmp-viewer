Further safety information is also detailed in the RMP.  In addition, operating procedures and equipment design codes and standards associated with the operations at the facility are maintained in the RMP at the facility.\r\n\r\nThe facility conducts safety inspections and hazard analyses to identify and control the hazards associated with the process.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.  \r\n\r\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY (40 CFR 68.155(E))\r\n\r\nEnergy Transfer's Super Drip Facility has not had a reportable accident of covered processes in the five (5) years previous to September 1, 2011, the renewal date of the RMP.\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM (40 CFR 68.155(F))\r\n\r\nEnergy Transfer's Super Drip Facility has an Emergency Response Program that is called their Emergency Response Plan.  The Emergency Response Plan describes response procedures to minimize hazards to human health and the environment in the event of a regulated substance accidental release.  Aspects of emergency response include adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident cleanup of affected areas.  In the event of a covered process accident, first aid procedures, and procedures to inform authorities and the public are described in the Emergency Response Plan.  A general emergency practice drill is performed at least annually.  A site map, MSDSs, and a list of chemicals kept on the site are kept at the facility.\r\n\r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY (40 CFR 68.155"

Energy Transfer's emergency response policy involves the preparation of response plans which are tailored to each facility and to the emergency response services available in the community, and is in compliance with the EPA Emergency Response Program requirements.\r\n\r\nEnergy Transfer's spill policy seeks to implement appropriate controls to prevent accidental releases of regulated substances.  If such a release does occur, the facility personnel are prepared to work with the local fire department, Local Emergency Planning Commission, and other authorities to control and mitigate the effects of the release.\r\n\r\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE HANDLED (40 CFR 68.155(B))\r\n\r\nThe primary activity at Energy Transfer's Super Drip Facility, herein referenced as the stationary source and the facility, is the handling and storage of natural gas liquids (NGL) condensate.  As part of the facility operation, natural gas liquids (NGL) are stored on site, and sold to a petroleum refiner.  The flammable regulated chemical mixture at the facility is Natural Gas Liquid (NGL) that is an aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbon mixture.
