Raw materials in the form of wood chips, sawdust, waste paper and pulp arrive from all over the Northwest by truck, barge and rail car.\n\nThe Camas Mill uses both the kraft and magnesium bisulfite (MGO) processes to convert wood chips and sawdust into pulp. Kraft pulp is produced from chips and sawdust.  Brown pulp is then bleached in one of three bleach plants.  Most of the paper grades produced contain a blend of these pulps and as well as purchased pulp and secondary fiber recycled from waste paper.\n\nPaper is made on twelve different machines, half of them producing towel and tissue grades and the other half communication paper grades.  The oldest machine dates from 1910 and the newest from 1984.  Daily production ranges from 30 tons per  day on the smallest to over 600 tons per day on the newest and largest.  Rolls of paper from the machines are sold directly to printers and converters or further processed into finished goods.  The mill also operates a pulp dryer to produce baled pulp for internal use or sale to outside customers.\n\nWaste water is treated and discharged to the main channel of the Columbia River.  The clarifier, aeration ponds and waste fiber landfill are located on Lady Island, a 476 acre site separated from the mill by the Camas Slough.\n\nThe Camas Mill employs about 1470 people from the local area.

In accordance with the RMP regulations, the entire 90 tons of chlorine was assumed to be released as a gas cloud in 10 minutes\n\nThe RMP*Comp model was used to estimate the downwind concentrations under the EPA-mandated weather conditions of 1.5 meters per second wind speed and F stability.  No passive mitigation measures were considered for this hypothetical release.  The RMP*Comp model predicted a maximum distance of greater than 25 miles to the toxic endpoint of 3 ppmv.\n\nThe event radius predicted by RMP*Comp assumes that the wind blows at the worst-case conditions of 1.5 meters per second and F stability.  In reality, the average wind speed at Camas is about 3.0 meters per second.  To estimate the off-site consequences under average conditions, the worst-case chlorine release was modeled at 3.0 meters per second wind speed and D stability.  As expected, the predicted distance to the chlorine toxic endpoint decreased significantly, down to a distance of 8.7 miles.\n\nEven if an entire chlorine railcar were somehow to be released during the worst-case atmospheric conditions, the steep terrain in the region would probably prevent the released gas from traveling anywhere other than along the river valley.  Under F stability conditions, light winds would not be able to transport the dense chlorine cloud to a height of more than about 400 feet above the release.  As a result, receptors situated at elevations greater than 400 feet above the Camas mill would probably not be impacted under EPA's stipulated worst case weather conditions.\n\n\tES6.2\tAlternate Release Scenario:  Chlorine\n\nThe alternate release scenario assumes that chlorine is accidentally released from a faulty bung at the bottom of the 450-gallon level tank at the bleach plant.

All of the liquefied chlorine was conservatively assumed to immediately expand to a dense gas and disperse into the atmosphere without forming a residual pool of liquid near the leak (in reality, much of the discharged liquid would be expected to form a pool, and the vapors would be released more slowly than estimated for the modeling used in this RMP). \n\nThe SLAB computer dispersion model was used to model the distance to the downwind toxic endpoint. The SLAB spill source type of evaporating pool was selected, with a source area equal to the floor area.  This modeling approach effectively disperses the release over the area of the room, rather than simulating a jet release directly from the level tank  For this alternate release scenario, EPA's suggested atmospheric dispersion conditions of 3.0 meters per second and D stability were used for the modeling.  A surface roughness of 0.5 meters was used, which is consistent with the mixed land use of the surrounding area (urban and rural).  EPA guidance states that, for a gaseous indoor release, the release rate can be reduced by 55 percent to account for the mitigating effect of the building.  Although the chlorine level tank is situated inside a partially-enclosed building,  for this Risk Management Plan Fort Ja"

      "SummaryText": "mes LLC elected not to reduce the release rate for modeling, for the reasons described below.\n\nEPA derived the 55 percent reduction factor by assuming that outside air displaces building (indoor) air at a rate of 0.5 air exchanges per hour.  The air exchange rate in a building with some open areas would be higher than 0.5, a rate which is representative of well-sealed buildings.  A release inside the building that houses the chlorine level tank would be mitigated by the building structure.  However, information on the actual air exchange rate for this building was not available and, given that parts of the building are not enclosed, there is no reason to believe an air exchange rate as low as 0.5 is appropriate in this case.\n\nThe SLAB model predicted a downwind distance of 2.4 miles to EPA's endpoint concentration of 3.0 ppmv for chlorine gas.  The affected area extends into the commercial and residential neighborhoods in Camas and Washougal, and across the Columbia River to the outskirts of Troutdale, Oregon.\n\nIn reality the emission rate from the spill would be reduced by the partially-enclosed nature of the process area.  Using the rate at which chlorine releases from the tank as the actual release rate to the atmosphere is conservative (that is, using this higher release rate gives a greater downwind distance).  To demonstrate how conservative it is to assume the full release rate, the downwind distance using a reduced rate (to simulate an indoor release) was also calculated.  The input parameters from the alternative case presented here were used, but the release rate was reduced to 1.7 from 3.0 kilograms per second to account for a partial-indoor event, using the 55% reduction that is stipulated by the EPA Offsite Consequence Modeling Document.  The SLAB model calculated that the toxic endpoint for this partial-indoor release would reach 1.7 miles, rather than 2.4 miles for the outdoor release.  It is likely that the actual distance would be between 1.7 and 2."

These tanks receive chlorine dioxide from both chlorine dioxide generators, the Lurgi and R-8 systems.  An 8-inch pipe  interconnects the two tanks near the bottom of the tanks.  The aqueous solution in the tanks is at ambient temperature (assumed to be 60 degrees F) and has a vapor pressure of 75 kPa.  The hypothetical release scenario assumes that the 8-inch pipe is accidentally broken, resulting in the release of the solution onto the floor of the Lurgi Building.  It is assumed that the leak continues for 30 minutes until is detected and manually repaired by mill staff.\n\nEquations from Section D.7 of EPA's RMP Offsite Consequence Modeling Guidance, May 24, 1996, were used to estimate the discharge of the liquid solution from the broken 8-inch pipe, and the POOL module of the AIRTOX modeling package was used to calculate the ClO2 evaporation rate from the liquid pool at the leak.  In this case the ClO2 evaporation rate was greater than the average liquid release rate over the 30-minute duration, which indicates that the rate of ClO2 evaporation to the atmosphere is not affected by the depth of the liquid pool that might form in and around the Lurgi Building.  Based on these calculations, the estimated average ClO2 evaporative release rate over the 30-minute leak duration is 281 pounds per minute.\n\nThe RMP*Comp model was used to model the distance to the downwind toxic endpoint.  The model predicted a downwind distance of 3.4 miles to EPA's endpoint concentration of 1.0 ppmv for chlorine dioxide.  T"

The program includes plans and procedures for responding to a wide range of events, caused either naturally or accidentally, that could result in a release of a regulated substance.  The possibility of fire or explosion in the event that a flammable substance is released is also included in this full range program.\n\nThe protocols and procedures address all aspects of emergency response:  \n\no\tEmergency notification protocol\n\t-  Mill Emergency Response Team\n\t-  Emergency Coordination Center\n\t-  Public Safety Agencies\n\t-  Public Regulatory Agencies\no\tClassification of hazards\no\tResponsibilities for management of response\no\tEvacuation plans (routes and assembly areas)\no\tInternal and external communication\no\tFirst aid and prompt medical care procedures\n\nThe emergency response plan also includes procedures for classifying both the nature of the emergency and the level of potential hazard so that responses will be appropriate and proportional the to the hazard level.  The Camas mill employs the Incident Command System (ICS) which parallels the National Interagency ICS.  This is an all risk system utilized for on-scene management of any emergency event.  The ICS is functionally oriented around five major areas:  (1) command, (2) operations, (3) planning, (4) logistics, and (5) finance (administration).  In a major incident the response command could consist of a unified command grooup containing mill personnel and local, state, and federal agency representatives.  The ICS includes eight crucial components:  common terminology, modular o"

These components work together to provide the direction and control for effective response proportional to the severity of the incident.  Measures for incident termination, post-incident cleanup and documentation requirements are also included.\n\nThe Camas mill emergency preparedness program addresses maintenance, inspection and testing of response equipment, and training and instructions that address use of this equipment.  The emergency response program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to the mill processes or facilities.  The functional design of the ICS minimizes the impact upon the emergency plan of changes in personnel assignments.  All changes in the emergency response program are administered through the management of change (MOC) process that is also utilized in the accident prevention program.  This process addresses informing and/or training affected personnel whenever changes with potential safety implications occur.  The most recent training of the Mill Emergency Response Team, included rescue training, ICS training, and a combination of HAZWOPER, Oil Spill, and Gas Pipeline annual training. \n\nThe overall emergency response program for the mill is coordinated with the City of Camas Fire Department.  This coordination includes periodic meetings with local emergency response officials, local government officials, independent response contractors and industry representatives.  Fort James LLC has around-the-clock communications capabilities with appropriate local officials emergency response organizations (e.g., Camas Fire Department).
