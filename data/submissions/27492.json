To accomplish this, The Champion Company has developed and implemented A Safety Policy and Program Manual that focuses on employee participation, an Emergency Response and Contingency Plan that addresses employee response to health, safety and environmental hazards, and a Risk Management Plan that includes training programs for personnel, programs to help insure safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of processes within the facility, and programs to evaluate the hazards at the facility.\n\n2.  ACCIDENTALRELEASE PREVENTION and EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\nThe Champion Company implements reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of potentially hazardous substances and materials.  These controls include training programs for personnel, programs to ensure safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of processes at the facility, programs to evaluate the hazards at the plant, equipment to continuously monitor delivery, storage, mixing and processing operations\n\nThe Emergency Response Plan provides for the containment of any release in a manner that provides for the safety of employees and protection of the internal and external environment.  A responsible member of management has been designated to oversee the implementation of response and safety plan activities, and a managment system has been established headeed by the General Manager with employee input to coordinate all aspects of protection (Health, Facility, Community).\n\n3.

Formaldehyde is received in bulk form as a 37% or 55% concentration stored at atmospheric in water mixture.  The maximum amount of actual formaldehyde stored on site in the internal 6367 gallon and 5500 gallon  steel storage tanks is 48,429 pounds.  The storage tanks are protected from external releases by being located inside concrete block, three hour fire rated, rooms.  Any release is designed to contained within the internal storge area.\n\nPotential releases from the diked  mixing vats are directed to sanitary drains and away from potential employee and external environmental exposures. \n\n4. OFF-SITE CNSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\nWorst-case Scenario  - In the event of an unlikely catastrophic storage tank failure, formaldehyde liquid solution (55%) spills into the internal containment area.  A total of 27,225 pounds of formaldehyde is ultimately evaporated (evaporation rate is calculated as 3.354 pounds per minute).  The distance to the EPA Toxic Endpoint of 0.012 mg/L is 0.3 miles.  \n\nThe Champion Company instaled concrete block surrounding the internal storage tanks and created a vault configuration that is designed to contain any release from the storage tanks inside the building to protect against a major release of formaldehyde mixtures into the environment.  As a further safeguard, a preventative maintenance program is in place to inspect the integrity of the tank system and prevent catastrophic tank rupture/failure.  Inventory checks, department safety checks, and computerized moitoring are also in place to pervent this worst-case scenario. \n\nAlternative Release Scenario\nAs a result of a tank coupling failure, 3143 gallons of 55% formaldehyde solution spills in the bulk tank receiving area.  From the resulting \"liquid pool\", 690 poinds of formaldehyde evaporates into the atmosphere.  The distance to the  EPA Toxic Endpoint of 0.012"

A spill or leak would be discovered quickly due to the driver and shipper proximity to the operation and the formaldehyde odor.  Valves can be closed and transfer pumps canbe shut-off immediatley to stop any release into the environmen.\n\n5.   Accidential Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nThe Champion Company has developed and implemented a prevention program to comply with the 13 elements of the OSHA Process Safety Management Program (PSM).  The EPA RMP Rule expands the OSHA PSM to include focus on protecting the environment and public sectors from releases of formaldehyde.  The following highlights a few of the specifric steps that are key to the prevention/protection program.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA) - The Chapmion Compoany performs process hazard analyses on all mixing processes (formaldehyde and non-formaldehyde) in the building to identify process hazards and generate recommendations to improve the safe operation of the process.  The Plant Safety Committee meets monthly to revirew operational safety recommendations and develops an action plan with completion dates and responsibility assignment for the respective recommendation.\n\nManagement of Change (MOC) - The Champion Company MOC ensures that changes and recommendations of changes made to the system do nit alter the safe operation of the processes.  The MOC's major design function is to pervent changes to the processes until proper safety reviews, employee training, material updaters, and specific procedures have been modified to reflect the change.  \n\nMechanical Integrity (MIP) - The purpose of Champion's MIP is to make certain that the equipment in the processes are installed, maintained, operated, inspected and tested to ensure its continued safe operation.  The MIP covers all equipment contained in the chemical storage,"

One section describes safety measures for welding or other \"Hot Work\", which includes a permit system to reduce the risk of fire.  The Safety Manual includes a Lockout, Tagout Program for equipment maintenance.  These procedures lessen the potential for a release.\n\nContractors are selected on the basis of performance history and safety record.  Prior to commencing work within the facility, selected contractors are given a safety orientation  to brief them on plant hazards and safety practices.  Contractor safety programs and performance are evaluated prior to their selection for jobs that impact process safety.\n\nFormaldehyde in solution is delivered to the facility by offsite vendors via DOT approved bulk tanker truck and follow DOT loading and unloading requirements.  In addition, the facility has specific loading/unloading instructions for receiving of bulk formaldehyde solutions.  The formaldehyde solution is pumped directly into storage tanks located inside the building in enclosed storage rooms.  Workers who handle formaldehyde receive annual training emphasing the hazards associated with formaldehyde and safe handling procedures.  Additional precautions maintained include; a remote emergency shut-off to stop the operation in case of failure, preventative maintenance program to aviod failure of equipment during operation, and annual review/ certification of the corrsponding safety procedures addressing the handling of formaldehyde.   \n\n6.

Emergency Response Program\nThe Champion Company has developed and implemented a written emergency response program to safely respond to any facility emergency, including potential releases of formaldehyde.  The Emergency Response Plan includes procedures for the following:\n\na.  Informing the local fire department about accidential releases that could result in offsite consequences.\nb.  Providing proper first aid and emergency medical treatment to treat accidential human exposure to          formaldehyde at the facility.\nc.  Containing accidnetial releases of formaldehyde including the use of emergency response equipment.  \nd.   Inspecting and maintaing emergency response equipment.\ne.  Annual, or as necessary, review and updating the Emergency Response Plan.\n\nThe written Emergency Response Plan complies with other federal and state contingency plan regulations (OSHA 29 CFR 1910.38, 29 CFR 1910. 119, and 29 CR 1910.1048) and has been directly communicated to local emergency response agencies for cordination and implementation with other like plans.\n\n8.   Planned Changes to Improve Safety\nAs recommendations from the Plant Safety Committee monthly review of the company committment to providing a safe work environment, safe from recognized hazards, PSM RMP Plans are reviewed accordingly.  Changes to existing programs and procedures are implemented as necessary to protect employees and the community.  The Champion Company conducts an annual review of all PHA, RMP, and Safety related programs.  Currently, documentation of the PHA and RMP procedural requirements are being made."
