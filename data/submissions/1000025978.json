Delta Terminal Services stores a variety of chemicals ranging from vegetable oils to volatile organic substances. \n\n\n\nKinder Morgan Delta Terminal has a standing commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by resources invested in accident prevention, ongoing worker training, and consideration of safety in design, installation, operation and maintenance of equipment.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent chemical releases.  However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control, contain, and mitigate the release. \n\n\n\nThis facility is regulated under the Program 2 rule requirements of 40 CFR 68.10 because:\n\n\n\n- It maintains storage inventories of Ethylenediamine(EDA), a listed toxic chemical, in excess of 20,000 lbs (the regulatory threshold as defined by 40 CFR Part 68 Subpart G)\n\n\n\n- A release from the Kinder Morgan Delta Terminal could impact off-site receptors (i.e., residences and business areas)\n\n\n\n- Kinder Morgan Delta Terminal does not operate under a SIC code specified for Program 3 rule\n\n\n\n- It is not subject to OSHA Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals (\"PSM\" at 29 CFR 1919.119) \n\n\n\nKinder Morgan Delta Terminal is subject to and complies with OSHA Emergency Action Plans (29 CFR 1910.38), OSHA Emergency Response (29 CFR 1910.120), the Clean Water Act (40 CFR 112), the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) Regulations, and the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to Know Act (EPCRA).\n\n\n\nThe January 2012 RMP resubmittal is a voluntary submittal to correct the changes noted here"

The liquid temperature for the worst case scenario for Tank 50-21 was changed from 77 F to 94 F, so that the ambient temperature is based on a three year maximum daily temperature.  This change caused the worst case release endpoint radius to increase from 0.7 miles to 1.1 miles, and the affected population to increase from 3125 persons to 13,518 persons.  Other corrections were made to the contact information and the executive summary.\n\n\n\nThe facility has had no RMP accidents in the past five (5) years.\n\n"
