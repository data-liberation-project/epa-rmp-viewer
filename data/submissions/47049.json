      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\n\nPendleton Flour Mills LLC\nPendleton, OR 97801\n\nACCIDENT RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICY\n\nIt is the policy of the Pendleton Flour Mills LLC. (PFM LLC), Pendleton, Oregon, facility management to implement the requirements of the Risk Management Program, (RMP) in accordance with the Environmental Protection Agency, (EPA) Regulation under 40 CFR Part 68 and with the corresponding regulations under OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) Program. The objective is to minimize the risk of a release of a hazardous material and if a release occurs, to minimize the potential impact to PFM LLC employees, the public and the environment. This objective will be accomplished by utilizing general good operating procedures, providing appropriate training to all employees and coordinating response activities, as necessary, with the local emergency response providers. Management is committed to providing the resources necessary to implement this policy. The key concepts in our release prevention program are employee participation, appropriate design and maintenance of equipment, and appropriate training of all employees.\n\n\nFACILITY DESCRIPTION\n\nThe PFM LLC operates a flour mill in Pendleton, Oregon that processes wheat into different grades of flour. Several of the grades involve a process in which chlorine is added to the milled flour to age and bleach the flour as well as reducing the microbial impact of the water used in tempering the wheat prior to milling. The system uses two one-ton chlorine cylinders on line to dispense the chlorine into an educator vacuum system. This vacuum system allows for the feed of chlorine from the containers into the piping system on to our agitators. If a chlorine line downstream of the vacuum regulator is broken or develops a leak, the vacuum is interrupted and the vacuum regulator automatically closes, preventing the discharge of chlorine gas.  Two additional one-ton cylinders are located within the same e"

The current system uses industry standard equipment, schedule 80 CPVC pipe well routed for safety, and is regularly inspected and maintained for integrity. The location of the current chlorine room is in the center of the flour mill complex.\n\nAmerican Ingredients, the company's contractor, regularly visits the flour mill to inspected the chlorine delivery system, perform routine maintenance, make adjustments to the chlorine delivery system, and other tasks as required to allow for efficient operation. PFM LLC`s personnel receive the chlorine containers from the chemical supplier, transfer the containers into the chlorine room and hook up the piping to the containers.  American Ingredient personnel are the only people making changes to the operating system with the exception of hooking up and unhooking the chlorine tanks, which is done by PFM LLC's personnel. \n\n  \nWORST CASE AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nChlorine\n\nThe worst-case release scenario for a chlorine release of all the contents of one of the 2,000-pound chlorine cylinders in a 10-minute period (per EPA guidelines). This release translates to a release of 2,000-pounds of chlorine in 10 minutes or 200 pounds/min. Other assumptions included in the worst-case assessment are: the chlorine is a liquefied gas; the cylinder is not diked. The wind speed is 1.5 meters/sec, and the atmospheric stability is classified as F (stable). The results of the worst-case assessment for chlorine show that the plume must travel 1.3 miles before dispersing to the endpoint concentration of 3.0 parts per million (PPM).\n\nThe selected alternative-release scenario for the chlorine system is a release resulting from damage or rupture of the chlorine vapor line (pigtail) from the ton cylinder to the chlorine manifold. The pigtail has an inside diameter of 3/8 inch. The operating pressure of the cylinder is 86 psig. Based on RMP COM"
