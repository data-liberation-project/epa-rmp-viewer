Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\nElite Comfort Solutions is committed to operating in a manner that is safe for its employees, the community, and the environment. As part of this commitment, Elite Comfort Solutions has established a Risk Management Plan (RMP) to help the company identify and communicate risks associated with its operations. Reasonable controls have been installed to prevent accidental releases from occurring. Site specific plans for emergency response have been developed to reduce the effects upon personnel and the public in the highly unlikely event of a release of hazardous materials from the facility.\r\n\r\n2. Facility and Regulated Chemical Description\r\nElite Comfort Solutions has developed a RMP to address the EPA RMP Program requirements (40 CFR 68) as well as the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program (19 CCR 2755) due to the onsite process containing a regulated chemical above its threshold quantity. The regulated chemical, Toluene Diisocyanate (TDI), with a CAS # 26471-62-5, is present at the facility in quantities above the 10,000-pound threshold.\r\n\r\n3. Accidental Release Prevention Program\r\nElite Comfort Solutions is dedicated to continuous improvement of its environmental, health and safety program. Elite Comfort Solutions' employees have been trained and provided with detailed information concerning their job duties and chemicals stored onsite. Employees have also been trained on the facility's Emergency Reporting Program.\r\n\r\n4. Five-Year Accident History\r\nThere have been no RMP applicable releases of toxic materials in the past five (5) years.\r\n\r\n5. Emergency Response Program \r\nElite Comfort Solutions has developed an Emergency Reporting Program that has been coordinated with the City of Ontario Fire Department. The Emergency Reporting Program details roles and responsibilities, procedures, and corrective measures to be used in the event of an emergency that could threaten human health o"
