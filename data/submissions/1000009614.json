This commitment is demonstrated by our efforts in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, facility personnel will evaluate the situation, take actions within the capabilities of the facility, and/or notify the necessary outside agencies.\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nHatters Pond Gas Plant, located in Creola, Alabama, U.S.A., operates a variety of processes to produce Condensate, Propane, Butane and Residue gas. Hatters Pond Gas Plant has regulated flammables, including:\nA?    Iso-butane\nA?    Normal Butane\nA?    Ethane\nA?    Methane\nA?    Iso-Pentane\nA?    Normal Pentane\nA?    Propane\n\n\nEMPLOYEE PARTICIPATION \n\nEmployees are consulted with on developing process hazard analyses, investigating incidents, writing operating procedures, and developing different aspects of PSM/RMP. Every employee has access to documentation and files included in PSM/RMP. It is the responsibility of every employee at the plant to comply with the aspects of PSM/RMP. The document entitled \"Employee Participation\" explains this section of PSM/RMP in greater detail.\n\n\nPROCESS SAFETY INFORMATION (PSI)\n\nAccording to the PSM/RMP standard, there are three main aspects of Process Safety Information required to properly inform employees/public of the potential hazards of processes involving potentially hazardous chemicals.  They are the following:\n\n\nPotential hazards of chemicals in process:\n\nInformation concerning the chemicals in the process is included in Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS).  Th"

The potential hazards of different chemicals being mixed are covered under this subsection. Also covered are a worst case scenario and an alternate scenario, which could affect off site receptors.\n\n\n\nTechnology of process:\n\nThe technology of the process refers to descriptions of processes at the plant, maximum intended inventories, inventory calculations and safe upper and lower limits on temperatures, pressures, flow rates, and compositions.  Included in this subsection is the plant Process Flow Diagram (PFD).\n\nEquipment in process:\n\nRequired information about equipment used in the plant includes: materials of construction, piping & instrumentation diagrams (P&ID's), electrical classifications, relief systems, and safety systems.  The design, maintenance, inspection, testing and operation of equipment is documented.\n\n\nPROCESS HAZARD ANALYSIS\n\nThe Hatters Pond Gas Plant has a comprehensive program to ensure that hazards associated with the process are identified and controlled.  This program systematically examines the process to identify hazards and ensure adequate controls are in place to manage the identified hazards.\n\nThe Process Hazard Analysis requirement is met by the Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) Studies conducted at the plant.\n\n\nOPERATING PROCEDURES  \n\nThe Hatters Pond Gas Plant personnel use various PHA processes including the Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) analysis and Check List techniques to perform these evaluations. The analyses are conducted using a team of personnel who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. This team identifies and evaluates process hazards as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures.  Approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are initiated and tracked until c"

The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\n\nThe operating procedures provide clear and thorough step-by-step instructions on operating various sections of the plant.  Operating limits and health considerations of the different processes, which are covered in Process Safety Information, are also requirements of operating procedures.  Step by step procedures for safe work practices, such as lockout/tagout, confined space entry, etc. are also included in this section.\n\n\nTRAINING \n\nTraining is required for employees involved in operating a process.  Types of training include operating procedures, maintenance procedures, mechanical integrity testing procedures, safety and potential health hazards, emergency operations, and safe work practices.  After initial training, refresher training is required every three (3) years, or more often if necessary or requested.  Training documentation includes the employee who received training, the date of training, and testing to verify that the employee understood the training. \n\n\nCONTRACTORS  \n\nThe Hatters Pond Gas Plant uses contractors to supplement its work force during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities. This section of PSM/RMP covers contractors working on or adjacent to a covered process.  Both Plant personnel and the contractor have responsibilities under this section.  The PlantA?s responsibilities include:\n\n    A?    Evaluating contract employer's safety performance and programs\n    A?    Informing contract employer of potential hazards related to the work\n    A?    Explaining Chevron U.S.A.s emergency action plan\n    A?

This section of PSM/RMP does not apply to Hatters Pond Gas Plant since it was in operation before the PSM/RMP regulation. New facilities or equipment added to the plant after the compliance dates is covered under \"Management of Change\".  \n\n\nMECHANICAL INTEGRITY  \n\nThe Hatters Pond Gas Plant has well-established practices and  procedures to maintain  pressure vessels,  piping systems, pressure relief, vent systems, operating controls, pumps, compressors,  and  emergency shutdown  systems  in a safe operating  condition. The basic aspects of this include:\n \n1.    Conducting training\n2.    Following manufactures written procedures\n3.    Performing inspections and tests\n4.    Correcting identified deficiencies\n\nThese activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process. Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels). Application of various elements of Chevron Operating Management System (OE) program ensures mechanical integrity is maintained on existing and new installations.\n\n\nHOT WORK PERMIT \n\nThe hot work permit currently being used at the plant meets the Hot Work requirements of PSM/RMP.\n\n\nMANAGEMENT OF CHANGE  \n\nThe Management of Change (MOC) process is used to identify, evaluate, and control hazards in the workplace that may be introduced because of change.  The process establishes the minimum procedures necessary to provide for the safety of personnel and facilities due to these changes or modifications.
