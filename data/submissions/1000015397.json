      "SummaryText": "The stationary source and regulated substances handled.\n\nCasa de Oro Foods, LLC is a manufacturer of flour tortillas located at 4433 South 94th Street in Omaha, NE.\n\nAt our facility, anhydrous ammonia (cas #7664-41-7) is used as a refrigerant during processing and to maintain the desired air temperatures of our storage rooms and docks. Designed as a closed-loop, single-stage compression system, liquid ammonia is pumped to the cooling evaporators. A mix of ammonia liquid and vapor returns to a suction accumulator where the liquid is separated from the vapor. Ammonia vapor is pulled from the suction accumulator, compressed, and sent to evaporative condensers where it is cooled and condensed to a liquid to be used again by the evaporators. The maximum high-side system operating pressure is 185 psig but the highest pressure that the system normally operates at ranges between 125 to 150 psig. The maximum quantity of ammonia on-site is 11,700 lbs.\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and the specific prevention steps.\n\nMany safety features have been incorporated into the design and installation of the ammonia refrigeration system to protect the system and its components from a catastrophic failure and release of ammonia and to minimize the impact should an incident occur. Notable safety design features include:\n\n1.    Safety cutouts installed on each compressor that will shut down the compressor should it operate outside of normal parameters.\n\n2.    Pressure relief valves have been installed on all vessels, compressors, and liquid pumps.\n\n3.    Emergency ventilation system installed in the engine room. The emergency ventilation system is automatically turned on by ammonia detectors installed inside the engine room or they can be operated manually using control switches.\n\n4.    Automatic fire sprinkler systems have been installed throughout the production, storage, dock and office areas.   \n\nIn addition to all of the safety features incorporated into the design of the sy"

In addition, the facility has established initial and refresher training requirements for ammonia refrigeration operators and mechanics as well as awareness training for all facility employees.\n\nThe Emergency Response Program.\n\nAll facility employees are trained on the hazards of ammonia and how to recognize and report accidental releases. They are also trained on evacuation procedures, where to go and what to do once they have evacuated the building. Casa de Oro Foods has trained refrigeration operators to handle small or incidental ammonia releases. Emergency response efforts have been coordinated with the Omaha, NE Fire Department and the Douglas County LEPC. Facility personnel will evaluate and respond to all ammonia releases that are within their training, capability and resources. If facility personnel cannot safely control and mitigate the release, or the incident would affect the public or the environment, the facility will notify the Omaha Police and Fire Departments for assistance.\n\nFive-year accident history.\n\nThere have been no reportable accidents within the past five tears.\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety.\n\nCasa de Oro Foods continues to evaluate improvements to the ammonia refrigeration system that would enhance safety and production."
