Facility only responds to situations that are within their capabilities. These may include, emergency shutdown, equipment isolation and pumping down the system. No emergency response actions or site clean-up that are beyond the capabilities of the refrigeration personnel will be performed. In case of an emergency, incident will be reported immediately to the RMP Program Coordinator. The RMP Program Coordinator is responsible for assisting county emergency responders upon arrival on site. This may include contacting emergency response agencies, schools, daycare centers, and acute care facilities that may be affected by the release. The RMP Program Coordinator will also be responsible for evacuation of employees if necessary and for coordination with community emergency responders if off-site evacuations are required.\n\n6. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nRecommended corrective actions to mitigate the potential for an accidental ammonia release are proposed on the tables located in RMP Binder Chapter 0.0. The table items result from recommendations made during the Process Hazard Analysis, a Code Compliance Review, Seismic Review, and a Safety Inspection performed by a qualified person. Some recommendation items in the recommendation table originate from multiple codes but are listed only once. Specific facility areas and systems categorize recommendations resulting from the Safety Inspection; some of which may repeat general Process Hazard Analysis and Code Compliance Review items. \nBased on the severity of the hazards identified, implementation deadlines are also recommended. All refrigeration equipment is well maintained and operated in a safe manner by trained personnel. Operating, maintenance, training, and safety procedures will be formalized with improved written documentation.\n\n\n*References to the hard-copy of the RMP available on-site."

Prolonged inhalation of high concentrations may cause bronchitis and/ or pneumonia, with some residual reduction in pulmonary functions. Repeated or prolonged contact of high concentrations of ammonia to the skin can cause frostbite, redness, pain and serious skin burn. See Chapter 8 Appendix 8.4 for Safety Data Sheets (SDS) for anhydrous ammonia.\n\n3. General Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\n Organic Girl, LLC maintains a release prevention program to eliminate or minimize releases. The program includes regular inspections, monitoring equipment and logging conditions, scheduled maintenance, and operator training. There is a program to analyze releases for ways to prevent a similar future release, see RMP Chapter 16 and Chapter 16 Appendix: Incident Investigation*. The ammonia refrigeration system has specific safety procedures to prevent a release. Operators and mechanics are trained for safe operation and maintenance of the refrigeration system. They are also trained in emergency response procedures in the event of an ammonia release. There are emergency shut-off switches outside the machinery room for shutting down the system. Ammonia detectors are installed in all refrigerated rooms and the machinery room. Personnel will automatically be notified if any detector exceeds its set point. Monitoring is done 24 hours per day. An emergency control box and diffusion tank allows system pressure to be relieved manually. All relief valves at the facility are tied into an ammonia diffusion tank to prevent high-pressure releases to ambient.\n\n4. Five-Year Accident History\n\nAccording to Organicgirl personnel, there has been no releases of anhydrous ammonia in the last 5 years that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, p"

At the end of the season vacuum tube and the refrigeration trailer are removed from the site. The facility house system remains operational throughout the year.\nAll compressors have safety switches that would shut down the compressors upon detection of unsafe operating conditions.  Low-pressure receiver high level float switch also shuts down the compressors when it senses high liquid level in the vessel. Refrigeration control panel inside the electrical room schedules the fan coil defrost times and monitors the ammonia detectors inside the cold rooms. System sends alarms to refrigeration manager in case of ammonia detected in cold rooms. All pressure vessels and compressors are protected against high-pressure situations by safety relief valves. There are assigned responders (refrigeration contractors) experienced with ammonia refrigeration that would respond to and determine specific actions for any incident.\nThe total ammonia charge of the refrigeration systems at the facility is approximately 21,800 lb. Refrigeration drawings are located in the Chapter 8 Appendix 8.1 (Refrigeration System Drawings) of the RMP Binder. A list of refrigeration equipment used at this facility can be found in Appendix 12 of the RMP Binder. Fixed and portable refrigeration equipment locations can be found on the plans located on sheets R1.0, R2.0, R2.1 and R2.2 in the RMP Binder. International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) Ammonia Refrigeration Safety Inspection Checklists, located in Appendix 12 of the RMP Binder, describe equipment details.\nThe refrigeration system at this facility is a single-stage vapor compression cycle.

      "SummaryText": "1. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nOrganic Girl, LLC conducts inspection procedures to review refrigeration equipment prior to startup and during operations. These procedures identify potential sources of release and equipment corrections required to prevent these releases. On-site personnel and certified refrigeration contractors review the equipment as required. On-site personnel provide initial emergency response. On-site personnel will make a preliminary assessment in the event of a release and will provide first response. First response may include emergency equipment shutdown, system isolation, or controlled operation such as pump down to prevent or reduce an off-site release. No emergency operations will be performed that are beyond the capabilities of the operators or other on-site personnel. Local fire and police departments with mutual aid response will provide emergency response for a major release event. The refrigeration contractors would also be on-call to provide emergency response. Emergency response training will be conducted yearly for current employees and as required for new employees. Records will be kept of all training performed at the site for a minimum of five (5) years.\n\n2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nOrganicgirl uses anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant in their operations. See Chapter 8 Appendix 8.1 of the RMP binder for the drawings showing the facility location map and site plan.\nThe ammonia system is used for cold storage, vacuum cooling, and water chilling operations. The refrigeration system at the facility is composed of both fixed and portable equipment. Fixed system includes, screw and reciprocating type compressors, pressure vessels, ammonia pumps, cold room evaporators (fan coils), plate-frame heat exchanger, falling film water chillers and diffusion tank. Portable systems are two half car vacuum tubes and low-side refrigeration skids.\nOne vacuum tube stays on site throughout"
