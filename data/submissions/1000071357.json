      "SummaryText": "Pioneer Frozen Foods, which is owned by C.H. Guenther & Son, Inc., operates a food manufacturing facility in Prosperity, South Carolina, that prepares and freezes baked goods for commercial use.  \r\nSection 112(r) of the Clean Air Act applies to Pioneer Frozen Foods because the plant handles and stores anhydrous ammonia in excess of threshold quantities.  The ammonia refrigeration system at Pioneer Frozen Foods uses anhydrous ammonia as the refrigerant in the freezers.  Two requirements of this section specifically apply to operations at the plant:\r\n\r\n1. Purpose and General Duty Clause - The essence of the general duty clause, \u00a1\u00b1112(r)(1), is that an owner/operator that stores and uses hazardous chemicals in any quantity has a fundamental obligation to ensure a safe operation and to have plans in place in the event of an accident to appropriately manage the situation.  Pioneer Frozen Foods is committed to the safe operation of their facility to ensure a safe workplace for our employees and a safe location for our neighbors in the community.  Pioneer Frozen Foods, therefore, has procedures in place to prevent accidents and is committed to emergency preparedness both for the plant and for the community by coordinating with the local fire department.\r\n2. Risk Management Plan - Even prior to the promulgation of \u00a1\u00b1112(r), Pioneer Frozen Foods management has been very aware of the potential hazards posed by the handling and storage of toxic chemicals.  Programs have been established to prevent accidental releases and to train personnel for emergency response in the event of a release, including maintaining a trained medical emergency response team.  \r\n\r\nIn addition to the above Clean Air Act requirements, Pioneer Frozen Foods is in compliance with the OSHA PSM requirements.\r\nThere is only one RMP-covered process at Pioneer Frozen Foods.  \r\n\r\nSeveral developments and findings have resulted from the implementation of the various elements of our accidental release prevention"

Most importantly, we stress our commitment to ensuring a safe operation for our employees, our visitors, and our community."
