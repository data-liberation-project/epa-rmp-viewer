      "SummaryText": "Introduction\n\nCalpine Corporation's South Point Energy Center uses anhydrous ammonia as a necessary part of reducing the emissions of nitrogen oxides to the atmosphere.  Storing a large quantity of ammonia can be a hazard if it is not handled properly.  As the company responsible for operating South Point Energy Center, Calpine Corporation take its safety obligations in storing and using ammonia as seriously as we take controlling emissions from the power plant.  The following document describes what could happen if there were to be an accident, the steps we take every day to ensure a safely operating plant, and what to do in the event of an emergency.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe South Point Energy Center accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates proven technology, staff training on operation and maintenance practices, and tested management system practices.  All applicable procedures of the State of Arizona and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Prevention Program are adhered to, including key elements such as training, systems management, and emergency response procedures.  \n\nThis document complies with the EPA Risk Management Program under Section 112 (r) of the Clean Air Act (CAA) Amendments of 1990, 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 68.  This document summarizes our existing health and safety programs, our internal management response procedures, and ongoing actions that are designed to prevent or minimize impacts of accidental releases of ammonia to the environment.  South Point Energy Center has prepared an emergency action plan to handle any potential accidental releases.\n\nGeneral Facility and Regulated Substances Information\n\nThe South Point Energy Center is located at 3779 Courtwright Road, Mohave Valley, Arizona, in Mohave County.  This power plant is located on a 320-acre property on the Fort Mojave Indian Reservation on the lower western slopes of the Black Mo"

      "SummaryText": "untains.  Havasu National Wildlife Refuge and the Topock Marsh lie approximately 1.2 miles south.  South Point Energy Center is a natural gas fired 544 megawatt combined cycle power plant.  Electricity generated by this facility is transported by lines owned by the Western Area Power Administration (WAPA).  Power is delivered from the plant to the Topock substation off-site by two 230 kV transmission lines in order to wheel power to the WAPA distribution grid.  The electricity will be sold under a variety of short-, mid-, and long-term contracts into the Arizona, California, and Nevada markets.\n\nThe facility currently stores anhydrous ammonia, a regulated toxic substance under RMP regulations, in two 14,193 gallon (filled to 85 percent capacity) steel bulk storage tanks.  Ammonia is used at the South Point Energy Center to reduce nitrogen oxides (NOx) created during the combustion of natural gas and exhausted from the two Combustion Turbine Generators (CTG) and Heat Recovery Steam Generators (HRSG) duct burners.  Ammonia vapor is drawn from the top of the storage tank and diluted with air, and injected into the two Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) units to reduce the NOx emissions.\n\nThe maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia stored at South Point Energy Center exceeds the federal RMP specified threshold quantities of 10,000 lbs; thus, the facility is subject to federal RMP regulations.\nRelief Valves.  Pressure relief valves are located throughout the process system to protect against excess pressure.  All process related factory-set pressure relief valves are set to protect the safety of workers and the integrity of the equipment piping from the storage tank is equipped with excess-flow valves to stop the flow from the bulk tank in event of emergency.  \n\nSecondary Containment. The ammonia storage tanks and vaporizer are located inside a secondary containment area sufficient to contain 120% of the tank capacity.  The dimension of the containment area is 43 feet by "

These monitors provide a signal to the Control Room to manually activate the deluge systems when high levels of ammonia are detected.  These sensors are located north and south of the secondary containment unit and set to alarm when an ammonia concentration of 200 ppm  is detected in the air.\n\nAlarm System.  The ammonia process is checked during every 12-hour shift as part of the normal rounds at South Point Energy Center. The storage tank is provided with local pressure indicator (in psig) and level indicators (in percent volume).  The tank also has pressure safety valves, temperature gauges, and ammonia leak detectors.  Tank level, temperature, and pressure indication is displayed locally and indication and alarms are displayed on the Control Room Distributed Control System (DCS).  \n\nEmergency Shower and Eyewash. An emergency eyewash and shower are provided at the truck unloading station near the ammonia storage tank. \n\nDeluge System.  A deluge water system, consisting of one spray monitor attached to a fire hydrant located west of the containment area, is provided to dissipate an ammonia vapor cloud in case of a leak.  The system will be manually activated in the event of an ammonia leakage.\n\nSolenoid Shut-Off Valve.  On each ammonia storage tank there is a solenoid shut-off valve. This is an electronically operated ball valve that is controlled by the DCS system to initiate valve closure in the event of a leak detected in the process piping.\n  \nSite Security.  The main gate, located on Courtwright Road on the south side of the plant,  provides the primary access to South Point Energy Center.  It is kept closed at all times and it equipped with a keypad, call box, and closed circuit camera so that the Control Room personnel may identify and grant access to visitors at the gate. A perimeter fence encloses the facility.  Th"

The results can be found in the  in the Compliance Workbook.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario Results Summary\nScenario Description: A realistic alternative release scenario was defined for the process.  The results can be found in the Compliance Workbook.\n\nRisk Considerations\nAlthough the storage and use of anhydrous ammonia has inherent potential risks; CalPine has recognized these potential risks and structured its safety programs to make the worst-case type of event non-credible.  In addition to the safety practices of the company and facility personnel to make this worst-case event non-credible, it should also be recognized that there are inherent analysis assumptions that make the results of the atmospheric dispersion analysis appear worse than what would actually be expected during such an event (e.g., In the event of a release, sudden rupture and flashing of ammonia would be highly turbulent. Turbulence causes entrainment of air and the released vapor dilutes much more quickly than is shown in the model).\n\nIn addition to the use of conservative analysis assumptions that over-predict the effects of a potential release, other characteristics of the facility and site serve to minimize the potential risks associated with an ammonia release:\nA?    There are process valves to permit isolation of any leaks in place.\nA?    The system undergoes scheduled maintenance to reduce the likelihood of catastrophic failures.\nA?    Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) is used by facility personnel, as necessary.\n\nSummary of the Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps \n\nSouth Point Energy Center is in compliance with Federal "

      "SummaryText": "our risk management program and process safety management plan to update safety information if there is a major change that would make existing information inaccurate.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis \n\nIn February 2011, a detailed process hazard analysis (PHA) was conducted with plant operations, maintenance, engineering, and administrative staff for the regulated process.  The team consisted of process operating and maintenance experts and the plant engineers.  The PHA technique used was a What If Analysis/Checklist Method, one of EPA's recommended approaches.  The PHA was led by a person knowledgeable on the type of process being reviewed.  This review will be updated again within a 5-year period or whenever there is major change in the process.  A list of actions to resolve any significant findings from the analysis was prepared, and staff is currently working to resolve this action item list.  Staff will document completion of any action item.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nSouth Point Energy Center maintains up-to-date, accurate, written operating procedures that give clear instructions for the ammonia process.  South Point Energy Center ensures effective operating practices by combining them with operating and maintenance training programs.  Standard operating procedures (SOPs) provide system descriptions, specifications, equipment inspection requirements, and operating procedures for the ammonia system.  Procedures include startup, shutdown, and normal, alternate, and emergency operation.  Also included are maintenance and troubleshooting procedures, including consequences of deviation and steps to avoid or correct deviations.  South Point Energy Center will update procedures whenever a change occurs that alters the steps needed to operate safely.  Operating procedures will be developed and implemented prior to any new process equipment coming on line or a changed process starting up.\n\nOperations and Maintenance Training Program\n\nEach South Point Energy Center employee pres"
