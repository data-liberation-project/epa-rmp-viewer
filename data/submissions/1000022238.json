      "SummaryText": "Introduction\n\nCalpine Corporation's South Point Energy Center uses anhydrous ammonia as a necessary part of reducing the emissions of nitrogen oxides to the atmosphere.  Storing a large quantity of ammonia can be a hazard if it is not handled properly.  As the company responsible for operating South Point Energy Center, Calpine Corporation take its safety obligations in storing and using ammonia as seriously as we take controlling emissions from the power plant.  The following document describes what could happen if there were to be an accident, the steps we take every day to ensure a safely operating plant, and what to do in the event of an emergency.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe South Point Energy Center accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates proven technology, staff training on operation and maintenance practices, and tested management system practices.  All applicable procedures of the State of Arizona and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Prevention Program are adhered to, including key elements such as training, systems management, and emergency response procedures.  \n\nThis document complies with the EPA Risk Management Program under Section 112 (r) of the Clean Air Act (CAA) Amendments of 1990, 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 68.  This document summarizes our existing health and safety programs, our internal management response procedures, and ongoing actions that are designed to prevent or minimize impacts of accidental releases of ammonia to the environment.  South Point Energy Center has prepared an emergency action plan to handle any potential accidental releases.\n\nGeneral Facility and Regulated Substances Information\n\nThe South Point Energy Center is located at 3779 Courtwright Road, Mohave Valley, Arizona, in Mohave County.  This power plant is located on a 320-acre property on the Fort Mojave Indian Reservation on the lower western slopes of the Black Mo"

      "SummaryText": "untains.  Havasu National Wildlife Refuge and the Topock Marsh lie approximately 1.2 miles south.  South Point Energy Center is a natural gas fired 544 megawatt combined cycle power plant.  Electricity generated by this facility is transported by lines owned by the Western Area Power Administration (WAPA).  Power is delivered from the plant to the Topock substation off-site by two 230 kV transmission lines in order to wheel power to the WAPA distribution grid.  The electricity will be sold under a variety of short-, mid-, and long-term contracts into the Arizona, California, and Nevada markets.\n\nThe facility currently stores anhydrous ammonia, a regulated toxic substance under RMP regulations, in two 14,193 gallon (filled to 85 percent capacity) steel bulk storage tanks.  Ammonia is used at the South Point Energy Center to reduce nitrogen oxides (NOx) created during the combustion of natural gas and exhausted from the two Combustion Turbine Generators (CTG) and Heat Recovery Steam Generators (HRSG) duct burners.  Ammonia vapor is drawn from the top of the storage tank and diluted with air, and injected into the two Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) units to reduce the NOx emissions.\n\nThe maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia stored at South Point Energy Center exceeds the federal RMP specified threshold quantities of 10,000 lbs; thus, the facility is subject to federal RMP regulations.\nRelief Valves.  Pressure relief valves are located throughout the process system to protect against excess pressure.  All process related factory-set pressure relief valves are set to protect the safety of workers and the integrity of the equipment piping from the storage tank is equipped with excess-flow valves to stop the flow from the bulk tank in event of emergency.  \n\nSecondary Containment. The ammonia storage tanks and vaporizer are located inside a secondary containment area sufficient to contain 120% of the tank capacity.  The dimension of the containment area is 43 feet by"

The results can be found in the  in the Compliance Workbook.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario Results Summary\nScenario Description: A realistic alternative release scenario was defined for the process.  The results can be found in the Compliance Workbook.\n\nRisk Considerations\nAlthough the storage and use of anhydrous ammonia has inherent potential risks; CalPine has recognized these potential risks and structured its safety programs to make the worst-case type of event non-credible.  In addition to the safety practices of the company and facility personnel to make this worst-case event non-credible, it should also be recognized that there are inherent analysis assumptions that make the results of the atmospheric dispersion analysis appear worse than what would actually be expected during such an event (e.g., In the event of a release, sudden rupture and flashing of ammonia would be highly turbulent. Turbulence causes entrainment of air and the released vapor dilutes much more quickly than is shown in the model).\n\nIn addition to the use of conservative analysis assumptions that over-predict the effects of a potential release, other characteristics of the facility and site serve to minimize the potential risks associated with an ammonia release:\n\u00c2\u00bf\tThere are process valves to permit isolation of any leaks in place.\n\u00c2\u00bf\tThe system undergoes scheduled maintenance to reduce the likelihood of catastrophic failures.\n\u00c2\u00bf\tPersonal Protective Equipment (PPE) is used by facility personnel, as necessary.\n\nSummary of the Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps \n\nSouth Point Energy Center is in compliance with Federal"

Oral reviews and written self-evaluations are used to verify that an employee understands the training material before the process work can be resumed. \nTraining documentation includes:  date of most recent review or revision to the training program, type of training required and the type of competency testing used to ensure staff understands the training.  Ongoing employee training records are maintained.  \n\nContractors\n\nThe South Point Energy Center has procedures and policies in place that ensure that only contractors with good safety programs are selected to perform work on and around the ammonia process.  Contractors are properly informed of the hazards, access limitations to these process areas, and emergency response procedures, and are prepared to safely complete the work.  The South Point Energy Center sets minimum contractor safety performance requirements for work in process areas, holds contractor safety briefings before allowing them near or in the process area, controls access to the process areas, and evaluates the contractor's performance.\n\nPre-Startup Safety Review and Mechanical Integrity Program\n\nSouth Point Energy Center ensures that a pre-startup safety review is completed for any new regulated process at the plant, or for significant modifications to an existing covered process that requires a change in the process safety information.

      "SummaryText": "46 feet by 39 inches high.\n\nLeak Detection. Two Chillgard RT leak detectors are provided for the system to perform ambient ammonia monitoring.  These monitors provide a signal to the Control Room to manually activate the deluge systems when high levels of ammonia are detected.  These sensors are located north and south of the secondary containment unit and set to alarm when an ammonia concentration of 200 ppm  is detected in the air.\n\nAlarm System.  The ammonia process is checked during every 12-hour shift as part of the normal rounds at South Point Energy Center. The storage tank is provided with local pressure indicator (in psig) and level indicators (in percent volume).  The tank also has pressure safety valves, temperature gauges, and ammonia leak detectors.  Tank level, temperature, and pressure indication is displayed locally and indication and alarms are displayed on the Control Room Distributed Control System (DCS).  \n\nEmergency Shower and Eyewash. An emergency eyewash and shower are provided at the truck unloading station near the ammonia storage tank. \n\nDeluge System.  A deluge water system, consisting of one spray monitor attached to a fire hydrant located west of the containment area, is provided to dissipate an ammonia vapor cloud in case of a leak.  The system will be manually activated in the event of an ammonia leakage.\n\nSolenoid Shut-Off Valve.  On each ammonia storage tank there is a solenoid shut-off valve. This is an electronically operated ball valve that is controlled by the DCS system to initiate valve closure in the event of a leak detected in the process piping.\n  \nSite Security.  The main gate, located on Courtwright Road on the south side of the plant,  provides the primary access to South Point Energy Center.  It is kept closed at all times and it equipped with a keypad, call box, and closed circuit camera so that the Control Room personnel may identify and grant access to visitors at the gate.
