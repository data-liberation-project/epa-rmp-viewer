The WTP provides potable water to the service area.  As a part of this operation, hazardous materials are used to help meet the quality demands of its customers and are committed to compliance with regulations, which protect the public health. This plan is updated and resubmitted to accommodate any plant changes in chemical delivery systems or chemical quantities or at least every five years.\n\nThis submission is a summary of the overall safety and release prevention programs in place. The prevention program includes the Cal-OSHA General Industrial Safety Orders Section 5189 requirements that a Process Safety Management (PSM) program. This program is required to be in place in order to prevent or minimize the consequences of catastrophic releases of Highly Hazardous Materials handled by the facility in quantities in excess of the Threshold Quantities stated in Appendix A of Section 5189.  The PSM Program meets the requirements of Section 5189 and the Federal and State regulations for a prevention program.  \n\ni-2  Accidental Release Prevention and Response Policies\nGSWC is committed to the safe operation of its facilities to protect its workers, the public and the environment. It is the policy of GSWC that all elements of the PSM program required by the Cal-OSHA General Industrial Safety Orders Section 5189 and Federal OSHA and all elements Federal EPA Risk Management Plan (RMP) and the California Accidental Release Prevention Program (CalARP) contained herein shall be maintained current and shall be implemented fully for all activities concerning chlorine handling at the Coloma Treatment "

In order to accomplish this goal, GSWC has gathered safety information on chlorine and on the process, equipment and procedures involving chlorine; performed a structured assessment of the hazards of the process and external events which might affect the process; performed an offsite consequence analysis of defined release scenarios; established a written program for prevention and mitigation of releases; and established a written emergency program coordinated with emergency response agencies.\n\nFurthermore, it is the policy of GSWC that all affected employees shall be informed of the existence and content of the required PSM program elements, and that employees shall be actively involved in the development and updating of these required elements. Responsibility for regulatory compliance and maintenance of the management plan reside with the employees, Water Supply Superintendent and District Manager. \n\ni-3  Description Of The Plant And The Regulated Substances Handled\nThe WTP is owned by the Golden State Water Company (GSWC). It is located at 11200 Coloma Drive in Rancho Cordova, California. GSWC is committed to providing needed services to local residents, businesses and visitors to Rancho Cordova, and to being a positive influence on the community. This includes respect for the safety of the public and Company employees, as well as concern for the environment.\n\nThe WTP began operation in the early 1970's and the current systems for handling chlorine were installed as a part of a plant improvement project that occurred in 1993. The facility is located in a commercial/residential neighborhood across the street from a fire station. \n\nChlorine is handled as a liquefied gas under pressure in steel containers. Chlorine exceeds the 2500-pound threshold amount set by the EPA RMP (40 CFR Part 68), 1500 pounds set by Cal OSHA PSM and the 100-pound limit set by the State of California CalARP threshold quantity.\n\nChlorine is received in ton containers by truck, handle"

The chlorine is used to control biological growth on the filters and to disinfect the treated water. \n\nThe limits of the processes include all the equipment, facilities and procedures to handle chlorine while it is in concentrated form. Once these chemicals reach the mixing equipment, they are no longer in concentrations that would make them hazardous and they now pose little risk to workers and no risk to the public.\n\nSpecific quantities handled and additional details of the systems are included in the details of the applicable compliance submittals to both EPA and Sacramento County.\n\ni-4  Worst Case Release Scenario\nAs required by both EPA and California regulations, GSWC has evaluated the worst-case scenario using parameters mandated in those regulations. The worst-case scenario is the rupture of the largest chlorine cylinder and the loss of the entire contents over at 10-minute period. The distance to the toxic endpoint was determined using tables and equations provided by the EPA, more specifically, its software RMP*Comp. \n\nThe EPA dispersion model does allow some minor reduction due to the release being enclosed in a building. The maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 3 ppm chlorine as well as the population impacted and sensitive public receptors is listed in the details of this submittal and per recent regulatory changes are not included in this Executive Summary.\n\nThe worst-case scenario was developed following EPA regulations and it is not considered to be a likely release scenario for emergency planning. Historically throughout the chlorine industry, a rupture of a chlorine cylinder is very rare. Additionally, EPA mandates that assumed meteorological conditions be the most conservative. Therefore, the results of this worst-case scenario off-site consequence analysis are extremely conservative.\n\nThe only administrative control used to limit the worst cas"

These were first presented in the 1994 Risk Management and Prevention Plan (RMPP). The American Water Works Association Research Foundation's Compliance Guide and Model Risk Management Program for Water Treatment Plants (AWWA Compliance Guidance) was also used to describe emergency planning scenarios.\n\nOne scenario considered involved a gaseous release for chlorine. Because of the inherent safety provided by the integral yoke regulators, just one of the suggested release scenarios from the AWWA was submitted. The details of the scenarios, the map of the areas of concern and the sensitive receptors within the vulnerability zone around the WTP are included in the details of the report but in compliance with recent regulatory changes they are not included in this Executive Summary.\n\ni-6  General Accident Prevention Program and Chemical-specific Prevention \n\ni-6.1  Management System\nThe Golden State Water Company's Coloma WTP has developed a management system to plan, organize, implement and control the risk management program elements. GSWC's management system was developed to maintain and continually improve the risk management program elements and plan updates. This system satisfies the management system requirement for Program 3 processes under OSHA regulations. The individual responsibilities are summarized below and discussed in more detail in Section 5 of this plan.

Refresher training is provided on an as-needed basis and following any changes to procedures. Annually, these procedures are reviewed and revised as needed to ensure they reflect current practices and regulatory requirements. Support staff is used to facilitate submissions to agencies as required by regulations.\nControlling - The Water Quality Engineer in conjunction with designees will conduct periodic internal reviews or audits against the goals and objectives of the program elements, facilitate submissions to agencies as required by regulations and plan to meet future regulatory changes and updates.\n\n\ni-6.2  Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nThe prevention programs described in the following section represent integrated administrative controls intended to ensure the safety of workers, the public, and the environment. Many of these prevention programs (e.g., PHAs, Compliance Audits, Incident Investigation) result in the development and implementation of additional safeguards (administrative and engineering controls). Those recommendations that are planned for implementation are discussed in Planned Changes to Improve Safety. Those applicable safeguards that have already been implemented or that were part of the original design are summarized below and described in more detail in section 6.2.5.

The WTP conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the Process Safety Regulations are being implemented. These audits are carried out periodically and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner. The most recent audit was conducted in October 2009.\n\nIncident Investigation. The WTP promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance. The date of the most recent incident investigation was August 2006. These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring. All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years. \n\nEmployee Participation. The WTP believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort. Employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements. In addition, employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the Process Safety regulations, including information resulting from process hazard analyses. \n\nHot Work Permit Program. Pertinent personnel are notified when hot work (i.e., any spark-producing operation including grinding, burning, welding, brazing) is to be performed at the WTP and they assure that appropriate safety precautions are taken prior to initiation of the work. The hot work pe"

As an extra layer of protection, no hot work is performed in the Chlorine area when chlorine cylinders are present.\n\nContractors. On rare occasion, the WTP hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities. The WTP has a strict policy of informing all contractors and visitors of known potential hazards related to the contractor's work and the covered process. Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for an emergency response should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur. \n\ni-7   Five-Year Accident History\nThe WTP has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last 5 years. Due to stringent release prevention equipment and policies, there has been no accidental release during this period that caused any onsite death, injury or significant property damage, or known offsite death, injury, property damage, environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place.\n\ni-8  Emergency Response Plan\nThe WTP maintains a written Hazardous Material Business Plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials. The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas.\n\nTo ensure proper functioning, the facility's emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced. In addition, the plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within the covered processes that would require a modified emergency response.\n\ni-9  Continuous Efforts to Improve Safety  \nSeveral developments and findings have resulted from the implementation of the various elements of our accidental release prevention program. There is a commitment to continue to improve safety by reviewing, revising, and enhancing written procedures as well as implem"

Written procedures were enhanced in 2008 to include additional safety and equipment check steps and development of specific chlorine delivery procedures related to supplier communication. Action items included installing an emergency shower in close proximity to personnel exit door, installing exhaust fan, windsock and a container scale. None of the action items resulting from the PHA or Internal Audit are critical or essential; rather they represent enhancements or continuous improvement."
