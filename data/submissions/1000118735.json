      "SummaryText": "Nucor Insulated Panel Group RMP-covered process consists of infrastructure, equipment, devices, and auxiliary support systems, all of which make up its foam panel manufacturing process.  Specifically, the insulative foam implanted within the panels is known as polyurethane foam.  Polyurethane foam is one of the most efficient insulating materials available on the market today. The foam's insulating abilities are due to the fact that the material is composed of solid foam cells that encapsulate vapor/gas. The foam cells are completely closed, which means that the vapor cannot escape, as well as that air and moisture are unable to infiltrate. \n\nNucor Insulated Panel Group  covered chemical is a blend of Cyclopentane and Isopentane known as CP-80 - the mixture is composed of 80% Cyclopentane and 20% Isopentane, by weight.  CP-80 is used as a \"blowing agent\". A blowing agent is defined as a chemical that is capable of producing a cellular structure via a foaming process in which material(s) undergo hardening and/or other phase transition; blowing agents are generally applied when the blown material is still in a liquid stage.  The other two primary chemicals that are used in the polyurethane foam manufacturing process are polyether polyol and isocyanate.  When these ingredients are injected into a cavity, a chemical reaction occurs, which produces insulative foam material.  This foam will rapidly expand until it fills the cavity shell - the time for this reaction to completely occur necessarily varies based on the size of the cavity and exact blend of chemicals. As the foam solidifies, it closes, hardens, and becomes impermeable at the cellular level, trapping Cyclopentane/Isopentane and carbon dioxide vapor inside those cells. The complete reaction, which is known as polymerization, typically lasts about 2-5 minutes. The chemical reaction that takes place is irreversible and its component gases are permanently trapped with the now solid foam material.\n\nThe covered foam"

To ensure that this covered polyurethane foaming process remains in a safe state at all times and that the opportunity for covered chemical to release outside of the process and equipment is absolutely minimized, Nucor Insulated Panel Group  process equipment and support systems were designed, constructed, and installed with a \"Safety First\" mentality.  In addition to the process and equipment being designed inherently safe, the facility will employ numerous safety systems to prevent an unintended release of chemical.  Specifically, process- and support-related safety systems that have been installed and used associated with the covered process include the following:\n- Pressure relief systems on the bulk storage AST - two (2) redundant pairs of PRVs, which will allow for maintenance and replacement of PRVs without isolating the entire pressure relief safeguard, which would temporaril"
