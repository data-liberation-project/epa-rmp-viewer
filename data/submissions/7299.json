This program is implemented in California as the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program.\n\nThe scope of this RMP is based on discussions with the Administering Agency (AA), the city of Oxnard Fire Department, to ensure that all issues are resolved and to incorporate state requirements.  With input from the AA, the ammonia storage and handling facility was identified as the only process that triggers the RMP/CalARP requirements.  This process was determined to be covered by Program 2 requirements.  The process hazard review technique was presented to and approved by the AA and the level of detail for this RMP submission agreed upon.\n\n\n1.2    General Description of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substance\n\n    Ormond Beach Generating Station, located in Oxnard, California, is an electric generating station consisting of two units each rated at 750 MW.  These units, which are capable of combusting either fuel oil or natural gas, are equipped with Selective Catalytic Reduction Systems (SCR) for the control of oxides of nitrogen (NOx) emissions.  These SCRs employ ammonia injection technology which reduces NOx emissions by approximately 80%.  Aqueous ammonia is also used in the station water treatment system for pH control, and in the demineralizer system for the regeneration of anion and cation exchange resins.  Aqueous ammonia is classified as a toxic chemical subject to the RMP/CalARP requirements.  Aqueous ammonia used is a 30% "

      "SummaryText": "solution of ammonia in water, ammonium hydroxide (CAS Number 7664-41-7).\n\nThe ammonia storage and handling system at Ormond Beach Generating station is comprised of two storage tanks, pumps, and piping which terminate at the vaporizer where the aqueous ammonia is atomized to concentrations below 20%.  Each tank is 20000 gal in volume and are equipped with pressure relief valves, flame arrester, temperature, pressure, and level indicators.  The piping consists of  both 1 and 2 inch I.D. pipes with branch piping to the station water treatment system and to the demineralizer system.   \n\n    All other regulated substances onsite are in quantities below applicable thresholds.\n\n1.3    Offsite Consequence Analysis Results\n\n    The Offsite Consequence Analysis (OCA) prepared in support of this RMP utilized the methodologies recommended by EPA and employed the RMP*Comp, Version 1.06 modeling system.  The following release scenarios were hypothesized:\n\nRelease Scenario I - Worst-Case \n\nThe entire contents of the aqueous ammonia storage tanks are released through a failed tank or pipe within the secondary concrete containment dike large enough to contain the entire contents.  Under worst-case meteorological conditions, 1.5 m/s wind speed and a stable (Pasquill F) atmospheric stability class, the ammonia cloud could travel 0.4 miles before dispersing sufficiently to no longer pose a health hazard to the public.\n\nRelease Scenario II - Alternative \n\nThe entire contents of the delivery truck's hose carrying aqueous ammonia between the shut-off valve on the truck and hook-up at the tank is released by a failed delivery hose outside of secondary containment.  Active mitigation consists of the truck's operator closing the truck's shut-off valve and diluting the ammonia spill with water.  Under average meteorological conditions, 3.0 m/s wind speed and a neutral (Pasquill D) atmospheric stability class, the ammonia cloud could travel 0.1 miles before dispersing sufficiently to no longer pose a "

      "SummaryText": "health hazard to the public.\n\nRelease Scenario III - Alternative \n\nThe entire contents of all piping carrying aqueous ammonia between the ammonia pump skid and the vaporizer is released through a failed pipe outside of secondary containment.  Active mitigation includes manual or automatic shut down of the ammonia pumps by the plant operators.  Under average meteorological conditions, the ammonia cloud could travel 0.1 miles before dispersing sufficiently to no longer pose a health hazard to the public.\n\nRelease Scenario IV - Alternative \n\nA connector, flange, etc. fails resulting in the leak of approximately 50 gallons of aqueous ammonia outside of secondary containment.  Active mitigation consists of automatic or manual shutoff of affected pump and its isolation pending repair and dilution of the spill with water.  Under average meteorological conditions, the ammonia cloud could travel 0.1 miles before dispersing sufficiently to no longer pose a health hazard to the public.\n\nRelease Scenario V - Alternative \n\nAqueous ammonia is released though a corrosion caused hole = inch in diameter outside of  the secondary containment between the secondary containment dike and the ammonia pump skid.  Active mitigation consists of regular equipment inspection and maintenance program.  Under average meteorological conditions, the ammonia cloud could travel 0.1 miles before dispersing sufficiently to no longer pose a health hazard to the public.\n\n\n1.4    Summary of the Five-Year Accident History\n\nThere have been no accidental releases from the aqueous ammonia storage and  handling system at Ormond Beach Generating Station in the past five years that have resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.

After thorough review, the existing system was found to be prudently designed, operated and maintained.  Following are additional enhancements which will further ensure the safety of the aqueous ammonia storage and handling system:\n\n7 Install magnetic level gage with flipper indicators (April 30, 2000)\n7 Add flashing or rotating warning light in addition to existing audio alarm from ammonia gas detectors (April 30, 2000)\n7 Install additional pipe supports per seismic assessment  (April 30, 2000)\n\n"
