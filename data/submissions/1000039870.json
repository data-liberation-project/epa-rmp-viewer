              "Description": "     The one-ton containers are stored in an enclosed building. The cylinders are connected to the main header via whip lines.  The main header is connected by piping that runs under grating in the floor to the pressure regulators and switchover valve. The system goes from pressure to vacuum at this point. The vacuum piping runs into the chlorinator room. The cylinder storage room and the chlorinator room has a chlorine gas detection alarm system to warn of a chlorine gas leak as well as a ventilation system to force in fresh air and draw exhaust air into a gas scrubber system. The ventilation and scrubber system are activated automatically in the event of a chlorine gas leak. Leak detector also actuates the automatic shutdown of container valves.                                                                                                                                               The chlorine is then directed by a series of valves through one of three separate chlorinators. Another series of valves control the application of the chlorine. Chlorine continues to be drawn through underground piping to the point of application. The vacuum is created by an open impeller induction system that draws the chlorine directly into the water stream.  The induction system also mixes the chlorine with the water stream just prior to entering the chlorine contact chamber where a minimum 20 minute contact time is maintained for disinfection. ",

      "SummaryText": "Brushy Creek Regional Wastewater System - East owned by the cities of Austin, Round Rock, and Cedar Park. Operated by the Brazos River Authority.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Brushy Creek Regional Wastewater System - East is an innovative and cost-effective regional sewerage system that serves the wastewater treatment needs of the urban areas in and around the city of Round Rock, Texas, including portions of Austin, Cedar Park, and local Utility Districts. The plant began expansion to a regional facility in 1995.  This first expansion was completed in 1997 and provided a treatment system capacity of 11.8 million gallons per day (MGD) permitted average flow, and a 2-hour peak flow of 21,319 gallons per minute (GPM). The facility was again expanded in 2007/2008.  The current system has an annual average flow limit of 21.5 MGD, and a 2-hour peak flow of 52,083 GPM.  \n\n\n\nThe primary mechanism for bacterial disinfection of the effluent stream utilizes ultraviolet (UV) light.  The chlorine and sulfur dioxide systems are in place to serve as secondary disinfection and/or back-up for the UV system.\n\n\n\nOnly chlorine and sulfur dioxide are stored above the allowable Threshold quantity.\n\n\n\nCHLORINE\n\n\n\nChlorine serves to destroy disease-causing organisms in the Treatment Plant effluent.  When using chlorine as the effluent disinfection mechanism, it is essential to maintain a chlorine residual of at least 1.0 mg/I after 20 minutes contact. The recommended dose for application to effluent from the activated sludge process is eight mg/L.\n\n\n\nThe chlorine is stored in one-ton containers and divided into groups of two containers each.  One group is in use, the second is held as backup and the third and forth groups are held in reserve. Each group is connected to a header that is provided with a separate vacuum regulator, which reduces the gas from a varying supply pressure to a constantly regulated vacuum. Chlorine gas feeder cabinets are wall-mounted in the Chlorination Room. Each feeder is equipped w"

      "SummaryText": "ith a manual rate control valve located on and adjusted from the front of the cabinet as well as an automatic control valve, operated by PLC. Sufficient valving has been provided to allow different feeders to serve different junction boxes. Induction units provide the vacuum required to pull the chlorine gas to the various points of application. These induction units create a vacuum through a motor driven open propeller, located 24 inches below the minimum water surface, which also provides mixing of the chlorine gas with the wastewater and feeds directly into the Chlorine Contact Chambers. Chlorine feed rates are adjusted by the automatic rotameters in response to changes in the flow rate. The chlorine contact chambers are d to adequately disinfect plant effluent at permitted peak flows. \n\n\n\nSULFUR DIOXIDE\n\n\n\nThe  concentration  of  the  chlorine  residual measured  at  the effluent  weirs  of  the  Chlorine Contact  Chambers  is  used  to determine  the  amount of sulfur dioxide dosed  at  the  Effluent Structure. The plant effluent flow is to be dechlorinated to less than 0.1 mg/l chlorine residual for discharge.\n\n\n\nSulfur dioxide is stored in one-ton containers, also connected to separate headers that are mounted on anchored supports.  Almost all of the equipment used for sulfur dioxide feeding and induction, with the exception of the rotameters and some materials of construction, is identical to the equipment used for chlorine induction.\n\n\n\nSulfur dioxide gas feeders, or manual rotameters, are wall-mounted. Each rotameter is equipped with a manual and automatic rate control valve. Three of these rotameters have been supplied, each capable of delivering the maximum recommended dose of sulfur dioxide. Sufficient valving has been provided so that either induction unit for this system may be fed through any rotameter.\n\n\n\nSulfonation (the process of sulfur dioxide reduction of the chlorine residual) takes place almost instantly. For this reason, it is not necessary "

Sulfur dioxide is introduced into the flow at the Effluent Structure.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nAuthority policies include the need for a written emergency action plan, exercises and reviews of the plan, emergency response training for facility personnel, and coordination with local responders.  In addition, monthly safety inspections are conducted by the Authority's Safety Training Officer.  Risk management consultants from our insurance company are used as resources.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\n\n\nThe chemical storage area is enclosed and equipped with the latest technology to contain and scrub any chemical releases. Plant personnel are trained to handle chemical containers in such a manner as to prevent leaks or spills while connecting or disconnecting containers.  Personnel are also trained to shut down the system by closing the container valve in the event of an emergency or anticipated emergency. \n\n\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\n\n\nThere were no reportable accidental releases of regulated chemicals in the last five years.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\n\n\nBrushy Creek - East staff have the capability to respond to and mitigation of an incidental leak of on-site hazardous substances where the substances can be absorbed, neutralized, or otherwise controlled at the time of release by employees in the immediate release area, or by maintenance personnel, as well as responses to releases of hazardous substances where there is minimal potential safety or health hazard (i.e. fire, explosion, or chemical exposure).  If the spill/release is beyond the capability of onsite personnel, the City of Round Rock and Williamson County HAZMAT teams will respond by calling 911. Training and exercises are to be conducted periodically. The city and county have conducted a regional WMD terrorism exercise, which included the intentional release of hazardous chemicals. They cond"

Security enhancements and procedures have been made since 9-11 and continuous improvements are made as resources become available."
