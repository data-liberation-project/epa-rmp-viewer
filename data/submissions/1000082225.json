The cylinder replacement procedures are based on\n\nthe manufacturer's recommendations. Employees also review operating procedures and\n\nmaintenance tasks daily, or as needed per manufacturer's recommendations. The prevention\n\nprogram for this facility is a Level 2. Lockout/tagout procedures are used to help prevent an\n\naccidental release of chlorine. When maintenance is conducted on the chlorination system, the\n\nWater Operator approves the proper installation of materials, and complete installation with final\n\napproval of changes in the system by the Mississippi State Health Department. Any change in\n\nmaintenance procedures is reviewed and approved by the same operator. All operators at this\n\nfacility are knowledgeable in the proper start-up and shut-down procedures for the water\n\ntreatment operations. All components of the chlorination system are visually inspected at least\n\ndaily.\n\n\n\nOur emergency response (action) plan was developed with the assistance of FC&E Engineering,\n\nLLC, Engineering Service Consulting Engineers, Harcros Chemical Chlorine Response Team,\n\nthe Bovina Fire Department, and the Warren County Emergency Management Agency. If a\n\nchlorine release occurs at the 101 Birdsong Road, Vicksburg Mississippi location a chlorine\n\ndetector will activate an outside siren system. The water treatment plant operator detecting the\n\nalarm will notify the CWD General Manager who will get personnel organized for an emergency\n\naction. On-duty personnel have SCBA equipment that they will use to enter the confined space\n\n(due to a potentially toxic atmosphere) in which the chlorine cylinders are stored and determine\n\nthe extent of release.

The release will be slowed by employees not starting the\n\nmanual vent system in the chlorine room until notification to the 911 response system is made,\n\nand evacuation activities begin. This will not prevent chlorine from being released from a\n\ncylinder, but will contain the release for some time to facilitate orderly response.\n\nActive mitigation of a release will consist of manual shutoffs, automatic vacuum feed chlorine\n\nsystem shut-down, and water deluge using fire protection water hoses. Alternative passive\n\nmitigation would consist of continued release into the enclosed space of the chlorine building\n\npending emergency response. It is assumed that the contents of the cylinder would be released as\n\nvapor, as there is no activity involving the liquid port on the chlorine cylinder. The area\n\nsurrounding the facility is generally rural and consists of relatively rolling terrain with sparse vegetation.

This facility falls under the NAICS Code 22131. The last\n\nreview and update of the safety information for this facility was performed on December 10,\n\n2010. The facility is subject to the handling codes of the National Fire Protection Association\n\n(NFPA) for compressed gas cylinder storage; the American National Standards Institute (ANSI);\n\nand the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME). These standards, along with the\n\napplicable Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) standards (compliance not\n\nrequired for municipal facilities), have been implemented through written policy and procedure\n\nmanuals. Even though this is a municipal facility and not governed by OSHA regulations, the\n\nCulkin WTP has decided to utilize Process Safety Management protocol as the prevention\n\nprogram (level 3 guidance). To prevent/limit releases, this facility operates the chlorine feed\n\nsystem on an automatic vacuum feed system, manual shut off valves, and delayed manual vent\n\nfan operation to control the potential release of chlorine from the enclosed chlorine facility. The\n\nvacuum feed regulators are cylinder-mounted; therefore, the system will shut off the chlorine\n\nfeed from the cylinders if there is a feed line leak anywhere from the chlorine tank valve to the\n\ninjector. Employees at the Culkin WTP perform maintenance checks on all chlorine system\n\ncomponents involved with the chlorination system on a daily basis. These checks involve reading\n\nand recording the chlorine cylinder weights, inspecting the cylinders visually, examining the feed\n\nlines, valves, and regulators, etc. The employees at the Culkin WTP practice safe handling of\n\nchlorine, and follow the manufacturer's recommendations for operational and maintenance\n\nprocedures.
