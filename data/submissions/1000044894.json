A contractor, Ag. Express, provides the labor and equipment to unload the ammonia from railcar and react the ammonia with phosphoric acid to produce a non-hazardous agricultural liquid fertilizer, ammonia polyphosphate, commonly known as ?10-34-0\".  This Risk Management Plan incorporates by reference the elements of the Risk Management Plan produced and maintained by the contractor. The facility stores the following quantities of regulated substances:\n\n-    Anhydrous Ammonia - 320,000 pounds\n\n\n\nAtmospheric dispersion modeling has to be performed to determine the distance traveled by the toxic substance released before its concentration decreases to the toxic endpoint selected by the EPA (0.14 mg/L for anhydrous ammonia). This is defined by the American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA) as the ?maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without which could impair an individuals ability to take protective action. The residential population within a radius corresponding to the toxic endpoint distance has to be defined, to estimate the population potentially affected.\n\n\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program is based on the following key elements:\n\n-    High level of training of the operators.\n\n-    Preventative maintenance programs.\n\n-    Use of state-of-the-art process and safety equipment.\n\n-    Use of accurate and effective operating procedures, written with the participation of the operators.\n\n-    Performance of a process hazard analysis of equipment and procedures.\n\n-    Implementation of an auditing and inspection program.\n\n\n\nThere have been no reportable releases at Fertizona Willcox LLC in the past five years.\n\n\n\nFertizona Willcox LLC will fully implement the RMP and will initiate appropriate changes as needed to maintain a safe"
