The Facility Policy\n\n    The owner, and employees of Barr Farms, are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of  \n    anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the  \n    local fire company, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to  \n    people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information.\n\n   - This facility is a privately owned commercial farm.\n   - Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application for crop production  \n     nutrients. \n   - The maximum quantity stored would be 92,000 pounds.  The maximum quantity handled would be the  \n     storage tank of 92,000 pounds.\n\n3. The accidental release prevention program.\n\n    The facility has implemented the provisions of Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of  \n    Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1, published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc., and the   \n    standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111,  \n    Storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia.\n\n4. The Five-year Accident History \n\n   a. There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that:\n\n   - Have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility: nor to our knowledge,  \n     have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or  \n     environmental damage.\n\n\n5. The Emergency action program.\n\n   a.  The facility is included in the community emergency response plan developed under 42 U.S.C. 11003.\n        This is the hazardous material plan developed and maintained by our Local Emergency Planning\n        Committee (LEPC).\n\n   b.  Barr Farms has elected not to respond and has coordinated the emergency response with LaPorte\n        County I"

If a large release of anhydrous ammonia takes place at6 the facility, the required response action is to\n        evacuate the area of the spill and call 911 and all applicable emergency response numbers.\n\n        1.  Within 15 minutes of determining that the amount oif the release would be over 100 pounds, the\n             Emergency Coordinator will notify:\n\n                    The National Emergency Response Center @ 800-424-8802\n\n        2.  Immediately (within 1/2 hour) after determining that the amount or release would be over 100\n             pounds, the Emergency Cooordinator will notify:\n\n                    Indiana Dept. Of Environmental Management @ 317-233-7745\n\n6. Planned changes to improve safety.\n\n    Safety improvement is and on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to  \n    assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia   \n    safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
