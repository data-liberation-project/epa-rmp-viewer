      "SummaryText": "Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:\n\nThe City of Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (LADWP) accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates technologies, procedures, and management practices.  All applicable procedures of the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Prevention Program are adhered to.  The LADWP emergency response policy involves the preparation of response plans that are tailored to each facility and to the emergency response services available in the community, and is in compliance with the State and Federal Emergency Response Program requirements.\n\nGeneral Description of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substance:\n\nHaynes Generating Station (HGS), located at 6801 Westminster Avenue in Long Beach, California 90803 is a gas-fired electricity generating facility that supplies electrical power to the LADWP system.  The facility consists of six natural gas combustion boilers with a total capacity of 1580 megawatts of electric power.  Three boilers are equipped with selective catalytic reduction (SCR) units to control emissions of nitric oxides (NOx), a combustion byproduct that is a precursor to ozone.  In the presence of a catalyst housed in the SCR units, ammonia (NH3) gas that is a reducing agent, is injected into the flue gas to react with NOx to form water vapor and nitrogen gas (N2), an inert gas and the abundant component of atmospheric air.\n\nThe ammonia solution handling and storage system supplies the solution to the nitric oxides emissions control catalyst in the SCR.  Ammonia solution is used instead of anhydrous ammonia because the latter has some serious inherent safety hazards requiring significant precautions and safety equipment in handling and storing.  The health and safety risks related to anhydrous ammonia outweigh the higher costs for transportation and storage of ammonia solution.  Ammonia solution "

      "SummaryText": "at 29% concentration (29% ammonia and 71% water) is stored in six 37,500 gallon, aboveground tanks.  The maximum inventory is 30,000 gallons per tank.  The tanks are each 37-foot long horizontal cylinders with 14-foot diameters and are surrounded by a containment system consisting of 6 inch thick, 142.5 feet long, 62.5 feet wide, and 3 feet high concrete walls.  A 6-gallon-per-minute (gpm) pump dispenses ammonia solution from the tanks to the emission control equipment.  Other safety equipment associated with these tanks are: pressure/vacuum relief valves, liquid level alarms, two ammonia vapor scrubbers, quick fill connections, vapor recovery system, and eight strategically-located ammonia vapor detectors.  Ammonia solution is delivered by truck into the storage tanks through a quick fill connection, located behind safety/collision barriers.  The truck parks within a sloped containment area, which drains to a sump.  A truck-mounted vapor recovery system is connected to the tank vapor recovery system during the unloading of the solution.  The storage tanks are equipped with pressure and vacuum relief valves and the tanks are maintained at ambient temperature and atmospheric pressure.  The loading operator is provided with a readily accessible water supply to wash spills quickly into the unloading area sump for rapid containment.  Flashing lights and audible alarms at the storage area and in the main control room are activated when the ammonia gas monitors detect the gas concentration above 20 parts per million in the surrounding area.\n\nAmmonia solution is pumped from storage tanks to an evaporator and air mixing chamber system, one for each SCR.   Heated air is provided to the systems by dilution air fans and heaters.  The air/water vapor/ammonia mixture is then injected in the flue gas that enters the SCR bed where a catalyst promotes the reaction.  The boiler load and exhaust flow rate, and the nitric oxides concentration in the exhaust control the feed rate of am"

The OCA is performed to determine the distance traveled by the ammonia released before its concentration decreases to the \"toxic endpoint\" of 0.14 mg/l, which is the Emergency Response Planning Guideline Level 2 (ERPG-2).\n\nThe worst-case release scenario involves the failure of a bulk storage tank containing 30,000 gallons of ammonia solution; this storage quantity corresponds to 80% of the designed tank volume of 37,500 gallons.  The entire volume of the solution from one tank is contained within the secondary containment system abd has a maximum surface area for evaporation of 4,560 square feet.  The RMP*Comp regulatory default meteorological parameters including wind stability F, wind speed 1.5 m/s, air temperature of 770 F, 50% average humidity and urban surroundings, were used.  The toxic endpoint distance for the worst-case release is reported to be at 0.2 miles (0.3 kilometers) from the ammonia storage area.  All offsite public receptors potentially affected within this distance are located on the west side of the facility west property line.  They include part of San Gabriel River, public bike paths on the east and west river banks, and the eastern part of the Alamitos Generating Station, a privately owned electric generating facility.\n\nThe alternative release scenario involves the spill of the ammonia solution as a result of the rupture of a 3 inch diameter, 20 feet long flexible fill line during the bulk transferring of the solution from a tanker truck to the storage tanks.  The transfer pump is shut off two minutes after the leak has been detected.  The volume of spilled solution is estimated to be 50 gallons, which is collected in the 9 cubic feet unloading area sump.

The distance to the toxic endpoint reported by the RMP* Comp for this scenario is less than 0.1 miles from the ammonia storage area.  For the purpose of identifying the distance for in-plant health and safety planning, a refined air dispersion modeling was performed using United States Air Force Toxic Chemical Dispersion model (AFTOX).  The model identified the distance to be at 0.01 miles, the shortest distance reported by the model, using local meteorological conditions and urban surroundings.\n\nSummary of the General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Ammonia Accidental Release Prevention:\n\nThe general LADWP accidental release prevention program is based on the following key elements:\n7 High level of training of the operators in safe handling of chemicals,\n7 Effective preventive maintenance program,\n7 Use of state-of-the-art process and safety equipment,\n7 Use of accurate and effective operating procedures, written with the participation of the operators,\n7 Performance of a hazard review of equipment and procedures, and\n7 Implementation of an auditing and inspection program.\n\nOther specific steps to prevent accidental ammonia releases include:\n7 The extensive training of the operators in the safe handling of ammonia, with emphasis on the hazardous and toxic properties of the chemical,\n7 Required ammonia safe handling training of tank truck drivers from suppliers as well as their equipment preventive maintenance program,\n7 The availability of self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) at close proximity to the storage tanks,\n7 The installation of tank liquid levels alarm, pressure levels alarm, pressure/vacuum relief valves, vapor recovery system, gas scrubbers, and ammonia gas detectors around the storage area.\n7 The installation of secondary containment system and sumps\n7 Water deluge syste"

Emergency response drills and drill evaluations are conducted every year; emergency operation and response procedures are also reviewed at that time.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:\n\n18 Minor changes to enhance the ammonia process safety were identified as the results of a Hazard Operability (HAZOP) study session with the facility management, operations and maintenance, and plant engineering.  These recommended changes have been either completed or evaluated for implementation as required."
