ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\r\nAt this Butterball facility, 401 North Main Street, Carthage, MO., we utilize anhydrous ammonia which is considered hazardous by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).  The Butterball Carthage, MO facility kills, eviscerates and debones whole turkeys for foodservice distribution.  Many areas of the plant are refrigerated to preserve poultry products. The properties which make ammonia valuable as a refrigerant also necessitate certain safety precautions.  Butterball  strives to protect all its valuable resources and assets - both personnel and property.  \r\nWe live and have families in this community.  We want to prevent exposure to all our personnel as well as nearby members of our community, existing natural resources, and the surrounding environment.  It is our policy to comply with all Federal, State, and Local regulations.  Through continual, accurate training and various safety devices and procedures, we work to minimize potential releases.\r\nOur emergency response program has specific procedures for accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia as well as other emergencies.  We work in conjunction with the Carthage Fire Department to prepare for necessary notification of all affected neighbors.\r\n\r\n2.  THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\r\nThe primary purpose of our facility is the temporary storage of refrigerated and frozen foods.  We utilize anhydrous ammonia as the primary means for refrigeration and freezing.  An outside company is used to fill our main receiver tanks.  Piping then carries the ammonia to the needed refrigeration or freezing units.  Access to the site is restricted to facility employees, authorized management personnel and authorized contractors.\r\nThe regulated substance used at our facility is anhydrous ammonia.  The maximum amount of ammonia stored at this facility is 51,911 pounds. We ha"

FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\nTo date, this Butterball facility has not incurred a reportable release within the past five years.\r\n\r\n5.  THE RMP MANAGEMENT PROGRAM\r\nThe management of the RMP program will be handled by the Maintenance Manager.  This person will administrate in conjunction with the Butterball management and personnel.  Other entities or organizations that will be coordinated with include the Carthage, MO., LEPC and Fire Department.\r\n\r\n6.  THE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND THE SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\nThe Butterball facility complies with all applicable Federal, State and Local regulations including the EPA Accidental Release Prevention Rule.  Our personnel are trained about this during our Hazard Communications Training and through access to our Written Programs.  Our Refrigeration Maintenance operators receive On-The-Job training (OJT).  They are observed and are able to demonstrate proper job skills and knowledge.  Also, the ammonia system is operated, tested and maintained to the standard of International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration, the most stringent standards of the industry.\r\n\r\n7.  THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\r\nButterball, Carthage, MO., has onsite Hazardous Materials trained personnel to immediately respond to adverse conditions.  This helps minimize the potential of an off-site release.  We work very closely with the Carthage Fire Department on emergency preparedness.  We meet periodically with representatives of each to address any changes in the facility or any new concerns.\r\n\r\n8.
