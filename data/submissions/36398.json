(KPL), is committed to managing all operations in a manner that protects the environment and the health and safety of employees, customers, contractors and the public while fully complying with applicable laws and regulations.  KPL?s management philosophy goals are achieved through the implementation of the Environmental Health and Safety Management Systems, by the personal commitments of employees and contractors, and by open communication with employees, customers, neighbors, and regulators.  \n\nThe purpose of this Risk Management Plan (RMPlan) is to provide information about operations at the facility, programs to prevent accidental chemical releases, emergency response plans in the event an accidental release should occur, the five-year accident history of the facility, and planned changes to improve safety at the facility.\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance\n\nThe Ulysses Truck Facility is owned by Koch Hydrocarbon, LP and operated by KPL.  At the facility, demethanized product is received via trucks and injected into a pipeline to be sent out to gas liquids fractionators for further processing.  There are two 30,000-gallon storage bullets at the facility containing demethanized product.  The Risk Management Program (RMP) substances contained in the demethanized product are ethane, propane, butane, isobutane, and pentane.  These are the only flammable RMP substances stored at the facility.  There are no RMP toxic substances present at the facility in amounts greater than threshold quantity.  The facility is classified as Program Level 2 under the regulation. \n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response programs in place at the facility are part of the high standards striven for by KPL.  These high st"

Ongoing analysis of the potential hazards of the process, detailed training of employees, and emphasis on safety has helped avoid any serious chemical release accidents over the last 5 years.  Part of this program has also involved identifying and taking steps to avoid potential accidental chemical releases.  A few examples of the prevention features implemented at this facility include:\n\n?Gas detectors have been installed at the facility, which will alarm in Wichita and shutdown pipeline delivery and truck unloading.\n?Manual emergency shutdown (ESD) buttons have been installed at the facility in order to shutdown the entire facility during emergency situations.\n?Fire eyes have been installed which will alarm Wichita of a fire at the facility.\n?High pressure in the pipeline will automatically shutdown pipeline injection.\n?Interlocks on the bullets will close the inlet valve to the bullet if the level and pressure in the bullet gets too high.\n?Surveillance cameras have been installed for security and operational purposes.\n?The Pipeline Control Center, which is operated 24 hours per day, has certain monitoring and remote ESD capabilities.\n?All drivers are provided with safety training.\n\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nNo incident resulting in onsite injuries, death or property damage or offsite impacts from a hydrocarbon release has occurred at the Ulysses Truck Facility within the last five years. \n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nThe fa"

      "SummaryText": "cility will continue to conduct emergency response preparedness activities and coordinate any emergency response actions necessary for the Ulysses Truck Facility with the Ulysses Fire Department.  Also involved in emergency response for the facility would be the Grant County Sheriff and the Kansas Department of Public Safety.  The Terminal Operations Manager is responsible for coordinating the emergency actions.  A specific Emergency Response Plan for the facility is in place and that plan has been coordinated with local officials, along with evacuation procedures, regular drilling, and training.  The Emergency Response Program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nCompliance with the RMP Prevention Program, coupled with the Environmental Health and Safety Management Systems,  forms the framework for continuous safety improvement.  Some of the key components of the safety program are:\n\n?The Management of Change provisions ensure that the potential safety and health impacts of any change made to process chemicals, technology, equipment or procedures are considered.\n?The Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) methods used to perform Hazard Reviews serve as a tool to ensure timely evaluation of potential hazards, thereby leading to continual improvements in safety standards.\n?The Safety Information and Maintenance provisions ensure that process equipment and instrumentation are designed, constructed, installed and maintained in such a manner as to minimize the risk of hazardous releases, thereby serving as an integral part of the safety program.\n\nSpecific actions that will be taken in the future to improve the level of safety at the facility include:\n\n?Internal and third party compliance audits will ensure that the level of safety protection at the facility is periodically evaluated for improvements.\n?An ongoing dialogue with the Grant Cou"
