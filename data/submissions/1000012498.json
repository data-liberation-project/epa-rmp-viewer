Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nSara Lee Corporation \u00c3\u00bf\u00c2\u00bf Shannon Mississippi Facility at 184 Bryan Blvd. in Shannon, MS complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Program Rule (40 CFR Part 68), OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard (29 CFR 1910.119) and OSHA Hazardous waste operations and emergency response (HAZWOPER) rules (29 CFR 1910.120). The enclosed Risk Management Plan addresses the requirements of 40 CFR Part 68 as they relate to the storage, handling, and processing of a highly hazardous material - ammonia. Through our compliance with Part 68 and 29 CFR 1910, we promote overall plant, worker and community safety. Our Risk Management Program enables our facility to prevent the occurrence and minimize the consequence of a significant release of ammonia, including leaks, spills, fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents. In order to reduce the likelihood and severity of accidental chemical releases that may affect on-site workers and off-site populations and environmental receptors, the Company policy is to fully comply with the spirit and the letter of EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Program rules (40 CFR Part 68). The Sara Lee Corporation Shannon facility has developed a formal Risk Management Plan in compliance with 40 CFR Part 68. All employees are expected to understand their role in developing and implementing the plan and to diligently adhere to its provisions. The Shannon facility's Risk Management System has clearly defined lines of authority and designation of responsibilities to ensure that the risk management plans are developed, implemented, and revised. Sara Lee's safety and risk programs prevent accidents because they focus on the rules, procedures and practices that govern individual processes, activities, or pieces of equipment. \n2.

      "SummaryText": "vd. Shannon, Mississippi is subject to the requirements of 40 CFR Part 68, the Accidental Release Prevention Provisions (112r) of the Clean Air Act, due to an on-site process containing a regulated chemical above its\nthreshold quantity. Anhydrous ammonia, a regulated toxic substance, is present in the facility refrigeration system in a quantity greater than its 10,000 pound threshold, as established in the 112r regulations. Anhydrous Ammonia is present as the refrigerant in the plant refrigeration system. Preparation of the meat products, packaging, and storage operations require refrigeration to keep raw ingredients and products fresh. The system consists of a high pressure tank, compressors, piping, pumps, chillers, and associated equipment located at various strategic locations throughout the plant. The ammonia may exist as a gas or as a liquid in different parts of the system.\n3. Release Scenario\nIn accordance with 40 CFR Subpart B, Sara Lee Foods Shannon, MS has evaluated off-site consequences for releases of anhydrous ammonia. Both a worst-case scenario and an alternate-case scenario were developed.\n4. Accidental Release Prevention Program\nThe Shannon facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Program rules and OSHA safety rules under 29 CFR 1910 for ammonia. All elements of the accidental release prevention requirements under Part 68 have been developed and implemented for ammonia at the Shannon facility.\nThe ammonia refrigeration system meets OSHA PSM standards (29 CFR 1910.119) and has been audited to the standard as required every 3 years. The refrigeration system was designed and constructed in accordance with ANSI/IIAR 2-1992 Standard for Equipment, Design, and Installation of Ammonia Mechanical Refrigerating Systems. A process hazard review was most recently updated for ammonia in September of 2004 using a \"What-If Checklist\" and all identified problems were addressed.

All persons working with ammonia or ammonia-containing equipment have been trained on operating procedures and understand the consequences of deviation from the procedures. A mechanical integrity program is in place for ammonia refrigeration equipment and operations.  \n5. Five-year Accident History\nNo accidental releases of ammonia have occurred during the last five years that resulted in off-site impacts of any kind.\n6. Emergency Response Program\nThe emergency response program at the Shannon facility is based on the OSHA requirements for Emergency Action Plans (29 CFR 1910.38 and 1910.119) and HAZWOPER (29 CFR 1910.120). We have trained employees for emergency response and maintain a written emergency response plan. The plan is coordinated with the Lee County Emergency Management and the Shannon Fire Department. Annual drills for implementation of the emergency response plan are conducted at the facility with the participation of the LEPC and the fire department where possible. The emergency response plan includes procedures for notification of the fire department and notification of any potentially affected neighbors.\n7. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\nAs part of Sara Lee Corporation Shannon Mississippi facility\u00c3\u00bf\u00c2\u00bfs continuous efforts to improve safety of the system, continual evaluation of the current system is ongoing to prevent anhydrous ammonia releases. Evaluation of existing equipment is part of our system safety practices and should issues be identified steps will be taken to make improvements in a timely manner."
