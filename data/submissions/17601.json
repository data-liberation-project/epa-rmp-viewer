It is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws.  If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to follow the emergency procedures outlined in our 1999 Emergency and Disaster Manual.  The procedures in our Emergency and Disaster Manual include notifying Milacron Security, our internal response team, and the local fire department if necessary.\n\nA description of your facility and the regulated substances handled:  This facility's manufacturing processes include the machining, electroplating, and heat-treating of many of  the components of plastics processing equipment.  The facility uses ammonia in its processes and manages the substance in less than 90-day tank storage quantities.\n\nThe worst-case and alternative release scenarios:  Our worst-case scenario is failure of one 2,200-gallon storage tank when 100% filled, resulting in a toxic release.  The resulting distance to the endpoint extends offsite, and public receptors are within the distance to the endpoint.  Our alternative release scenario is a breack in a 1-inch diameter pipe, leading to a toxic release.  The resulting distance to the endpoint extends offsite, and public receptors are within the distance to the endpoint.\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps:  This facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule and all applicable state and local codes and regulations.  The ammonia system is maintained in accordance with OSHA's 29 CFR Part 1910.119.\n\nFive-year accident history:  We have never had an accident involving ammonia that caused injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or shelterings in place.\n\nThe emergency response program:  In the event of an emergency involving our ammonia process,"

      "SummaryText": "it is our policy to follow the guidelines outlined in our 1999 Emergency and Disaster Manual.  Our manual was recently updated and is intended for the protection of the employees of Milacron Inc. and our neighbors surrounding our plant.  The plan ensures that the most efficient methods of response by certified individuals can take place during a possible incident.\n\nAmong other things, our plan covers arson and bomb threats, chemical spills, civil disturbances, electrical power failures, fire/explosions, and first aid procedures.  The plan is also intended as a reference source to familiarize local emergency response agencies, fire and police departments, and area hospitals on operations related to Milacron's Mount Orab facility.\n\nIn the event of a chemical emergency at the Mt. Orab facility an emergency alarm is sounded and the emergency coordinator is notified.  There are two secondary coordinator contacts in the event that the primary emergency coordinator is not immediately available.  The emergency coordinators have complete authority to commit all resources of the company to carry out the Emergency Response Contingency Plan in the event of an emergency.  The contingency plan contains a contact list that includes the Mt. Orab Police, the fire department, Clermont Mercy Hospital, Brown County Hospital, the OEPA, the Ohio Response Center, an Emergency Response Contractor, the Brown County Local Emergency Planning Committee, and the Coast Guard.\n\nMilacron's emergency coordinators meet the second Friday of every month to review and discuss emergency procedures.  Milacron also performs a corporate safety audit on an annual basis.\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety:  None."
