Nevertheless, the Review Team did consider recommendations that address procedure-related issues.\r\nThe Team used the Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) Guideword method in conjunction with What-If /Checklists to provide a comprehensive Hazard Review. This methodology was approved in advance by the CCHD Haz Materials Division. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOperating Procedures\r\nDEC maintains up-to-date, accurate, written operating procedures that give clear instructions for the ammonia process. Procedures include startup, shutdown, normal operations, temporary operations, abnormal conditions, emergency operations, and emergency shutdown.   The operating procedures also include safe work practices for hazardous material handling.   The operating procedures are accessible to all staff and are maintained in the control room.\r\nIf the operating procedures must be modified, the Operations Manager or designee will be responsible for modifying the procedure.  The Operations Manager will review the draft-revised procedures and sign the approval page.  The Operations Manager will forward the revised procedures to the General Manager for approval and signature. The Oper"

Calpine Corporation verifies that that equipment complies with recognized and generally accepted good engineering practices by specifying that the latest codes and standards be used for the design of the plant, conducting a seismic assessment to confirm that the process meets structural codes, and by reviewing the ammonia process in the process hazard analysis.  Calpine also has scheduled reviews of the risk management program to update safety information if there is a major change that would make existing information inaccurate.\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\r\nA systematized evaluation of new and existing equipment and processes has and will continue to be implemented in an effort to protect employees, the public, and the surrounding environment.  The initial PHA was conducted on 12/7/2005.  The PHA will be conducted every five years.\r\nThe purpose of the process hazard analysis (PHA) is to: \r\n\u00bf Identify equipment or process hazards\r\n\u00bf Identify equipment failures that could lead to accidental release.\r\n\u00bf Identify staff errors (operations or maintenance) that could lead to accidental releases\r\n\u00bf Evaluate the consequences of such releases\r\n\u00bf Identify additional program measures that may be needed to mitigate or prevent the release\r\n\u00bf Identify additional training and/or safety needs \r\nThe PHA was last conducted at the Delta Energy Center facility on November 3, 2020. A multidisciplinary Team comprised of management, operations, maintenance and environmental and safety staff was assembled to perform the PHA. The Review Team included personnel familiar with design, operation, and maintenance requirements, and both a facilitator and scribe from Environmental Resources Management, Inc.\r\nThe primary objective of this new PHA was to review the process equipment and operation in order to comply with applicable portions of the CalARP"

The site is located in the city limits of Pittsburg in Contra Costa County at the border of the City of Antioch, and is approximately 35 miles northeast of San Francisco. \r\nThe facility currently stores anhydrous ammonia, a regulated toxic substance under RMP and CalARP regulations, in one 15,000-gallon double walled steel storage tank at 85% capacity, which is located inside a secondary containment area.  Anhydrous ammonia is used at DEC to reduce nitrogen oxides (nitric oxide and nitrogen dioxide) created during the combustion of natural gas and exhausted from the three  Combustion Turbine Generators (CTG) and Heat Recovery Steam Generators (HRSG) duct burners.  Anhydrous ammonia  vapor is drawn from the top of the storage tank and diluted with air, and injected into the three Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) units to reduce the NOx emissions. \r\nThe maximum quantity of ammonia stored at DEC exceeds the federal RMP (and PSM) and CalARP specified threshold quantities of 10,000 pounds and 500 pounds, respectively; thus, the facility is subject to federal RMP, PSM and CalARP regulations.

      "SummaryText": "Delta Energy Center, LLC - RMP Executive Summary\r\nIntroduction \r\nCalpine Corporation operates the Delta Energy Center (DEC), a nominal 880-megawatt power plant located in Pittsburg, California.  The DEC uses anhydrous ammonia as a necessary part of reducing the emissions of nitrogen oxides to the atmosphere.  Storing a large quantity of ammonia can be a hazard if it is not handled properly. Calpine Corporation takes its safety obligations in storing and using ammonia as seriously as we take controlling emissions from the power plant. The following document describes what could happen if there were to be an accident, the steps we take every day to ensure a safe operating plant, and what to do in the event of an emergency.\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n\r\nDelta Energy Center maintains a written emergency response program. The program addresses all aspects of emergency response, including proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, spill response measures, evacuation plans and personnel accounting, notification of emergency response agencies and the public in the event of a release. In the event of an ammonia spill, Delta Energy Center may respond with limited defensive actions.\r\n\r\nThe emergency response program is coordinated annually with the Contra Costa County Hazmat Agency.\r\n\r\nDEC's accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates proven technology, staff training on operation and maintenance practices, and tested management system practices. All applicable procedures of the State of California and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Prevention Program are adhered to, including key elements such as training, systems management, and emergency response procedures.  \r\nIt is the policy of Calpine Corporation that every employee is entitled to a safe and healthful place in which to work and live.
