A release of chlorine through the relief device located on a ton unit cylinder during the filling operation was identified.  This scenario would occur if the heat applied during the process exceeds the acceptable range.  The likelihood of this incident occurring is decreased by operator training, a margin of safety inherent in the established acceptable heat range, and constant monitoring of the heat application process.\n\nThis scenario also involves a container holding 2,000 pounds of product with a theoretical off-site impact of 0.1 mile.  To provide the most conservative data, the toxic endpoint was modeled using a release rate calculated with the with the most conservative data and without considering any mitigating equipment, such as a scrubber, neutralization system, chlorine kit, or enclosure, present at the facility. \n\nACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThis facility has not had an accident involving the regulated process in the last five years.\n\nPREVENTION PROGRAM and EMERGENCY RESPONSE\n\nCompressed gas cylinders are manufactured and maintained to the exacting codes and standards of the DOT, NFPA, and CGA.  Cylinder construction is mandated in all aspects including metallurgy, wall thickness, and design pressure.  The cylinder design pressure must exceed the fill pressure by a certain percentage.  These codes and standards are in place to insure that compressed gas cylinders are designed to withstand extremes of operation and overpressure conditions.  Each cylinder must be tested and re-qualified every 5 years.  Appurtenances such as safety relief devices and valves must"

This operation includes transfilling material from one cylinder to another, purification of some materials, quality control, and gas mixing to customer specifications.  The source gas for operations may be packaged in cylinders of varying sizes.  The finished product may include a single pure gas or a mixture of gases at varying concentrations.  Finished product is stored and shipped in cylinders with capacities of 2,000 pounds to less than 1 pound, depending on the size of the cylinder and the chemical involved.\n\nOne process at this facility involves a chemical at quantities above the RMP threshold.  Chlorine purification, transfilling, laboratory analysis, and storage are subject to RMP regulations.  The Chlorine process typically involves ton unit cylinders; therefore, this process has been assigned to Program 3. \n\nDESCRIPTION OF WORST-CASE AND ALTERNATIVE CASE SCENARIOS\n\nWorst Case Scenario\n\nIn compliance with the Federal definition of the worst-case scenario, a 10-minute release of the entire contents of the largest container of chlorine handled at the facility was modeled using RMP Comp.  Such a release would involve a cylinder unit spontaneously splitting in half under poor weather conditions without the use of any mitigation equipment available at the facility.  Due to the rigorous DOT, NFPA, and CGA codes and standards applied to compressed gas cylinder service and Matheson Gas Products' internal standards, the likelihood of this scenario occurring is almost zero and should not be considered a credible release situation.  \n\nThe largest container of chlorine located at the facility holds 2,000 pounds of product and has a theoretical offsite impact of 1.3 mile"

      "SummaryText": "meet stringent manufacturing standards as well.  In addition to these codes and standards, Matheson Gas Products has an established policy of filling cylinders to a pressure below the DOT approved fill pressure.  Compliance with these standards, codes, and policies significantly reduces the likelihood of a catastrophic failure of a compressed gas cylinder.\n\nIn addition to the integrity of the cylinders and their components, a primary component of this facility's prevention program is its experienced operators.  Not only are they certified with the knowledge, skills, and abilities to perform their duties safely, but they are also able to assess and resolve possible abnormalities before they result in a release.  Operator experience ranges from 8 years to 20 years.  The primary operator for the majority of chlorine activities has 8 years of experience.  In addition to the operator's experience and qualifications, processing of chlorine does not occur unless process control and mitigation systems, such as the neutralization tanks and scrubber, are functioning within their operating parameters.  Finally, the facility has had a preventive maintenance program in place for years and employs a competent maintenance staff to resolve mechanical problems and improve current systems.\n\nThis facility maintains an emergency response team that has been trained in accordance with OSHA 29 CFR 1910.120 Section Q (6)(iii).  Each member receives refresher training and requalification annually.  The on-site training concentrates on the handling of incidents involving chlorine, and is conducted by an outside emergency response consultant, recommended by the local fire department.  An internal chlorine emergency response drill is conducted annually.  Equipment necessary to quickly respond to an incident is kept at the facility, including a Chlorine Kit used to contain leaks from a chlorine ton unit.  During an incident, the facility team assumes the role of primary responder, with support"

The new area will incorporate additional safety systems, including larger doors to improve movement of ton unit cylinders in and out of the area."
