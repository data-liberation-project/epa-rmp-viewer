The properties of TDI make it necessary to observe safety precautions when handling to prevent human exposure, and to reduce the threat to the facility's workers and nearby members of the community. It is the facility's policy to adhere to all applicable federal and state rules and regulations. Safety depends upon proper usage of the procedures used to handle TDI; operation of the safety devices and systems designed and constructed into the facility; and the proper training of personnel.\r\n\r\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\r\n\r\nThe Renosol facility produces liquid polyurethane systems and polyurethane seating for the automotive industry. TDI is the key component of the TDI foaming line.\r\nTDI is received at the plant via railcar and is stored in three storage tanks.  One storage tank has a maximum capacity of 7,600 gallons and two larger storage tanks have a maximum capacity of 10,500 gallons each.\r\n\r\nAdministrative Controls\r\n\r\nAdministrative controls are in place at the Renosol facility to reduce the likelihood that a release might occur and to limit the severity of impacts (minimize distances to safe concentration) if a release were to occur. The administrative controls are inherent in the operational procedures for the TDI system and the training provided to the TDI system operators.\r\n\r\nMitigation Measures\r\n\r\nMitigation measures are in place at the Renosol facility to reduce the likelihood that a release might occur and to limit the severity of impacts (minimize distances to safe concentration) if a release were to occur. The mitigation measures are based on the design, inspection, testing, and maintenance of the TDI system and its related equipment and components.\r\n \r\nGe"

The facility conducts safety meetings and safety training periodically. The process safety management program implemented at the facility for the TDI-related activities and equipment represents one of the facility's main active commitments to an accidental release prevention program.\r\n\r\nFive Year Accident History\r\n\r\nNo accidental releases occurred within the last five years.\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program\r\n\r\nThe Emergency Response Program is focused on the internal HAZWOPER trained team to handle accidental spills of TDI.  Release events that are too large to be handled by the internal team are handled by the third party clean-up services of Young's Environmental located in Flint, Michigan.  In the event of a release of TDI that is a potential risk to personnel safety, personnel are alerted to evacuate the facility.\r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\r\n\r\nRenosol recently performed a complete hazard review of the TDI processes including a Failure Mode Effects Analysis (FMEA). The FMEA identified additional potential hazards and recommended actions to prevent or mitigate those potential hazards. The results of the FMEA will be implemented to provide additional mechanisms for the prevention or mitigation of a potential TDI release."
