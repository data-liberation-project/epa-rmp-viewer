      "SummaryText": "Priority Cooling's (Yuma, Arizona) accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates technologies, procedures, and management practices. All applicable procedures of the EPA Prevention Program are adhered to. Priority Cooling's emergency response policy involves the preparation of response plans which are tailored to the facility and to the emergency response services available in the community. It is also in compliance with the EPA Emergency Response Program requirements.\n\nThe Priority Cooling facility in Yuma is utilized for fresh vegetable processing and wholesaling. The facility uses an anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system to cool the processing areas. The facility uses 25,000 pounds (lbs) of anhydrous ammonia for refrigeration. \n\nThe general accidental release prevention program is based on the following key elements:\n?    High level of training of the operators.\n?    Preventative maintenance program.\n?    Use of state-of-the-art process and safety equipment.\n?    Use of accurate and effective operating procedures, written with the participation of the operators.\n?    Performance of a process hazard analysis of equipment and procedures.\n?    Implementation of an auditing and inspection program.\n\nChemical specific prevention steps include availability of self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA), worn by the operators during connection/disconnection of ammonia supply, and awareness of the hazardous and toxic properties of these toxic substances.\n\nNo accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia have occurred at this facility in the past five years.\n\nPriority Cooling will fully implement the RMP and will initiate appropriate changes as needed to maintain a safe operation.\n\nThe facility possesses its own emergency response program. This program includes an emergency response decision tree and a notification plan. Emergency response drills and drill evaluations are conducted once every year; emergency operations and response procedures are also reviewed a"
