The Emergency Response Plan includes procedures for facility evacuation, as well as for notification of the local emergency response agencies which are responsible for notifying the public.  The plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within the facility that would require modified procedures.\r\n\r\nThe McLennan County LEPC is the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) with which our Emergency Response Plan has been coordinated.

Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n\r\nCoca-Cola North America is strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety.  This commitment is inherent to our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with our regulated processes.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible accidental releases of regulated substances.  However, if such an accidental release does occur, we are coordinated with the City of Waco Fire Department and the McLennan County LEPC for emergency response support.\r\n\r\n2.  The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\r\n\r\nThis facility is used for the production of Powerade&reg;, vitaminwater&reg; and FUZE&reg; sports beverages as well as Minute Maid&reg; fruit juices and juice drinks.  Ammonia is the only RMP regulated substance present at this facility in a threshold quantity.  It is utilized as the primary cooling media in our closed-loop refrigeration system.  The ammonia refrigeration system has been operational since December of 1998.  The system's purpose is to provide cold storage capabilities for certain products.  Due to the characteristics of our ammonia refrigeration system, as well as Process Safety Management (PSM) applicability, this facility is covered under Program 3 of the RMP regulations.\r\n\r\n3.  The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\r\n\r\nTo evaluate the worst case and alternative release scenarios, the DEGADIS model, Version 2.1, was used.  DEGADIS is designed to model the atmospheric dispersion of ground-level area source dense gas clouds released with zero momentum into a"

The low-pressure receiver has a capacity of 48,874 pounds; however, the maximum quantity stored in the receiver at any one time is administratively limited to 80% of the capacity (39,099 pounds).  Based on this information a release quantity of the entire vessel (39,099 pounds) is assumed.   As specified in the RMP Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration, the worst case scenario assumes the release occurs over a period of 10 minutes, yielding a release rate of 3,910 pounds per minute.  The vessel is located inside the facility engine room, which has an overhead door; however, the release rate is considered unmitigated since the proximity of the storage vessel to the door prevents the use of the door as passive mitigation.  Under worst case weather conditions (Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s wind speed) as required by the RMP rule, DEGADIS yielded a distance of 1.21 miles to the toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L (200 ppm) (zone of influence).  The estimated residential population for the zone of influence is approximately 5,980 based on US Census Bureau Quickfacts for 2006 and the 2005-2009 American Community Survey 5-Year Estimates.  Other public receptors identified within the zone of influence include schools, churches, recreation areas, and commercial/industrial areas.  No environmental receptors are known to be located within the zone of influence.\r\n\r\nSeveral alternative release scenarios were evaluated; however, when they were modeled none of them reached a toxic endpoint offsite.  For the purpose of this RMP submission, the fo"

      "SummaryText": "llowing alternative release scenario was chosen because it is the most likely to occur that would potentially release a significant amount of ammonia.  The scenario chosen involves the failure of a 0.25 inch safety relief valve in the high pressure part of the ammonia system.  This scenario could also be representative of multiple situations such as a small hole in a vessel or pipe, a pinpoint hole in a condenser coil, or a packing leak around a valve stem.  Due to the presence of an alarm system and isolation valves and based on a recent release event, the release would occur over a 15 minute timeframe.  Under average weather conditions taken from meteorological data from the Waco Regional Airport, DEGADIS yielded a distance to the toxic endpoint of 429 feet.  No offsite receptors will be affected by the alternate release.  \r\n\r\n4.  The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\n\r\nThe facility has taken all necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set forth in 40 CFR Part 68.  Our facility is also subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119, as well as the EPCRA Section 302 and 311/312 notification/reporting requirements.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the accidental release prevention program that is in place at our facility.\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\n\r\nCoca-Cola North America maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters, and equipment designs associated with the ammonia refrigeration system.\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis\r\n\r\nAs part of the ammonia refrigeration system installation process, and as required under PSM, the facility conducted a comprehensive study to ensure that hazards associated with its ammonia refrigeration system are identified and controlled efficiently.  These studies, using What If scenarios, will be repeated every 5 years by a team of qualified personnel with"
