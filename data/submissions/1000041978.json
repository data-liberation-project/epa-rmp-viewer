In 2004, a flammable mixture was used to describe the entire process.  In 2009, the mixture was divided into several chemicals that more accurately describe the process, along with the storage vessels and capacities.  Worst case scenarios and alternative case scenarios have also been updated based on more conservative system integration and equipment volumes\n\n\n\n\n\nACCIDENTIAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICIES\n\n\n\nThe Formosa Hydrocarbon - Point Comfort plant has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n\n\nThe Formosa Hydrocarbon - Point Comfort plant, located in Point Comfort, Texas, operates a two step process to produce petroleum products (e.g., natural gas, natural gas liquids and condensate) from natural gas.  The Formosa Hydrocarbon - Point Comfort plant has several regulated flammables as part of the natural gas liquids, they are methane, ethane, propane, butane +.  The plant does not contain any toxic materials above the threshold quantities requiring a RMP submittal.\n\n \n\n\n\n GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the plant.  Because processes at the plant are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) risk management program (RMP) regulation are also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health A"

This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA) \n\n\n\nThe Formosa Hydrocarbon - Point Comfort plant has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\n\n\nThe Formosa Hydrocarbon - Point Comfort plant primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\n\n\nThe PHA team findings are handled by local management for resolution.  Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident "

The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\n\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the plant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews were initially performed in May of 2000 and will be conducted every 5 years until the process is no longer operating.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.  Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\n\n\nThe Formosa Hydrocarbon - Point Comfort plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, and  (5) normal shutdown.  These procedures can be used as reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.  The procedures are kept current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.\n\n\n\nIn addition, the Formosa Hydrocarbon - Point Comfort plant's operating procedures contain procedures that provide guidance on how to respond to upper or lower limit exceedance for specific process or equipment parameters.  This information is readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\n\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the Formosa Hydrocarbon - Point Comfort plant is implementing a comprehensive traini"

New employees will receive basic training in plant operations if they are not already familiar with such operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator will be paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate (e.g., through skill demonstrations) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  In addition, all operators will periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is scheduled to be conducted at least every 3 years.  All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\n \n\nContractors\n\n\n\nThe Formosa Hydrocarbon - Point Comfort plant uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the plant is implementing practices to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform plant personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.
