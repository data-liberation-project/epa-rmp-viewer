The site is a responding facility for releases of the RMP-listed chemicals, so the site utilizes an Emergency Response Plan to address emergency response policies.  Denbury senior management are committed to the implementation of the RMP/PSM procedures.\r\n\r\nThe stationary source and regulated substances handled [40 CFR 68.155(b)]:\r\n\r\nThe Delhi NGL facility is a natural gas liquids processing plant.  Approximately 150 MMscfd of unprocessed natural gas with high CO2 content (96%) is delivered to the facility by an underground pipeline from an adjacent facility.  The gas is routed through a coalescer, dehydrator and heater (105\u00b0F) prior to being routed through three stages of membranes to remove methane from the rich CO2 gas.   CO2 is piped to the suction of a High Pressure Permeate Compressor.  The methane gas is processed using two propane refrigeration systems to remove NGLs.  Out of the second and third Membrane Stages medium pressure and low pressure CO2 are routed to their respective compressors.  The discharge of these two compressors is tied into a common suction header that feeds the HP Permeate Compressor.  Compressed CO2 at approximately 500-550 psig is routed back to the adjacent facility.  NGL liquids are piped to a Stabilizer Tower where light ends are vaporized into overhead gas, which is piped back to the inlet of the"

Condensate or off spec NGL is recovered and piped to the Condensate Vessel and then routed to the adjacent facility.  \r\n\r\nThe covered process boundary begins as the CO2/natural gas mixture enters the facility and ends after filled NGL containers are shipped offsite.   The two (2) propane refrigeration systems are not included as a part of the covered process boundary as their capacity does not exceed the RMP threshold quantity for propane. \r\nDenbury has reviewed plant storage and usage data and determined that five (5) flammable chemicals onsite are listed RMP flammable chemicals.  The RMP threshold quantity is 10,000 pounds for flammable mixtures containing greater than one (1) percent by weight of a listed flammable component with a mixture National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) flammability rating of 4.  The RMP-listed flammable chemicals that are present at the Denbury Delhi NGL Facility include:\r\n\r\n \tButane - CAS No. 106-97-8\r\n \tEthane - CAS No. 74-84-0\r\n \tIsobutane - CAS No. 75-28-5\r\n \tPentane - CAS No. 109-66-0\r\n \tPropane - CAS No. 74-98-6\r\n\r\nFor additional details on the quantity of regulated chemicals stored at the Denbury Delhi NGL Facility, refer to the facility's Maximum Intended Inventory documentation, which is included in Section 3 of the Process Safety Management (PSM) manual.\r\n\r\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps [40 CFR 68.155(c)]:\r\nThe Denbury Delhi NGL Facility has implemented the Program Level 3 prevention program requirements under the RMP regulations.  The facility is also subject to the PSM regulations under the general flammable category.

However, the facility plans to coordinate with responding agencies for emergencies as necessary.  The facility plans maintain incident command if responders are needed onsite.  Additional details related to emergency procedures can be located in the facility's Emergency Response Plan. \r\n\r\nPlanned changes to improve safety [40 CFR 68.155(f)]:\r\n\r\nThe facility completed a process hazard analysis (PHA) on November 17, 2015, which identified several recommendations for enhanced process safety.
