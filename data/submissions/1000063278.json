This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel (i.e., operators, emergency response teams)  and our emphasis on safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release and mitigate the hazards.\n\n\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n\n\nThe Westinghouse facility, located on the outskirts of Columbia, South Carolina, operates a variety of processes to fabricate nuclear fuel assemblies.  The facility has one regulated toxic substance: aqueous ammonia at a solution concentration greater than 20 wt%.  The plant is located in a semirural area on a site of approximately 1,155 acres.  \n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM STEPS\n\n\n\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at the Westinghouse facility. Although no longer applicable or covered by OSHA PSM, the program was developed to follow OSHA process safety management (PSM) guidelines as defined in 29 CFR1910.119. Elements of PSM and the Site Emergency Response Plan are used where applicable. \n\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\n\n\nThe Westinghouse facility encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety (risk) management and accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team.  Employees have access to all information created as part of the facility accident prevention program.  Speci"

In addition, the facility has a number of initiatives under way that address process safety and employee safety issues.  These initiatives include forming teams to promote both process and personal safety.  The teams typically have members from various areas of the plant, including operations, maintenance, engineering, and plant management.\n\n\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\n\n\nThe Westinghouse facility keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain and document safe operation of the processes.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  Specific departments within the facility are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.\n\n\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs).  This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  The facility has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) in the operating procedures for each process.  The facility ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).  \n\n\n\nThe facility also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.

Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\n\n\nThe Westinghouse facility primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  The analyses are conducted using a team that has operating, maintenance, and engineering experience and are supplemented by persons with appropriate regulatory expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.  \n\n\n\nThe PHA team recommendations are forwarded to management for resolution. Implementation of mitigation actions in response to PHA recommendations based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation actions being implemented in response to PHA team recommendations are tracked until they are complete.

These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.  The results and recommendations from these updates are documented and retained.  Once again, the team recommendations are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of each recommendation is documented and retained.\n\n\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\n\n\nThe Westinghouse facility maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency operations, (5) emergency shutdown, (6) normal shutdown, and (7) initial startup of a new process.  These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.  The procedures are maintained current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.  \n\n\n\nIn addition, the operating procedures at the Westinghouse facility provide guidance on how to respond to upper or lower limit exceedances for specific process or equipment parameters. This information, along with written operating procedures, is readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.  These procedures are required to be read and acknowledged as understood by all operators in the affected area.\n\n\n\n\n\nTraining\n\n\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the Westinghouse facility has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process.

After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\n\n\n\n\nContractors\n\n\n\nThe Westinghouse facility uses contractors to supplement its workforce. Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the facility has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform plant personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.  This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) relevant process information, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work.  In addition, the Westinghouse facility evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor.  Plant personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\n\n\nPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\n\n\n\nThe Westinghouse facility conducts a PSSR for any facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information.

The basic aspects of this program include (1) conducting training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting identified deficiencies, and (5) applying quality assurance measures. In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process equipment.\n\n\n\nMaintenance personnel receive training on (1) an overview of the process, (2) safety and health hazards, (3) applicable maintenance procedures, (4) emergency response plans, and (5) applicable safe work practices to ensure that they can perform their job in a safe manner. Written procedures ensure that work is performed in a consistent manner and provide a basis for training.  Inspections and tests are performed to ensure that equipment functions as intended and to verify that equipment is operational within acceptable limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels).  If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service, or a management of change (MOC) team will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment.\n\n\n\nAnother integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance.

The following types of safety features are used in various processes: \n\n\n\nSurveillance\n\n\n\n*     Appropriate operational, maintenance, and regulatory surveillance is performed to ensure controls function as designed\n\n \n\nRelease Containment and Control\n\n\n\n*     Valves to permit isolation of the process (manual and/or automated)\n\n*     Automated shutdown systems for specific process parameters (e.g., high level, high temperature, fail-safe failure mode)\n\n*     Curbing or diking to contain liquid releases\n\n*     Pressure relief devices\n\n\n\nRelease Mitigation\n\n\n\n*     Trained emergency response personnel\n\n*     Personal protective equipment (e.g., protective clothing, self-contained breathing apparatus)\n\n\n\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nThe Westinghouse facility has an excellent record of accident prevention over the past 5 years.  Westinghouse has experienced no accidents in the past 5 years involving an RMP-regulated substance that have resulted in any of the EPA-specified onsite or offsite effects. One reason for this success at preventing accidents is that every incident is studied very carefully to determine ways to prevent similar incidents from occurring.\n\n\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\n\n\n\nThe Westinghouse facility maintains a written emergency response program that is in place to protect worker and public safety, as well as the environment.  The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released. Specific emergency response procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first aid "

The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to facility management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until completion.  The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings. Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years so that the reports can be reviewed during future PHAs and PHA revalidations. \n\n\n\n\n\nCompliance Audits\n\n\n\nTo ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, the Westinghouse facility periodically conducts an audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented. Compliance audits are conducted at least every 3 years. Formal audits are generally done by professionals and management with independent professional auditors who are not associated with the facility.  An internal audit team may consist of facility hourly, professional, and management personnel.  The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to facility management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until completion.  The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are retained. \n\n\n\n\n\nCHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nThe processes at the Westinghouse facility have hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation.  The accident prevention program summarized previously is applied to all EPA RMP-covered processes at the plant.  Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by (1) faulty design and insta"

Also, the Westinghouse facility has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment, as well as instructions that address the use of emergency response equipment.  Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties.  The emergency response program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to facility processes or other plant systems.  The emergency response program changes are administered through the MOC process, which includes informing and/or training affected personnel in the changes.  \n\n\n\nThe overall emergency response program for the Westinghouse facility is coordinated with the Richland County Local Emergency Preparedness Committee (LEPC), local fire and police departments, and state and federal agencies through the Incident Command System. The Westinghouse facility has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate community officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., the fire department).  This capability provides a means of facilitating quick response to an incident, as well as notifying the public of an incident if necessary.  The Westinghouse facility conducts periodic emergency response exercises that involve facility personnel, contractors, and emergency response organizations. The facility provides periodic refresher training to emergency responders regarding their responsibilities during an emergency. \n\n\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nWestinghouse personnel are committed to the safe operation of the plant and are continually looking for ways to improve safety.  Westinghouse is continuing to  implement Human Performance (HuP) process improvements in accordance with the Inst"
