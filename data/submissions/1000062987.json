      "SummaryText": "The Behr facility stores products in aerosol cans that contain flammable propellants listed as a regulated substances in 40 CFR Part 68, Subpart F.  Based on the maximum storage capacity of the aerosol storage cage at the distribution center, the Behr facility exceeds the applicable threshold of 10,000 pounds (lb.) of a flammable regulated substance.  Therefore, the facility is subject to the RMP regulations.  Based on the worst case scenario modeled using RMP*Comp, and the accident history of the facility related to the storage of aerosol can products, the facility is subject to the Program 1 requirements.\r\n\r\nThe Atlanta DC is a warehouse operation where products in consumer packaging, including aerosol cans, are received, stored and ultimately shipped to various retail locations.  Aerosol cans are stored within a fully enclosed caged area within a room with self-closing doors.  The aerosol can storage area is equipped with racks and an in-rack sprinkler system that provides water at each level of the racks.  The storage area has a capacity of approximately 130,000 aerosol cans.  The aerosol cans are 13 ounces (oz.) by weight and are stored in boxes of either six, 12 or 24 cans per box.  \r\nThe aerosol cans contain various spray products.  Based on information provided by Behr, the products themselves do not contain any RMP toxic or flammable substances; however, the propellants added to the cans include the following RMP-regulated substances: propane, butane, and isobutane.  Each can may contain up to 60% by weight of a mixture of these flammable substances. \r\n\r\nThe Behr facility meets the Program Level 1 criterion as follows:\r\n1. The facility has not had a release from the aerosol can storage area in the last five (5) years that\r\nreached an off-site receptor.\r\n2. The distance to the endpoint was calculated using inputs assuming the propellant is a maximum\r\nof 60% by weight of the contents of a 13-ounce can. Modeling runs were completed based on a\r\nsingle propellan"

The nearest public receptor is approximately 310 feet south of the aerosol\r\ncan storage area.\r\n3. A copy of the facility's Emergency Business Plan (EBP) has been submitted to the McDonough Fire Department. The plan was last updated in July 2016. Any substantial changes to the plan will be submitted to the McDonough Fire Department."
