In addition, LA JOLLA COLD STORAGE will continually strives to improve in all areas, including safety.\nOne strategy has been to group the plan elements together in such as way as that they align with LA JOLLA COLD STORAGE business practices rather than the order presented in the law.  Safe Operating Procedures are now grouped together so that appropriate office staff may administer them.  The Emergency Action Plan is now separated out and distributed widely through the plant for easy reference.\nA second strategy has been to ensure that plan documentation forms and company policy forms pertaining to employee, contractor, and community safety are merged together to prevent unnecessary complexity and redundancy.  Forms in the plan that are not being used will be discarded and replaced with more relevant documents.  Alternatively, forms that are being used at LA JOLLA COLD STORAGE that meet plan documentation requirements, but which were not acknowledged by the plan, are now included.\nA third strategy is that operators have assisted in the writing of Standard Operating Procedures for ease of use.  In addition, there is now a method for receiving operator feedback and making changes in the future.\nThe last, but perhaps the most fundamental strategy, is that the Risk & Process Safety Management Program will be thought of as a \"living document\".

THE  LA JOLLA COLD STORAGE, RISK & PROCESS SAFETY MANAGEMENT PROGRAM\nThis is to inform all interested persons, including employees, that La Jolla Cold Storage has prepared a unified Risk & Process Safety Management Program.  The program is in compliance with California's Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program (in California CCR Title 19, Chapter 4.5 Program Level 3 Elements.  At the Federal level, Title 40 CFR Part 68), and California OSHA's \"Process Safety Management (PSM) of Acutely Hazardous Materials\" standard (in California CCR Title 8, Section 5189, \"Process Safety Management of Acutely Hazardous Materials,\" and Federally Title 29 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 1910.119).  This program has been prepared to address the risks involved with the presence of anhydrous ammonia in an amount in excess of 10,000 lbs., which is contained in our refrigeration system. \n\nOur program promotes overall plant, worker, and public safety. The program enables our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of anhydrous ammonia. Overall, the program is designed to prevent accidental fatalities, injuries and illnesses and avoid physical property damage.\n\nOur company has an exemplary safety record, one that we are quite proud of.

We have: (1) prepared a unified program based on the PSM plan to meet CalARP obligations as well; (2) reorganized the program so that it meshes more closely with general La Jolla Cold Storage business practices; and (3) reviewed plan documentation forms and responsibilities.  The unified Risk & Process Safety Management Plan sets forth rules, procedures and practices that will help our employees protect themselves and our neighbors.\n\n2.  DESCRIPTION OF AMMONIA SYSTEM\nLa Jolla Cold Storage will be operating a commercial cold storage for grapes.  Our facility has one  ammonia system which will operate with a charge of 23,600 lbs.  The system provides refrigerating capacity to two cold storage rooms equipped with forced air cooling and four cold storage rooms for palleted product.  A hallway between the rooms is also refrigerated.\n\nThe systems operate as follows.  High pressure liquid from our main receiver is piped to each cold room, where it passes through an expansion valve into low temperature & pressure accumulator vessels.  From the accumulators, cold liquid ammonia is circulated through evaporator coils.  As heat is absorbed, the liquid ammonia vaporizes to form low temperature & pressure gas which is returned to the accumulator vessel.  The ammonia vapor is returned from the accumulator vessels through a suction return line to our engine room, where it passes through a compressor.  The high pressure discharge from the compressor is sent to a water cooled condenser where the high pressure gas ammonia is cooled, liquified and returned to our receiver. \n\nThe facility was built by professional refrigeration engineers in accordance with standard design, and installation of ammonia mechanical refrigerating systems.  It was also built in compliance with the Uniform Mechanical Code and Uniform Building Code applicable at the time of construction. The system contains numerous saf"

      "SummaryText": "ety devices including sensors which stop the compressors if temperatures or pressures exceed or drop below established limits, and safety relief valves which vent ammonia gas to an ammonia adsorption system if the pressure in the system exceeds their set point.  Lastly, an emergency \"dump box\" contains switches and valves to turn off equipment and vent ammonia if necessary.\n\nThe ammonia system at our facility consists of vessels which are interconnected, or which are co-located such that a release of ammonia could impact the ability to operate vessels that are not directly connected.  Therefore, we are treating our facility as a single process.\n\n3.  AMMONIA RELEASE SCENARIOS\n3.1  Worst Case Scenario\nOur worst-case scenario is the failure of our high-pressure receiver that can contain up to 15,600 lbs of ammonia.  Following the instructions set forth in EPA's \"Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration (40 CFR Part 68),\" we considered the failure of one vessel.  We did not include any liquid ammonia in the piping connected to the failed vessel.  This vessel is located in the mechanical room, and the release would be passively mitigated.  The ammonia would be released over a ten-minute period.  Using the program RMP*Comp we estimate that the ammonia would travel 1.7 miles (mitigated rural conditions) before dispersing enough to no longer pose a hazard to the public.  A map showing the area that would be affected is attached.\n\nIn our opinion, it is extremely unlikely that the worst-case scenario will ever take place.  Our receiver meets industry standards for manufacture and quality control of pressure vessels; ammonia is not corrosive in this service; pressure safety relief valves limit the operating pressure in this vessel; and our operators are trained in the safe operation of our system.\n\n3.2  Alternative Case Scenario\nThe alternative release scenario selected by La Jolla Cold Storage is as follows. A gasket in a flanged connection on one of the val"

The discharge would be released to the atmosphere, and under this scenario approximately 700 lbs. of ammonia would be released over a time period of about 10 minutes.\n\nThe likelihood of this release scenario is decreased by the fact that the system has been pressure tested to levels well above the settings of our relief valves, therefore leaks are unlikely at normal operating pressures.  In addition, we visually inspect the piping and valves on a regular basis.\n\nThe EPA program RMP*Comp was used to estimate the distance ammonia would travel before dispersing enough to no longer pose a hazard to the public. This program uses approved data for variables such as wind speed/atmospheric stability class, ambient temperature/humidity, height of release, surface roughness, dense or neutrally buoyant gases, and temperature of released substance.  The RMP*Comp program calculated that the ammonia would travel less than 0.2 miles (unmitigated rural conditions) before dispersing enough to no longer pose a hazard to the public. A map showing the area that would be affected is attached.\n\n4.  GENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE & AMMONIA SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\nThe ammonia refrigeration system at the La Jolla Cold Storage facility is an integral part of the overall business.   The system contains a total charge of approximately 23,600 lbs. It is extremely important that it is maintained and operated in a safe and efficient manner.  Management is committed to making sure that all employees are made aware of the potential danger of an ammonia leak.\n\nOur refrigeration personnel monitor the ammonia refrigeration system/process and keep an active journal of all procedures and transactions that pertain to ammonia.  In addition, the system/process is checked frequently by our outside refrigeration contractor, California Controlled Atmospher"

PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\nOur company has an outstanding safety record, one that we are quite proud of.  Many policies and procedures have been implemented to promote overall plant, worker and public safety.  Nevertheless, La Jolla Cold Storage continually strives to improve in all areas, including safety.  Preparation of this Risk & Process Safety Management Program has been the primary recent improvement, and implementation of the program is our plan for improved safety in the near future.\n\nThe Risk & Process Safety Management Program has been written so that program elements are aligned with La Jolla Cold Storage business practices rather than the order presented in the law.  Thus, Safe Operating Procedures are grouped together for the benefit of our system operator.  Safe Operating Policies are grouped together so that appropriate office staff may administer them.  The Emergency Action Plan is now separated out and distributed widely through the plant for easy reference.  \n\nThe Risk & Process Safety Management Program documentation forms and company policy forms pertaining to employee, contractor, and community safety have been carefully reviewed so as to prevent unnecessary complexity and redundancy.  Our operator assisted in the writing of Standard Operating Procedures, and they are presented in a format that is easy to use.  \n\nFor the future, La Jolla Cold Storage now thinks of the Risk & Process Safety Management Program as a \"living document\".  It is an interactive framework that guides safe action for La Jolla Cold Storage employees, but allows for feedback and continual improvement.  Through the Risk & Process Safety Management Program La Jolla Cold Storage will continue to profit while maintaining overall plant, worker and public safety."

New employees are made aware of the potential risk of ammonia in an employee orientation meeting.  During these meetings we also discuss preventative measures, such as evacuation, in order to be prepared for a release.\n\nOur ammonia refrigeration system was designed and built by professional refrigeration engineers in accordance with ANSI/IIAR 2-1992 \"Standard for Equipment, Design, and Installation of Ammonia Mechanical Refrigerating Systems.\"  It was also built in compliance with the Uniform Building Code and Uniform Mechanical Code applicable at the time of construction.\n\n5.  FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nLa Jolla Cold Storage has not had any reportable accidents within the last five years.\n\n6.  EMERGENCY ACTION PLAN\nThis facility's emergency response program is based on the Cal/OSHA requirements for Emergency Action Plans (in California CCR Title 8, Section 3220, \"Emergency Action Plans.\"  Federally, Title 29 CFR 1910.38 and 1910.119), HAZWOPER (standard (in California CCR Title 8, Section 5192, \"Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response,\" and Title 29 CFR 1910.120). \n\nStrategically, our plan is \"Minimal Response\". Employees will evacuate to predetermined assembly areas in the event of an emergency.  The first priority will be to operate the ammonia system to bring a release under control safely, from a distance, without donning personal protective equipment.  Steps might include stopping the flow of ammonia to a leak point, or using the compressor to suck ammonia away from a leak point. Further response requiring the donning of personal protective equipment would be performed by an outside agency.  All response activities would be directed by the local fire department and the Kern County Fire Department Hazardous Materials Response Team.\n\nEvery "
