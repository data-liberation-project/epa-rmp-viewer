      "SummaryText": "Introduction\nWater District No. 1 of Johnson County operates a water treatment plant, which draws water from both the Missouri and Kansas Rivers.  The Hansen Water Treatment Plant consists of Facility No. 1, which is a 60 million gallon per day, lime-softening plant; and Facility No. 2, which is a 120 million gallon per day, lime-softening plant.  Facility No.2 contains two separate chemical process areas.  In addition to the plant, there are two intake and presedimentation facilities, one at the Missouri River and one at the Kansas River.\n\nThis Risk Management Plan (RMP) covers the Section 112r regulated substances stored and used at the Hansen Water Treatment Plant, which will be referred to herein as the Plant.  No Section 112r regulated substances are stored at the intake and presedimentation facilities.\n\nPlant Description\nThe Plant maintains two regulated substances on site: chlorine and aqueous ammonia.  Chlorine storage is 82,000 pounds, which exceeds the RMP threshold quantity of 2,500 pounds.  Ammonia storage is 195,000 pounds, which exceeds the RMP threshold quantity of 20,000 pounds.  The storage and management of both chlorine and ammonia are addressed in this RMP.  \n\nThe Plant is located at 7601 Holliday Drive, Kansas City, Kansas, which is an urban area. \n\nProcess Hazard Assessment\nA process hazard assessment was performed on the chlorine and ammonia systems beginning with the unloading of the container and ending with each chemical in solution.  In the assessment, general questions regarding the storage and use areas, as well as protocols associated with the management of the chlorine and ammonia systems, were answered.  A copy of that checklist is included in this plan.  Following the checklist, each valve, line, and piece of equipment in each system was assessed from the cylinder or tank to point of chemical injection.  Compliance with code requirements, potential failures, maintenance and inspection concerns, and standard operating procedures were"

      "SummaryText": "reviewed for each point in the system.  \n\nPrevention System\nThe Plant has an operation, maintenance and inspection system designed to review each element of the chlorine and ammonia systems routinely.  There are Operation and Maintenance manuals for each major piece of equipment, and personnel receive training before being allowed to work on the systems.\n\nAs each cylinder is changed, the valves and flexible whip connection of the chlorine system are tested for leaks.  There are standard operating procedures (SOPs) for startup, shutdown, normal operation, and emergency operation of both systems.  Personnel are trained on safety concerns and general operation procedures as well as emergency procedures.  The chlorine system is equipped with chlorine detectors and alarms that indicate leaks.  The chlorine alarms indicate by sending a signal back to SCADA and triggering visual and audible alarms outside the chlorine room.  Chlorine tank storage rooms are protected by a scrubbing system.\n\nEmergency Response Plan\nAny response requiring entry in a dangerous atmosphere requiring Level A personal protection or use of a chlorine repair kit is to be managed by Haz-Mat Response Inc., an emergency response company located in the Kansas City area.  A copy of the relevant sections of Water District No. 1A\u00c2\u00bfs Emergency Operations Plan is included.   \n\nAccident History\nThe Plant has had one chlorine in the past five years that resulted in injury to an employee. The Plant has had no ammonia releases in the past five years."
