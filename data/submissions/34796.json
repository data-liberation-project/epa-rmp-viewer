Accident Release Prevention Program and Emergency Response Policy\n\nIt is the policy of the TYSON FRESH MEATS, INC., Dakota City, Nebraska facility management to implement the requirements of this Risk Management Program (RMP) in accordance with the USEPA regulations under 40 CFR Part 68 and with the corresponding regulations under OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) program.  The objective is to minimize the risk of a release of a hazardous material and if a release occurs, to minimize the potential impact to TYSON FRESH MEATS, INC employees, the public and the environment.  This objective will be accomplished by utilizing general good operating procedures, providing appropriate training to all employees, and coordinating response activities, as necessary, with the local emergency response providers.  This plan covers all TYSON FRESH MEATS, INC owned activities at this facility.\n\nTYSON FRESH MEATS, INC.'s management is committed to providing the resources necessary to implement this policy.\n\n2. Facility Description\n\nTYSON FRESH MEATS, INC operates a cattle slaughter and processing facility and a hides tannery at this location.  Cattle are trucked to the facility, slaughtered and fabricated.  TYSON FRESH MEATS, INC. operates rendering systems to produce gel bone, dried blood, low protein beef byproducts, tallow, and other rendered products.  Support operations include a wastewater treatment system, truck repair facilities, cold storage, an analytical laboratory, and administrative offices.\n\nThree chemicals are utilized or generated at the facility in sufficient quantities to be subject to the requirements of 40 CFR Part 68.  These chemicals are chlorine (in two separate processes), ammonia (in two separate processes), and methane.  Chlorine is used as a disinfectant and to treat wastewater, ammonia is used as a refrigerant throughout the facility, and methane is generated"

General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe Dakota City, Nebraska facility is governed by a set of OSHA and USEPA regulations that require planning and facility activities intended to prevent a release of hazardous material, or if a release inadvertently occurs, to minimize the consequences of a release to the employees of the facility, the public and to the environment.  These regulations include:\n\n* 40 CFR Part 68, Accidental Release Prevention\n\n* 40 CFR Part 112, Spill Prevention, Control and Countermeasure\n\n* 40 CFR Part 264, Hazardous Waste Contingency Plan\n\n* 29 CFR Part 119, Process Safety Management\n\n* 40 CFR Part 302, Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA)\n\nThe key concepts in TYSON FRESH MEATS, INC's release prevention program are employee participation, appropriate design and maintenance of equipment, and appropriate training of all employees.  TYSON FRESH MEATS, INC has developed and documented these elements in their process safety management plan (PSM).  The PSM plan is incorporated with this document by reference.\n\nEmployee participation in the release prevention program is encouraged and supported by TYSON FRESH MEATS, INC management.  Key personnel are responsible for conducting and implementing the findings from the Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) for the ammonia and chlorine systems, and for conducting the process safety review for the methane system.  TYSON FRESH MEATS, INC employees are also members of the facility emergency response team.\n\nTYSON FRESH MEATS, INC policy is to construct all new equipment, systems, and facilities to ensure the appropriate safety and release prevention systems are included from the beginning of each project.  TYSON FRESH MEATS, INC maintains a computerized program of maintenance activities to ensure that key systems are maintained appropriately to minimize the risk of a r"

Each new employee is provided comprehensive safety training during their initial orientation for the facility.  In addition, TYSON FRESH MEATS, INC conducts regularly scheduled safety training for all employees each year.  Additional training is provided to maintenance personnel for the systems they are responsible for.  Members of TYSON FRESH MEATS, INC's emergency response team receive semiannual training to ensure that response actions are promptly and safely completed.\n\n4. Five Year Accident History\n\nTYSON FRESH MEATS, INC has not had a release of ammonia, chlorine, or methane from the Dakota City, Nebraska facility that has affected the public or the environment or injured any employees on site within 5 years prior to 4/16/04.\n\n5. Emergency Response Program\n\nTYSON FRESH MEATS, INC has personnel trained in emergency response at the facility 24 hours per day, seven days per week.  These personnel receive semiannual training on emergency procedures and response techniques.\n\nTYSON FRESH MEATS, INC does not have emergency response capability on site to respond to a methane emergency. It is TYSON FRESH MEATS, INC's policy to contact off-site emergency responders for assistance in the event of an accidental release of methane.\n\nTYSON FRESH MEATS, INC's employees will attempt to extinguish small fires with fire extinguishers if they have been properly trained.  TYSON FRESH MEATS, INC's employees, trained in the safe operation of the methane system, will close manual shutoff valves to terminate the flow of methane if the valves can be safely approached.  For all other scenarios, TYSON FRESH MEATS, INC's employees will evacuate the area and allow off-site responders to respond to the emergency.\n\nTYSON FRESH MEATS, INC has met with the local fire department to review the methane system and to establish coordination and communication procedures.\n\n6."
