Introduction and Background\n\nThe Accidental Release Prevention (ARP) requirements mandated in Section 112r of the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments were promulgated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) on June 20, 1996.  These requirements are codified in 40 CFR 68, Subparts A through H.  Under the ARP program, processes with chemical quantities on site exceeding the listed threshold quantities have applicable requirements.\n\nSistersville produces silicone chemicals at the Sistersville plant.  As defined by the regulations, the Sistersville plant stores the following toxic chemicals in excess of the threshold quantities: anhydrous ammonia, acrylonitrile, ethylenediamine, propylene oxide, methyl chloride, 37% hydrochloric acid, methyltrichorosilane, dimethyldichorosilane and trimethylchlorosilane.  The plant stores the following flammable chemicals above threshold quantities as defined by the regulation: dimethylamine, and trichlorosilane.\n\nThe Sistersville plant has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in safety and environmental protection, employee safety training, and safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of plant equipment.  Sistersville's written safety and environmental policy state that Safety is unequivocally our number one priority.  Sistersville has implemented reasonable controls to prevent and mitigate probable releases of hazardous chemicals.  Should a release occur, trained personnel would respond to control and contain the release.     \n\t\n\n2.\tDescription of the Stationary Sources and Regulated Substances\n\nThe Sistersville plant is a silicone chemical producing facility located at 3500 South State Route 2 in Friendly, West Virginia.  The plant is situated on approximately 1400 acres in southern Tyler County.  An environmental remediation firm and an aluminum dross-recycling firm to the south,"

      "SummaryText": "the Ohio River to the west, a rural residential area to the north and undeveloped forestland to the east occupy the immediate area surrounding the facility.\n\n   Silicone chemicals have been manufactured at the facility since the mid-1950s.  The Sistersville plant makes a variety of silicone products, which fall into three general categories: urethane additives, silicone fluids and silanes.  The products are utilized in a broad spectrum of industry.  The facility is operated 24 hours a day, seven days per week. Approximately 570 full time employees are at the site.  Plant manufacturing areas are broken down into four areas: Polymers I, Polymers II, New Product Development and Silanes.       \n\n\n3.\tWorst Case release scenario and alternate release scenario.\n\nThe Risk Management Program (RMP) rule requires the development of accidental release scenarios for both the toxic and flammable chemicals at our site.\n\nA worst-case scenario and alternate release scenario are designed to calculate\nthe potential impact to the surrounding community.  EPA defines a worst-case scenario as the complete release of the largest inventory of a chemical over ten minutes under weather conditions that would allow the chemical to travel the farthest distance at ground level.  It also assumes that none of the facility mechanical controls or safety systems is operational.  A worst-case scenario is highly unlikely to occur.\n\nGiven the severe guidelines of a worst-case scenario, more realistic alternate release or planning scenarios were also developed to more closely resemble a real world event.  These scenarios involve smaller releases and allow safety systems to be included in the release containment and dispersal calculations.  These alternate release scenarios are useful to local government and industry to prepare emergency response plans.\n \nWorst-Case Toxic Release Scenario- The worst case toxic release for the Sistersville plant would be the catastrophic failure of a methyltrichlorosilane s"
