The facility is prepared to work with the local Fire department, LEPC, and other authorities, to prepare for, mitigate and respond to any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2.  Facility Information \n\nKerens Grain and Elevator primarily serves the farming operation of the owner. Anhydrous ammonia is used as a fertilizer throughout the 5,000+ acres owned by Authur Bancroft.  Kerens Grain and Elevator provides anhydrous ammonia as a small service to neighboring farming operations.  The anhydrous ammonia is applied during peak farming and growing seasons.  During off seasons, there is typically very little anhydrous ammonia in the tank. \n\nThe anhydrous ammonia is stored in a 12,000 gallon tank in the center of the property.  The maximum quantity stored is 10,200 gallons, or 48,000 pounds, due to the physical limitations and design of the tank.\n\n3.  The worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario.\n\na.  The worst-case release scenario is calculated based on the loss of the largest, single ammonia storage vessel and associated piping used in accordance with the definition provided in the Environmental Protection Agency guidance for RMP development.  As required by EPA guidance for the toxic worst-case scenario, the contents of the ammonia tank are assumed to be released instantaneously to form a liquid pool.  In accordance with rule guidance, only passive control systems capable of withstanding the release event have been taken into consideration.  Determination of the area of potential impact was made using RMP*Comp, modeling software developed by the EPA and then compared against similar results in Aloha, modeling software developed by EPA and NOAA.\n\nFor modeling purposes, the worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of the"

      "SummaryText": " storage tank over 10 minutes.  In our scenario, we assumed a hoel puncture of three inches in diameter. The maximum quantity released would be 48,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards.  \n\nThe ammonia is assumed to volatilize from the pool (two phase release) and dissipate to the atmosphere as a gas.  Release time and weather conditions are dictated by EPA guidance.  The ammonia gas is considered to pose no further risk to the public when it has dissipated to a concentration less than the toxic endpoint specified in the RMP rule.  The toxic endpoint is 0.14 mg/L and the distance to the toxic endpoint is 1.3 miles.  The estimated number of people affected by the release is 100.  This is estimated by taking the population and density of people within the census area and estimating the percentage of area that would be affected.   \n \nb.    Alternative Release Scenario\nThe alternative release scenario is, by definition, a more likely release scenario than that considered for the worst case.  As with the worst-case release scenario, modeling is performed using RMP*Comp software provided by EPA and compared against similar scenarios run using Aloha Air Dispersion Modeling.  Release conditions, including release time and weather conditions, are dictated in the EPA Off-Site Consequence Analysis Guidance. \n\nThe type of failure identified for the alternative release was the loss of ammonia due to a puncture in the tank. Since the tank is only full during prime farming season and is typically empty during wet of cold seasons, the amount of ammonia in the tank is estimated to be at 12,000 pounds.  The release scenario allowed for a total release of all this materials over a ten minute time frame.  The distance to the toxic endpoint is < 0.6 miles rounded up to 1 mile as required by the guidance.  It is estimated that approximately 25 people would be affected by a release of this nature. \n\n4.  The"

      "SummaryText": " accidental release prevention program\n\nThe facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\" of the American National Standards Institute, Inc.  The provisions of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\" have also been implemented.\n\n5.  The Five-year Accident History -\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that:\n\n- have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility, nor\n- to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, and evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n6.   Emergency Response Program\n\nThe facility has a written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.38 and has provided the state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).\n\n7.  Planned changes to improve safety.\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.   There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time.  Additional fencing around the tank or valve lock boxes are planned  for implementation to reduce the risk of a release caused by the illegal theft of anhydrous ammonia."
