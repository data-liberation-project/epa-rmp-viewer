The SIC code for the primary process at this facility is 2022. Many areas of the plant are refrigerated to preserve the products.  Some of these areas include: raw material storage, process equipment, filling and finished product storage. \n\nKraft Foods has one regulated substance under 40 CFR 68, anhydrous ammonia, at this location.  Ammonia is used as a cooling agent in the refrigeration of the milk and cheese products in the various areas described above.\n\nThe ammonia threshold for triggering applicability to 40 CFR 68 is 10,000 pounds. The quantity of ammonia stored on-site is approximately 16,033 pounds. Thus, 40 CFR 68 is applicable to this facility.\n\n\n3.0    Worst-case and Alternative Release Scenarios\nNo data \n 4.0    General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThis facility has developed an OSHA PSM program for their ammonia refrigeration system.  Ammonia falls under the RMP Program 3 prevention program, which is identical to the OSHA PSM program.  EPA has stated that if the process is in compliance with OSHA PSM, it is in compliance with RMP Program 3.  Thus, Kraft?s ammonia PSM has been reviewed and determined to be complete for the RMP document. \n\nThere are several aspects of the prevention program that are key:\n\n1.    The Utility Service Area design (USA) serves as an excellent safeguard for plant personnel because it greatly reduces the amount of ammonia piping inside occupied rooms.  Since most of the pipe work is out of the way of people and the machinery and so there is less of a chance of an ammonia release.\n\n2.    The plant maintains good training, certification, and employee awareness of operating procedures. \n\n3.    An electronic control monitoring system is in place for monitoring the entire engine room process.  \n\n5.0    Five-year Accident History\n\nThe facilty had an ammonia release as defined "

An estimated quantity of 1,230 pounds of ammonia was release to the atmosphere as a liquid and a vapor.  An extensive investigation into the incident revealed the root cause was the safety relief valve on the thermosyphon cooling vessel for #3 ammonia compressor opening at a pressure less than 225 lbs which is where the compressor shut-offs were set.  An examination of the valve found a thread shaving under the valve seat which would not allow closure. Another contributing factor to the release was a power outage which damaged the input and output cards on the Energy mangement system (EMS).  This disrupted communications between the PC and the I/O cards preventing the condensers from operating properly. \n\nNo injuries, deaths or property damage occurred as a result of this release.\n\nThe facility Emergency Response/SPCC Plan was implemented and the local LEPC was contacted at 9:58 p.m.  The State Emergency Commission was contacted at 9:50 p.m. and the Nation Response Center was contacted at 9:40 p.m. (all contacts were made on August 2, 2000) and the incident number of 537462 was assigned to the release.  The release occurred at a pressure erelief valve and vented liquid onto the roof.  The local fire deparmnet applied a water spray to the ammonia liquid and vapor and this water was contained in a diked are on the facility's propery.  The liquid was discharged to the POTW after testing and receiving approval from the POTW.\n\nAs a result of this release, many safety precautions were implemented to prevent a future release.  1.  All safety relief valves were replaced (completed on 8/3/00).  2.  Reviews and revisions (where necessary) of production and utility procedures were completed.  3.  The high limit shutoffs were reduced on all compressors.  4.  An outside team came on-site and performed and extensive inspection on th"

An investigation into why the EMS failed due to a power outage.\n\n\n6.0    Emergency Response Program \n\nAs mentioned earlier, this facility has developed an emergency response in which plant employees are divided into various management and response teams.  There are many in-plant contacts for an emergency, which can be found in the Emergency Response Plan.  There are also back-up personnel in the event that the primary incident response personnel cannot be contacted.  The emergency response plan includes information about the frequency of employee emergency response training, as well as a detailed description of the training content, which includes a CPR and first aid training.  There are also specific procedures to follow in the event of a fire and ammonia emergency. \n\nAt the discretion of the Incident Commander, the Bentonville Fire Department will be called to provide emergency responders and equipment.  In the event of an ammonia release, a trained on site responder will accompany the fire department into the facility.  The fire department will take the lead in responding to the emergency.  The Bentonville Fire Department will also be called for all fire related emergencies.  In all cases where the fire department is called, an ambulance will also be called to the facility."
