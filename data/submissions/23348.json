GLNRP has installed a cryogenic gas processing plant at the Chalmette Refinery, an eighty mile long 10\" pipeline from Chalmette to Geismar, LA and a fractionation facility in Geismar, LA.  Total investment for the three components was $ 115,000,000.  Present personnel complement is 26 for the operations and maintenance activities.  Future growth plans include a cryogenic gas processing plant at the Motiva Enterprises, LLC, Convent Refinery and an Refinery Grade Propylene Splitter system at the Geismar Fractionation Facility.\n\nThe Fractionation facility will separate pipeline Liquefied Petroleum Gases (LPG's) to produce the following pure components:\n\n1. Ethane,\n2. Ethylene,\n3. Propane,\n4. Propylene,\n5. N-Butane,\n6. I-Butane, and,\n7. Natural gasoline.\n\nMost of the products will be shipped to customers via pipeline.  Some products will be shipped by tank trucks.  There will be limited on-site storage of products in pressurized tanks.  All products are gases at atmospheric pressure and temperature.\n\nThe flammable worst case scenario to be reported is the scenario of the release of the entire butane product tank contents (at 100% level) and a subsequent vapor cloud explosion at or near the product storage vessel.  This was chosen as the worst case scenario because the product storage tank is the largest single vessel which contains the flammable product (butane) under pressure.\n\nThe flammable alternate case scenario to be reported is that of a rupture of a 2\" LPG (propane) truck unloading hose at the truck unloading area near "

This alternate (or more likely) case scenario was chosen because of its proximity to the property line and the fact that if it should occur, the consequence could have very limited offsite impact.\n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at the facility.\n\nGulf Liquids New River Project, LLC has developed an overall safety and health policy to prevent accidental releases of flammable materials to the environment.  This policy is supported by many programs such as, the compliance with OSHA's 1910.119 Process Safety Management regulation which includes communication of risks and hazards to the employees and contractors, the development of an employee training, certification and retraining program with written operating procedures.  Since the facility is subject to 29 CFR 1910.119, it qualifies as a Program 3 facility under the EPA's Risk Management Plan regulation.\n\nThe facility management also stresses the development and documentation of the process safety information, a management of change procedure, pre-startup safety reviews, employee participation in safety reviews and an equipment mechanical integrity inspection program for all major equipment items and piping systems, as well as, new equipment purchases.  The facility operations personnel also issue Hot Work Permits and Cold Work Permits for maintenance activities within the operating units.\n\nThe facility also conducts the following safety inspections on the basis as noted:\n\n1. Work areas - as needed.\n2. Portable fire extinguishers - monthly.\n3. Pressure vessels - as specified in API 653\n4. Extension cords, motorized hand-tools - every 3 months.\n5. Yards, parking lots, roofs, etc. - annually.\n\nCompliance audits are also conducted every three (3) years as required by OSHA's CFR 1910.119 regulation.  In addition, incident investigations are conducted immediately after any accidental release or incident occurs.  The root cause of the incident is "

The following provide support for the plant in the event of a fire:\n\n1. Ascension Parish OEP.\n2. GAMA Firefighting Equipment.\n\n\nThe facility engineering staff also follows and adheres to guidelines set forth in American Petroleum Institute (API) standards and recommended practices, National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) codes for fire protection systems, National Boiler Inspection Codes (NBIC) for fired boilers, the American Society Of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) pressure vessel and piping codes, and the National Electric Codes for flammable environments.\n\n\nThe worst-case and alternate case release scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release as defined by the RMP regulation is the instantaneous release of the entire contents of the butane product storage tank (at the 100% level) with a subsequent vapor cloud explosion as the flammable vapor cloud finds an ignition source.  This worst case scenario was chosen because the butane product storage tank is the single largest vessel which contains a flammable liquid under pressure.\n\nFor the alternate release scenario, the facility has chosen the rupture and subsequent vapor cloud explosion of a 2\" hose at the butane truck loading station for the alternate case scenario.  This choice was made since the procedure of filling a truck will occur.\n\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical specific prevention steps.\n\nGulf Liquids New River Project, LLC has implemented numerous procedures to ensure the safety and well being of its employees and the general environment surrounding the facility.

The responsibilities for various functions during the emergency are clearly defined in the response plan.  Gathering places (primary and secondary staging areas, as well as, one off-site staging area) for employees evacuated from the control room and plant area by the emergency conditions are also listed.\n\nThe action plan contains reporting procedures for employees when the fire is too large to be extinguished by a portable handheld fire extinguisher.  The plan identifies steps to be taken in case of an accidental release including first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, and notification of local emergency response agencies. Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary based on their specific emergency duties.  The emergency action plan is updated when necessary based on modifications made to the process or other Plant facilities.\n\nThe overall emergency action plan for the facility has been coordinated with the Ascension Parish OEP.

Future growth plans include a cryogenic gas processing plant at the Motiva Enterprises, LLC, Convent Refinery and an Refinery Grade Propylene Splitter system at the Geismar Fractionation Facility.\n\n\n\nThe Fractionation facility will separate pipeline Liquefied Petroleum Gases (LPG's) to produce the following pure components:\n\n\n\n1. Ethane,\n\n2. Ethylene,\n\n3. Propane,\n\n4. Propylene,\n\n5. N-Butane,\n\n6. I-Butane, and,\n\n7. Natural gasoline.\n\n\n\nMost of the products will be shipped to customers via pipeline.  Some products will be shipped by tank trucks.  There will be limited on-site storage of products in pressurized tanks.  All products are gases at atmospheric pressure and temperature.\n\n\n\nThe flammable worst case scenario to be reported is the scenario of the release of the entire butane product tank contents (at 100% level) and a subseque"

This was chosen as the worst case scenario because the product storage tank is the largest single vessel which contains the flammable product (butane) under pressure.\n\n\n\nThe flammable alternate case scenario to be reported is that of a rupture of a 2\" LPG (propane) truck unloading hose at the truck unloading area near the South property line of the facility.  This alternate (or more likely) case scenario was chosen because of its proximity to the property line and the fact that if it should occur, the consequence could have very limited offsite impact.\n\n\n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at the facility.\n\n\n\nGulf Liquids New River Project, LLC has developed an overall safety and health policy to prevent accidental releases of flammable materials to the environment.  This policy is supported by many programs such as, the compliance with OSHA's 1910.119 Process Safety Management regulation which includes communication of risks and hazards to the employees and contractors, the development of an employee training, certification and retraining program with written operating procedures.  Since the facility is subject to 29 CFR 1910.119, it qualifies as a Program 3 facility under the EPA's Risk Management Plan regulation.\n\n\n\nThe facility management also stresses the development and documentation of the process safety information, a management of change procedure, pre-startup safety reviews, employee participation in safety reviews and an equipment mechanical integrity inspection program for all major equipment items and piping systems, as well as, new equipment purchases.  The facility operations personnel also issue Hot Work Permits and Cold Work Permits for maintenance activities within the operating units.\n\n\n\nThe facility also conducts the following safety inspections on the basis as noted:\n\n\n\n1. Work areas - as needed.\n\n2. Portable fire extinguishers - monthly.\n\n3. Pressure"

Yards, parking lots, roofs, etc. - annually.\n\n\n\nCompliance audits are also conducted every three (3) years as required by OSHA's CFR 1910.119 regulation.  In addition, incident investigations are conducted immediately after any accidental release or incident occurs.  The root cause of the incident is determined and appropriate steps are taken to prevent recurrence of the event.\n\n\n\nThe facility also has an emergency action plan in the event of a release of a flammable material.  The following provide support for the plant in the event of a fire:\n\n\n\n1. Ascension Parish OEP.\n\n2. GAMA Firefighting Equipment.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe facility engineering staff also follows and adheres to guidelines set forth in American Petroleum Institute (API) standards and recommended practices, National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) codes for fire protection systems, National Boiler Inspection Codes (NBIC) for fired boilers, the American Society Of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) pressure vessel and piping codes, and the National Electric Codes for flammable environments.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe worst-case and alternate case release scenarios.\n\n\n\nThe worst case release as defined by the RMP regulation is the instantaneous release of the entire contents of the butane product storage tank (at the 100% level) with a subsequent vapor cloud explosion as the flammable vapor cloud finds an ignition source.  This worst case scenario was chosen because the butane product storage tank is the single largest vessel which contains a flammable liquid under pressure.\n\n\n\nFor the alternate release scenario, the facility has chosen the rupture and subsequent vapor cloud explosion of a 2\" hose at the butane truck loading station for the alternate case scenario.  This choice was made since the procedure of filling a truck will occur.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical specific prevention steps.\n\n\n\nGulf "
