The accidental release prevention and emergency evacuation policies at the stationary source\n\n\n\nTo address concerns of an accidental release, prevention and emergency evacuation, all plant and field personnel are trained in emergency evacuations and will assist the Local Fire Department with any shutdown or isolation procedures, but will not enter the \"hot zone\" until it is deemed safe by the Local Fire Department. \n\n\n\nAs a result of information gathered during preparation of this Risk Management Program, SIGMA PROCESSED MEATS is committing additional resources to further increase employee awareness and equipment reliability and to establish operator training and preventive maintenance programs. As a demonstration of SIGMA PROCESSED MEATS `s high degree of commitment to public safety and service, SIGMA PROCESSED MEATS is taking action to decrease the risk of ammonia exposure to the public by implementing recommendations made during the Process Hazards Analysis and Off-site Consequence Analysis.\n\n\n\n2. The stationary source and regulated substances handled\n\n\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is used as a refrigerant in the SIGMA PROCESSED MEATS refrigeration system. The liquid is circulated as needed to the evaporators and heat exchangers/chillers where heat is absorbed and removed from the medium. The anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system is a closed loop single stage industrial refrigera"

The \"Worst-case release scenario(s) and the alternative release scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\n\n\n\nA \"Worst-Case Scenario Offsite Consequence Analysis\" and an \"Alternative Scenario Offsite Consequence Analysis\" were performed identifying the public and environmental receptors within the toxic endpoint concentration radius of 200 ppm. The results are mitigated by the fact that all the vessels and the much of the piping are inside the SIGMA PROCESSED MEATS building. A variety of administrative controls and computerized controls are in place to shut the system down when operating parameters and limits are exceeded.\n\n\n\n4. The general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific preventative steps\n\n\n\nThe basic elements of the Program 3 Prevention program have been developed and are now in place.

      "SummaryText": "nt history has not been prepared and included in the RMP since the facility has not had any accidential releases. To prevent and/or minimize any potential future release of anhydrous ammonia, SIGMA PROCESSED MEATS is implementing a detailed Process Safety Management program (Preventive Program 3).\n\n\n\n6. The emergency evacuation program\n\n\n\nEmergency evacuation is discussed in Section 5 of the RMP. SIGMA PROCESSED MEATS has a detailed Emergency Evacuation Plan for their facility. The purpose of this plan is to provide the means for rapidly determining the appropriate response for any emergency that may develop at the facility such as an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia. SIGMA PROCESSED MEATS conducts scheduled drills of the emergency evacuation plan. The Emergency Evacuation Program is written, includes specific actions to be taken in response to an accidental release, includes procedures for informing the public and local agencies responsible for responding to an accidental release.\n\n\n\n7. Planned changes to improve safety\n\n\n\nSIGMA PROCESSED MEATS is incorporating and addressing any recommendations resulting from the Process Hazard Analysis, Offsite Consequences, and program audits. The flexibility of the program allows SIGMA PROCESSED MEATS to respond effectively to prevent or minimize any potential exposure of SIGMA PROCESSED MEATS employees, the surrounding public, and/or the environment to a release of anhydrous ammonia. Specific actions taken to improve safety are the implementation of the Program 3 Prevention Program described above, improved operator training, administrative controls, and computerized system controls."
