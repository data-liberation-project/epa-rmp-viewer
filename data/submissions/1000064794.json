All included information was reviewed and approved by HLBE management prior to resubmission of this RMP.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES:\n\n\n\nHLBE is committed to worker and public safety and has invested significant resources to prevent accidents. These resources include personnel training as well as considering safety in design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the facility. It is HLBE's policy to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, plant personnel will respond to contain the release and notify external emergency responders, as necessary. The facility also maintains a Health & Safety Plan and a Spill Prevention, Control & Countermeasure (SPCC) Plan.\n\n\n\nFACILITY DESCRIPTION AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE:\n\n\n\nThe HLBE ethanol plant is located in Heron Lake, Jackson County, Minnesota. The facility utilizes corn/milo to produce ethanol via natural fermentation to produce fuel grade ethanol for blending with gasoline and other motor fuels. Co-products produced as a result of ethanol manufacturing include Dried Distiller's Grains with Solubles (DDGS), corn oil and corn syrup. The substances regulated under the RMP program are Propane and Natural Gasoline (Flammable Mixture), also known as Denaturant. \n\n\n\nThe facility had previously utilized Anhydrous Ammonia within the process for ethanol generation as a food source for microbes and was also used for pH adjustment; however, HLBE has not used Anhydrous Ammonia within the process since February 2012 and the tank has been since decommissioned. As such, it has been removed from RMP.  \n\n\n\nPropane is used at the facility to fuel the Loadout Flare, which is a Volatile Organic Compound (VOC) destruction device. Denaturant (Natural Gasoline) is used at the facility for blending with ethanol to comply with Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and "

      "SummaryText": "Trade Bureau (TTB) regulations to allow final sale of the product.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS:\n\n\n\nAn OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) Program has been implemented for Denaturant at the HLBE facility. Propane is exempt from the PSM program at the facility, but extensive safety measures are in place to prevent accidental releases.  The Denaturant and Propane tanks are visually inspected regularly. All associated equipment, including piping, connections, pumps and secondary containment structures are included in the inspection. Some of the checks performed during the daily inspection include: check for signs of leakage, corrosion, staining, and odor around all tank bases, valves, test ports, connections, flanges and manways. If an integrity issue is observed or a possible release is discovered, it is immediately reported to the facility Supervisor and EH&S Manager.\n\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\n\n\n\nThe facility has had no accidental releases in the past five years.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM:\n\n\n\nHLBE has several safety programs in place at the facility that incorporate emergency response, including a Health & Safety Plan and a SPCC Plan. The facility conducts employee training as part of facility activities. The importance of worker, public, and environmental safety is reflected in HLBE's plans and training activities.\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY:\n\n\n\nThe HLBE facility has been designed and constructed to meet existing construction and process safety requirements. HLBE will continue to evaluate and implement changes as necessary to improve safety at the facility.\n\n"
