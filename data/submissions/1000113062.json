We have around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate emergency response organizations (e.g. contracted chlorine emergency response [HAZMAT] teams, local fire department, police department). This provides a means for notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident. In addition to participating in periodic C/WEPC meetings, we conduct periodic walk-around orientation tours of the plant facilities with key representatives of local emergency response organizations. During such tours we discuss and review the source of chlorine at our site, the hazards of a chlorine release, release mitigation features and emergency response actions involving the chlorine system.  Thus, our emergency response plan is fully coordinated with the community emergency response plan.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nAt the West Virginia American Water Huntington Water Treatment Plant we constantly strive to improve the safety of our operations through periodic safety reviews, our incident investigation program, and a program for soliciting safety suggestions from our facility workers. We resolve all findings from our reviews of proposed changes to facilities, equipment, and operations and from analyses of process hazards. Some findings of this type can result in modifications to the process. the prevention program, or administrative controls. The following is a list of improvements that we are planning to implement at the facility during the next 5 years to help prevent and/or better respond to accidental chemical releases:\n\nWVAW is currently on track to eliminate the gaseous chlorine process from this facility and replace it with a Sodium Hypochlorite system sometime between 2026 and 2028."

Our program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, contractors, the public, and the environment during emergency situations. The program consists of procedures for responding to a chlorine release. The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including (1) proper first aid and emergency medical treatment for human exposures, (2) facility evacuation plans and accounting for facility personnel after an evacuation, (3) notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and (4) post-incident follow-up requirements. Procedures are in place governing the establishment of the plant's Emergency Operation Center where management personnel can direct and control emergency operations on an as-needed basis.\n\nIn addition, we have procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment, as well as instructions that address the use of emergency response equipment. Employees receive training in these procedures to perform their specific emergency response duties. The emergency response program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to plant facilities or to the chlorine storage and feed process, or when improvement benefits are recognized. Affected personnel are informed about, and trained on, the changes.\n\nThe overall emergency response program for the plant is coordinated with the C/WEPC - the local emergency planning committee (LEPC) having jurisdiction in Cabell and Wayne Counties - and with Cabell County and City of Huntington, West Virginia, emergency management officials.  This coordination includes periodic meetings of the C/WEPC, which includes local emergency response offici"

It is a surface water treatment plan with its source water being the Ohio River.  The facility is located in Cabell County in the State of West Virginia.  The Huntington Water Treatment Plant is a water treatment facility that takes raw river water from the Ohio River in Huntington, West Virginia, and treats the river water with chlorine and other chemicals to make potable (drinking) quality water for public distribution and consumption.  Sewage treatment is not a part of plant operations. The plant handles one RMP-regulated toxic substance above the EPA threshold quantity, which is chlorine. No regulated flammable substances are present at the treatment plant.\n The chlorine storage room is designed hold up to 22 one-ton containers and is equipped with a scrubber system. Chlorine is delivered to our plant and stored in 1-ton (ton) cylinders as liquified gas under pressure. This facility utilizes a vacuum feed system.  There is a bank of 5 cylinders that are feeding at any one time (3 pre-treatment and 2 post-treatment). A vacuum regulator is attached to each individual cylinder. Feed rates are set and controlled from chlorinator units located in the adjacent chlorine feed room.  From the chlorinators, chlorine gas is injected at the outlet of the chlorinators into the water stream. \n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWest Virginia American Water Huntington Water Treatment Plant is committed to operating and maintaining all of our processes (especially those using hazardous substances) in a safe and responsible manner. We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees, contractors, and the public, as well as protection of the environment.
