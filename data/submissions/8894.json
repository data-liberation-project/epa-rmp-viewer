      "SummaryText": "    Introduction\n\nUSEPA's RMP rule (40 CFR 68), published in the Federal Register on June 20, 1996, was developed to assist facilities in preventing accidental releases of highly toxic or flammable chemicals.  The RMP rule applies to an owner or operator of a stationary source that has more than a threshold quantity of a regulated substance in a process, as determined under '68.115.\n\nThe USEPA has established three tiers of requirements to reduce the level of effort for facilities with a lower risk of offsite impacts.  These tiers are known as Programs 1, 2, and 3.  Program 1 applies to any process that has not had an accidental release with prescribed offsite consequences for five years and has no public receptors impacted by a worst-case release.  Program 3 applies to processes in specified industries, and to all processes subject to the OSHA PSM standard, unless the process is eligible for Program 1.  Program 2 applies to processes not covered by Programs 1 or 3.\n\nThe South Bend Water Works Pinhook Filtration Plant and Well Field utilizes more than the threshold quantity of chlorine (2,500 pounds) in their process.  Therefore, this facility is required to submit a Risk Management Plan (RMP) as defined in '68.150 by June 21, 1999 (three years after publication of the final rule). Since public employees are covered under the state-delegated OSHA program, the Pinhook Filtration Plant and Well Field is subject to the OSHA PSM standard and is therefore subject to Program 3 requirements.  \n\nUSEPA's RMP rule requires that covered facilities prepare an executive summary.  The following pages represent the executive summary, summarizing the items required as described in '68.155 (a) through (g).\n\n\n    '68.155(a) Accidental Release and Emergency Response Policies\n\nIn order to ensure the safety of the South Bend Water Works chlorination systems, the South Bend Water Works depends on the commitment and team effort of their employees and suppliers.  This commitment and team effort "

      "SummaryText": "is supported from the top management at the City of South Bend.  \n\nThe South Bend Water works has established a Prevention Program to ensure the integrity of the chlorination systems and minimize the potential for releases.  The Prevention Plan contains safety information relating to chlorine and the chlorination system and establishes standard protocols for items such as system operations, maintenance, system changes, contractor safety, and incident investigation.  The Prevention Plan also describes training for employees on the safe operation of the chlorination systems.  In addition, at least once a year, South Bend Water Works chlorine provider sponsors a training seminar on safety and handling of chlorine, which is attended by both South Bend Water Works and South Bend Fire Department employees.  \n\nThe South Bend Water Works has established emergency response procedures, which are documented in the South Bend Water Works Distribution Department Emergency Response Plan.   South Bend Water Works facilities containing chlorine are equipped with ambient chlorine detectors (inside the chlorine ton container rooms), ambient level displays (outside the chlorine ton container rooms), and audible alarms (outside the chlorine ton container rooms).  \n\nThe ton cylinders are equipped with vacuum regulators, through which chlorine gas flows to the injector under vacuum.  Loss of vacuum causes the vacuum-regulating valve to automatically shut off the gas supply at the source.  A scrubber is present at this facility that is capable of mitigating the release of chlorine from one of the 1-ton containers.  All potential releases from South Bend Water Works facilities will be responded to by the South Bend Fire Department, whose members are aware of the presence of chlorine at the facilities and trained to respond to such emergencies.\n\n\n    '68.155(b) Stationary Source and Substance Handled\n\nThe stationary source subject to 40 CFR Part 68 is the Pinhook Filtration Plant and Well Fiel"

      "SummaryText": "d facility.  This location is a 14.6-mgd facility consisting of four wells with pumping capacities of 3.7-mgd, 3.5-mgd, 3.7 mgd, and 3.7 mgd.  Water from these wells is treated by the following sequence of processes: pre-aeration chlorination, aeration, pre-filtration chlorination, filtration, high service pumping, fluoride addition, and final chlorination.  The groundwater is then pumped into the South Bend Water Works distribution system by three of the four high service discharge pumps.  Each high service discharge pump has a capacity of 4-mgd; however one pump always remains on standby.  The resulting distribution capacity of the facility is 12-mgd.\n\nThe Pinhook Filtration Plant and Well Field facility uses two 1-ton chlorine containers connected in parallel to supply chlorine to the pumped water.  These containers are located inside of a building.  One container is isolated by a vacuum automatic transfer valve. An additional five 1-ton containers, which may be empty or full, can be stored inside the building in the same room as the two in-use containers. \n\nGaseous chlorine from the 1-ton containers is drawn by a vacuum to a chlorinator located inside the building. In the chlorinator, the gaseous chlorine is mixed with treated water (pumped to provide a higher pressure for injection) to form a chlorine solution.  The chlorine solution is then injected at one of three locations: 1) at a pit, for pre-aeration chlorination; 2) into the aeration basin, for pre-filtration chlorination; and 3) at an outside pit into the high service main, for final chlorination. The filtered, chlorinated water is then distributed to South Bend Water Works customers.\n\n    '68.155(c) Offsite Consequence Analysis\n\nIn accordance with the requirements of the rule, a worst case and alternative case release scenario were evaluated.  The worst-case release scenario was determined in accordance with the requirements in 40 CFR 68.22 and 40 CFR 68.25(b,c).  For the Pinhook Filtration Plant and Well"

It is assumes that the container ruptures and its contents escape to the ground in ten minutes.  The worst-case scenario requires a ground level release height.  It was assumed that the release occurred outside, and no mitigation measures were incorporated into the evaluation.   The reference tables in the USEPA RMP Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants were used to determine the toxic endpoint for the worst case scenario.  The toxic endpoint distance indicated that residential areas, parks, and schools could be impacted by a worst case release.\n\nThe facility is also required to complete at least one alternative release scenario.  The alternative release scenario considered was completed in accordance with the guidelines provided in 40 CFR 68.22 and 40 CFR 68.28.  The alternative release scenario involved the shearing-off or some other significant damage to the 5/16 inch valve of the 1-ton container.  It is assumed that this tank damage occurs inside the building, and the mitigation provided by the building was incorporated into the evaluation.  As with the worst case scenario, the reference tables in USEPAs RMP Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants was used to determine the toxic endpoint, and the resulting toxic endpoint predicted potential off-site impacts.\n\n\n    '68.155(d) Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe Prevention Plan describes measures taken at the South Bend Water Works facilities to prevent releases.  The South Bend Water Works has a Prevention Program for the chlorine systems, which is documented in the Prevention Plan.
