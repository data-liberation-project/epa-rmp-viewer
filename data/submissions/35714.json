The facility has developed and implemented accident prevention programs and emergency response plans appropriate to this site as required by a number of OSHA and/or EPA regulations.  These programs and plans are reviewed at least once annually to determine their continued compliance with regulatory requirements and ensure all information is complete and up-to-date.\n\nAmrep produces both aerosol and liquid pour products used in the automotive maintenance industry.  A-46 Hydrocarbon is used as a propellant for aerosol containers.  The A-46 Hydrocarbon system may contain a maximum total quantity of 37,000 pounds of a mixture of propane and isobutane, which exceeds the RMP threshold for a flammable mixture of listed chemicals.  The A-46 is stored in one horizontal aboveground storage tank located outside the building near the southwestern corner of the property boundary.\n\nThe A-46 Hydrocarbon process at Amrep presents a fire and/or explosion risk, and it satisfies the RMP rule criteria for a Program 3 process: the process has the potential for offsite impacts in the worst-case scenario, the process is also  subject to OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) of Highly Hazardous Chemicals (29 CFR 1910.119), and the process can be classified into one of the nine SIC codes listed in the RMP rule.  The Amrep facility has a complete and separate program in place to comply with OSHA's PSM Standard.  The PSM program includes such elements as a preventive maintenance plan that requires all process equipment to be periodically inspected and serviced.  This will ensure that the equipment remains in good operating condition and will minimize the probability of accidents due to faulty equipment.  Amrep's PSM program also has written operating procedures that cover all phases of the facility's operations, including information on safety devices.  The operating procedures are use"

There are existing safe work practices, such as the Hot Work Permit, and Contractor selection criteria that are reviewed periodically and updated as necessary to ensure that routine and non-routine work is performed safely.  Other program elements include the collection and review of equipment design information to ensure that equipment used meets and/or exceeds industry standards, Management of Change, Pre-Startup Review, Incident Investigation, and Compliance audits to ensure continued safe operation and prompt correction of deficiencies.\n\nThe Amrep facility has had no releases that resulted in offsite consequences by A-46 Hydrocarbon in the past five years.\n\nAmrep's Contingency Plan and Emergency Response Procedures have been written so that coordination exsists with the local emergency responders, including the Jacksonville Fire Department and the Jacksonville Sheriff's Office (JSO).  Notification regarding on-site hazardous chemicals is submitted annually to the Local Emergency Planning Committee as well as an outside emergency response contractor.  Emergency notification is made by dialing \"911\" and communication regarding imminent safety, health and/or environmental impact to the surrounding community would be made by the JSO.\n\nAll of Amrep's safety and environmental programs receive full support by plant management and involvement/participation by employees at all levels thus ensuring continued implementation of new procedures and/or equipment or technology and improvement of safety and communication to anyone or anyplace potentially impacted by a disaster occuring at the Amrep facility."
