We adhere to corporate policies, which can be summarized as \"All safety and environmental incidents can be prevented\".  In addition to this emphasis on preventing accidental releases, we are prepared to respond to any emergency situation that may occur.  This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including:\r\n\r\n- A description of our facility and the use of substances covered by this regulation\r\n- A summary of results from our assessment of the potential offsite consequences from accidental chemical releases\r\n- An overview of our accidental release prevention programs\r\n- A five-year history of accidental releases of chemicals covered by this regulation\r\n- An overview of our emergency response program\r\n- An overview of planned improvements at our facility to help prevent accidental chemical releases from occurring and adversely affecting our employees, the public, or the environment\r\n- The certifications this regulation requires us to provide\r\n- The detailed data elements about our risk management program\r\n\r\n2.0 Stationary Source and Regulated Substance\r\n\r\nThe DuPont Louisville Works site is located along the Ohio River in Jefferson County, Kentucky just southwest of the city of Louisville in an area known locally as \"Rubbertown\".

We share the site with a Chemours HCFC-22 manufacturing facility.

The following are brief summaries of these scenarios, including information about the key administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the exposure distances for each scenario:\r\n\r\nWorst Case Scenario - Regulated Toxic Chemicals\r\n\r\nThe Worst Case Scenario for the toxic chemicals on our site is the loss of containment of anhydrous hydrogen fluoride from a 1\" vent valve from the HF transfer header (from railcar to HF product tank).  EPA RMP Comp was used for the worst case scenario, this toxic gas release would have an off-site impact on other industry, residential populations, and public receptors.  Additionally, the scenario was processed by the PHAST program, and since the toxic endpoint for this program is more conservative, the receptor and population analysis uses these results.  This event is unlikely due to the high-integrity design, including full head shields. \r\n\r\nAlternative Release Scenarios - Regulated Toxic Chemicals\r\n\r\nHydrogen fluoride -- A 1/8\" hole on a pipe (from corrosion) or flange (due to flange make-up incorrectly) releasing hydrogen fluoride.  The EPA RMP Comp was used for the model program for the alternative scenario, this toxic gas release would have an off-site impact on ot"

The EPA program RMP Comp was used for worst-case scenario, this flammable gas if ignited would have an off-site impact on other industry receptors, but not residential or public receptors.  Additionally, the scenario was processed by the PHAST program, and since the toxic endpoint for this program is more conservative, the receptor and population analysis uses these results. The likelihood of a catastrophic failure of the VF Sphere bottom outlet, from the PHA assessment, is extremely unlikely due to the high-integrity design and maintenance of the sphere.  Additionally, ignition sources in the area of the sphere are strictly controlled.\r\n\r\nAlternative Release Scenario - Regulated Flammable Chemicals\r\n\r\n1,1 difluoroethane -- A leak in a liquid unloading line hose failure releasing 1,1 difluoroethane, causing potentially a vapor cloud explosion, but more likely a flash fire.  The EPA program RMP Comp was used for alternative scenario, this flammable gas if ignited would have an off-site impact on other industry receptors, but not residential or public receptors.

We have on-site alarm and public address systems to alert and inform personnel of an emergency situation.  All of our Emergency Response Team members are trained as HAZMAT technicians according to the requirements of 29 CFR 1910.120.  Emergency response team members receive additional training in capping, patching, plugging, and other techniques for stopping leaks.\r\n\r\nWe maintain an integrated contingency plan, which consolidates all of the various federal, state, and local regulatory requirements for emergency response planning.  Our program provides the essential planning and training, including active community drills and critiques following all emergency response drills and activities, for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations. Through the Louisville/Jefferson County Emergency Management Agency and the Rubbertown Community Advisory Council,  we assist in public education regarding risk, risk management, and shelter-in-place.   Furthermore, we coordinate our plan with the following local agencies:\r\n\r\nLouisville/Jefferson County Local Emergency Planning Committee (KY)\r\nLake Dreamland Fire Department\r\nKentucky Emergency Response Plan\r\nU.
