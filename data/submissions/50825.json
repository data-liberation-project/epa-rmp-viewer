LLC - Arapaho Gas Plant\r\n\r\nThis summary provides a brief description of the MarkWest Western Oklahoma Gas Co. LLC (MarkWest) Risk Management Plan (RMP) for the Arapaho Gas Plant in Custer County, Oklahoma.\r\n\r\n1.\tAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n\r\nMarkWest is committed to the safety of its employees and the public.  MarkWest utilized generally accepted and recognized engineering practices, codes and standards in the design and construction of the Arapaho Plant. Safe work practices have been established and written in a formal Safety & Environmental Policy Manual.  A site specific Emergency Plan has been prepared which is tailored to the facility and the resources available in the community.  Operating manuals and drawings are current for the plant.\r\nMarkWest has a training program in place for employees assigned to the facility to ensure they can operate the plant safely during normal operations as well as during an emergency situation.\r\n\r\n2.\tDescription of Arapaho Plant and the Regulated Substances Handled\r\n\r\nThe Arapaho Plant is located 9 miles North of Butler, Oklahoma in Custer County.  Its primary activity is the extraction of natural gas liquids (NGL) from a natural gas stream through the operation of a cryogenic expander unit.  Other processes at the site include compression, dehydration, and product CO2 removal to meet specifications for sales.  The plant\u00bfs product, NGL, is the regulated flammable substance at the plant.  NGL is a mixture of ethane, propane, butane, pentane, and heavier hydrocarbons.  There is no storage facility for NGL product on site. All NGL product is transported from the plant by pipeline as it is produced.\r\n\r\n3.\tThe Worst Case Release Scenario \r\n\r\nThe Arapaho Plant is a Program 1 facility.  The parameters of the offsite consequence analysis for this MarkWest facility were based on the requirements set forth in the RMP rul"

The worst case radius of effect was determined utilizing RMP*Comp software provided by the EPA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4.\tFive Year Accident History\r\n\r\nThe Arapaho gas plant has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases since start-up of operations of the facility in 2000. Due to stringent release prevention policies, there have been no accidental releases during this period.\r\n\r\n5.\tEmergency Response Program\r\n\r\nMarkWest has an Emergency Response Plan that is site specific to the Arapaho Plant.  The plan describes response procedures to minimize hazards to the public and environment in the event of a regulated substance release.  Also included in the Plan is a facility plot plan, chemical inventory, procedures for first aid and medical treatment, evacuation, control and containment of a release, and notification to local emergency response agencies.\r\n\r\nEmergency drills are conducted periodically within MarkWest\u00bfs Western Oklahoma System to provide personnel with experience in responding to simulated emergencies.  Drill scenarios vary so that personnel obtain training on a broad range of possible emergency situations.  These drills are conducted periodically, but at least annually.\r\n\r\n6.\tPlanned Changes to Improve Safety  \r\nMarkWest has an ongoing program to monitor the safety of the Arapaho Plant.  A safety hazard reporting program is in place that provides all employees with a mechanism to submit hazards identified.  Reports are reviewed to determine an effective method of resolution and a formal tracking system is in place to follow up to ensure the hazard is resolved in a timely manner.\r\nIn addition to the safety hazard reporting system, a formal facility inspection program is in place that requires scheduled inspections by a team of inspectors.  Deficiencies and recommendations resulting from these inspections are documented and tracked to ensure they are addressed in a timely manner.\r\nIm"

Conclusion\r\nMarkWest Western Oklahoma, LLC has taken all necessary measures required by EPA and OSHA regulations to ensure the continued safe operations of the MarkWest \u00bf Arapaho Gas Plant.  This risk management program illustrates MarkWest\u00bfs commitment to employee, public, and environmental safety.  In the unforeseeable event that a release does occur, MarkWest\u00bfs emergency action plan combined with the assistance of the Custer LEPC provide assurance that such an event will be successfully and safely mitigated.\r\nPage 1"
