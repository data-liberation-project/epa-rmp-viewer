We are proud of our facility and the stability of our workforce.\r\n\r\nThe Federal Accidental Release Prevention Requirements under the Clean air Act Section 112 &reg;, codified in 40 CFR Part 68, were written to help prevent the accidental release of extremely hazardous substances and to minimize the consequences of any such release.  All facilities with threshold quantities (TQs) of the listed regulated acutely toxic and flammable substances are subject to these provisions.  FLEXSYS has one chemical, carbon disulfide (CS2), that meets the toxic chemicals TQs, and thus, this substance must be included in a Risk Management Program for its use within a process.\r\n\r\nCS2 is a yellowish liquid with an unpleasant odor.  In nature, very small amounts are found in gases from volcanic eruptions and in marshy areas.  CS2 has been an important industrial chemical since the 1800s because of its many useful properties, including its ability to solubilize fats, rubbers, phosphorus, sulfur, and other elements.  CS2 has been highly suitable for other industrial applications including the vulcanization and manufacture of rubber accessories; the production of resins, plywood adhesives, and flotation agents; petroleum-well cleaning; brightening of precious metals in electroplating; rust removal from metals; and removal and recovery of metals and other elements from wastewater and other media.  In agriculture, CS2 was formerly widely used as a fumigant to control insects in stored grain.\r\n\r\nThe major Clean Air Act Section 112 &reg; (\"112&reg;\") requirements with which FLEXSYS must comply for use of CS2 include:\r\n     - Management System development and documentation;\r\n     - Hazard Assessment for each affected process,\r\n     - Prevention Program completion,\r\n     - Emergency Response Program coordination, and\r\n     - Risk Management Plan submittal.\r\n\r\nIn addition, FLEXSYS recognizes its re"

The probability that a worst-case release might occur or the possible causes of such a release are not considered.\r\n     - The alternative scenario involves an accidental release that is \"more likely to occur\" than the worst-case scenario.  Scenarios to consider include transfer hose splits or uncoupling, process piping failures, process vessel or pump cracks and failures, vessel overfilling and spill or over pressurization and venting through relief valves or rupture disks, and shipping container mishandling and breakage or puncturing leading to a spill. FLEXSYS prepared worst-case release scenario analyses and alternative release scenario analyses for CS2, based on requirements given in the 112&reg; rule.\r\n\r\nThe Offsite Consequence Analysis of the chemical release was analyzed using appropriate air dispersion analysis and modeling techniques.  Air dispersion modeling is the use of a computer to simulate the spread of air pollutants.  Dispersion modeling can be used to determine the movement and concentration of toxic gases emitted from an accidental release.  To determine the Offsite Consequence Analysis, FLEXSYS used several air dispersion models and modeling techniques, as follows:\r\n     - RMP*Comp is based on the U.S. EPA's RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance (March 2009).

ALOHA is part of the CAMEO (Computer-Aided Management of Emergency Operations) system used by many emergency response teams.\r\n\r\nShould an accidental release occur that has potential for offsite consequences, plant-wide alarms will sound.  The emergency response team will provide an immediate and rapid response and emergency shutdown systems and procedures will be activated.\r\n\r\nModeling Limitations and Assumptions\r\nAir-dispersion models are limited in their ability to accurately predict the impact of a chemical release.  Their limitations increase as the complexity of the topography surrounding the release site increases.  The EPA-recommended models used for the FLEXSYS worst-case and alternative release scenarios have likely over-estimated the impact distance, because of several complicating conditions:\r\n     - Surrounding the CS2 storage tanks, reactor vessel, and piping are large industrial buildings and structures.  These features disrupt and redirect airflow, but the models used assume winds are steady and moving in a straight line.\r\n     - Beyond plant property, buildings, structures, vegetation, and terrain features also serve to disrupt and redirect airflow.\r\n     - The chemical emitted is assumed to have no reaction with the ground, other chemicals, or other potential release conditions.  However, it is likely that a release of CS2 will deposit on the ground and other surfaces as it disperses from a ground-level source.  In addition, because of an auto ignition temperature, CS2 will likely ignite.  In each case, the resulting impact distance is likely to be less than the distance predicted by the models.  \r\nNote that a \"synergistic effect\" c"

In addition, if a chemical release occurs, the Prevention Program ensures that procedures and equipment are established to detect and mitigate the impact of such a release.  The completion of Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) requirements essentially satisfies the 112&reg; Prevention Program requirements for CS2 in the Program-level 3 processes.\r\nSafeguarding the public from accidental releases through an effective Prevention Program is an important component of the 112&reg; rule.

Annual Certification helps to assure the currency and accuracy of the procedures.  In addition, safe work practices, applicable to employees and contractor employees, are developed and implemented to provide for the control of hazards during a variety of plant operations.\r\n     - Training:  Initial and refresher training is conducted as appropriate for each employee involved in operating a process.  FLEXSYS ascertains and documents that each employee has received and understood the required training.\r\n     - Mechanical Integrity:  FLEXSYS has developed a comprehensive mechanical integrity program that applies to pressure vessels and storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems and devices, emergency shutdown systems, controls, and pumps in the covered processes.  Written procedures, training for process maintenance activities, inspection and testing, correction of equipment deficiencies, and quality assurance are all included in FLEXSYS' mech"

The procedures assure that the technical basis for the proposed change, the impact of the change on the environment, safety, and health, the modifications to operating procedures, the necessary time period for the change, and authorization requirements for the proposed change are all addressed.  Appropriate employees and contractors are informed of, and trained in, the change prior to startup of the process of affected part of the process.  Updates to the RMP are made if required by the nature of the change.  \r\n     - Pre-startup review:  A pre-startup safety review is performed for new covered processes and for significantly modified covered processes at FLEXSYS.  Such review confirms that prior to introduction of regulated substances to the process that construction and equipment is in accordance with design specifications; safety, operating, maintenance, and emergency procedures are in place and adequate; for new stationary sources, management of change requirements have been met; and training of each employee involved in operating a process has been completed.\r\n     - Compliance audits:  FLEXSYS evaluates compliance with the provisions of this section at least every three years to verify that the procedures and practices developed under the standard are adequate and are being followed.  FLEXSYS' compliance audit is conducted by a team consisting of outside auditors, the ESH Lead and representatives from each covered process.  A report of the compliance audit findings is developed.  FLEXSYS promptly determines and documents an appropriate response to each of the audit findings, establishes a schedule for acting on the findings and documents that deficiencies have been"

This investigation shall be initiated as promptly as possible, but not later than 48 hours following the incident.  An incident report is prepared at the conclusion of the investigation.  A system has been established to promptly address and resolve the findings and recommendations of the incident report, with documentation of resolutions and corrective actions.  The report shall be reviewed with all affected personnel, including contract employees where applicable, whose job tasks are relevant to the incident findings.\r\n     - Employee participation:  FLEXSYS has developed a written plan of action regarding employee participation.  Employees and their representatives are consulted with on the conduct and development of process hazards analyses and on the development of the other elements of process safety management in the 112&reg; rule.  Employees and their representatives are also provided access to process hazard analyses and to all other information required to be developed under the rule.\r\n     - Hot-work permit:  FLEXSYS issues a hot-work permit for hot-work operations conducted on or near a covered process.  The permit documents that the fire prevention and protection requirements in 29 CFR 1910.252(a) have been implemented prior to beginning the hot-work operations.  The permit further indicates the date(s) authorized for hot work and identify the object on which the hot-work is to be performed.  The permit is kept on file until the hot-work operations is completed.  \r\n     - Contractors:  FLEXSYS and contract-company owners and operators comply with the requirements for contractors performing maintenance or repair, turnaround, major renovation, or specialty work on or adjacent to a covered process.  Contractor issues include, amon"
