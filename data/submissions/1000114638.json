We have completed this report\nunder the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) risk management program (RMP) to\ncommunicate our efforts to achieve a safe workplace.\n\nThe brewery uses ammonia as a key part of the cooling system that maintains beer at the proper\ntemperature during certain stages of the brewing process. Ammonia is one of the materials covered under the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration's Process Safety Management standard (PSM) and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Risk Management Program regulations. The brewery follows these regulations, as well as others, to ensure that it safely handles, uses, and stores ammonia and other potentially hazardous chemicals safely. \n\nOur global environmental, health, and safety (EHS) policy and requirements promote the overall\nsafety of this brewery, employees, and the public. This policy includes risk reduction programs that provide assurance for the safe management of process risks to prevent environmental, health and safety incidents and to protect the workplace, the community and the environment. These programs enable the brewery to prevent the occurrence, or minimize the consequences of, significant releases of ammonia.\n\nIt is Anheuser-Busch's policy to conduct our business in accordance with all applicable laws,\nregulations, and permits and to promote a safe workplace and a quality environment. Each\nemployee is trained and required to comply strictly with this policy. We do not allow production goals or financial objectives to over-ride safety and environmental concerns.\n\nAlso, it is Anheuser-Busch's policy to lead by example so that other companies, including vendors and suppliers, are similarly interested in protecting the health and safety of employees and safeguarding the environment. We are co"

Anheuser-Busch employees whose actions in the performance of their duties may affect the environment and/or public health are trained sufficiently to permit them to comply strictly with our EHS policy.\n\nIn conducting our businesses, we continue to seek and implement cost effective methods to reduce the EHS impact of our operations. We integrate EHS considerations into our business planning and decision-making processes, including product research and development, packaging, and new manufacturing methods. Our continuous EHS improvement goals include pollution prevention and resource conservation. We ask our contractors to adopt EHS standards, ethics, and policies similar to our own and we will give preference to suppliers that do so.\n\nWe encourage our employees, customers, and the public to share with us their EHS concerns. We\ncontinually talk with local authorities in communities in which we operate to share ideas about\npreventing incidents with materials we use or store.\n\nAmmonia System\nAmmonia is used in the refrigeration system of the brewery. As part of the brewing process, the\nbeer is cooled to ensure its consistency, flavor and overall quality. The beer packaged in kegs is\nstored in a refrigerated area in our facility until it's shipped. Because of the characteristics of\nammonia, our employees observe certain safety precautions to prevent unnecessary human and\nenvironmental exposure, both within the brewery and in the surrounding community.\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario\nAs required by the EPA's Risk Management regulations, we have identified an extremely unlikely\n\"worst-case\" scenario in which a liquid ammonia receiver located outside fails and releases 100% of its capacity of 26,036 pounds of anhydrous ammonia (5.42 lbs/gal @ 32 psig, 18.6 deg F). Under worst-case weather conditions am"

      "SummaryText": "monia could travel 2.9 miles before dispersing enough to no longer pose a threat to the public.\n\nThis scenario is unlikely to occur at the Baldwinsville brewery for a number of reasons:\nBrewery piping and vessels that contain ammonia meet or exceed industry manufacturing and\nquality control standards;\nAmmonia is not corrosive in the form in which it is used at the brewery;\nPressure relief safety valves limit operating pressures so the chance of a large-scale release is\nminimal;\nOperating level of the vessel is well below full capacity with routine monitoring and high level safety interlocks; \nManual safety valves allow the immediate shut-off of the ammonia system;\nEquipment is inspected and kept in proper working order and replaced when necessary;\nThe brewery has an emergency response plan and equipment in place (see description below).\n\nAlternative Release Scenario\nWe have also identified an \"alternative release\" scenario involving the release of 4,120 pounds of anhydrous ammonia due to the opening of a pressure safety relief valve, which itself is a system\nsafety device designed to relieve pressure to avoid a more serious release. This release scenario is based upon historical release data for Anheuser-Busch breweries. Under common weather\nconditions, this amount of ammonia could travel 0.4 miles and remain mostly on brewery property before dispersing enough to no longer pose a threat to the public.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\nAnheuser-Busch has years of experience operating ammonia-based refrigeration systems at its\nbreweries. This experience has helped bring about designs and operating plans that produce a safe system. \n\nThe following elements have produced this safe operating record:\nProcess hazard analysis and review, including corrective action follow-up requirements;\nStandard operating procedures that all operators of the refrigeration system must follow;\nFormal operator training;\nPreventative maintenance to ensure that the entire refrigeration sy"

The emergency response program is based on OSHA's requirements for emergency action plans (29 CFR 1910.38) and HAZWOPER (29 CFR 1910.120). We have trained employees for emergency response and maintain a plan titled ES Incident Plan\n(HAZWOPER Plan) which has been supplied to, and discussed with, the Onondaga County Department of Emergency Management. We conduct annual coordination with local agencies to help us remain prepared to implement the ES Incident Plan (HAZWOPER Plan) at the brewery.\n\nBrewery personnel notify local agencies when emergency response is needed.

      "SummaryText": "Safety\nAnheuser-Busch's Baldwinsville brewery ammonia refrigeration system is periodically modified to improve safety. In Baldwinsville a continuous ammonia monitoring/detection system was installed in the machine room (Powerhouse). Upon detection of a high ammonia concentration, the system will alarm and automatically shut down all boilers, ammonia compressors, and other electrical equipment in addition to activating the exhaust ventilation fans in the machine room. This system is tested on an annual basis to confirm proper function.\n\u00a0\nAdditionally, the brewery has recently conducted a minimum system safety evaluation in accordance with Chapter 8 of the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) 9 - Standard for Minimum System Safety Requirements for Existing Closed Circuit Ammonia Refrigeration System and is actively working to address any opportunities to improve the system through that evaluation.\n\n\nConclusion\nAnheuser-Busch is pleased to share its record of safe operations with the citizens of Baldwinsville. We believe the Risk Management Plan under which we are providing this information is an important tool for encouraging communications with our neighbors. Although we are confident the \"worst case\" and \"alternative\" scenarios presented in this report are highly unlikely, we want you ,our neighbors, to know we are prepared to respond quickly and effectively should one ever occur. Anheuser-Busch has worked hard over the years to ensure the highest standard of safety. Our goal is to continue the excellent and safe track record."
