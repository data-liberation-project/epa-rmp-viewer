Our belief in environmental stewardship is revealed in our policies and demonstrated through our actions. Our commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance and employee training associated with the processes in our facility. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. Although such releases may not be foreseeable, our plans are fully coordinated with the highly trained emergency response personnel at King County LEPS and the Valley Regional Fire Authority to control and mitigate the effects of any release should they occur.\r\n\r\nThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\r\nOur facility's primary activities revolve around large-scale public storage of food products. Anhydrous\r\nammonia is the major regulated substance present at our facility. The entire ammonia inventory is used as a\r\nrefrigerant to support our process. \r\n\r\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\nOur facility has taken steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR Part 68 by the EPA. In addition, our facility is subject to the OSHA, PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119. Our facility is also subject to EPCRA, Section 302 notification requirements.\r\n\r\nThe following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our\r\nstationary source:\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\nLineage-Algona maintains a detailed record of written safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all"

The methodology used to carry out these analyses is the \"what if/checklist\"\r\nmethodology. The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and\r\nprocess operations and will be revalidated at a regular interval of three years or sooner if required by the\r\nregulation. Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\r\n\r\nOperating Procedures\r\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Lineage -Algona maintains written operating procedures. These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround. The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved with the processes.\r\n\r\nTraining\r\nLineage-Algona has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are completely competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes. Refresher training is provided at least every three years and more frequently as needed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMechanical Integrity\r\nLineage-Algona carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations. Process equipment examined by these checks includes pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.\r\nMaintenance procedures are performed by qualified personnel with a strong background in maintenance\r\npractices.

Process operators, maintenance personnel and all other employees whose job tasks are affected by a change in a process are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the changes.\r\n\r\nPre-startup Reviews\r\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice. These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\r\n\r\nCompliance Audits\r\nLineage-Algona conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP Rule are being implemented. These audits are carried out at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\r\n\r\nIncident Investigation\r\nLineage-Algona promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance. These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring. All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\r\n\r\nEmployee Participation\r\nLineage-Algona believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort. Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.
