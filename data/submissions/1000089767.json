      "SummaryText": "Gavilon manufactures ammonium polyphosphate fertilizer as 10-34-0 by combining superphosphoric acid with ammonia vapor. The reaction occurs by combining the ammonia vapor and superphosphoric acid in a simple pipe or reactor tee under anhydrous conditions. After combination, a reaction occurs which releases heat (with temperatures of 575?F to 650?F) and produces a highly polymerized, partially neutralized \"melt\". The heat of reaction causes several chemical changes to occur. First, water is removed as steam, and phosphorus atoms in the super phosphoric acid combine to form polyphosphate molecules. Secondly, the anhydrous ammonia reacts with these molecules (i.e. polyphosphate molecules) to produce the ammonium polyphosphate melt.\n\n\n\nThe highly polymerized, partially neutralized \"melt\" formed within the pipe is discharged into a hot well where it is dispersed, dissolved by the addition of water and neutralized with aqua ammonia to a final pH of 5.95 - 6.20 and a specific gravity of 1.395 - 1.420 @ 100?F (depending upon the final product). It is then cooled evaporatively by recycling through a tower packed with pall rings and collected at the base in the mix tank. The product, containing 60-80% polyphosphates, is then pumped through a heat exchanger that is also used to vaporize the reactant ammonia and cool the product to below 100?F. It is then routed to storage.\n\n\n\nAt the Gavilon Fertilizer, LLC - Moorhead facility, ammonia is received in supplier owned rail cars and regulated by federal DOT standards.  As rail cars are received, they are visually inspected by the facility manager or his designee for signs of leakage.  The security of the rail cars becomes the responsibility of the facility until emptied and returned to the railroad.  The facility personnel are not trained to make repairs to the rail car, but if defects or leaks are identified, the facility contacts the supplier as well as the railroad officials."
