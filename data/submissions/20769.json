A regulated chlorine process is no longer present at the facility and therefore, is not included in this documentation. \n\nFoster Poultry Farms, Turkey Products, C Street Plant/Blast Freezer and Turlock Distribution Center (formerly Plant 1) (referred to hereafter as \"Foster Farms\" or \"C Street Plant and Distribution Center\") prepared a Chemical Risk Management Program and Process Safety Management Program (RMP/PSM) in general accordance with state and federal regulations. The state risk management regulations, also referred to as the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) program, are codified in California Code of Regulations (CCR), Title 19, Section 2735.1, et. Seq.  The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) also regulates facilities with certain toxic and flammable substances.  The federal regulations are codified in Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 68.  Finally, both CalOSHA and OSHA regulate facilities with certain acutely hazardous materials under the PSM regulations, as defined in CCR Title 8 Section 5189 and CFR Title 29 Part 1910 Section 119, respectively.\n\nFoster Farms prepared the RMP/PSM to satisfy regulatory requirements and to demonstrate a commitment to evaluate and improve chlorine and anhydrous ammonia handling systems and practices at the facility.  Foster Farms recently removed all liquid/gaseous chlorine processes and replaced them with alternative systems, further demonstrating their commitment to reduce chemical risks.  There"

Foster Farms will continue to improve ammonia handling safety through the implementation of the prevention program elements of the RMP/PSM.  In the unlikely event that a ammonia release does occur at the facility, Foster Farms personnel are trained in the appropriate response measures and do not rely on support services provided by the local fire department and/or hazardous materials response team to end the release.\n\nThe C Street Plant and Distribution Center is located at 500/520 C Street in Turlock, California.  Foster Farms purchased the facility in 1982 from the Grange Company.  The main processing building was constructed in the 1950s; the Distribution Center was constructed in 1977.  The C Street Plant and Distribution Center is located on approximately 2 acres bordered by 5th Street on the east and 6th Street on the west.  The north side is bordered by B Street, and the southern border is D Street.  The areas surrounding the facility consist of residential, industrial, and commercial properties.  Portions of the facility are surrounded by a security fence, prohibiting unauthorized access.  Additionally, the entrance to the facility is staffed by plant security personnel 24 hours per day, 365 days per year.\n\nOperations at the facility consist of the processing, storage, and Distribution Center of poultry products.  The facility receives poultry products from other Foster Farms facilities, and packages them or sends them to other Foster Farms' facilities for further processing.  All processing rooms and cold storage units are cooled by air handling units supplied with ammonia.  The ammonia systems at the C Street Plant and Distribution Center are located in secured rooms, in a fenced area, or on the roofs of the facility.\n\nAnhydr"

      "SummaryText": "ous ammonia is used in two closed-loop refrigeration systems at the facility.  The ammonia system for the C Street Plant provides cooling for production areas, storage areas, freezers, water, and ice makers.  The ammonia system for the Distribution Center is used for cooling storage areas.  The desired temperatures are maintained by controlling the flow of ammonia with manually and electrically operated valves, float switches, transfer pumps, and compressor controls.  Ammonia is used as the heat transfer media in the refrigeration systems.  As the ammonia passes through heat exchangers in the various refrigerated areas or units, heat is transferred to the ammonia thus cooling the air, water, or product that is giving up heat.  The ammonia is then compressed and passes through a condenser where it gives up heat to air and water.  The ammonia cycles back through the heat exchangers to repeat the process.  Anhydrous ammonia is a commonly used industrial refrigerant due to its relatively efficient heat transfer characteristics.\n\nThe RMP/PSM regulations require a review of the five-year accident history at the regulated facility.  Foster Farms had one reportable release within the past five years.  On March 15, 1996 an inspection cover gasket on the oil separator of a screw compressor failed and ammonia vapor was released into an engine room equipped with an exhaust fan.  The leak duration was approximately one-half hour.  The leak ended when the operators isolated the oil separator from the system.\n\nThe RMP regulations require facilities to identify and evaluate chemical release scenarios resulting from potential failures of the chemical handling systems covered by the RMP.  Program 3 requirements of the RMP apply to the main ammonia refrigeration system at the C Street Plant; CalARP Program 2 guidelines apply to the smaller ammonia refrigeration system at the Distribution Center.

The regulations define a worst-case release scenario as \"?the greatest amount held in a single vessel?released as a gas over 10 minutes.\"  An alternative release scenario is identified as a release that is more likely to occur at the facility.  For facilities with multiple processes, the regulations require that the worst-case scenario with the greatest distance to the toxic endpoint must be modeled.  Additional worst-case scenarios are not required if the affected populations from worst-case release scenarios from other processes are within the populations affected by the selected scenario.  \n\nThe largest ammonia vessel at the C Street Plant and Distribution Center, the recirculator, contains approximately 13,623 pounds of ammonia at 80% capacity -- the safe fill level for the vessel.  Therefore, the worst-case release scenario for the facility is a release of approximately 13,623 pounds of ammonia in 10 minutes.  Catastrophic failure of the recirculator is required for this scenario to occur.  As required by the RMP regulations, pessimistic atmospheric conditions, very conservative chemical dispersion characteristics, and a toxic endpoint of 200 parts per million (ppm) ammonia vapor were assumed.  The SLAB Model was used for modeling the worst-case release scenario.  SLAB was first developed by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory under contract with the U.S. Department of Energy.  SLAB has been revised and updated by the USAF Engineering and Services Center and the American Petroleum Institute.  SLAB is commonly used to simulate the atmospheric dispersion of denser-than-air releases.\n\nFoster Farms used the alternative release scenario for ammonia described in the EPA's Model Risk Management Program and Plan for Ammonia Refrigeration, November 1998.

The evaluation used a release rate of 78.8 pounds/minute and average weather conditions.  The predicted distance to the toxic endpoint for the alternative release scenario is approximately 0.08 mile. The SLAB Model was also used for modeling the alternative release scenario.\n\nThe RMP regulations require a review of the accidental release prevention program and chemical specific prevention steps used by the facility.  Foster Farms has incorporated many safety features in the ammonia refrigeration systems to prevent system failures and to mitigate potential releases.\n\nThe predominant safety concern with closed-loop ammonia systems is an inadvertent buildup of pressure exceeding pressure ratings or capacities of equipment due to ammonia expansion.  The Foster Farms ammonia systems are continuously monitored by automated control systems that shut down components if deviations from normal operating conditions occur.  The major pressure vessels in the ammonia systems at the C Street Plant and Distribution Center are equipped with pressure relief valves.\n\nOther safety features of the ammonia refrigeration systems at the facility include: \n? emergency shutdown systems\n? component specific safety shutdowns\n? an ammonia leak detection system is installed in the C Street Plant engine room and other rooms in the facility \n? an ammonia leak detection system is installed in the Distribution Center engine room and other rooms in the facility\n? component specific safety shutdowns and the ammonia leak detection system alarm locally and to the security department at Foster Farms' headquarters in Livingston, California \n? many of the ammonia pipes, valves, and components are labeled\n? pressure relief valves are replaced at least every five years\n? fire alarms and sprinkler systems are installed throughout the plants\n? location of ammonia equipment is located in a fenced or secured"

Administrative controls include, but are not limited to, formal training programs for system operators and mechanics, emergency training, a hot work permit program, a lockout/tagout program, a contractor safety program, incident investigation program, mechanical integrity program, management of change program, pre start-up safety review program, and a RMP auditing and inspection program.  Written standard operating procedures (SOPs) have been prepared and are being reviewed for the ammonia systems at the facility.  The SOPs provide a basis for site specific operator training and a ready reference for operating and trouble-shooting the systems.\n\nFoster Farms is committed to maintaining the mechanical integrity of the ammonia refrigeration systems.  A preventive maintenance system is utilized to manage the maintenance of the refrigeration systems.  Preventive maintenance at the facility includes shift, daily, weekly, and periodic inspection; calibration; testing; and overhaul of equipment.  The system is used to track equipment performance and to create reports that are used by maintenance personnel to monitor the frequency of repairs and deviations from normal operating parameters.\n\nChanges to improve safety at the fa"

Others will be addressed during the next eighteen months.  \n\nThe status of significant mitigation measures for the ammonia refrigeration system is as follows:\n? the review and revision of SOPs is nearly completed\n? Foster Farms will test safety shutdowns annually\n? operator training will include SOPs\n? valve tagging is underway\n? recommendations for equipment inspection and maintenance are being incorporated into the preventive maintenance program\n? Foster Farms will evaluate the condition of valves and flanges in Attic #19 and replace as needed\n? a fire diffusion panel is being considered\n? location of gib chiller is being evaluated\n? high level compressor shutoffs will be installed if not already on recirculator and intercooler vessels\n? protection of piping at the old ice maker is being evaluated\n\nFoster Farms will respond to all suggested mitigation measures.  Foster Farms is scheduling completion of proposed actions.  Management responses and support will be consistent with Foster Farms' commitment to safe and environmentally responsible operations.\n\nFoster Farms recognizes that the RMP/PSM is a continuous process for evaluating, monitoring, and improving anhydrous ammonia handling operations at its facility. As such, this document and related attachments and program elements will evolve as Foster Farm continues their ongoing focus and dedication of risk minimization and safety improvement for their employees and surrounding community. Foster Farms will submit revised information if a change occurs that is considered significant and requires resubmission under the regulations. However, minor improvements/modifications to the RMP/PSM and related attachments and program elements will be incorporated consistent with Foster Farms' internal review practices and Foster Farms will maintain the most current versions on site.
