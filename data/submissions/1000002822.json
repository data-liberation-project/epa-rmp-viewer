It is the stated policy of SABIC-IP to safely manage our site operations.  In addition, we have prepared contingency plans to be used in the unlikely event that a major accident should occur.  The efforts at our Washington, W.Va. facility have been recognized by the US Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), who oversees our programs, as among the best in the nation for worker safety. \n\nWe believe it is important for all interested parties to have access to information that can help them better understand our business and our facility.    \n\n0.2 ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nOur company is committed to operating safe and environmentally sound chemical and plastics production facilities everywhere we do business. Protection of our neighbors and workers is the highest priority.  This ongoing commitment to worker and public safety is demonstrated through resources invested for safe design, operation, and maintenance of our facilities.  \n\nIn order to provide top-quality products for our customers, the SABIC-IP Washington WV facility uses in its manufacturing process some raw materials that are classified as toxic or flammable.  We are committed to complying with governing laws, regulations, and engineering standards as well as systematic assessments to manage and maintain a safe operation.   Our operating practices and procedures ensure that numerous controls are implemented to prevent an accidental release of a chemical.  However, if a major release does occur, our trained on-site emergency response organization will be activated. This organization includes a fire brigade as well as medical and chemical emergency response teams.\n\nThe outstanding programs at the Washingto"

This is OSHA's highest recognition for safety performance. This OSHA program includes agency revalidation audits every five years. The Washington facility has been an OSHA VPP Star site since 1993 and our most recent OSHA program review was completed in March of 2009.\n\n0.3 DESCRIPTION OF THE FACILITY AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe SABIC-IP plant is on a 600-acre tract along the Ohio River in Washington, WV, about eight miles south of Parkersburg.  It was built in 1957 and currently employs about 250 people in the Mid-Ohio Valley.  The plant manufactures thermoplastic resins and pellets.  Our products are used in the construction, automotive, medical, electronics, computer, and appliance industries, to name a few.  \n\nThe site is also home to a Technology Center, where SABIC-IP conducts advanced research in polymer technology.  \n\nThe Washington WV plant uses two chemicals that are regulated under the EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP) rule.  These are: acrylonitrile, a regulated toxic substance; and, 1,3-butadiene, a regulated flammable substance.  Acrylonitrile and 1,3-butadiene are raw materials used to manufacture our products. \n\n0.4 GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM/ CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nSABIC-IP has implemented a comprehensive Process Safety Management (or PSM) program to prevent accidental releases of highly hazardous chemicals.  PSM is an integral part of working safely at SABIC-IP facilities.  PSM ensures that proper safety information is in place; operating procedures are followed; chemical hazards are identified; employees and contractors are trained; and, critical equipment is properly inspected and maintained.  PSM satisfies the accidental release prevention program requirements of the RMP.\n\nSome of the many, specific safety features to prevent a chemical a"

Even minor incidents are investigated to identify what went wrong and to learn how to prevent future occurrences.\nThe RMP requires that all incidents involving regulated chemicals that resulted in any off-site impact or significant on-site impacts are reported in this document.

All of our employees are trained in the proper response to an incident.  We also invest in the equipment needed to respond to emergencies, both on-site and off-site.   Our trained fire brigade, medical and chemical response teams work closely with area hospitals, industries, and other response organizations in the Mid-Ohio Valley.  \n\nOngoing training exercises are important to the company's emergency response organization and help better prepare our partners in the community for emergency response necessary in the unlikely event of a major industrial incident. \n\nIn 1993, in partnership with DuPont and Shell Chemical (now Kraton Polymers), we introduced the eleven-siren Industrial Alert System (IAS) in the Mid-Ohio Valley with coverage in Washington County in Ohio and Wood County in West Virginia.  Though we have never had to activate the IAS on an emergency basis at SABIC-IP, the siren system is available to warn the public in the unlikely event of a major incident on site.   The system has been designed to enhance the area's emergency response services.  \n\nSABIC-IP personnel have helped develop emergency preparedness plans for local communities.  In addition, they are members of local emergency planning and emergency preparedness groups, and are members of the Mid-Ohio Valley Industrial Neighbors Group (MOVING) and Central Ohio Valley Industrial Emergency Organization (COVIEO).  \n \n0.7 PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nSABIC-IP is committed to continuously improving the overall safety and environmental performance record at the Washington, WV facility.  Some of the specific planned changes aimed at improving safety are:  \nA? Continuing development of best management practices under OSHA's Volun"
