This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as safety information, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\nWe have one regulated substance present at our facility.  Hydrofluoric Acid, 70% Solution.\n\nThe maximum inventory of hydrofluoric acid, 70% solution at our facility is 10,000 pounds. This regulated substance will be stored and handled in 55-gallon plastic (polyethylene) drums. These drums were manufactured and tested according to the requirements of DOT 49CFR 178. Specifications for Plastic Drums.Peach State Chemical maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards (MSDS), operating parameters and equipment designs associated with the process that involves our regulated substance.\n\nOur facility conducted a comprehensive study to ensure that hazards associated with our process were identified and controlled efficiently. The methodology used to carry out this analysis was Industry Check list method as recommended by CMA's Warehouse Assessment Protocol.  The study was conducted by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and will be revalidated at intervals of three years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis were addressed in a timely manner."
