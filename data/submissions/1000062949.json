      "SummaryText": "RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nThe Nestle Foods facility in Medford, Wisconsin, has an excellent record in preventing and minimizing releases of anhydrous ammonia (hereafter, anhydrous ammonia will be referred to as ammonia).  This facility has implemented the use of an electronic preventive maintenance system, which manages preventative maintenance, inspection, and training aspects of release prevention.  The ammonia compressor safety cutouts are inspected semiannually and maintenance procedures were reviewed in April 2017.\n\nNestle has developed and implemented emergency response procedures at this facility ensure emergency response coverage 24 hours a day, 7 days per week.  There are also adequate provisions for coordination with outside agencies, such as with the Medford Fire Department and Local Emergency Planning Commission (Taylor County Emergency Management Director), in the event of an emergency.\n\n\n\nPROCESS DESCRIPTION AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nNestle manufactures frozen pizza products at the Medford plant.  The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) codes for the primary process at this facility are 311412 and 3114121.  Nestle has one regulated substance under 40 CFR 68 at the Medford plant - ammonia.  The ammonia threshold for triggering applicability to 40 CFR 68 is 10,000 pounds.  The quantity of ammonia stored on site is approximately 46,527 pounds.\n\n\n\nAmmonia is classified as a Group 2 Refrigerant per ASHRAE Standard 34-1989.  The potential risks to people exposed to an accidental ammonia release include irritation of respiratory tract, burning of skin and other tissue when contacted by ammonia vapor, and freezing of skin and other body tissue when contacted by liquid ammonia.\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThis facility is regulated under Process Safety Management (PSM), and has developed an OSHA PSM program for their ammonia refrigeration system.

PSM compliance audits are conducted every 3 years.\n\n\n\nA brief summary of key aspects of the prevention program is provided below:\n\n\n\n?    The facility employs a dedicated and full-time PSM coordinator to ensure the facility's program elements are in compliance and procedures are being followed.\n\n?    Utility/maintenance personnel are present on site and assigned to the ammonia system, 24 hours a day, 7 days per week, all year round.\n\n?    Employees are included in the development of the PSM program.\n\n?    Most of the ammonia pipework is located away from employee traffic patterns and machinery to minimize the chance of ammonia release.\n\n?    The plant provides routine on-the-job training, certification and employee awareness of operating procedures.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe review of this facility's accident history includes the following range of dates:  January 2012 - March 2017.  The rule requires that the 5-year accident history include all accidental releases from covered processes that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.  To date, there have been no accidental spills or releases of ammonia at this facility for the past 5 years meeting those conditions.  This 5-year history does not include any nuisance odor reports (i.e., packing leaks that were reported by employees and repaired by the refrigeration technicians without mishap) or any other small leaks that did not result in an offsite impact or damage on site or off.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThis facility has developed a written emergency response plan, including, but not limited to, steps to address the following topics:\n\n\n\n?    Accidental discharge of hazardous substances and hazardous waste into the env"

Employees receive emergency response training annually (via computer-based training) and participate in emergency evacuation/take cover drills.\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nNestle is committed to continuously making safety improvements.  Currently, Nestle Pizza Division is planning to replace 4 current HVAC that have ammonia loops with HVAC units that have glycol exchangers, eliminating ammonia in those units."
