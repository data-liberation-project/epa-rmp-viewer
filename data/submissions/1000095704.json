(Oberweis) facility located at 951 Ice Cream Drive in North Aurora, Illinois, for the reduction of accidental releases of hazardous materials. This updated, five (5) year Risk Management Plan (RMP) summarizes the management, administrative, procedural, and technological controls that work together to minimize the risk to site personnel, contractors, visitors, and the community and environment at large of hazardous chemical releases. The RMP is organized to correspond with specific U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) RMP, Program 3 of 40 CFR 68, definitions and requirements of Subpart G, including: \n\n?

Oberweis Policies To Protect Health, Environment, and Safety\n\nRisk management and safety are important concerns at Oberweis; this RMP formalizes and documents these activities. Oberweis is committed to conducting its operations in a safe and responsible manner and to reducing risks to human health and to the environment. It is Oberweis' policy to comply with all applicable federal, state, and local rules and regulations.\n\n\n\nThis RMP has identified potential hazards and has taken steps to design and maintain a safe facility in order to prevent releases, and minimize the consequences of accidental releases, which could occur. RMP addresses potentially catastrophic chemical releases that could result in immediate harm and acute health effects to offsite receptors (public and environmental).

Facility Identification\n\nThe Oberweis facility is located at 951 Ice Cream Drive in North Aurora, Illinois and utilizes anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant to maintain the proper temperature of milk, ice cream, and milk products within the facility. \n\n\n\nThe NAICS codes for the facility are 311511 and 31152.  A large portion of the facility is refrigerated to maintain milk and ice cream temperature for storage, packaging, and distribution.   \n\n\n\nThe facility uses ammonia for refrigeration, and is regulated under 40 CFR Part 68, the EPA RMP Rule. \n\n\n\nThe amount of ammonia in the refrigeration system is approximately 15,000 pounds.  The refrigeration system is used for cooling in the freezers, coolers, raw milk tanks, and compressor oil cooling.  The refrigeration system consists of three (3) high stage compressors, three (3) low stage compressors, two (2) evaporative condensers, one (1) -45 recirculator with oil pot and ammonia pumps, one (1) -30 recirculator with oil pot and ammonia pumps, one (1) +17 recirculator with oil pot and ammonia pumps, one (1) high pressure receiver/thermosyphon, one (1) auto purger, one (1) glycol chiller, one (1) liquid transfer vessel, three (3) raw milk silo evaporators, one (1) anti room evaporator, two (2) hardening evaporators, one (1) ingredient cooler evaporator, three (3) freezer evaporators, two (2) floor warming heat exchangers, one (1) production ice cream freezer, seven (7) cooler evaporators, two (2) cream tanks and surge drums, one (1) make-up air unit, and two (2) pasteurizing tanks\n\n\n\nThe total amount of ammonia present on-site has been estimated at approximately 15,000 pounds.\n\n\n\nAn aerial map identifying the site location is included as Appendix A. \n\n\n\nIV.

Appendix D consists of the offsite consequence analysis data and maps for the alternative release scenario. \n\n\n\nVI.    General Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nA prevention program is in place to minimize the risk of hazardous chemical releases in accordance with the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (29 CFR 1910.119) and the EPA Risk Management Program.   \n\n\n\nThis prevention program covers those processes that handle ammonia above the threshold quantity for both PSM and RMP rules. The most recent audit of the PSM program was completed on May 13, 2021. The elements of the PSM / Program 3 prevention program and a brief description are listed below.\n\n?    Employee Participation - Oberweis has developed a site-specific employee participation plan that ensures employees and their representatives are consulted when conducting and developing process hazard analyses, standard operating procedures, and other information required to be developed under the PSM/RMP regulation.  In addition, the employee participation program will ensure employees and their representatives have access to process hazard analyses and all other information required to be developed under PSM/RMP.  \n\n?    Process Safety Information - Oberweis maintains a site-specific PSI program that ensures information pertaining to the hazards, technology, and equipment of the process are properly developed and maintained. Process safety information for the ammonia process has been compiled and was last reviewed and updated during July 2021.\n\n?

In addition, this program ensures PHAs are conducted in accordance with OSHA and EPA regulations and ensures findings and recommendations of PHAs are properly documented. Oberweis conducted a thorough PHA study for the refrigeration system June 22-24 and 29, 2021.\n\n \n\n?    Operating Procedures - Oberweis has developed a site-specific procedure that ensures operating procedures provide clear instruction for different phases of process operations and ensures they are properly maintained.  Annually, the operating procedures will be reviewed and certified as accurate.\n\n?    Training - Oberweis has developed a site-specific training procedure that ensures employees operating the ammonia process have the knowledge to safely operate the process, are aware of the potential hazards of the process, and understand the causes of process problems.\n\n?    Management of Change - Oberweis has developed a site-specific management of change procedure that ensures changes (except for replacement in kind) to the ammonia process, such as additions of new equipment or changes in operating, maintenance, or other procedures are documented. \n\n?    Pre-Startup Review - Oberweis has developed a site-specific pre-startup safety review procedure that ensures a safety review is performed when modifications to the ammonia process are significant enough to require a change in PSI.\n\n?    Mechanical Integrity - Oberweis has developed a site-specific mechanical integrity procedure that ensures written preventative maintenance procedures are developed and maintained, preventative maintenance tests and inspections are properly documented, and employees maintaining the process receive adequate training.  \n\n?

Incident Investigation - Oberweis has developed a site-specific incident investigation procedure that ensures each incident that either results in a release or could have resulted in a release of anhydrous ammonia is investigated, within 48 hours, by a team of at least one person knowledgeable in the process.  This procedure will also make provisions to ensure a report is prepared at the conclusion of the investigation and findings are promptly addressed. \n\n \n\n?    Compliance Audit - Oberweis has developed a site-specific compliance audit program that ensures compliance audits are conducted at a minimum of every three years to verify that Oberweis PSM/RMP practices and procedures are adequate and are being followed.  The most recent compliance audit was completed on May 13, 2021.  \n\n?    Hot Work Permits - Oberweis has updated a best management practice for hot work.  Oberweis reviewed their hot work permit procedures for the refrigeration system on September 15, 2021.\n\n\n\nVII.

Continuous improvement in safety is an important goal for Oberweis.  \n\n\n\nXI.    Management Program\n\nOberweis has updated a management system to oversee the implementation of the risk management program elements.  This system has assigned qualified person(s) (or position) to assist in the development, implementation, and integration of the risk management program elements.  If any portion of the program is delegated to others, the names or positions of those individuals will be documented and the lines of authority defined through an organization chart or similar document.
