(R&M)\nBayport Plant\n\n1.Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nSunoco is committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program in place that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with our processes.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, our trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  We are also coordinated with Channel Industries Mutual Aid which provides additional emergency response expertise.\n\n2.The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nSunoco's primary activities include operation of a Polypropylene and Polyethylene Manufactureing units.  We manufacture or utilize 4 regulated substances at Sunoco; anhydrous ammonia, propylene, ethylene, and propane.\n\n3. The Worst Case Release and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nMethodology given in the RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance by the EPA using tables and equations has been employed to perform worst and alternative case release scenarios.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 3 flammable substances as a class, involves a catastrophic release from propylene storage in the polypropylene manufacturing process.  The scenario involves the release of 305,000 pounds of propylene.  It is assumed that the entire quantity is released as a vapor, which finds an ignition source, with 10 percent of the released quantity participating in a vapor cloud explosion.  Under worst case weather conditions, the maximum distance of approximately 0.5 miles is obtained corresponding to an endpoint of 1 psi overpressure.  \n\nThe alternative"

The release is assumed to result from a broken line in the storage area.  The scenario involves the release of approximately 290,000 pounds of ethylene oxide in 60 minutes.  Passive mitigation controls such as dikes are taken into account to calculate the scenario.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance of approximately 3.3 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.09 mg/l.\n\n\n4. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nSunoco has taken the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR Part 68.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with strict engineering standards and the facility is subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management standard under 29 CFR 1910.119.\n\nThe following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program in place at Sunoco.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nSunoco maintains a record of written safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with the process.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nSunoco conducts studies to ensure that hazards associated with the process are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses is referred to as a unit Process Hazard Analysis (PHA).  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated on an as needed basis, but at a minimum every five years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting operations activities, Sunoco maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial s"

The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved with the processes.\n\nTraining\nSunoco has a training program in place to ensure that employees that are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  New employees receive basic training in process operations followed by on-the-job supervision until they are deemed competent to work independently.  Refresher training is provided as needed .\n\nMechanical Integrity\nSunoco carries out documented maintenance checks to ensure process equipment is functioning properly.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Maintenance is carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.  Equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nManagement of Change\nWritten procedures are in place to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures.  Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and are trained to deal with the modification.\n\nPre-startup Reviews\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits\nSunoco conducts audits on a regular basis to verify the provisions set out under the PSM and RM"

These investigations are undertaken to identify the root cause of the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the incident from reoccurring.

The plan includes many aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas.  The facility's emergency response plan has bee coordinated with the LaPorte and Pasadena Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).\n \nTo ensure proper functioning, emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced and our emergency response team conducts regular training and drills.  In addition, the plan is updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within our process that would require a modified emergency response.\n\n7. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nSeveral developments and findings have resulted from the implementation of the various elements of our accidental release prevention program.  A hydrocarbon detection system is planned for installation in and around selected process areas to provide early warning for gas leaks.  This system will allow the facility to promptly detect and respond to gas leaks before they become serious.  Over-blast protection is planned for the Polypropylene Control Room to protect personnel and control equipment in the event of an explosion.  This will provide personnel the opportunity to maintain control of the process in the event of emergency."
