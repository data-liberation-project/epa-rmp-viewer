Ameren CILCO Duck Creek Generation Plant will contact the Fulton County Emergency Services and the Canton Fire Department once the construction of the SCR system is complete to invite them to visit the facility.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThe Risk Management/Process Safety Management for Highly Hazardous Chemicals Program for the facility is currently being developed to ensure compliance with all applicable local, state, and federal regulations and to provide guidance for emergency situations involving the anhydrous ammonia storage system.  This program will be reviewed on an annual basis and revisions will be made as necessary."

If an emergency was to occur, the Fulton County Emergency Services and the Canton Fire Department will be notified and requested to respond.  The Ameren CILCO Duck Creek Generation Plant minimizes, where possible, the storage and use of highly hazardous chemicals in our facility.  When highly hazardous chemicals are requried for our processes, the faiclity management is expected to ensure the safety of Ameren CILCO Duck Creek Generation Plant associates and the protection of the environment. \n\nFACILITY AND PROCESS DESCRIPTION\n\nThe  Ameren CILCO Duck Creek Generation Plant operates a 400 MW coal-fired electric generating facility located approximately five miles southeast of Canton in Fulton County.  The facility will be installing a Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) system to reduce the nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions to achieve compliance with federal limits.  Anhydrous ammonia will be used in the SCR process and will be stored in two 30,000-gallon (142,000 pound @ 85% capacity) above ground storage tanks.\n\nWORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\nThe worst-case scenario is a release of the entire contents (142,000 pounds) of one of the anhydrous ammonia storage tanks within a ten minute period.  The EPA RMP*Comp (TM) program (version 1.06) was used to estimate the distance to the toxic endpoint for ammonia (0.14 mg/L).  The calculated distance to the toxic endpoint was 6.9 miles based on the mandated assumptions of a wind speed of 1.5 meters/second, an atmospheric stability class of F, and using a rural setting.\n\nBased on 2000 census data obtained from the U.S. Census for Fulton County, the estimated residential population located within the 6.9 mile radius is 10,000.\n\nTo minimize the potential for this worst-case release would occur, the Ameren CILCO Duck Creek Generation Plant will store the anhydrous ammoni"

The storage tanks will be regularly inspected as part of the facility's accident prevention program.\n\nALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\nThe  Ameren CILCO Duck Creek Generation Plant selected a pipeline leak as the most realistic release scenario for the anhydrous ammonia system.  This scenario is based on the complete rupture of a 2 inch pipeline.  Ameren CILCO Duck Creek Generation Plant estimates that the valves needed to stop the flow through the pipe would be closed within a maximum of ten (10) minutes.\n\nUsing Formula 7-1, Chapter 7 of the USEPA Risk Management Program Guidance for Offsite Consequence Analysis, the estimated ammonia release rate during this scenario was calculated to be 675 pounds/minute.  The EPA RMP*Comp (TM) program (version 1.06) was used to estimate the distance to the toxic endpoint for this release rate and duration.  The atmospheric stability class D was assumed for this scenario with a wind speed of 3.0 meters/second, a relative humidity of 50%, and a temperature of 77 degrees Fahrenheit, with a rural topography.  The results indicate that the endpoint would be reached at a distance of 0.50 miles from the facility.  Based on information provided from the 2000 census data approximately 50 residents are located within this radius.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe facility maintains compliance with OSHA standard 1910.119, Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals.  The anhydrous ammonia storage and transfer system was designed pursuant to ANSI K 61.1 guidelines.  The Ameren CILCO Duck Creek Generation Plant will request assistance from the supplier for proper practices in the storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia and employee training.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nSince the system is new, there have been no reportable releases or accidents.\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nIn the event of an emergency, personnel are expected tot evacuate the facility and meet at a designated are"
