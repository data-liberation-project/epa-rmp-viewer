General accidental release and prevention policy of McCain Foods USA, Inc.\n\n\n\nIn this food product manufacturing facility we handle anhydrous ammonia in a liquid and vapor\n\nstate which is considered hazardous by the EPA.  The same properties that make ammonia a\n\nvaluable refrigerant also makes it necessary to observe certain safety precautions during it's use to\n\nprevent human exposure, reduce the threat to our workers personal health, the surrounding\n\ncommunity and the environment.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal and state\n\nregulations.  Safety depends directly on our proper handling of ammonia combined with the safety\n\ndevices that are incorporated in our facility and the safe handling procedures that our personnel\n\nare trained in.\n\n\n\n2.  Stationary source and regulated substance handled.\n\n\n\nMcCain Foods USA, 204 East Roberts Street, Grand Island, Nebraska is responsible for the\n\nmanufacturing of frozen appetizers.  There are approximately 450 employees at this facility which\n\nincludes hourly and salary personnel.  The plant manufactures product around the clock, (7) seven\n\ndays a week.  McCain Foods is located in an industrial park on the north side of Grand Islands,\n\nNebraska.  In addition to our manufacturing facility the industrial park also houses other\n\nmanufacturing or business facilities.  \n\n\n\nThe potentially hazardous chemical used at the McCain Foods facility is ANHYDROUS\n\nAMMONIA. The dominant characteristic of ammonia vapor is it's pungent, distinct odor. \n\nPersons exposed to ammonia will not voluntarily stay in areas of even small concentrations,\n\nalthough these levels would not result in any health risks. \n\nRisks from accidental exposure to ammonia in a vapor state are irritations to the eyes, nose and\n\nthroat. The extent of irritation depends on the exposure amount and len"

It will burn, but only\n\nin a very narrow, high concentration level with a constant ignition source.\n\n\n\nThe normal operating level of ammonia that is used/stored at the McCain Foods facility is 24,000\n\npounds. The anhydrous ammonia is used as the refrigerant chemical in the manufacturing/storage \n\nprocess. The possible hazards that could lead to an accidental release include, but are not limited\n\nto, equipment failure, damage to piping, damage to equipment, human error, etc. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Worst case release scenario and alternate release scenarios including administrative and\n\nengineering controls to limit/prevent the release.\n\n\n\n   Worst case release scenario criteria for McCain Foods USA facility:\n\n\n\nWorst case scenario depicts continuous source leak from the High Pressure Receiver (HPR)\n\nlocated inside the McCain Foods machine room.  This vessels normal operating level is 5,482\n\npounds of liquid ammonia,  approximately 50% of it's total capacity.
