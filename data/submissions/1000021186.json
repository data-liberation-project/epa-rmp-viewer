To strive for a coordinated and affective program particular persons have been identified and assigned responsibility for carrying out the requirements of each element.  There is however a single person identified who has overall responsibility for the PSM and RMP.  Most all of the program elements are reviewed annually to keep the program current with personnel training and system requirements.  The entire program is scheduled to be reviewed at least every 3 years in a complete documentation compliance audit review.  A follow-up report of the audit would be created to address any recommendation to improve any program elements.  A process hazard analysis has been done for the entire system, and the hazard analysis will be repeated every five years.  A follow-up report is also generated and all recommendationsfrom the hazard analysis will be addressed to further improve the safety and integrity of the ammonia refrigeration system.  It is Congdon Packing CompanyA?s intent that the PSM/RMP for the Mead facility to be a living document that is used, reviewed, and improved as needed to assure the safety of the employees, the public, and the environment.  It is expected that by following the work practices that are implemented at the facility only incidental released of ammonia will occurred due to routine maintenance procedures, or normal equipment wear and tear, however trained personnel with proper equipment can respond to more significant releases should they occur. \n\nRelease Considerations\nFollowing program guidelines a A?Worse CaseA? release of ammonia was analyzed.  Also, several alternative (much more likely to occur) releases were considered.  Both the worse and alternate cases were documented in a report.  The alternative releases were in most cases releases that were of potential concern as determined in"

The information generated from the consideration of the worse and alternative releases is used in developing the emergency response plan for the facility, and for coordination with local emergency responders.  \n\nFive year release history A? Facility was leased as of July, 2008.  The system had one release since that time.  The incident occurred on 8/14/08 at 1:20 pm until 2:20 pm.  This incident was the result of human error (employee of the owner), equipment failure and over pressurization.  The wind direction was from the East at approximately 5 miles per hour, the temperature was 90A?F.   The atmospheric stability class was an A?AA?.  The facility of 120 employees was evacuated.  No one was hospitalized or seeked medical treatment resulting from this incident.  Off-site responders were called.  The first responders were the fire department.  There was no property damage.  The total amount of the release was 32 lbs.  An incident investigation was done to determine the cause, and to find means or methods to reduce the possibility of a similar future occurrence and resulted in upgraded equipment, revised maintenance and revised maintenance procedures.\n\nEmergency Action Plan\nCongdon Packing Company, LLC has a written A?Emergency Action PlanA? that will be followed in the event of any type of emergency, including an ammonia release.  Some of the operating personnel have been trained to the Hazmat Technician level, and do receive annual refresher training.  Congdon Packing Company, LLC also has the proper personnel protective equipment for the emergency team to use in dealing with an ammonia release. Where and when possible A?defensiveA? actions will be used to control and contain an ammonia release, but when circumstances required Congdon Packing Company, LLC can take an A?defensiveA? response to a release.
