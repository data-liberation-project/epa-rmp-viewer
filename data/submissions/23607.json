Additionally, Perdue conducts regular safety meetings and provides a wide range of environmental, health, and safety training to its staff.\n\n1. Accidential Release and Emergency Response Policies\n The Lewiston facility is strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety. This committment is demonstrated by a comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training. It is a policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substance Handled\n The primary activities associated with this facility are poultry processing and by-products rendering. As of 12/13/2000 the chlorine gas that was used for disinfection purposes has been reduced to levels below RMP plan thresholds. There is one regulated substance present at the facility. This substance is anhydrous ammonia. Ammonia (anhydrous) is used for product refrigeration and cooling.\n The maximum inventory of ammonia at the facility is 66,540 pounds.\n\n3. Worst Case Release Scenario and Alternative Release Scenario\n The EPA's Risk Management Planning Computation Program via computer program was used to perform off-site consequence analysis, which are as follows:\n The worst-case release scenario submitted for program 3 toxic substances involves a catastrophic release from ammonia. In this scenario 25,000 pounds of ammonia is released. The toxic liquid released is assumed to form a 1cm. deep pool from which evaporation takes place. The pool is estimated to evaporate over 10 minutes. At class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s windspeed, the maximum distance of 2.2 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L.\n The alternative release scenario for ammonia involves a release from any compressor room.

General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n The facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set forth under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA. This facility maintains a process safety management(PSM) plan in accordance with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration(OSHA) regulation 29 CFR 1910.119. The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at the stationary source.\n  PROCESS SAFETY INFORMATION\nLewiston maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters, and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n  PROCESS HAZARD ANALYSIS\nThe facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that the hazards associated with its processes are identified and controlled efficiently. The methodology used to carry out these analyses is the What IF/ Checklist(combined) and HAZOP. The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated yearly, with a regular audit of processes every five years. Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner. The most recent PHA/ update was performed on 06/28/1999.\n  STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within covered processes, the Lewiston Perdue Farms facility maintains written operating procedures.
