The District's accidental\n\nrelease prevention strategy incorporates operator training, periodic audits, standard operating\n\nprocedures, regularly scheduled maintenance, management practices, continuous system\n\nmonitoring, and current technology to achieve its goals. Additionally, applicable provisions of\n\nFederal, State, and Local regulations are followed to ensure compliance and prevention of\n\naccidental releases.\n\nIn the unlikely event of a release, this plan addresses the response to emergencies by the District\n\nand coordination with response agencies that may be involved. In addition, the District has\n\nprepared an Emergency Response Plan to address an alarm scenario. Training includes\n\ninstruction on using emergency response equipment and following proper procedures in the\n\nevent of a chlorine release. A copy of the Emergency Response Plan is included as Appendix A.\n\n\n\nThe Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\n[Reference CalARP Regulation 19 CCR 2745.3(b)]\n\n\n\nThe Hidden Valley Lake Community Services District (District) operates a Wastewater\n\nReclamation Plant that treats domestic wastewater from the community of Hidden Valley Lake,\n\nCalifornia. The only substance used at the Wastewater Reclamation Plant (stationary source)\n\nthat is regulated by the RMP requirements is chlorine gas.\n\nAs a final step in the treatment process, chlorine gas is added to the treated wastewater as a\n\ndisinfectant. The chlorination distribution system and chlorine gas storage used for disinfection\n\nare located in the Wastewater Reclamation Plant's Control Room. The chlorine storage area\n\nstores full and empty chlorine cylinders and contains the equipment and piping that controls and\n\nsupplies the chlorine gas to the wastewater reclamation operation.\n\nThe maximum number of one-ton chlorine g"

However, in practice the amount of chlorine\n\nstored on site will be less than 4,000 pounds, because the gas is continuously being used. Both\n\none-ton cylinders are connected to the chlorination system, with one of cylinders feeding\n\nchlorine to the system and the other cylinder in reserve. When the pressure in the active cylinder\n\nfalls below 20 pounds per square inch gauge (psig), an automatic switchover system places the\n\nreserve cylinder on line while allowing the first cylinder to depressurize to ambient pressure.\n\nThen the empty one-ton cylinder is replaced with a reserve cylinder delivered to the site by the\n\nchlorine vendor. Chlorine gas under pressure in the cylinder flows through the cylinder valve and directly into the\n\nchlorinator.\n\nNote: There is no pressurized piping between the cylinder valve and the chlorinator.\n\nThe chlorinator reduces the chlorine gas pressure to less than atmospheric and regulates the\n\nchlorine gas flow rate. Chlorine gas under a negative air pressure flows through piping passing\n\nthrough the automatic switchover system, a gas flow measuring device, and to the ejector where\n\nit is mixed with untreated wastewater.\n\nNote: A more detailed description of the process with diagrams is provided in the Chlorine\n\nSystem Operating Procedures included as Appendix E.\n\n\n\nThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Specific Prevention\n\nSteps\n\n[Reference CalARP Regulation 19 CCR 2745.3(c)]\n\n\n\nThe District has in place the following general strategies to help prevent the release of chlorine\n\ngas:\n\n?

This Plan provides\n\nan organizational and procedural framework for the management of emergency incidents that\n\nmay affect the District. The Emergency Response Plan also describes the coordination of the\n\nDistrict with outside agencies for the further protection of District employees and property, as\n\nwell as the surrounding community and environment. The Emergency Response Plan may be\n\nfound in Appendix A.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n[Reference CalARP Regulation 19 CCR 2745.3(f)]\n\n\n\nThe following recommendations were identified during the Process Hazard Analysis discussed in\n\nSection 5.2 of this RMP to improve the safety of the chlorination system:\n\n1. An evaluation needs to be conducted of the feasibility of using sodium\n\nhypochlorite as a substitute for chlorine gas. (Expected completion by spring of\n\n2018.)\n\n2. The prevention of chlorine gas releases from the chlorination system is\n\ndependent on the proper operation of the chlorinator valve that is attached to\n\nthe one-ton cylinders. Because of this, the chlorinator valve needs to receive\n\nregularly scheduled maintenance according to the manufacturer's\n\nrecommendations by a factory trained and authorized repair person using\n\nfactory authorized replacement parts.

For contractors that will be working on or near the chlorine system or for\n\nvendors providing chlorine gas, ensure that their contracts require them to take\n\nthe necessary precautions to prevent accidents that could result in a chlorine release and also require training of their employees on appropriate actions to\n\ntake in the event of a chlorine alarm or release. This training may need to be\n\nprovided by the District. Contractor safety procedures are listed in Section 5.12\n\nof this RMP. (Ongoing.)\n\n8.
