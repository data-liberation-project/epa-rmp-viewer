TIMET operates 24 hours per day, seven days per week. \n\n\n\nThe facility produces titanium sponge and ingots from rutile (primarily titanium dioxide) by a series of chemical processes, which include chlorination, purification, reduction with magnesium, and vacuum distillation. The titanium sponge is crushed, pressed into compacts and then melted into ingots in vacuum arc remelt furnaces.\n\n\n\nIn Titanium Tetrachloride Production Unit, titanium tetrachloride (TiCl4) is produced by reacting rutile ore with chlorine. Chlorine and titanium tetrachloride are the two listed substances which are required to be reported in the RMP. The resulting TiCl4 is purified and is either stored in the Titanium Tetrachloride Storage Unit or sold and shipped offsite in drums.  The TiCl4 is reduced in Vacuum Distillation Process Unit using magnesium to yield a raw titanium sponge and magnesium chloride.  Titanium sponge is further processed into titanium ingots. Magnesium chloride is processed in the Magnesium Recovery Unit to recover magnesium for reuse in the process.\n\n\n\nTIMET operates an ingot plant, which consists of blending, "
