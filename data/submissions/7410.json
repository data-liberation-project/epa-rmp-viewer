Cooling Coils and Evaporator Piping Location:\n                        The piping and all of the cooling coils are located above the bin storage room and packed\n                        box storage room, out of reach of all normal operational machinery minimizing the possibility\n                        of damage by careless equipment operation.\n\n                d.)  Ammonia Piping and Receiver Insulation:\n                       The system piping and receiver vessels are insulated to increase system efficiency and \n                        reduce the risk of system overpressure due to excessive heat gain.  Additionally, piping\n                        is located on the roof of the facility to minimize the posibilty of damage by routine equipment\n                        operation and to provide greater accessibility for maintenance and inspection.\n\n                e.)  Pressure Equalized Dump Trap:\n                      The system design incorporates a pressure equalized liquid ammonia dump trap that drains\n                      liquid ammonia from the main suction Accumulator, equalizes pressure with the high pressure\n                      receiver, then drains liquid ammonia by gravity back into the high pressure receiver.  This\n                      sub-system minimizes the possibilty of liquid ammonia reaching the compressor which may\n                      cause excessive wear and/or damage and subsequent release.\n\n \n           2.

High discharge pressure could be caused by a condenser malfunction, \n                      non-condensable gases entrained in the system, or a closed valve in the compressor \n                      discharge line.

Liquid Level Controls in Accumulators:\n                       Solenoids valves controlled by float switches maintain the liquid level in the accumulators.\n                       When the liquid ammonia level in the accumulator is low, a liquid float switch opens the \n                       solenoid valves to establish ammonia flow into the accumulator.  When the ammonia level in\n                       the accumulator reaches operating capacity, the liquid level float switch de-energizes the\n                      solenoid valve which stops the ammonia flow.\n\n                c.)  Compressor Controls:\n                       In addition to the system control stated previously, the compressor is equipped with the \n                       following controls functions:\n \n                       1.)

In the event that any operational\n                      parameter is exceeded, the control system identifies the severity of the fault, shuts down\n                      the relevant system component and notifies maintenance personnel on a 24 hour basis.  In\n                      the event of failure of the electronic control system, the system will shut down.

In the event that operating parameters are exceeded as \n          measured by these control devices, maintenance personnel are notified and the system or its \n          components are automatically shut-down.\n\n     2.  Manual Monitoring and Inspection of the Ammonia Cold Storage System\n\n          As described in Design, Operation, and Maintenance Safety Systems, the refrigeration system\n          is physically monitored and inspection checks are kept on file by the refrigeration service contractor\n          and forwarded to the facility operators.  During this physical inspection, any possible leaks are \n          detected using sulfur sticks and dragger tubes.  Additionally, pH of the diffusion tank water is \n          routinely checked to detect possible non-atmospheric release through the pressure relief valves.\n\n\nSection V\n\nACUTELY HAZARDOUS MATERIAL ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere have been no accidental release or accidents involving anhydrous ammonia at Farmington Packing\nsince the start-up of operations in July of 1995.\n\n\nSection Vl\n\nSUMMARY AND SCHEDULE O"
