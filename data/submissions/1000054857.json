Lake Charles Chemical Complex\n\nRisk Management Plan\n\nExecutive Summary\n\n\n\nSasol's Lake Charles Chemical Complex (LCCC) has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, training of highly qualified personnel, and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of our processes. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent chemical releases. However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control, contain, and mitigate the release.\n\n\n\nSasol's Lake Charles Chemical Complex (LCCC) located in Westlake, Louisiana uses natural gas and by-products from refinery operations to produce specialty chemicals for detergents and cosmetics. The chemical complex uses or produces several regulated flammables such as ethylene, propane, butane, propylene, ethane, butane, hydrogen, methane, and pentane. Chemicals maintained on site at the LCCC listed on the EPA's list of toxic chemicals and are above EPA's threshold quantity are Chlorine, Ethylene Oxide and Hydrogen Fluoride. Other regulated chemicals used in our process, which are stored below the threshold quantity, are Sulphur Dioxide and Ammonia.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\n\n\nThe LCCC (Lake Charles Chemical Complex) maintains a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters, specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information. Specific departments within the chemical complex are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information. Employees are provided training on how to locate the information from various computer terminals located throughout the chemical complex.\n\n\n\nChemical specific information, including exposure "

This information is supplemented by documents that address known corrosion concerns and known hazards associated within inadvertent mixing of specific chemicals. For the different process areas, the chemical complex has documented safety related limits for specific process parameters (e.g. temperature, pressure, composition, etc.). The chemical complex ensures that the processes are maintained within the limits using process controls, monitoring instruments, protective instrument systems, and highly trained personnel.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe chemical complex also maintains an electronic database, that is accessible by both employees and contractor supervision, which provides information about the design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical classification, etc. This information in combination with written procedures and trained personnel provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\n\n\nThe Lake Charles Chemical Complex (LCCC) has a comprehensive program to help ensure the hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled. Within this program, each process is systemically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\n\n\nThe LCCC primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations and the What-if/Checklist method for Process Hazard Analysis revalidations. The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. The team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measure"

Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative ranking assigned by the PHA team. This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest rank receive immediate attention. All approved mitigation options being implemented in response to PHA findings are tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\n\n\nOperators, supervisors, and plant engineers' work together to develop and maintain operating procedures. These procedures define how tasks related to process operations are safely performed. At the Lake Charles Chemical Complex (LCCC), operating procedures: (1) are used to train employees and (2) serve as reference guides for appropriate actions to take during both normal operations and process upsets. Operating procedures include:\n\n?    Steps for safely conducting activities\n\n?    Applicable process safety information, such as safe operating limits,\n\n?    Safety and health considerations, such as chemical hazards, personnel protective equipment required and steps to take if exposed to a particular chemical.\n\n\n\nPlant personnel develop and maintain operating procedures that cover all phases of operations, including initial startup, normal operation, normal shutdown, emergency shutdown, startup following a turnaround or emergency shutdown, and temporary operations.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\n\n\nThe Lake Charles Chemical Complex (LCCC) trains its workers to safely and effectively perform their assigned tasks.

Once a new employee reports to a particular process unit, he receives detailed training with respect to process specific procedures and for specific tasks, before he is allowed to begin work in a specific operating unit.\n\n\n\nRefresher training covers (1) a general overview of the process, (2) the properties and hazards of the substances in the process and, (3) a review of the process operating procedures and safe work practices. Oral review and written tests are used to verify that employees understand the training before an employee can resume work in the process.

The PSSR review team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness. A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\n\n\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nThe Lake Charles Chemical Complex (LCCC) has well established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, emergency shutdown systems, and rotating equipment (pumps and compressors) in a safe operating condition. The basic aspects of this program include (1) conducting training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and test, (4) correcting identified deficiencies and, (5) applying quality assurance measures.
