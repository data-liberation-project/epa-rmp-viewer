(P&UCI), is committed to the protection of the health and safety of its employees and the general public, responsible stewardship of the environment and ensuring the safety of its products consistent with the requirements of the Risk Management Program.\n\nAs stated before P&UCI is committed to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of company processes.  P&UCI's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, P&UCI's trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n\nP&UCI plans to meet or surpass regulatory requirements.  In the attempt to accomplish this goal, the management systems at P&UCI have been developed in such a way that the hazards are identified, understood, and controlled to prevent accidents.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED [40 CFR 68.155 (B)]\n\nP&UCI  is dedicated to the manufacture of pharmaceutical and chemical bulk products.  Certain processes at the facility are subject to the Accidental Release Prevention Provisions codified as 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 68. As such, P&UCI developed and implemented a Risk Management Program (RMP) and submitted a Risk Management Plan (RM-Plan) for the covered processes.  \n\nThe two covered processes contained in the 1999 RMP included three chemicals: anhydrous ammonia; hydrochloric acid (HCl); and phosphorous oxychloride (POX).  P&UCI has since discontinued the process that utilized anhydrous ammonia.  In addition, P&UCI intends to install and operate the necessary facilities and equipment to store and utilize aqueous ammonia in excess of the applicable threshold quantity.  Theref"

      "SummaryText": "ore, P&UCI is updating the RMP and RM-Plan in accordance with 40 CFR \u00a768.190(b).  This revised RM-Plan is being submitted for the introduction of a new regulated substance (aqueous ammonia) above a threshold quantity as part of the Valdecoxib process [40 CFR \u00a768.190(b)(4)] and for a change (removal of anhydrous ammonia) that required a revised off-site consequence analysis (OCA) [40 CFR \u00a768.190(b)(6)].\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS [40 CFR 68.155(d)]\n\nP&UCI has developed and implemented an accidental release prevention program to continously comply with OSHA's 29 CFR 1910.119, Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals, and EPA's 40 CFR Part 68 subpart D, Accidental Release Prevention provisions in the Risk Management Program.  The prevention program thus developed and implemented consists of twelve elements which are listed below:\n\n-  Process safety information\n-  Process hazard analysis\n-  Operating procedures\n-  Training\n-  Mechanical integrity\n-  Management of change\n-  Pre-startup review\n-  Compliance audits\n-  Incident investigation\n-  Employee participation\n-  Hot work permit\n-  Contractors\n\nSome elements of the prevention program are intended to assure the designs are reviewed so the new plant and equipment are in conformance to safe design principles.  The remainder of the elements assure that the operation, maintenance and control of hazards are performed to prevent inadvertent changes outside the safe design and operating envelope.\n\nWith regards to accidental release prevention for specific chemicals, P&UCI currently relies on the following programs:  chemical-specific personnel training, good engineering practices, safe material handling procedures, sound engineering design, Good Manufacturing Practices (GMPs), corrosion protection programs, container management programs, inspections targeted to specific chemical hazards, and the installation of release prevention equipment, such as pressure re"

The program will be similar to a Program 2 prevention program. P&UCI has personnel trained in OSHA PSM because of existing Program 3 prevention program requirements for the Clindamycin Phosphate process which uses POX and HCl. Therefore, P&UCI will use these PSM methodologies for the development and implementation of the Program 2 prevention program for aqueous ammonia.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY AT P&UCI [40 CFR 68.155 (e)]\n\nP&UCI has not had an accidental release which had off-site consequences over the past five years.\n\nWORST-CASE/ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS[40 CFR 68.155 (d)]\n\nP&UCI is required to conduct a hazard assessment of the affected process utilizing aqueous ammonia, including an OCA to evaluate the area impacted by hypothetical releases. In addition, P&UCI conducted OCAs for hypothetical worst-case and alternative releases for POX and HCl.

For the worst-case release, no off-site impact is predicted.  As such, no alternative release scenario OCA was required.\n\nIn addition, P&UCI conducted OCAs for hypothetical worst-case and alternative releases for POX and HCl.    For POX, the OCA predicts a hypothetical worst-case release of 768 pounds would affect an estimated population of 10,000 persons, residing in a 10.9 square mile area (excluding plant property) extending 1.9 miles from the plant. The Cambalache State Forest is also included in the worst-case release scenario. For a less severe but more likely alternative release such as a continuous leak occurring for 20 minutes, the OCA predicts an impact radius extending 0.3 miles from the plant.  Though this distance impacts off-site areas, no public or environmental receptors would be affected.\n\nFor HCl, the OCA predicts a hypothetical worst-case release of approximately 97,000 pounds affect an estimated population of 180 persons, residing in a 0.1 square mile area (excluding plant property) extending 0.5 miles from the plant.  No environmental receptors would be affected.  For a less severe but more likely alternative release continuous leak occurring for 60 minutes, the OCA predicts an impact radius extending 0.2 miles from the plant.

      "SummaryText": "cted.\n\nSince there has not been any release of a regulated substance from the Valdecoxib process over the past five years which have resulted in off-site death or injury or may have led to response or restoration for activities for the environment, and the worst-case OCA demonstrates that there can be no off-site consequences in terms of human health and safety, the Valdecoxib process is a Program 1 process. As such, no alternate release scenario OCA is required.  The RM-Plan for Program 1 processes is simply comprised of registration information, a demonstration that in the event of a worst-case release that no off-site public receptors are affected, and that emergency response can be coordinated between the facility and off-site first-responders. Program 1 also requires that any environmental receptors within the worst-case impact zone be identified.  This RM-Plan provides the above required information.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM [40CFR 68.155 (f)]\n\nP&UCI maintains a comprehensive written emergency response program to protect plant workers, the general public, and the environment.  The program include plans and procedures for responding to a wide range of events, caused either naturally or accidentally, which have the potential to result in a release of a regulated substance.  Periodic emergency drills are conducted within the plant to maintain preparedness and to identify areas for improvement.   The emergency response program is updated when necessary, based on modifications made to plant processes or facilities.  In addition, the plant has an emergency preparedness program that addresses maintenance, inspection and testing of response equipment, as well as instructions and training that govern use of the equipment.\n\nThe overall emergency response program is coordinated with the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEP-Arecibo Municipality).  This coordination includes periodic meetings of the committee, which includes local emergency response officials, and in"
