We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public as well as the protection of the environment.  The DuPont Co. - Corpus Christi Plant adheres to Corporate policies, which could be summarized as follows:\n                            - All Safety and Environmental Incidents Are Preventable\n                            - The Goal Is Zero - Zero Incidents, Period\n                            - All Employees and Contractors Are Responsible For Their Safety\nThe Corporate policies are embodied in the numerous site safety and engineering procedures and guidelines.  At the DuPont Co. - Corpus Christi Plant, the policies are implemented through the Process Safety and Risk Management Procedures Manual and the Emergency Response Procedures Manual.  These manuals are available to all site employees through hard copies and annual computer based training.\nFACILITY DESCRIPTION\nThe DuPont Co. - Corpus Christi Plant consists of approximately 980 acres, located in a rural setting along Highway 361 between the cities of Ingleside and Gregory.  About 266 acres of the property is industrialized while the remaining 714 acres is used for agricultural purposes.  The industrialized area consists of a single manufacturing complex that produces ozone friendly hydrofluorocarbon refrigerant, HFC-134a,  and aerosol propellant, HFC-152a.  In the production of these products, the following RMP regulated substances are used as raw materials or intermediates or products.\n                              - Hydrogen Chloride, anhydrous               - Hydrogen Fluoride, anhydrous\n                              - Difluoroethane (HFC-152a)                     - Vinyl Chloride\nKEY OFF-SITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS "

According to EPA's OCA Guidance, this toxic gas would have an off-site impact.   A sphere failure is unlikely due to the high quality of design and the vigorous maintenance and inspection program to assure vessel integrity.\nWORST-CASE FLAMMABLE RELEASE SCENARIO\n    The worst case release scenario for a flammable chemical is a rupture and complete failure of a 1,1 Difluoroethane storage tank releasing 220,000 pounds instanteously.  This release, if ignited, would have an off-site industrial impact as determined by EPA's OCA Guidance.  The ignition of this release is unlikely because the storage tank is located away from ignition sources.  A tank failure is unlikely due to the high quality of design and the vigorous maintenance and inspection program to assure vessel integrity.  \nALTERNATIVE TOXIC RELEASE SCENARIOS\n* Hydrogen Fluoride - A one inch pipe in a reaction vessel is severed releasing 1193 pounds per minute of liquid anhydrous hydrogen fluoride.  Mitigation assumed included the initiation of process deinventorying procedures to reduce the quantity released and stop the leak within sixty minutes and the application of water spray within the first 10 minutes of the release by emergency responders to mitigate the fumes.  This scenario was identified in a process hazards analysis.  This release scenario has an off-site industrial impact and off-site residential impact.\n* Hydrogen Chloride - A pinhole in the vaporizer shell is caused by internal corrosion due to the presence of moisture in the hydrogen chloride and results in the release of 2500 pounds.  Mitigation efforts included emergency shutdown procedures.  This release has an off-site industrial impact potential, but no impact on residential populations.  This scenario is "

If ignited, a vapor cloud explosion would have off-site industrial impact potential, but no off-site residential impact.   Emergency responders initiate water spray with canons and close the drain valve to stop the leak within 10 minutes.\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n* We maintain a number of programs to help prevent accidental releases and ensure safe operation.  The accident prevention programs in place are in compliance wih the OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) rule and the EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP) rule.  For our efforts in safety excellence, the DuPont Co. - Corpus Christi Plant is recognized by the OSHA Voluntary Protection Program as a \"STAR Work Site\" since 1984.\n* Our accident prevention and safety programs can be summarized into these elements.  \"Designing for Safety\" includes a documented process technology system covering the hazards of materials, equipment design basis, and process design basis.  It includes an strategically located extensive accident prevention and mitigation system.  It includes the requirement to choose materials of construction to provide mechanical integrity.  It incorporates extensive safety instrumentation such as alarms, interlocks, and gas detectors.  Transportation vehicles are designed for safe handling.  \"Maintaining Our Plant\" includes identifying all process safety critical equipment and perfoming routine inspections to ensure proper operation and mechanical integrity.  High housekeeping standards contribute to safe operation practices.  Equipment specifications meet or exceed acceptable engineering standards.  A work order and permit system is used to control maintenance on the systems.  Maintenance personnel are trained, qualified"

      "SummaryText": ", and experienced in preventative and predictive maintenance.  \"Operating Safely\" includes the requirement for operators and mechanics to follow approved procedures.  The process is continually monitored by computer control systems and operators.  Railcar transfers are under continuous surveillance by trained personnel.  And, even the subtlest changes are properly designed and completely documented.  \"Auditing Our Operations\" inlcudes the requirement for routine area safety audits.  The DuPont Corporate Guardian Committee's for hydrogen fluoride and hydrogen chloride are utilized to provide guidance in safe handling and risk management practices.  These individual elements of our prevention program work together to prevent accidental chemical releases.  Our company and our employees are committed to the standard that these management systems set for the way we do business, and we have specific accountabilities and controls to ensure that we are meeting our own high standards of accident prevention.\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nWe keep records for all accidental chemical releases that occur at our facility.  It is our philosophy and practice that all accidental releases, regardless of size and significance, are tracked to identify and correct the key cause of the event.  The DuPont Co. - Corpus Chrisit Plant has an excellent safety record and accidental release prevention history.   There have been no releases of these RMP regulated substances; hydrogen fluoride, hydrogen chloride, vinyl chloride, or 1, 1 difluoroethane, in the past 5 years that have caused off-site consequences.\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\nOur program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting the workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.  The program can be summarized as follows:  In order that plant personnel are prepared, an emergency response plan is in place and updated regularly and all employees are trained for their role in the emergency "

Critiques are held on drills and actual events.  The plant site is a founding member and active supporter of the San Patricio County Local Emergency Planning Committee.  We coordinate our plan with the San Patricio County emergency response plan.  If a major release occurs, the emergency alarm is sounded and the site's emergency control center is activated.  The site incident commander and emergency response team responds.  Community emergency responders are notified as appropriate and mutual aid agreements are exercised when necessary.  Incident investigations and corrective actions are identified and implemented.\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\nThe following is a list of improvements that we are planning to implement at the facility to help prevent and/or better respond to accidental chemical releases:\n* Enhance the site's process hazard analysis procedure to include guidance for conducting risk reduction analyses which will facilitate consistent risk reduction decisions among PHA teams.\n* Enhance the site's community alert notification system to better alert neighboring communities.\n* Implement an observation tool for incident commanders during a toxic gas release to improve response decisions.\n* Identification of a PHA consequence analysis champion to provide expertise to model accidental release scenarios and provide consequence assessments.\n* Continued focus on \"The Goal is Zero\" for injuries and incidents.\n* Continued reinforcement of \"Operational Discipline\" for all site employees, including contractors."
