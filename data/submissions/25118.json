      "SummaryText": "The Cedar County Coop is an agricultural retail cooperative that handles anhydrous ammonia as a nitrogen source for retail use in crop production.  We store it in a stationary tank an is transferred to portable tanks that are transported out to farms. We are in compliance with all state and federal regulations. If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to notify the Cedar County Fire Department and LEPC.  We have had no accidents in the past 5 years.  Safety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to asses the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no additional specific safety recommendations regarding storage or use of anhydrous ammonia for implementation at this time.We adhere to safety regulations in OSHA 29 C.F.R. 1910.111 and ANSI k61.1 under state code. Our emergency action plan is under code 29 C.F.R. 1910.38. Our worst case scenario is a valve failure of a storage tank. Under RMP COMP our toxic endpoint is 6.9 miles with an affected population of 3000  people. Our alternative scenario was pipe leak the had a toxic endpoint of 1.6 miles that affected 389 people."
