              "Description": "Preventative Programs\n\nFill Stations Emergency\n\nEvery Bulkhead filling station is equipped with a breakaway shut down nitrogen powered pneumatic valve.  The purpose of the breakaway shutoff valve is to prevent product release by closing the valves in the unlikely event the fill line becomes disconnected while filling.\n\nAll outlets from the storage tanks are equipped with self-closing stop valves in the event of  excessive flow through the valve, the valve closes and the flow is reduced to a limited bleed.\n\nThe system is also protected by two shut down switches. The first switch is a shut down switch that  vents off the nitrogen  in the line. Once this switch is moved to the off position, the nitrogen flow to the pneumatic actuators is turned off and simultaneously the pressure is bled from the lines. When this switch is in the off position no product can flow out of the storage tanks. \n\nThe second switch in this circuit is an Emergency Stop switch (E-stop), once the e-stop has been actuated the nitrogen  flow to the pneumatic actuators is turned off and simultaneously the pressure is bled off from the lines.  In addition to shutting down the nitrogen supply and bleeding off the nitrogen line, the e-stop shuts down all electrical supply to the flammable fill island. \n\n    Fire Engagement Prevention\n\nPassive mitigation, in the form of stock separation and fire barriers (bunkers) have been installed.  The fire barriers are concrete filled cinder block walls, RATED FOR 2 HOURS FIRE PROTECTION. Stock level signs have been posted and employees have been trained on the bunker storage system.  These passive fire protection measures allow additional time for firefighting measures.\n\n\n\nInternal Audits\n\nIndustrial source performs monthly facility inspections and program audits every three years.\n\n",
