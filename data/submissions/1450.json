      "SummaryText": "a.  The Valparaiso Water Department (VWD) accidental release prevention policy involves an approach that integrates technologies, procedures, and management practices.  All applicable procedures of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Prevention Program are adhered to.  The VWD emergency response policy involves the preparation of response plans which are tailored to each facility and to the emergency response services available in the community, and is in compliance with the EPA Emergency Response Program requirements.\n\nb.  The Airport Treatment plant was built in 1966 to disinfect and treat ground water from seven deep wells and is located at 3800 Redbow Road.  This treated water serves the City of Valparaiso and the surrounding areas.  The treatment plant includes a chlorination room, which contains liquid chlorine containers, V-notch chlorinators, a filter room, which contain four horizontal pressure filters, and chemical storage for potassium permanganate and ortho-poly phosphate, a motor control room, which contains high lift pumps, various electrical panels, and safety equipment, and a chemical storage room, which contains fluoride.  The amount of chlorine handled is three one-ton containers.  The facility is unmanned with water treatment personnel visiting the facility daily and responding to any trouble alarms which may occur.\n\nc.  The offsite consequence analysis includes consideration of two chlorine release scenarios, identified as \"worst case release\" and \"alternative scenario\".  The first scenario is defined by EPA, which states that \"the owner of operator shall assume that the maximum quantity in the largest vessel is released as a gas over 10 minutes,\" due to an unspecified failure.  The alternative scenario is defined as \"more likely to occur than the worst-case release scenario\".\n\nAtmospheric dispersion modeling has to be performed to determine the distance traveled by the chlorine released before its concentration decreases to the \"toxic endpo"

The offsite consequence analysis for this scenario followed conditions pre-defined by EPA, namely the release of the entire amount as a gas in 10 minutes, use of the one-hour average ERPG-2 as the toxic endpoint distance.  EPA set these conditions to facilitate the performance of the offsite consequence analysis; however, the assumptions used may be unrealistic because:\n\n(1)  Only a fraction (about 26% of the total) of the compressed liquefied chlorine released to the atmosphere flashes as a vapor.  the remaining unflashed liquid forms liquid-droplet aerosols, resulting in the formation of a very dense chlorine cloud consisting of vapor and liquid droplets, with dispersion characteristics significantly different than for a cloud consisting only of chlorine gas.\n\n(2)  Only the population within an elliptical plume extending downwind of the release is potentially affected.  This plume area, or footprint, is approximately 6% (one-twentieth) of the area of the full circle.\n\nEPA-mandated meteorological conditions, namely Stability F, wind speed 1.5 m/sec, highest daily maximum temperature (116 degrees F), and average humidity (65%) was used.\n\nWhe"

      "SummaryText": "n atmospheric dispersion modeling for the worst case was performed using EPA's RMP*Comp program, a distance to toxic endpoint of 0.9 miles and an estimate of residential population potentially affected of 4,837 was obtained.\n\nThe alternative scenario involves a release from a horizontal cylindrical tank occurring through a valve in the top of the tank.  The amount of chlorine released is 317 lb, at an average rate over one hour (the duration of the release) of 10.5 lbs/min.  When atmospheric dispersion modeling was performed using EPA's RMP*Comp program, a distance to toxic endpoint of 0.1 miles and an estimate of residential population potentially affected of 7 was obtained.\n\nActuation of the chlorine detector is an active mitigation measure considered.  An additional mitigation system installed was the conversion of the existing chlorinators to a remote vacuum type, with all pressurized chlorine gas piping replaced with vacuum piping.  This change reduced the potential for a chlorine gas leak from a pigtail rupture by making the system operate under a vacuum.\n\nd.  The general accidental release prevention program is based on the following key elements:\n\n     Training of the treatment plant personnel\n     Preventive maintenance program\n     Use of state-of-the-art process and safety equipment\n\nChemical-specific prevention steps include availability of self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA), full face dual cartridge respirator, worn by personnel during connection/disconnection of chlorine supply, awareness of the hazerdous and toxic properties of chlorine, presence of chlorine dictors, and outside warning lights.\n\ne.  No accidental releases of chlorine have occured at this facility in the past five years.\n\nf.  The facility has an action plan, which has been reviewed by the Valparaiso Fire Department, which is a member of the Local Emergency Response Planning Committee (LEPC)."
