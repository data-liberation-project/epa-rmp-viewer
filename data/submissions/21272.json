If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department and law enforcement personnel to mitigate any release to residents and the environment of our community.\n\n2.  Facility Information:  The primary activity at the facility is the storage and sales of fertilizers to farm producers in our area.  Iola Grain anhydrous ammonia operation has been located at this location for over 32 years.\n\n    a.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient.\n\n    b.  The maximum quantity stored would be 117,300 pounds.\n\n3.  Worst-Case Release Scenario and Alternative Release Scenario:\n\n    a.  the worst-case release scenario would be the total release of the anhydrous ammonia from our major storage tank.  The distance to the endpoint is 1.2 miles\n\n    b.  The alternative release scenario is a release from a break in a transfer hose.  The distance to the endpoint is 0.3 miles.\n\n    c.  Administrative Controls:  During the off season for crop production, Iola Grain reduces it's inventory of anhydrous ammonia to approximately 17,000 pounds.  During this period the Worst-Case Scenario would be the release of approximately 4,100 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.  The distance to the endpoint would be approximately 0.8 miles.\n\n4.  Accidenal Release Prevention Program:  The facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requiremetns for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61-1\" published by the American National Standards Institure, Inc.  After normal duty hours the Iola Police Department inspects our area, approximately every two hours.  Anything out of the ordinary is reported to our 24 hour telephone number and the police take necessary actions.  The Iola Fire Department conduct an annual fire inspection of the facil"

Fire-Year Accident History:  There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at this facility, nor to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite death, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n6.  Emergency Response Program:  Our facility has coordinated with the local responders and we do not plan to have our employees respond to a major release.\n\n    a.  Additional Facility Emergency Contact:\n\n         Mr. Kris Smith, Assistant Manager, (316) 365-0460\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:  Safety improvements is an on-going process at this facility.
