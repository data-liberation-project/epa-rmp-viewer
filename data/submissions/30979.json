      "SummaryText": "A primary goal of  the Baytown Area Water Authority (BAWA) is to eliminate or control both known and potential safety and health issues.  These issues are the responsibility of top management, supervisors, and every employee.  Our objective is to teach and motivate safe working habits.  Monthly safety meetings are held concerning gerneral and specific safety issues, which include proper chemical handling procedures.  These safety meetings are held in an open forum allowing all employees to voice concerns about any safety issues and suggestions on improving safety procedures.  Our employees are provided education through training,  continuing education, and certification as operators.  By maintaining this competency level, safety and health risk are greatly reduced.\n\nThe BAWA facility was completed in 1980 and is located on a 61-acre tract of land located at 7425 Thompson Road.  The plant processes raw, surface water from a 26-mile long canal originating at the Trinity River.  The process of treating raw water so that it is potable (safe to drink) as well as palatable (taste good) requires the addition of various chemicals.  The regulated substances utilized at the plant are Chlorine and Anhydrous Ammonia.  Chlorine and Anhydrous Ammonia are utilized at the plant to form Chloramines.  Monochloramine is the compound used to disinfect water to maike it safe to drink.  The Chlorine is transported by truck from the manufacturer in one-ton cylinders.  The manufacturer inspects these cylinders before transporting the cylinders.  In addition, the cylinders are inspected once they arrive and before they are placed on-line.  The largest number of Chlorine Cylinders on site at any one time is twenty (one-ton) cylinders.  Anhydrous Ammonia is transported by tanker truck from the manufacturer to a storage tank on site.  The accepted general limit of 82% liquid volume is never exceeded;  The liquid volume of the tank on site will not exceed 77.5%.\n\nThe general accidental release "

      "SummaryText": "prevention program is based on training, education, and maintenance.  These tree facets are supplied by either the supplier or in house during the monthly safety meetings.  The staff must verify that a checklist has been  completed prior to utilizing personal protective equipment (respirator).  The Anhydrous Ammonia Tank is inspected every three months by BAWA staff and annually by LaRoche per contract.  The Anhydrous Ammonia Tank is also maintained by LaRoche.  The Chlorine Cylinders are inspected and tested by the supplier and the cylinders are inspected on site by the staff.\n\nBAWA has not experienced an accidental chemical release in five years.\n\nThe emergency response program consists of the first response from trained personnel and notification of both the supplier and the City of Baytown Fire Department.  The Fire Department has access to the emergency siren alert system.  The alert system is a set of sirens stationed throughtout the city utilized by the city and industry to alert the public in the event of a chemical release.  In addition, the public may tune in to AM 740 and AM 1610 for further instructions.  \n\nRecent changes to improve safety is to have LaRoche Industries inspect and maintain the Anhydrous Ammonia storage tank.  Another change was the installation of a Chlorine monitor and scrubber system for the chlorine storage area."
