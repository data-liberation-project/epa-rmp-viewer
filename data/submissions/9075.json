The owner, management, and employees of Cropmate Company, Crerston, Ia. are commited to the prevention of any accidental release of Anhydrous Ammonia or Propane. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local Fire Department, LEPC, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and to minimize the impact of the release on people and the environment.\n\nII. FACILITY INFORMATION.\nA. The primary activity at the facility is the storage and handling of Anhydrous Ammonia and Propane for sale to farmers and other customers.\nB. Anhydrous Ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for application on crops as a fertilizer nutrient.\nC. Propane is received, stored, and distributed as LP-Gas to the end user.\nD. The maximum quantity of Anhydrous Ammonia stored would be 130000 pounds in a 30000 gallon storage tank.\nE. The maximum quantity of Propane stored north of Creston would be 96000 pounds in a 25000 gallon storage tank.\nF. The maximum quantity of Propane stored near Murray Ia. would be 44000 pounds in a 12000 gallon storage tank.\n\nIII. THE WORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO FOR ANHYDROUS AMMONIA.\nA. The worst case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of the storage tank over 10 minutes. The maximum quantity released would be 130000 pounds, which represents the volume of the tank at 85% capacity as limited by design standards. The distance to the toxic endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 1.06 miles.\nB. The alternative release scenario, is based on a release from a break in a transfer hose. The quantity released would be 26000 pounds. The distance to the toxic endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is .59 miles.\n\nIV. THE WORST CASE AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO'S FOR PROPANE NORTH OF CRESTON.\nAThe worst case release scenario would be the release of t"

The alternative release scenario is based on a discharge line break while pumping. The maximum quantity released would be 5200 pounds. The distance to endpoint (1-psi) is .10 miles.\n\nV. THE WORST CASE AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO'S FOR PROPANE-MURRAY\nA. The worst case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of the storage tank. The maximum quantity released would be 44000 pounds. The distance to endpoint (1-psi) is .40 miles.\nB. The alternative release scenario is based on a discharge line break while pumping. The maximum quantity released would be 5200 pounds. The distance to endpoint (1-psi) would be .10 miles.\n\nVI. THE ACCIDENT RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM.\nA. The facility has implemented the provisions of safety requirements for the storage and handling of Anhydrous Ammonia and Propane published by the American National Standards Institute inc.\nB. The facility has implemented the standards of the US Occupational Safety And Health Administration (OSHA) 29-CFR 1910.111 and 29-CFR 1910.1200 storage and handling of Anhydrous Ammonia and Propane.\n\nVII. THE FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY.\nA. There has been no accidental releases of Anhydrous Ammonia or Propane that have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility, nor have resulted in off site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\nVIII. THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM.\nA. There are procedures for informing the public and emergency response agencies about releases.\nB. There are procedures and measures for emergency response.\nC. Documentation of proper first aid and emergency medical treatment necessary to treat human exposure.\nD. Procedures for inspecting, testing, and maintaining emergency response equipment.\nE. Training for all employees in relevant procedures.\nF. Proc"
