This plant is one of three water plants operated by the City.  The West King water plant has quantities of regulated hazardous chemicals above the EPA threshold.  The City has a unified Risk Management Program which applies to each plant.  Only Water Treatment Plant #1 operations and policies are subject to the RMP and are presented in this Plan.\n1.1.\tACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION/EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES     (a)\nThe City of St. Augustine Water Treatment Plant accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates technologies, procedures and management practices.  The plant prevention program complies with all applicable procedures of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) 40 CFR-68,  Prevention Program.\n1.1.1.\tMANAGEMENT SYSTEM  (a)(1)\n\tThe City of St. Augustine has a management system in place which is lead by the Public Works Director, who oversees the implementation and on-going use of the RMP elements.  This program, along with other City-wide and plant-specific policies, eliminates and /or reduces the likelihood of a hazardous chemical release at the plant.  An organizational chart defining the lines of authority and responsible staff is included in the plants RMP Process Safety Information.\n1.1.2.\tPREVENTION PROGRAM LEVEL 3  (a)(2)\n\tThe City of St. Augustine maintains policies, procedures and systems as part of their prevention program.  These are applied to each treatment plant and specifically the Water Treatment Plant.  The program addresses each of the EPA Program Level 3-listed 12 elements, plus RMP elements needed to implement th"

The site is located at 254 West King Street, City of St. Augustine, in St. Johns County, Florida.  The 5 acre site is located in a block area,  boarded by Palmer Street on the east, Travis Lane on the west, Rail Road Avenue on the north and West King Street on the south.\n\tThe Plant includes a separate chlorine storage building and adjacent control distribution system that is contained in a two separate process rooms of the main water plant pump building.  The boundaries of the chlorine system subject to the RMP regulation include the Bulk Chlorine Storage and Feed Control rooms and the associated vent makeup and exhaust systems.  These are detailed in the Process and Instrument Drawings (P&ID) which are part of the plant Process Safety Information (PSI).  All drawings are maintained in the plants RMP Process Safety Information.\n1.2.2.\tREGULATED SUBSTANCE  (b)(2)\n\tChlorine is the only regulated substance on site which exceeds the EPA 40 CFR-68 rule threshold quantity.  The City of St. Augustine chlorine process was installed as part of the process of purifying water for public consumption.  It operates under permit from the State of Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FL DEP).  The chlorine is received, stored and distributed to four process control systems. \n\tChlorine is an EPA listed toxic chemical.  It is an irritant and it is corrosive.

The residential population that would be impacted by this release is estimated at ___.\n1.4.\tACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM  (d)\nThe City of St. Augustine accidental release prevention program is based on EPA\u00c2\u00bfs RMP Level 3 prevention program.  The program has been in place and effectively used for many years.  It is part of the plants operating culture.  There are two parts to the program.  The first is the general overall City wide program and the Water Treatment Plant site program.  The second is the chlorine-specific actions within the site program.  This is coordinated with the City of St. Augustine Fire/Rescue Department the Police Department and St John\u00c2\u00bfs County Haz Mat Team.\n1.4.1.\tGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM   (d)(1)\n\tPlant-wide, many elements of the prevention program are used for all operations.  An overview of the generally written programs is listed below:\n\u00c2\u00bf\tThe City of St. Augustine has detailed process safety information on each of its operations. \n\u00c2\u00bf\tThe document maintenance system is integral to the management of change for all operations on site control.  \n\u00c2\u00bf\tTraining is the backbone of employee knowledge, job operations and is ongoing in each area.  Employee training in operations and maintenance emphasizes awareness of the hazardous and toxic properties"

The second chlorine area is for storage of 150 lb chlorine cylinders and is separate from the ton container area.  It is a covered gated open-air storage area.\n1.4.2.3.\tEquipment Design\nThere are two types of chlorine pipe systems, high and low (vacuum) pressure.  The high pressure chlorine piping system is made of chlorine compatible steel pipes or equipment.  These materials are steel or chlorine compatible non-metallic compound (not corroded by chlorine) rated to 500 psig.  The maximum pressure of the chlorine in the high pressure system is only 150 psig giving a 3 to 1 safety factor.  This system is only inches long leading from the chlorine container to the pressure regulator bolted to the containers.  \nThe low pressure system operates under a vacuum pressure of 13 inches of mercury.  There is a pressure relief valve which vents if the pressure in the line reaches above atmospheric pressure.  All the pipe, tubes, and equipment are also chlorine compatible.  The system is designed to 150 psig or complete vacuum giving it a large safety factor over the typical vacuum or positive pressure in it.  There is a chlorine monitor which detects the presence of chlorine in the ton storage area.  There is a chlorine monitor in the separate #150 lb. cylinders storage area.\n1.5.\tFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY  (e)\nThere have been zero EPA recorded accidents in the past five years.    \n1.6.\tEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM  (f)\nEmergency response procedures are contained both the Plant Emergency Response Policy and is coordinated with the City of St. Augustine Contingency Plan (Emergency Response Plan).

Emergency operation and response procedures are also reviewed annually.\nThe emergency response program (contingency plan) is coordinated (reviewed by) with the City Wide Safety Committee, the Police Department and the St. Augustine Fire Department (who man the nearby City, Police and Fires/Rescue Station). The Water Plant and Fire Department coordinates with Local St. Johns County Emergency Response Planning Committee (LEPC) and the St. Johns HazMat Team.  All are located in St. Johns County, Florida.  Copies of the program are given to key local agencies including: fire, medical, rescue, management, and police departments in the City of St. Augustine and St. Johns County.  Besides the specific emergency response program, key elements of the prevention programs are incorporated in the operating culture of the City of St. Augustine water plant.\nThe Contingency Plan procedures detail the actions and responses to chlorine spills (releases).  The plan includes training of all chlorine-area operators,  The primary response team includes the St. Augustine Fire and Rescue, plus the county Haz Mat Teams.  All of these respond to severe chlorine leak situations.  Actions include catastrophic, severe, and moderate leaks.  A Chlorine \u00c2\u00bfB\u00c2\u00bf Leak Repair Kit is maintained at the City Fire Station and for use at the water treatment plant to aid in stopping leaks.  Public notification is facilitated through the City of St. Augustine Police and St. Johns County Sheriff\u00c2\u00bfs Office, which has an automated emergency dialing message system for public notification.\n1.6.1.\tPERSONNEL  (f)(1)\n\tPersonnel are the key resource of the City of St. Augustine\u00c2\u00bfs prevention program.

These recommended actions have now been evaluated and implemented as required.  An Audit was conducted to review the RMP program.  The key safety action items were completed.  See the \u00c2\u00bfUpdate\u00c2\u00bf Section 6 of this report.  The City has completed installation and start-up of designing new water treatment plant.  The new plant will use sodium hypochlorite bleach solution.  This will reduce the use of chlorine.\nThe City of St. Augustine continually reviews implemented operating procedures for potential safety improvements for all of its operations.  Currently, the City of St. Augustine management team and process safety team are reviewing potential upgrades to the existing design of the chlorine operations to make the system even safer to prevent a release and minimize consequences in the event of a release of chlorine."
