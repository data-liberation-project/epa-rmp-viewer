The facility has one anhydrous ammonia storage tank with a capacity of 18,000 gallons (water capacity).  The storage tank, several anhydrous ammonia nurse tanks, risers for filling nurse tanks, electrical panels, lighting, and safety equipment are all parts of this facility's anhydrous ammonia operation.  The facility operates with normal business hours during the spring and fall season.\n\n\n\nPrairie Home Cooperative has several key elements in their accident prevention plan:\n\n1. The anhydrous ammonia system adheres to the laws and regulations of the State of Missouri.\n\n2.
