This substance is ammonia (anhydrous). The highest expected inventory of ammonia (anhydrous) at this facility is 25,000 pounds (rounded to two significant digits for reporting purposes).   Our facility has taken the following steps as required by 40 CFR Part 68 of the EPA regulations. Our ammonia (anhydrous) process is subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard under 29 CFR 1910.119.  Our facility is also subject to the EPCRA Section 302 reporting requirements. The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our facility. \n\nProcess Safety Information:\nSysco Chicago (Cooler) has compiled information related to the hazards of the ammonia refrigeration system installed at the facility. Prior to conducting to the initial hazard analysis, the process safety information was reviewed and utilized in identifying and mitigating recognized hazards. The process safety information was also used in the development of the operating procedures.   \n\nProcess Hazard Analysis: \nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our process are identified and controlled efficiently. The methodology used to carry out these analyses is the what-if/ checklist.
