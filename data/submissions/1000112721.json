CalChef recently leased  the site and has made improvements and  has reconfigured  the facility. The existing system was shut down and ammonia was removed from the refrigeration system in May of 2023.  The total amount of  ammonia (8,984 pounds) was pumped out.  New equipment was added and some existing equipment was capped off and other existing equipment is being re-used in the new configuration of the system with new operating conditions. Building Permits were approved for the new design and the system was brought up to the current 2022 California Building, Mechanical, Electrical, Plumbing, Energy, and Green  codes.    At minimum, this design meets and often exceeds all applicable federal, state, and local codes and standards. The system start up is  planned for February 2024.\n\n At both the corporate and local levels, CalChef Foods. has taken significant steps to ensure safety both for its workers at the site and for the community at large. CalChef has implemented strict standards in the development and design of the process and both the building itself and the addition, and has overlaid administrative controls for operating, testing, inspecting, and maintaining the facility.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF FACILITY\nThe facility is located at 3735 Imperial Way, Stockton CA.  It is within the Arch Road Industrial Park, just Northeast of the intersection of Arch Road and California Highway 99.\n\nThe Arch Road Industrial Park contains many other facilities of equal and larger sizes.\n\nIt is a modern, updated, 160,000 square foot  production and distribution center for the making of Kevin's Natural Food frozen products.\n\nThe overall facility site is an expanding industrial area, there are no hospitals or nursing homes within a one mile radius.  \n\nThe amount of ammonia in the system will exceed the threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds so is required to follow th"

The company takes numerous steps to prevent accidents and injuries, including the following: \n\nDevelops programs to provide and maintain safe work environments\n\nProvides employee training emphasizing safe work practices and potential on-the-job hazards\n\nPerforms periodic reviews of accident prevention programs and accident data to ensure that safe work practices are being followed\n\nProvides incentive programs to promote safety awareness and interest among employees\n\nAll of these programs and provisions foster employee safety and awareness of potential hazards at each site.  Provisions are also in place for employees to report accidents or conditions that could lead to an accident. Any personnel injury accidents that do occur are reported in accordance with Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) requirements. \n\nThe California Health and Safety Code requires that an RMP include a description of each \"accident\" involving the acutely hazardous material for which the RMP is being prepared that has occurred at the business or facility within the last three years of operation.  The description is to include identification of underlying causes of the accident and the measures taken, if any, to avoid a recurrence of a similar accident. \n\nDEFINITIONS OF \"ACCIDENT\" AND FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY \n\nThe term \"accident\" (as it relates to an RMP) is defined in Section 25532 (b) of the California Health and Safety Code.

For instance, while the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) refers to \"accidents\" as incidents that involve worker injury, and does not specifically relate to release of hazardous material, Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986 (SARA) Title lll defines specific federal reporting requirements for releases of hazardous material.  The SARA standards establish chemical-specific criteria for reporting releases based on the quantity of material released over a specified duration.  For example, any release of ammonia that exceeds 100 pounds in 24 hours must be reported under SARA Title lll requirements.  Unlike the OSHA standard, the SARA reporting requirements are independent of worker injury. \n\n\nDue to this is a new facility and owner there are no accidents to report.\n\nSYSTEM DESCRIPTION (Anhydrous Ammonia System)\nAnhydrous Ammonia is the chemical used in the refrigeration system in this facility.  Refrigeration systems of this type are the most widely used in the world, primarily due to their reliability, safety and cost.  These systems are inherently safe and are designed and installed with automatic, computer-controlled monitoring systems to both indicate necessary maintenance procedures and sound the alarm in case of accident.  Ammonia is a lighter-than-air gas at atmospheric pressure and temperature and would rise quickly and disperse if released into the environment.  The primary hazard associated with ammonia is acute toxicity when inhaled or ingested. Ammonia also poses a hazard when coming into contact with the skin.\n\nPRINCIPLES OF AMMONIA REFRIGERATION\n\"Refrigeration\" is a general term used to describe the cooling of a space or substance to a te"

Mechanical refrigeration is an application of thermodynamics wherein a cooling medium, or \"refrigerant,\" goes through a sequence of phase changes, the net effect of which is to absorb heat from one location and transfer it to another.  This process occurs in a closed cycle so that the refrigerant is recycled.  In the CalChef Foods. facility at the Stockton site, ammonia is the refrigerant.  In the ammonia refrigeration cycle, liquid ammonia expands, absorbs heat from the surroundings, ammonia vapor is compressed, condensed to a liquid, and then expanded.  As it expands, ammonia liquid changes back to vapor and absorbs heat from its surroundings, thereby providing refrigeration.  After absorbing heat, the vapor is compressed again, repeating the cycle. \n\n\nMost larger industrial systems rely on ammonia as a refrigerant.  Ammonia was chosen as the at the CalChef Foods. Stockton site for many of the same reasons it has been selected by other manufacturers:\n\n     1. Ammonia is a highly efficient refrigerant.\n     2. Ammonia does not have any ozone depletion potential.\n     3. Ammonia does not have any global warming potential. \n     4. Although ammonia, like several other refrigerants, has toxic properties, it\n          has many advantages over other refrigerants in terms of worker and \n          community safety:\n \nAmmonia is easily detected by smell in concentrations well below levels that could be harmful. \nAmmonia gas is lighter than air and will rise and disperse into the atmosphere if released.  \nAmmonia has a high affinity for absorption in water.  This increases the effectiveness of emergency response actions.\n\n\n**Equipment and Operation\nThe ammonia refrigeration facility in Stockton is based on a standardized, risk-preventing design. \n\nThe ammonia refrigeration facility at the Stockton site is new or recent construction, built to meet, and in many instances exceed, industry standards such as 2021 IIAR-2 and ASHRAE-15 (se"

Welded construction provides the strongest, most leak-proof type of piping connection.  Flanged and possibly screwed connections are used for specialty equipment that cannot be welded, such as system relief valves.\n\nThe equipment for the refrigeration system is located in the following  areas: the Engine Room, the prep room, packaging room, production room, WIP room and freezer storage, LPR room, dock, spiral freezer, or mounted on the building roof-top.\n\na)Screw Compressors\nThese transform cold, low pressure ammonia gas into hot, high pressure gas.

      "SummaryText": "virtually no need for operator involvement in the normal operation of the system, thus reducing potential risk of human error. \n\nIn the unlikely event that a problem occurs that results in release of ammonia from the refrigeration system, a sophisticated ammonia detection system located throughout the ammonia refrigeration facility will sense the presence of ammonia, provide an audible alarm, and initiate safety systems and system shutdown if required.\n\nAMMONIA LEAK DETECTION SYSTEM AND REFRIGERATION SYSTEM AUTOMATIC CONTROLS \n\nOne of the single most important properties of ammonia from a safety perspective is its strong, pungent odor. Ammonia can be sensed by the human nose in concentrations as low 50 parts per million (ppm) in air. This odor threshold concentration of ammonia is well below the levels that pose a health hazard. Therefore, the odor of ammonia provides an early warning signal that allows people to evacuate contaminated areas and take protective actions long before significant hazards exist. \n\nAdditionally, CalChef Foods.' ammonia refrigeration facility includes a sophisticated ammonia leak detection system that automatically initiates safety systems as well as local and site alarms.  The sensing system will be capable of detecting ammonia at concentrations as low as 25 parts per million.  It is important, however, to assure that the alarms and the responses to them are commensurate with the severity of the problem.  For example, it would not be appropriate to evacuate the site for a small ammonia leak that would not be harmful.  Likewise, large leaks would require a greater level of response and initiation of precautionary actions.  For this reason, the ammonia detection system will have different responses for varying levels of detected ammonia concentration.  These responses will initiate a local alarm at 25 ppm.\n\nAn Emergency Pressure Control System (EPCS) has been installed that has a high pressure switch set at 90% or less of the associated reli"

In this system the ammonia is kept in the piping and valves prior to the relief valve lifting to atmosphere.\n\nIn addition to the automatic controls associated with the ammonia leak sensing system, there will also be automatic controls associated with operation of the refrigeration compressors.  Each of the compressor units is controlled by a microprocessor.  Among its other functions, the microprocessor operates a series of interlocks which, in the event that pre-established critical parameters are exceeded, shut down the compressor.  As an additional safeguard, auxiliary system controls also exist to shut off the compressors if certain critical parameters for auxiliary equipment are exceeded. \n\nAMMONIA REFRIGERATION FACILITY OPERATING PARAMETER MONITORING.\n\nAmmonia Leak Detection System Automatic Controls\nAMMONIA CONCENTRATION (Parts per million - ppm).

Under normal conditions, the operator's primary role is to monitor process instrumentation, providing information regarding process parameters such as pressure and temperature.  Under normal operating conditions, these process parameters do not vary to any significant degree.  Deviations from normal operation are therefore easily detected. \n\nThe operator also conducts periodic inspections of the system to visually inspect primary system compone"

These walkdowns are performed at least once every 24 hours.   \n\nBecause of the fully automatic nature of the system, the elaborate alarm system, and the limited need for operator involvement in the normal operation of an ammonia refrigeration system, there is no need for an operator to be present continuously in the ammonia refrigeration building.  This system includes a computer-based system that continuously monitors important system parameters and checks the status of the ammonia sensing system.  In the event that a critical process parameter deviates from normal range or a leak detector reaches an alarm setpoint, personnel at the remote monitoring location are alerted to take necessary corrective action.  The remote monitoring station for Stockton's refrigeration facility is installed in a central monitoring area in the Maintenance Department.  Security personnel can provide a secondary level of notification to contact appropriate CalChef. individuals to respond to an incident.  \n \n\nProcess Hazards Analysis\n\nDuring the  Engineering Design Phase (development of specifications and system design), CalChef,  conducts a Process Hazards Analysis.  This analysis uses a systematic and comprehensive method to ensure that the finished design provides for safe and orderly construction, startup, operation, maintenance, and shutdown of the facility.  This review also includes a follow-up on the open issues identified in the Preliminary Safety Review.

Site Specific and Industry Incidents\n\n\n     2) Follow-up on open issues from previous review(s)\n\nThe technique  used for the Process Hazards Analysis is a What if Checklist\n\n\nPre-Startup Review\n\nUpon completion of construction, immediately prior to startup and before the introduction of chemicals or raw materials into the process, we conduct a Pre-Startup Review.  The purpose of this final review is to ensure that all safety items from previous reviews have in fact been incorporated into the actual construction, and that the process and facility can be safely started and operated.  This review also follows up on the results of the Preliminary Safety Review, the Process Hazards Analysis and the Layout Safety Review.  The Pre-startup Safety Review is usually done using a checklist. \n\nAn actual walkthrough inspection of the process facility takes place after the team completes the checklist.  Any problems or exceptions are recorded and a judgment is made by the safety team as to whether a safe startup can take place.  Items identified as impacting a safe startup must be resolved before startup take place.  Startup cannot take place until the safety team concurs that a safe startup (and emergency shutdown, if necessary) can take place.  The project is not \"closed\" until all action items have been resolved.  The Pre-startup Safety Review addresses the following points: \n\n     1) Walkthrough inspection of facility\n     2) Establishment of ability to safely start the process\n     3) Establishment of ability to safely shut down the process\n     4) Verification that the process and facility can be safely operated and\n          occupied\n     5) Verification of completeness of training\n     6) Follow-up on open issues from previous reviews\n     7) Review of process safety information\n\n Administrative Operating Control\nOperation of the ammonia refrigeration facility is a straightforward process that requires very little operator interaction.
