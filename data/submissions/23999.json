It is the Water Authority?s intent to enforce the policies and procedures presented in this document to prevent accidental releases of regulated substances or reduce the severity of those releases that do occur.\n\n\n1.0  POLICIES IN PLACE\n\nIt is the policy of the Water Authority to provide a safe working environment for each employee and all county residents in and around its various offices and work sites.  Every reasonable effort is made by the Water Authority to ensure a safe workplace for all staff members.  The Water Authority has established safe work methods that employees must practice at all times.\n\nThe Water Authority?s Water Treatment Plant complies the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regulations and has policies in place to ensure continued compliance.\n\n2.0  SOURCE AND SUBSTANCES\n\nThe facility (SIC Code 4941, NAICS 22131) is responsible for treating water for the Towns of Blacksburg and Christiansburg, and Virginia Tech.  Chlorine (Chemical Abstracts Services, CAS Number 7782-50-5) is used to disinfect treated water prior to distribution. The Water Authority stores up to five one-ton cylinders on site. \n\n3.0  RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nThe worst case release scenario for a release of chlorine involves the failure of a one-ton container releasing approximately 2,000 lbs of chlorine.  In this scenario, the entire amount is released over a ten-minute period at a rate of 200 pounds per minute (lbs/min).  The distance to the toxic endpoint the chlorine would travel, before dispersing enough to no longer pose a health hazard, is 0.9 miles.  This distance was limited by considering the enclosed building as a passive mitigation measure.\n\nThe alternate release scenario for the release of chlorine involves release t"

The distance was limited by considering the enclosed building as a passive mitigation measure.\n\n4.0  ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe facility is in compliance with the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) rule and, with this document, the Clean Air Act Accidental Release Prevention Program regulations.  The Water Authority Water Treatment Plant relies on a system of equipment maintenance and periodic testing to prevent accidental releases. \n\n5.0  ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nTo date, the Water Authority Water Treatment Plant has had no accidental releases of chlorine.\n\n \n6.0  EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe Water Authority Water Treatment Plant has an emergency response plan that has been coordinated with community emergency responders.  The Plant uses a vacuum chlorine system, and the entire Water Authority staff is trained in the repair of leaking and/or ruptured chlorine cylinders or transmission lines.  The Water Authority has coordinated efforts with the local fire department to supply additional emergency equipment.  An outside agency is notified if needed.\n \n7.0  PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThe Water Authority Water Treatment Plant has an ongoing maintenance training and operational training program to continuously update operator knowledge of systems within their facility.  For added safety, the Water Authority is planning to add a gas scrubber to the chlorine system in the near future."
