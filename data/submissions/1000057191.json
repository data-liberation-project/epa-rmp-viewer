Accordingly, ESG has developed proactive safety and environmental programs, which rely upon active employee participation and management leadership and support.  This same proactive philosophy was employed in the development and implementation of the Quigg Branch WPCP RMP for the chlorine system.  ESG Operations, Inc. has determined that the OSHA Process Safety Management standard also applies to the chlorine storage and chlorination process and therefore has prepared this RMP to comply with the RMP Program 3 requirements.  By doing so, ESG affirms its proactive safety and environmental philosophy and acknowledges the inherent value of full RMP compliance.\r\n\r\nThe RMP prevention program is arguably the most important element of the rule.  Its program elements require the active participation of facility employees and management in conducting activities aimed at preventing accidental releases of chlorine, a regulated chemical under the RMP regulation.  If prevention activities could be completely successful, there would be no need for emergency response activities, since no releases would occur.  Accordingly, a well-developed and properly implemented prevention program will lower the possibility of an accidental release and minimize the consequences of a release should one occur.\r\n\r\nESG Operations, Inc. takes an active role in preventing accidental releases by ensuring that its employees are well-informed regarding the hazards associated with chlorine at the Quigg Branch WPC"

The employees that work on the chlorine system are properly trained in the safe operation and handling of the chlorine system.  Refresher training is provided to the employees periodically.  They are aided in this work by standard operating procedures.\r\n\r\nESG Operations, Inc. management understands its duty to provide a safe working environment and to take measures to prevent accidents which may have an effect on the surrounding community.  Additionally, ESG Operations, Inc. has established procedures for emergency notification and response. \r\n\r\n2.0 Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\r\n\r\nThe Quigg Branch WPCP owned by Rockdale County is located in Conyers, Georgia.  The 6 MGD facility treats wastewater through a series of physical and chemical treatment operations.  Incoming wastewater initially passes through automated bar screens before being treated in a three-channel orbal activated sludge basin.  Clarification is accomplished in biological clarifiers for final solids precipitation.  Final effluent is disinfected by chlorination prior to discharge to the Yellow River.  Solids are digested aerobically and de-watered by gravity and belt filter press prior to landfill.\r\n\r\nThe Quigg Branch WPCP utilizes chlorine as a disinfectant in the treatment of wastewater.  Because of the volume of chlorine, the Quigg Branch WPCP is regulated under the RMP rule due to the volume of chlorine stored and used at the facility.   As required by the RMP Regulation, ESG Operations, Inc. has updated the Offsite Consequence Analysis.\r\n\r\n3.0\t General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-specific Prevention \r\nSteps\r\n\r\nThe prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps are described in detail in the Quigg Branch WPCP RMP manual.

As the equipment and the process has remained the same from the time the first PHA was performed in 1999, the PHA review/revalidation conducted did not result in many new findings or recommendations.  The recommendations from the PHA's conducted in 1999, 2004 and in 2007, 2011, 2013 and 2016 were reviewed, the findings of subsequent compliance audits were reviewed for completion as well.

If the chlorine sensor detects a specified level of chlorine, audio and visual alarms will be activated and a high rate ventilation system can be activated.  The ventilation system withdraws chlorine and air from a low elevation in the chlorine storage room to an outdoor location.  Additionally, there is a windsock on top of both chlorine storage building and the administrative building designed to aid employees in easily identifying wind direction and potentially plume migration. The alarm system is maintained and tested on a regular basis to ensure proper operation should there be a chlorine release.
