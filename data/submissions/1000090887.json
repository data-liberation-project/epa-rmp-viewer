The emergency response plan spells out the hows of emergency response and the roles and responsibilities of the incident response and management response teams.  Regular drills test readiness and help employees practice responses to alarms and incidents.\r\n \r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE TEAMS\r\nTippecanoe Labs maintains a fully trained emergency response organization that is on-site 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.  The site has approximately 109 fully trained emergency response personnel.  Site emergency response teams undergo regular training by the full time Emergency Services Group.  The instructors are certified through the State of Indiana and authorized to teach any state hazmat and fire curriculum.  Each response team member receives 120 hours of initial training in Hazmat Awareness and Operations & Fire 1. Once initial training is successful completed, each member has a least 40 hours per year of continuing education handling industrial fires and hazardous materials.  The emergency response organization has responsibility for custom-designed response equipment.  Vehicles on site include a fully equipped chemical response truck, an ambulance, an incident command vehicle, a fire engine equipped with 1250 gal of AFFF Foam, a fire engine equipped 1000 gal of water, and a foam truck designed for mutual aid response.  Tippecanoe Labs also has an on-site medical facility with a full time nurse, 3 Emergency Medical Responders (EMR), and 17 Emergency Medical Technicians (EMT). \r\n\r\n6.
