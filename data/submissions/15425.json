The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\n\nEvans is the operator of a stationary source that has more than the threshold quantity of a regulated substance in a process, as determined under 40 CFR 68.115 and therefore is subject to 40 CFR Part 68 - Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions.  Evans is a Program 3 level facility because the processes covered under RMP are also subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management Standard, 29 CFR 1910.119. \n\nTo evaluate the worst case and alternative scenarios, Evans used EPA's program RMP*Comp to calculate the off-site consequences.  RMP*Comp is based on the look-up tables and equations provided by the EPA in the RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nScenarios for Toxic Substances\n\nThe worst-case release scenario submitted for toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from Allylamine.  The scenario involves the release of 31,800 lb. of Allylamine in a liquid form over 10 minutes.  The release is completely contained within a diked area.  Evaporation from that pool within the dike occurs over 60 minutes.  Calculations take into account the worst case weather conditions (stable, low wind speed) in an urban setting, and are calculated to a toxic endpoint of 0.0032 mg/l.\n\nOne alternative release scenario is submitted for each toxic substance that may be present in Program 3 processes cumulatively.  Inventory is dependent upon customer orders and not all regulated substances are present onsite at a given time. \n\nThe alternative release scenario for Acrylonitrile involves a release from a transfer hose failure while loading or unloading from a tank truck.  The scenario involves the release of 1800 lb. of Acr"

The scenario involves the release of 160,000 lb. of Isopropylamine. It is assumed that the entire quantity is released as a vapor, which finds an ignition source, with the entire released quantity participating in a vapor cloud explosion.  Under worst case weather conditions (stable, low wind speed), in an urban setting, the endpoint is calculated to 1-psi overpressure. \n\nThe alternative release scenario submitted for flammable substances involves a release of Isoprypylamine liquid from a rail car.  The release is assumed to result in a pool fire. The scenario involves a 60-minute release of 1,525 lb. of Isopropylamine.  It is assumed that an ignition source reaches the pool causing a pool fire.  Passive mitigation controls such as enclosures and dikes are taken into account to calculate the scenario.  The release is also controlled by active mitigation measures that include deluge system(s) and fire monitors. Under neutral weather conditions, the endpoint is calculated to the distance from a pool fire to a radiant heat level that could cause second"
