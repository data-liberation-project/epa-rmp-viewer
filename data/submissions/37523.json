Distribution Center is the Retail Support Center for Winn-Dixie Stores, Inc. located in Montgomery, Alabama.  Winn-Dixie requires each facility to develop and maintain accident prevention programs and an emergency response plan appropriate to the site.  Each site is also responsible for regulatory compliance issues that apply to the site.  Winn-Dixie?s corporate and division environmental and safety personnel provide assistance in training for site employees and in budgeting and procurement of safety and training services.\n\n2. The facility and the regulated substance handled\n\nThe Hope Hull Distribution Center is located at 6080 Mobile Highway in the southeastern section of Montgomery, Alabama.  The facility consists of areas for dry, cooler, and freezer storage of perishable and non-perishable items for distribution to the Winn-Dixie Supermarkets.\n\nThe Hope Hull Distribution Center has a two-stage ammonia refrigeration system that exceeds the 10,000 lb. RMP threshold quantity.  The ammonia refrigeration system?s equipment is located in the southwest corner of the property in a machine or compressor room.  The high pressure receiver (HPR) or storage tank is located inside the compressor room in the Distribution Center building.  The HPR is the largest capacity vessel in the ammonia refrigeration system capable of holding approximately 18,830 lbs. of ammonia. \n\n3. The general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps\n\nThis facility exceeds the ammonia threshold quantity in the ammonia refrigeration system for the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard, 1910.119, and is therefore subject to the PSM requirements. For RMP compliance purposes, this places the Hope Hull's Distribution Center?s refrigeration process in the Program 3 level. Hope Hull Distribution Center will use its PSM program as the required Program 3 Prevention P"

      "SummaryText": "rogram for ammonia. \n\nThe Hope Hull  Distribution Center has a program in place to comply with the OSHA Process Safety Management Standard, 29 CFR 1910.119.  The PSM Program includes a preventative maintenance plan which requires all ammonia refrigeration equipment to be periodically inspected and serviced.  This will ensure that the equipment remains in good operating condition and will minimize the probability of accidents due to faulty equipment.  In developing the PSM Program, Hope Hull  Distribution Center also developed written operating procedures for the refrigeration processes.  These procedures cover all phases of operation and include information on safety devices.  These procedures will be used to train all operators and mechanics who work on the ammonia refrigeration processes to ensure consistency of operation and minimize human error.  In addition, all refrigeration mechanics receive training through the Refrigeration Engineers and Technicians Association (RETA) training course.  These measures ensure that all refrigeration operators and mechanics are properly trained.  Existing safe work practices such as Lockout/Tagout and Hot Work Permit are reviewed and updated to ensure that all non-routine work can be performed safely.  Other components of the prevention program include collection and review of all equipment information, the development of updated Piping & Instrumentation Diagrams (P&IDs), and the correction of any equipment design deficiencies found.  These actions will ensure that the equipment meets all refrigeration industry standards and that accurate equipment information will be available when needed.  To ensure that the Hope Hull Distribution Center refrigeration staff has the skills necessary to identify unsafe conditions, Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) training was conducted.  The staff also performed a PHA of this process.  Other PSM procedures, including Management of Change, Pre-Startup Safety Review, Compliance Audits, and Incident "

The PSM Program receives full support of plant management and involvement of employees at all levels.\n\n4. Five-year accident History\n\nThe Hope Hull Distribution Center has had no accidental releases of ammonia in the past five years.\n\n5. Emergency Response Program\n\nThe Hope Hull Distribution Center has an Emergency Response Program in place.  The program complies with 29 CFR 1910.38.  The site also has some internal emergency response capability and is developing a program to comply with paragraph (q) of 29 CFR 1910.120.  The current plan has been coordinated with the Montgomery Fire Department and notification is made locally by dialing 911.\n\n6.    Planned changes to improve safety\n\nNo changes are specifically identified but regular training sessions and compliance audits will be conducted.  If shortfalls are noted in the compliance audits then an action plan will be developed and areas of improvement will be addressed in a timely manner."
