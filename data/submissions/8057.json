We strive daily to operate our facility and handle our products in the safest manner possible, consistent with prudent environmental, health, and safety practices.   It is our policy to implement appropriate controls wherever possible, to prevent the unwanted release of any regulated substance.  We have a comprehensive accidental release prevention program in place that covers the key elements of design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  In the unlikely event that a release ever does occur, we have our own fully equipped HAZMAT team which is trained in emergency response.  This HAZMAT team will work diligently with the Rayne fire department and other emergency response personnel to control and minimize the effects of any release.   As members of CMA and SOCMA, we believe in Responsible Care, which includes the CAER code, Community Awareness and Emergency Response.  So, even though not required by any regulation, we installed a state of the art emergency response system to protect our community in the event of a release.  This emergency response system guards the acrolein storage area, and includes a containment wall, chemical detectors,  a deluge system, plus foam and neutralizer which would deactivate or minimize any release. \n\n\n2.The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility is a  small blend plant, which produces and distributes oilfield production chemicals.   We store one (1) regulated substance at our facility.  This substance is Acrolein [2-Propenal], which is used as a biocide, or as a hydrogen sulfide scavenger/antifoulant in the treatment of prod"

The following information provides details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 3 toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from Acrolein Storage.  Specifically, the scenario involves the release of 2,450 lb. of Acrolein [2-Propenal].  Toxic liquid is assumed to be immediately released to form a pool 1 cm in height, from which evaporation takes place. \n\nThe alternative release scenario for Acrolein [2-Propenal] involves a release from a dedicated acrolein skid in the Acrolein Storage process.  The scenario involves the release of 2,450 lb. of Acrolein [2-Propenal].  Toxic liquid is assumed to be immediately released to form a pool 1 cm in height, from which evaporation takes place.  Since acrolein is water soluble, the acrolein storage area is equipped with a deluge system to solubilize and dilute a release, and thus reduce evaporation.  This alone will minimize the extent of the plume.  In addition, foam is available for vapor suppression.  Plus, an adequate supply of neutralizer is stored in the area, which can be released to deactivate the acrolein.\n\n\n4.The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA. Our facility is subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119.  Our facility is also subject to EPCRA Section 302 notification requirements.    The following sect"

The primary methodology used to carry out these analyses is HAZOP.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at least every five years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, we maintain written operating procedures.  These procedures address unloading, transport, storage, and loading of acrolein cylinders and skids.  The information is reviewed regularly and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nTraining\nBaker Petrolite Corporation has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that  employees are competent in the operating procedures associated with various plant processes.  Refresher training is provided at least every year and more frequently as needed.  Training provided to employees at the Rayne facility includes required core safety training as defined by OSHA, plus additional training such as Environmental Awareness.  Plant employees also attend defensive driving classes taught by a certified instructor from Acadiana Safety Association bi-annually, plus Driving Safety.  First Aid/CPR training is provided annually by qualified Emergency Medical Technicians from the Crowley Fire Department.  HAZMAT training is provided annually to designated employees by our contracted emergency responders, Boots and Coot"

We plan to upgrade our existing emergency response system to include a contingency plan for after hours notification of the plant Emergency Coordinator, Plant Manager, and/or the fire department.  In addition, an emergency bypass for the neutralizer application system will be installed, to eliminate potential problems due to a power outage.    We also plan to strengthen our relationships with the local Fire Department and the LEPC.  These changes are expected to be implemented by August 1999.\n\nOur systems are focused on continual improvement in the prevention of accidents and pollution, effective communications and training, and accountability throughout the organization.  In line with our goal of continuous improvement, we plan to build on our existing good relationships with our close industrial neighbors, and the community."
