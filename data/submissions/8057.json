We strive daily to operate our facility and handle our products in the safest manner possible, consistent with prudent environmental, health, and safety practices.   It is our policy to implement appropriate controls wherever possible, to prevent the unwanted release of any regulated substance.  We have a comprehensive accidental release prevention program in place that covers the key elements of design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  In the unlikely event that a release ever does occur, we have our own fully equipped HAZMAT team which is trained in emergency response.  This HAZMAT team will work diligently with the Rayne fire department and other emergency response personnel to control and minimize the effects of any release.   As members of CMA and SOCMA, we believe in Responsible Care, which includes the CAER code, Community Awareness and Emergency Response.  So, even though not required by any regulation, we installed a state of the art emergency response system to protect our community in the event of a release.  This emergency response system guards the acrolein storage area, and includes a containment wall, chemical detectors,  a deluge system, plus foam and neutralizer which would deactivate or minimize any release. \n\n\n2.The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility is a  small blend plant, which produces and distributes oilfield production chemicals.   We store one (1) regulated substance at our facility.  This substance is Acrolein [2-Propenal], which is used as a biocide, or as a hydrogen sulfide scavenger/antifoulant in the treatment of prod"

The following information provides details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 3 toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from Acrolein Storage.  Specifically, the scenario involves the release of 2,450 lb. of Acrolein [2-Propenal].  Toxic liquid is assumed to be immediately released to form a pool 1 cm in height, from which evaporation takes place. \n\nThe alternative release scenario for Acrolein [2-Propenal] involves a release from a dedicated acrolein skid in the Acrolein Storage process.  The scenario involves the release of 2,450 lb. of Acrolein [2-Propenal].  Toxic liquid is assumed to be immediately released to form a pool 1 cm in height, from which evaporation takes place.  Since acrolein is water soluble, the acrolein storage area is equipped with a deluge system to solubilize and dilute a release, and thus reduce evaporation.  This alone will minimize the extent of the plume.  In addition, foam is available for vapor suppression.  Plus, an adequate supply of neutralizer is stored in the area, which can be released to deactivate the acrolein.\n\n\n4.The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA. Our facility is subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119.  Our facility is also subject to EPCRA Section 302 notification requirements.    The following sect"

The primary methodology used to carry out these analyses is HAZOP.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at least every five years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, we maintain written operating procedures.  These procedures address unloading, transport, storage, and loading of acrolein cylinders and skids.  The information is reviewed regularly and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nTraining\nBaker Petrolite Corporation has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that  employees are competent in the operating procedures associated with various plant processes.  Refresher training is provided at least every year and more frequently as needed.  Training provided to employees at the Rayne facility includes required core safety training as defined by OSHA, plus additional training such as Environmental Awareness.  Plant employees also attend defensive driving classes taught by a certified instructor from Acadiana Safety Association bi-annually, plus Driving Safety.  First Aid/CPR training is provided annually by qualified Emergency Medical Technicians from the Crowley Fire Department.  HAZMAT training is provided annually to designated employees by our contracted emergency responders, Boots and Coot"

Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, excess flow valves and lifting devices.  Maintenance operations are conducted by qualified personnel who have received previous training in safe and effective maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nManagement of Change\nWritten procedures are in place at our facility to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures.  Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification.\n\nPre-startup Reviews\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at all Baker Petrolite locations.  These reviews are conducted at each site to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits\nBaker Petrolite\u0012s corporate safety group conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the PSM and RMP rule are being implemented.

The investigations are designed to identify the root causes of incidents, and identify corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\n\nEmployee Participation\nBaker Petrolite Corporation truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.  Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  In addition, our employees have access to all information created as part of the facility\u0012s implementation of the RMP rule, including information resulting from process hazard analyses in particular.\n\nContractors\nIf necessary, our company hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities.  Prior to selecting a contractor, we conduct a thorough evaluation of their safety performance.  Only those who meet strict acceptance criteria are authorized to enter the facility.  The Rayne facility routinely informs the contractors of known potential hazards related the contractor\u0012s work and plant processes.  Contractors are also informed of the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.\n\n\n5.Five-year Accident History\nThe Rayne blending facility has an excellent safety record over the last 5 years, with no accidental releases occurring during this period.   In fact, because our employees use safe work practices in their day to day work, no accidental release of acrolein has occurred at the Rayne plant since the material was first stored on site in 1983.  It is our policy to strive for continous improvement in our operations, and this has led to more stringent release prevention policies, and more elaborate emergency response plans.

Therefore, we expect to be able to control and minimize a release, should one ever occur.\n\n6.Emergency Response Plan\nBaker Petrolite\u0012s Rayne facility has a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials.  The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas.\n\nTo ensure proper functioning, our emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced.  In addition, the plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within our processes that would require a modified emergency response.\n\n7.Planned Changes to Improve Safety\nSeveral opportunities for improvement have been identified during our implementation of the accidental release prevention program.  We plan to upgrade our existing emergency response system to include a contingency plan for after hours notification of the plant Emergency Coordinator, Plant Manager, and/or the fire department.  In addition, an emergency bypass for the neutralizer application system will be installed, to eliminate potential problems due to a power outage.    We also plan to strengthen our relationships with the local Fire Department and the LEPC.  These changes are expected to be implemented by August 1999.\n\nOur systems are focused on continual improvement in the prevention of accidents and pollution, effective communications and training, and accountability throughout the organization.  In line with our goal of continuous improvement, we plan to build on our existing good relationships with our close industrial neighbors, and the community."
