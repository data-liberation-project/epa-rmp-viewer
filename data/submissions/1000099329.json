This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, the Eagle Gas Plant has trained personnel that will respond to control and contain the release.\r\n\r\nDescription Of The Stationary Source And Regulated Substances\r\n\r\nThe Eagle Gas Plant, located near Edna, TX, uses refrigeration to process wellhead gas into marketable natural gas and natural gas liquids (NGL).  As a result of this operation, EPA regulated flammable substances are processed, recovered, and stored at the facility (e.g., methane and NGL).  The Eagle plant does not use or store any regulated toxic substances above the EPA set threshold levels.\r\n\r\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program\r\n\r\nThe following is a summary of the accidental release prevention program in place at the plant.  Because processes at the gas plant that are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) Risk Management Program Regulation are also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement PROGRAM 1 under EPA's accidental release prevention program.\r\n\r\nEmployee Participation\r\n\r\nThe Eagle Gas Plant encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention.

The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings.  Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years so that the reports can be reviewed during future PHAs and PHA revalidations.\r\n\r\nCompliance Audits\r\n\r\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, DCP Midstream's personnel periodically conduct an audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented.  Compliance audits are conducted at least every 3 years.  Audit findings are forwarded to the company's Safety Department for resolution.  The Safety Department initiates any corrective actions taken in response to the audit and tracks them until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are retained.\r\n\r\nChemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\n\r\nThe processes at the Eagle Gas Plant have hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation.

This information, in combination with trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\r\n\r\nThe Eagle Gas Plant has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\r\n\r\nThe Eagle Gas Plant primarily uses the HAZOP and What-if/Check list analysis techniques to perform these evaluations.  OSHA and the EPA recognize these analyses as approved methodologies for conducting PHA's.  Plant PHA's are conducted using a team of people who have operating, maintenance, engineering and safety experience.  The team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\r\n\r\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to company's local management for resolution.  Implementation of mitigation options, in response to PHA findings, is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation actions are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\r\n\r\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the plant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard anal"
