      "SummaryText": "A.  ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nThe management and staff of the Tracy Distribution Center are committed to operating the Distribution Center with the highest regard for the safety of the public, Distribution Center personnel, and the environment.  To ensure the safety of the public, Distribution Center personnel, and the environment, the Distribution Center has implemented a management system that integrates the elements of Cal-OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) standard, 8 CCR 5189, EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP) rule, 40 CFR part 68, and the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program, Title 19, Division 2, Chapter 4.5.  The policies and procedures integrated under the Distribution Center's management system specifically address prevention of the release of anhydrous ammonia, and emergency response to an accidental release of ammonia.\n\nB.  STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nThe Tracy Distribution Center operates several refrigerated warehouses and freezers.  Anhydrous ammonia is used as a refrigerant in the mechanical compression refrigeration system at the Tracy Distribution Center.  Ammonia is handled in a closed-loop process that consists of the following general stages: liquid storage; expansion; evaporation; compression; and condensation.\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system is the only process at the Tracy Distribution Center which is subject to the EPA RMP rule ( and the Cal-OSHA PSM standard).  Anhydrous ammonia is the only regulated substance handled in the ammonia refrigeration system.\n\nThe refrigeration cycle begins with the transfer of high pressure liquid ammonia from the high pressure thermosyphon receiver to the two controlled pressure receivers where the pressure is dropped to 65 and 45 psig.  The thermosyphon receiver also supplies ammonia to the compressors for oil cooling.  From the 65 psig controlled pressure receiver, liquid ammonia is transferred to dock evaporators, a glycol chil"

      "SummaryText": "ler, ice production makers, produce and meat storage areas, and the new Perishables Warehouse (2001).  The 45 psig controlled pressure receiver transfers liquid ammonia to the freezer evaporators.  A liquid/vapor mixture is pulled from these pieces of equipment to individual suction accumulators.  Dock evaporators and the glycol chiller send a liquid/vapor mixture to the +30?F Suction Accumulator, and the produce and meat storage area evaporators send a mixture to the +15?F Suction Accumulator.  The appropriate level of liquid is maintained in each accumulator by dump traps that pump liquid from the accumulators to the controlled pressure receivers.  The +30? and +15? accumulator's associated dump trap delivers liquid to the 65 psig controlled pressure receiver.  -25? accumulator delivers liquid to the 45 psig controlled pressure receiver. \n\nThe vapor from the -25? Suction Accumulator is routed to the four Booster Compressors.  Discharge from these four compressors is sent by a common header to the 45 psig controlled pressure receiver.  Vapor from the +30? and +15? Suction Accumulators are routed to the nine compressors where the pressure and temperature of the gas is increased.  Compressor discharge (high pressure ammonia vapor, or hot gas) is sent to the condenser where it is condensed to a high pressure liquid and returned to the thermosyphon receiver.  An Auto Purger periodically purges the system of non-condensibles collected in the condenser.  The system also has an emergency refrigerant control box located outside of the machine room where pressure can be manually relieved from one vessel to another. \n\nC.  ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe Tracy Distribution Center facility has many safety features, including those implemented on the ammonia refrigeration system.  Much of the safety of the system is inherent in the policies and procedures that govern the operation of the system.  For example, the facility operat"

      "SummaryText": "es in accordance with the State Office of Emergency Services' California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) program as well as Cal-OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM), and Federal EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP), Program 3 requirements.\n\nThe Tracy Distribution Center opened in April 1992 with major upgrades to the ammonia system in 1999 and 2001.  The ammonia refrigeration system at the Tracy Distribution Center facility was designed and constructed in accordance with the Uniform Mechanical Code, which specifically outlines requirements for the safe operation of the ammonia refrigeration system.  These safety features include an ammonia diffusion tank, ammonia sensors in the machine room, penthouses, dock areas and Perishable Warehouse, pressure relief valves to protects vessels' integrity, and automatic shut down systems that prevent equipment damage and ammonia releases.  In the event of ammonia detection, audible and visual alarms are triggered throughout the facility. \n\nAmmonia refrigeration systems do not experience any chemical reactions or internal corrosion.  The only composition change that occurs within the systems are phase changes, as ammonia is cycled through various stages of liquid and vapor, similar to a household refrigerator.  The refrigeration system is a closed-loop system without any regular emissions or releases.  Any leaks are noted and repaired immediately.\n\n\nD.  FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nOver the past five years, the Tracy Distribution Center has not had any ammonia releases that resulted in deaths, injuries, property damage, environmental damage, or offsite evacuations.\n\nE.  EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe Tracy Distribution Center facility has an emergency action plan in effect.  The Emergency Action Plan (Plan) is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of the PSM/RMP document, which is maintained at the facility.  Emergency response activities are coordinated with the Tracy Fire Department and the local fire "

If necessary, the facility will call 9-1-1 to alert the local Police and Fire Departments.\n\nOther responders will be called as needed, including the Tracy Fire Department.  If a release exceeds the federal reporting quantity of 100 pounds for ammonia, the National Response Center will be called.\n\nThe Tracy Distribution Center will be responsible for evacuating and ensuring the safety of its employees in case of an emergency evacuation.  Evacuation drills are performed at least annually.  Other training received by employees includes: ammonia awareness, what to do in case of emergency, and where to go when an evacuation is called. \n\n\n\nF.  PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThe initial Process Hazard Analysis, including a Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) study and a Facility \"What If\" Walkthrough, provided mitigation measures to improve safety at the Tracy Distribution Center located at 16900 West Schulte Road in Tracy, California. Then in August 2001, this study was updated to include the 2001 warehouse expansion project.  All mitigation measures from the 1999 analysis and the 2001 addendum have been completed."
