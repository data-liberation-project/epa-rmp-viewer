Solutia Inc. - Decatur Plant is one of the chemical manufacturing facilities that make up the company.  Staffing at Decatur Plant is currently about 190 Solutia employees and 120 permanent contractor employees.\n\nBuilt in 1952, the Decatur Plant is situated on a 668 acre tract, 4 miles west of the City of Decatur, on the Tennessee River  (river mile 302). Of the 668 acres, over 300 acres are presently in use.\n\nThe plant was designed to primarily manufacture Acrilan acrylic fiber and various nylon intermediate chemicals for the production of nylon fiber. In April of 2005, the production of Acrilan permanently ceased at this site. The bulk chemicals in the production units and tanks were subsequently removed, with completion occurring by the end of the Third Quarter of 2005. There are only two chemicals (both are toxics) in our remaining processes that are regulated by EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP) rule. They are:\n\n    Acrylonitrile (AN) ------------------- A raw material to make acrylic fiber and nylon intermediate chemicals.\n    Propionitrile (PN) ------------------- A by-product from manufacture of nylon intermediate chemicals.\n\nThe main raw material for production of nylon chemicals  (i.e., AN) arrives at the plant by barge on the Tennessee River. The principal products are non-RMP chemicals, and are shipped from the site by barge, railcar, and trucks.\n\nSolutia Inc. has officially adopted the following six commitments, expressing our intention to operate responsibly:\n  \n* We wil"

The site maintains a list of the scenarios considered, as well as those reported, including information about the key administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the exposure distances for each scenario. This information is available at the Decatur site to appropriate inspectors.\n\n          2. For alternative release scenarios (ARS), an evaluation of the most likely system failures was conducted. This information has been documented, and is available at the Decatur site to appropriate inspectors.\n\n 4.0  General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n \nWe take a systematic, proactive approach to preventing accidental releases of hazardous chemicals.  Our management systems address each of the key features of successful prevention programs including:\n \n * Process safety information\n * Process hazard analysis\n * Operating procedures\n * Training\n * Mechanical integrity Program\n * Management of change Process\n * Pre-startup review\n * Compliance audits\n * Incident investigation\n * Employee participation\n * Hot work permit\n * Contractors\n \nAs part of our prevention efforts, we have implemented the following chemical-specific prevention steps:\n \n  Acrylonitrile (AN)\n *  Low level alarm on the tank would be triggered.

Check valves on the discharge side of the transfer pumps would prevent material from flowing back into the tank if the release occurred while loading a railcar.\n *  An operator would stop the flow of material into the tank and immediately contact the site coordinator.  Cleanup would be handled by the HAZMAT team.\n\nThese individual elements of our prevention program work together to prevent accidental chemical releases.  Our company and our employees are committed to the standard that these management systems set for the way we do business, and we have specific accountabilities and controls to ensure that we are meeting our own high standards for accident prevention.\n\n5.0  Five-year Accident History\n\nThere were not any agency reportable spills/releases of the two RMP-covered chemicals in the last five years from the specific processes covered by the regulation that met the criteria for being reportable under 40 CFR Part 68. Minor releases of some of these chemicals occurred from other processes; however, there were no exposures to individuals onsite or offsite, no onsite damage to equipment, and no environmental impacts onsite or offsite as a result of these minor releases.\n\n6.0  Emergency Response Program\n\nWe at Solutia use several types of safety audits to ensure that our plant runs safely.

We have approximately 27 firefighters across the 4 shifts that  we work.  These firefighters train 48 hours annually at the site on things like flammable liquid fires, interior fire fighting, hazardous communications, incident command and others.  Our firefighters also train at Texas A&M Fire School on similar items but larger projects.   We have two fire trucks that are equipped with foam and dry chemical extinguishing agent to supplement the 6 fire pumps that draw fire water from the river.  We have recently implemented a $3 million fire water upgrade project to increase our pumping capacity.\n\nCurrently we have 11 EMTs training 56 hours annually on trauma assessment, burn care, confined space rescue and others.

Participation in planning and execution of community drills through our membership in these two organizations has always been rewarding.\n\nSolutia has a good working relationship with other Industrial Plants and emergency responders from the City of Decatur.  We invite representatives from local industries and fire fighters from the City of Decatur to tour the plant annually.  During these visits we exchange ideas about various items and take the opportunity to train together on live fire fighting exercises at our training facility. \n\nThere is an on-site emergency response team trained to handle all chemical incidents. Any chemical incidents that may have off-site impacts are reported to the Morgan County Emergency Management Agency (EMA) which can initiate a county-wide emergency alerting system. The Solutia-Decatur site also supplies equipment in emergencies as backup for the EMA's systems.\n\nWe maintain an integrated contingency plan, which consolidates all of the various federal, state, and local regulatory requirements for emergency response planning.
