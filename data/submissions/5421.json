Operations at the site include raw material receiving and storage, corn processing and co-product separation, product storage and shipping.  The primary products are corn sweeteners, cornstarch, and ethanol.  In our processes, we use three toxic chemicals stored in quantities greater than the EPA RMP Threshold Quantity limit.  The three chemicals and quantities are identified below.\n\n\tToxics\tQuantity\tThreshold Quantity\n\t\t\t\n1.\tSulfur Dioxide\t15,230 gal. AST\n(153,000 lbs. at 84% Admin.

Control)\t20,000 lbs.\n \nMCP does not use listed flammable substances in quantities exceeding EPA RMP Threshold Quantity limits.\n\nSulfur dioxide is used in the steeping process.  Liquid sulfur dioxide is vaporized and introduced into the process water line.  The vaporized sulfur dioxide is dissolved into the process water and produces a sulfurous acid solution.  The sulfurous acid solution minimizes bacterial growth and prepares corn for further processing.  The process water is recovered and added back into the process in a continuous loop.  Chlorine is used as a water additive at the cooling towers and water reclaim tank.  Chlorine is drawn into the water stream from storage cylinders to keep a bacteria-free system.  Aqueous ammonia is used in the fermentors for ethanol production.\n\nOur accidental release prevention programs and our contingency planning efforts help us effectively manage the potential hazards related to our use of these chemicals.

This information identifies the potential hazards and the potential risks they pose.  The following are brief summaries of these scenarios, including information about the key administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit exposure distances for each scenario.\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario\n\nThe worst-case scenario (WCS) is an evaluation of the impact of a release of a hazardous substance from a complete failure (catastrophe) of the largest vessel, releasing the entire contents over a ten-minute period under the most stable weather conditions.  The probability of a release meeting these conditions is extremely small.\n\nThe worst-case toxic release scenario at MCP's Columbus Facility is the rupture of the sulfur dioxide outdoor, aboveground storage tank and release of the entire contents (153,000).  The worst-case release would occur over a 10-minute period and the distance to the toxic endpoint (3 ppm) is 25 miles.  The exposure distance was obtained using EPA Risk Management Program Guidance (EPA 550-B-98-010).  There are no mitigation"

MCP has developed a risk management system which identifies positions and responsibilities for proper management of the RMP.  An organizational chart is included as Attachment 2.\n\n5.0 Five-Year Accident History\n\nWe keep records for accidental chemical releases and near misses that occur at our facility.  Incident reports are completed and the appropriate emergency response agencies are notified by MCP for any accidental chemical release exceeding federal or state Reportable Quantities.  Reporting and notification procedures are documented in the MCP Environmental Compliance Manual.  Reports are also completed for First Aid or chemical release near misses that occur on-site.  Appropriate corrective measures are taken to help prevent similar situations from occurring in the future.  \n\nThe following is a brief summary of accidental chemical releases involving materials covered under EPA's RMP rule which occurred at the MCP Columbus facility during the past five years:\n\n- Aqueous Ammonia - 8/19/95, 1:00 PM, 650 gallons (4,979 lbs.) - Tank overfill (high alarm failure)\n\nFor this incident we conducted a formal incident investigation to identify and correct the root causes of the event.  During the ammonia release incident, a construction worker at the facility was taken to the hospital for emergency care.  The incident did not result in any off-site consequences that affected the public or damaged the environment.  Additional information regarding this release is included in the RMP Registration Data Elements.\n\n6.0 Emergency Response Program \n\nMCP has developed and maintains an Emergency Response / Fire Prevention Plan and an Emergency Response Plan for Hazardous Chemical Spills, Leaks and Releases.  The Plans consolidate various federal, state, and local regulatory requirements for emergency response planning.  Our emergency response program provides the essen"

      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\n\n\n1.0 Introduction\n\nThis Risk Management Plan (RMPlan) was prepared to meet the requirements of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) Rule (40 Code of Federal Regulation (CFR) 68).  Minnesota Corn Processors (MCP) is a covered facility under the rule because processes contain more than a threshold quantity of a regulated substance.  The MCP process meets Program Level 3 criteria.  The actual components of the required RMP include:\n\n( Conduct a hazard assessment (release scenarios)\n( Develop and implement a accident prevention program\n( Develop and implement an emergency response program\n( Development and implementation of a management system organizational structure\n( Submittal of a RMP Plan\n\nThe purpose of the RMP is to prevent the accidental release and to minimize the consequences of any such release of hazardous substances.\n\nAt MCP, we are committed to operating and maintaining our processes (especially those using hazardous substances) in a safe and responsible manner.  We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public as well as protection of the environment.  This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including:\n\n( A description of our facility and use of substances regulated by EPA's RMP regulation\n( A summary of results from our hazard assessment of the potential off-site consequences from accidental chemical releases\n( A five-year accident history for accidental releases of chemicals regulated by EPA's RMP rule\n( An overview of our accident prevention program\n( An overview of our emergency response program\n( An overview of planned improvements at the facility to help prevent accidental chemical releases from occurring and adversely affecting our employees, the public, and the environment\n( The certifications"

      "SummaryText": "measures included in this scenario.  Public and environmental receptors in this WCS include:  residences, schools, hospitals, public recreational areas, commercial / industrial areas, national or state parks / forests and officially designated wildlife refuges.  The population was estimated and public receptors were identified using Landview III mapping software and U.S. Census Data.  Environmental receptors were identified using U.S. Geological Survey Quad Maps.  Additional information regarding the WCS is included in the RMP Registration Data Elements.\n\nAlternate Release Scenarios\n\nAn Alternate Release Scenario (ARS) is the evaluation of the impact of a release of smaller quantities of material.  The causes and the amount in these scenarios were determined based on site-specific data.  The probability of this scenario is higher than worst-case scenarios and therefore is the primary focus for on- and off-site emergency planning.  Nonetheless, this scenario remains a low probability event.  Alternate toxic release scenarios have been prepared and selected for sulfur dioxide, chlorine and aqueous ammonia.  \nThe selected sulfur dioxide scenario involves a release when a valve on the sulfur dioxide transfer line is inadvertently opened due to human error.  Sulfur dioxide is released at a rate of 60 lbs. per minute for 15 minutes (900 lb. release).  The distance to the toxic endpoint (3 ppm) is 0.4 miles.  The exposure distance was obtained using EPA Risk Management Program Guidance (EPA 550-B-98-010).  Detection equipment, alarm system, excess flow valves, and an on-site HAZMAT response team help limit release duration.  Public receptors include a school and residences.  There are no environmental receptors within the sulfur dioxide ARS exposure distance.\n\nThe selected ARS for chlorine is described below.  Chlorine could be released at the facility if a one-ton chlorine cylinder valve is sheared off.  The entire contents of the cylinder (2,000 lbs.) could be released a"
