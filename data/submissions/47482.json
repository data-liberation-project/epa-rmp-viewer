Facility accidental release and emergency response policy. \n\nThe management and employees of Southern FS, Inc. are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2.  The stationary source and the regulated substance handled.\n\nThe primary activity of the facility, which is located at Old Route 146 Loop,  Vienna,IL, is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous Ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient. The storage and handling system consists of one storage tank (26,000 gallon), loading risers, associated plumbing and nurse tanks.   Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility, employees, authorized management personnel and authorized contractors.  The maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia that can be stored would be 220,000 pounds. This includes anhydrous ammonia that could be stored in nurse tanks.\n\n3. The worst case release scenario and the alternative release scenario.\n\nThe facility has developed a worst-case and alternative-case scenario, however,since this is security-sensitive information it has been withheld from this Executive Summary as required by EPA regulations.\n\n4. The accidental release prevention program.\n\nThis facility complies with EPA' s Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations. This facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\",  published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc. as adopted by state regulation and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\".

Five Year accident history.\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that:\n- have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor  \n- to our knowledge, have resulte in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, shelter in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n6.  The emergency response program.\n\n The facility has:\n - a written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.38;\n - provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information \n      as required under SARA Title III  (EPCRA).\n - This facility during the period of late 2006 became an unmanned facility, responsibility for emergency planning and RMP documentation will be maintained at our Boles Location at 140 State Route 37 North, Boles Illinois 62909\n - In the event of an emergency involving anhydrous ammonia, it is our policy to notify the Vienna Fire Dept. and the Johnson County LEPC and request that they respond to the emergency. Our emergency action plans have been coordinated with both the fire department and LEPC.\n     \n7.  Planned changes to improve safety.\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility. Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe condtions.  There are no specific safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
