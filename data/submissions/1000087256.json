The maximum intended inventory of ammonia at the Great Lakes Cold Storage facility is 19,890 pounds within the refrigeration system. The purpose of this plan is to establish and describe the actions that would be followed by GLCS personnel in the event of an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia from the refrigeration system. The scope of the plan is limited to anhydrous ammonia because this is the only hazardous substance present at the facility above the regulatory threshold quantity. The plan is coordinated with the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) on an annual basis, through a filing with the Ohio State Emergency Response Commission (SERC).\n\n\n\nAn organizational chart has been created to identify the \"Emergency Commander\", in the event of an accidental release. All personnel on the organizational chart have been trained in the duties of the Emergency Commander. The duties of the Emergency Commander that are covered in the training are 1) Overall responsibility for the management of the emergency response; 2) Functioning as the Safety Officer; i.e., determining whether proposed response actions can be undertaken safely; 3) Ensuring that all necessary notifications of external agencies are made in a timely manner; 4) Representing GLCS in communications with outside entities, including response and regulatory agencies, and the news media. In the event of a response by the Solon Fire Department, incident command shall pass to the senior fire officer on scene. The GLCS Emergency Commander, however, will remain responsible for the last two duties listed above. It is important to note that GLCS coordinates with the Solon Fire Department on a yearly basis. The fire department does a walk through of the facility each year, to ensure that all firefighters are familiar with the facility. The Solon Fire"

The duties of the Operations Team Leader are 1) Directing the tactical response, but only to the extent that such can be done without encountering an inordinate risk of exposure to dangerous concentrations of ammonia ; 2) Advises the GLCS Incident Commander in the development of a tactical plan for the emergency response and advises of any changes in the situation and of any necessity to deviate from planned actions. 3) In the event that the Solon Fire Department and county HAZMAT team are activated, he will ensure that all team members and contractor response team members have relocated to an area of safety. He will then advise the fire department Incident Commander of conditions in the plant and of employees or visitors who have not been accounted for. - All personnel on the Operations Team have been trained in evacuation and shelter-in-place procedures.\n\n\n\nGLCS has a contract with InterCool to provide a properly trained and equipped team to respond to anhydrous ammonia releases or potential releases at the GLCS facility. InterCool is also under contract to provide maintenance and repair of the ammonia refrigeration system. Upon notification to their 24 hour emergency number InterCool will provide an emergency response team of two or more persons who are experts in maintaining and repairing the ammonia refrigeration system at the GLCS facility. The InterCool team will coordinate and work with the fire department, HAZMAT team, and the GLCS Emergency Commander to determine the best course of action. \n\nAll employees have been trained in the recognition of a release and the physical signs of ammonia (i.e. smell, tearing of the eyes, etc.).

The procedure calls for the employee to notify the supervisor on duty, who will evaluate the situation and decide whether to activate the employee alarm system to evacuate the entire facility. Evacuation routes and assembly points are posted throughout the facility and have been reviewed with all employees. The supervisor on duty will notify senior management of the situation so the Emergency Commander can initiate the response plan. The facility is also equipped with ammonia detectors that will sound an alarm, initiating an evacuation of the building.\n\nIn the event of an accidental release of ammonia during business hours, GLCS personnel who are off site and who may be needed for the emergency response will be notified by telephone. If a high concentration of ammonia is detected during non-business hours, an alarm will sound at ADT Security Services, who will immediately contact one of the senior GLCS managers on their call-out list. \n\nImportant information that is identified in the plan is the layout of the facility and a process flow diagram of the refrigeration system that can be easily accessed by emergency responders. A worst case scenario and alternative case scenario are included to identify sensitive receptors that are close enough to the source to potentially be injured in the event of an accidental release. The plan identifies first aid procedures for persons exposed to anhydrous ammonia.\n\n\n\nA Process Safety Management plan is in place in order to properly manage the refrigeration system. The purpose of this program is to develop and implement a written plan of action in Process Safety Management to identify the hazards, conduct a hazard analysis and implement a plan to control the hazards associated with the use of ammonia in this cold storage facility.
