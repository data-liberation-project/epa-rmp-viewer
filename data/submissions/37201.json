      "SummaryText": "Sweetheart Cup Company, Inc., located at 1550 Wrightsboro Road in Augusta manufactures disposable food containers, including those consisting of polystyrene foam. This foam production process uses Difluorethane (CAS # 75-37-6).\n\nSweetheart Cup is dedicated to the safety of our employees and our community. Our corporate safety policy reinforces Sweetheart's commitment to providing a safe environment for our employees and our neighboring community.\n\nThe Sweetheart Plant occupies 570,000 square feet of space on a 17 acre lot. \n\nThe worst case scenario listed depicts the release of 45,642 lb. of the subject material. RMP Comp software was used to model this release. There is potential for offsite impact.\n\nThe alternative release scenario listed depicts a 15 minute release of the subject material. Excess flow detection control devices will mitigate any further release. Within the past five years, the process has had no accidental release that caused offsite impacts.\n\nThe emergency response program includes coordination with local emergency response. Our emergency response plan includes notification procedures, emergency contacts etc. Employees are trained on emergency response annually.\n\nSafety training at Sweetheart Cup is an ongoing process. Safety review and evaluation is part of our company's day to day operations."
