      "SummaryText": "Pioneer Frozen Foods\nProcess Safety and Risk Management Program\nExecutive Summary\n\n1.  This is to inform all interested persons, including employees that Pioneer Frozen Foods is complying with OSHA\u00bfs Process Safety Management Standard (called Process Safety Management or PSM), Title 29 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 1910.119, and EPA\u00bfs Risk Management Program regulations (called RM Program), Title 40 CFR Part 68. In this way we promote overall plant, worker, and public safety.  These programs enable our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of toxic substances as well as fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents. Overall, these programs prevent accidental fatalities, injuries and illnesses and avoid physical property damage. Our safety programs are applied to any activity involving hazardous chemicals including any use, storage, handling, or the on-site movement of such chemicals, or combination of these activities. Any group of vessels which are interconnected and separate vessels which are located such that a hazardous chemical could be involved in a potential release shall be considered a single process.\nOur safety programs prevent accidents because they focus on the rules, procedures, and practices which govern individual processes, activities, or pieces of equipment.  These rules are detailed and improved as necessary. They are also communicated to and accepted by all employees at the facility.  \n\n2.  Pioneer Frozen Foods utilizes anhydrous ammonia as the cooling medium for its production of frozen foods.  Refrigeration is necessary for conditioning the room air in production areas, cooling water and glycol used as secondary coolants, freezing product, and maintaining product at desired temperatures.  Anhydrous ammonia was selected because of its superior heat transfer capacities and non-ozone depleting qualities.\n\n3.  The following is a description of the worst case scenario.\nFailure of"

      "SummaryText": "the high pressure receiver containing 19,400 of ammonia with the receiver quantity limited to 80% of the vessel capacity by facility procedures resulting in a ten minute release. Under worst-case weather conditions, ammonia could travel 1.8 miles before dispersing enough to no longer pose a hazard to the public.  This scenario is unlikely for the following reasons: worst-case weather conditions are uncommon; the vessel is enclosed in a building that would withstand and help to contain such a release; industry standards for the manufacture and quality control of pressure vessels; ammonia is not corrosive in this service; pressure safety valves limit operating pressure in this vessel; the accident prevention program in place at the facility including the mechanical integrity program for regular maintenance, inspection and testing, and replacement of equipment, if necessary; installed ammonia sensors in the system to warn of leaks; alarms and the auto-dialing system in place to warn operating personnel of process upsets; and the emergency response plan and equipment in place at the facility.\n\n4.  The following is a description of the alternative case scenario.\nA damaged \u00bd\u00bf drain valve on the Spiral Freezer could release 14 pounds of ammonia in a period of ten minutes.  Under common weather conditions, ammonia could travel no more than one tenth of a mile before dispersing enough to no longer pose a hazard to the public.  This particular scenario was chosen because it is located in an area with forklift traffic nearby.  This scenario is unlikely for the following reasons:  ammonia pipes and valves in the plant are clearly labeled, personnel have reviewed potential hazards, and forklift traffic is by qualified personnel only.  In the rare event that a leak does occur, the plant has computer control system to give operators remote control capability.  Valves are located on the roof to allow operators to stop the flow of ammonia to the area without endangering themselves."

      "SummaryText": "5.  Accident Prevention Program\nThe facility at Prosperity, South Carolina was constructed in 2002.  It was constructed by reputable contractors who had to comply with the plant\u00bfs safety program.  All construction on the ammonia system was completed in full compliance with all applicable local building codes.  Work performed was in compliance with ASHRAE Standard 15, \u00bfSafety Code for Mechanical Refrigeration\u00bf and ASME B31.5 \u00bfRefrigeration Piping.\u00bf  The plant has hired experienced refrigeration personnel to handle the operation and maintenance of the system.  These individuals have completed necessary HAZMAT training and experienced with working on ammonia systems.\n      The facility is installed with numerous devices to aid technicians in the safe operation of the plant.  Ammonia detectors are located throughout the plant to indicate any leaks that may occur.  The system is equipped with a computer control system that can be accessed both from the facility and via a computer equipped with a modem.\n\n6.  Accident History\nThe facility has never had an ammonia related accident.\n\n7.  Emergency Response\nTechnicians responsible for the safe operation have received HAZMAT training.  The Process Safety and Risk Management program requires that the individuals responsible for the emergency operations receive annual training.  Newberry County is equipped with a HAZMAT team to assist the plant.  The plant will continue to update and review the emergency response program with all additional employees.\n\n8.  Changes to improve safety\nPioneer Frozen Foods is very grateful of their employees and stresses their safety.  For this reason new employees go through orientation prior to employment.  The plant has a full time safety director devoted to employee safety and human factor analysis."
