As part of this program, ADM\u2019s personnel are trained to take measures to mitigate accidental releases.  The Emergency Response Plan is coordinated with ADM personnel and the Memphis Fire Department such that, in the event of an accident, immediate emergency response measures can be implemented.  ADM works cooperatively with the surrounding community and the Memphis Fire Department to improve response capabilities. \nAs a result of the terminal\u2019s process hazard analysis review, ADM has implemented a procedure for locking the ethanol storage tank\u2019s discharge valve and implemented an interlock for the ethanol truck unload pumps.  ADM will continue evaluating options for improving processes and efficiencies in order to reduce the quantities of hazardous materials used and stored at its terminal."

In addition, ADM continually evaluates options at its facilities for replacing hazardous materials with less hazardous or non-hazardous materials.\nADM employs specific safety precautions in handling hazardous chemicals to reduce the threat to workers, members of the community and the environment.  ADM adheres to all applicable federal and state rules and regulations.  Safe operations are the result of the following: precautions used in handling hazardous chemicals, personnel training, and the engineering of inherent safety features in the design of equipment. \nEmergency response for the ADM Riverport terminal is coordinated with ADM personnel and the Memphis Fire Department.  The program includes procedures for notifying the appropriate personnel and agencies in the event of an accident involving a hazardous chemical.  \nThe facility is a bulk vegetable oil and ethanol storage terminal with a marine dock.  The regulated substance used at ADM\u2019s Riverport terminal is n-Pentane, a denaturant used in fuel ethanol.  Ethanol is received by truck, rail and barge and stored in two storage tanks.  \nThe key concepts in the Riverport prevention program are the elements including:  employee participation, process safety information, analysis of hazards, operating procedures and safe work practices, personnel training, contractor programs, pre-startup reviews, maintenance and mechanical integrity programs, hot work permit procedures, management of change procedures, incident investigations, emergency planning and response and compliance audits.  The ADM Riverport terminal has not experienced any accidents involving ethanol that have required reporting within the past 5 years.  Therefore, the terminal has not experienced a"
