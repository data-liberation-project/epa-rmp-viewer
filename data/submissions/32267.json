Facility accidental release and emergency response policy.\n\nThe management and employees of Lincoln Land FS, Inc. are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. The stationary source and the regulated substances handled.\n\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient.  Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel and authorized contractors.\n\nThe maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia that can be stored would be 371,000 pounds.\n\n3. Worst-Case Scenario/Alternative-Case Scenario: This facility has developed a worst-case and\nalternative-case scenario however it has been withheld from this Executive Summary as security-sensitive\ninformation as requested by EPA.\n\n4. The accidental release prevention program.\n\nThis facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations.  This facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc. as adopted by state regulation and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\".\n\n5. Five year accident history.  \n\n There has been one accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that:\n Caused property damage. The cause of the release was vandalism.The offsite property damage was to field corn. There were  no evacuations or injuries.\n\n6. The emergency response program.\n\nThe f"
