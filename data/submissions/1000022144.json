      "SummaryText": "Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policy\n\nThe Hammond Water Filtration Plant (HWFP) has an emergency response plan on file with the Lake County Emergency Planning Committee.  A copy of the response plan is at the plant, accessible to all employees.  The Fire Department has recently toured the water plant to familiarize themselves with the emergency procedures.\n\nThe HWFP stores and uses chlorine as disinfection in amounts that exceed the EPA's 40 CFR part 68 threshold limit of 2,500 pounds.  The plant does not store or use any other chemicals in excess of the limits set in the standard mentioned above.  The HWFP is covered by OSHA PSM.  All applicable OSHA documents are stored at the plant, these include confined space entry, lockout/tagout, emergency evacuation, and PPE programs and procedures.  \n\nDescription of the Hammond Water Filtration Plant\n\nThe HWFP has undergone improvements in the chlorine storage and feeding room during 2001.  The chlorine room was previously open to the rest of the facilities, after the improvements, the room is completely separated from the rest of the water filtration plant.  This improvement also included the installation of scrubbers and vents.  Part of the reason for these changes was the developments that started occurring nearby.  \n\nThe HWFP has a design capacity of 70 million gallons per day (mgd) with an average day demand of 40 mgd.  The plant includes processes such as coagulation, flocculation, sedimentation, filtration, and disinfection.  The plant also has a Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system that allows monitoring of all processes with preset alarms.  This system can detect any chlorine leaks or malfunctions in the chlorine room.  The controls are only set for manual shutoff.  \n\nThe chlorine room stores up to 10 one-ton tanks where normal operation occurs 24-hours a day.  An accident is most likely to happen during the changing of a chlorine tank.  No accidents have occurred at the HW"

      "SummaryText": "FP in the last five years.  In fact, the last accident reported occurred in 1987, approximately twenty-four years ago.  Chlorine is withdrawn as a liquid and is fed under vacuum to chlorinators where the liquid is transformed into a gas  state.  The vacuum system is a safety measure in that if a chlorine leak occurs, the air will be drawn into the piping preventing the chlorine gas from being released.\n\nWorst Case Release Scenarios and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nThe EPA's RMP*COMP model was used to determine the worst case and alternative release scenarios.  The model results in a distance from the origin where the chlorine concentration would no longer be a hazard.  The worst case scenario was assumed to be the release of an entire chlorine vessel in 10 minutes.  Therefore, since each chlorine vessel holds 2,000 lbs of chlorine, the release rate was assumed to be 200 lbs/min.  During this worst case analysis, no mitigation measures were assumed to allow for maximum release of chlorine.  In this scenario, the model resulted in a radius of 1.3 miles.  It should be noted that this scenario is unlikely to happen due to the high release rate that is needed.\n\nThe first alternative scenario assumes a hole in the liquid space of the tank.  The hole in the tank was assumed to have a radius of 1/8-inch with a height of liquid above the tank of 10 inches.  This scenario resulted in a radius of 0.2 miles with a release rate of 158 lbs/min.  For this scenario, it was assumed that mitigation measures were in place as this is more realistic.  As the chlorine tanks are constructed of steel on all sides, it is unlikely that the tanks be punctured during impact.  \n\nThe second alternative assumed a release from a pipe.  It was assumed that the pipe has a diameter of 1-inch with an operational pipe pressure of 22 psi (absolute) and a change in pipe elevation of negative 10 feet.  The model resulted in a release rate of 898 lbs/min with a distance of 0.4 miles.  This release rate i"

      "SummaryText": "s extremely high due to the operational pipe pressure.  As stated before, the majority  of pipes are in a vacuum system, therefore the pressure is below atmospheric pressure.  However, the modeling software does not allow a pressure below atmospheric as input.  This alternative is considered the most likely to happen alternative, but with a much lower release rate due to the vacuum system in place.  Pipe release may be due to either faulty parts or corrosion. The release rate would not be as high and the distance of toxic exposure would be less.  For conservative purposes, the distance of 0.4 miles was considered as valid.  \n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nThe HWFP operator is in charge of updating the Emergency Response Plan (ERP).  The update is performed on a regular basis.  One of the improvements that has been updated in the ERP is to better organize the plan to be more user-friendly.  Due to the extensiveness of the plan, in the previous version, the user had to first consult the table of contents to be able to find a particular section of the plan.  With the new version, the user is able to go directly to the section of interest without much lookup.  The employees are trained in emergency response actions and are updated with the latest revisions of the ERP.  An evacuation plan is posted in the facilities of the HWFP.  The first contact in case of an emergency is the Hammond Fire Department, then the Lake County Emergency Planning Commission and the City of Hammond.\n"
