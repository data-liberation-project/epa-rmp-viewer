The  pipeline  is  heat  traced  and\ninsulated. The cool incoming material is preheated in the line to\napproximately  110oF and further in the oleum  cooler  before  it\nflows into the oleum boiler by exchanging heat with hot, depleted\noleum.  Inside  the boiler, the oleum is heated  to  its  boiling\npoint  to  liberate sulfur trioxide which flows to  the  catalyst\nsulfation  calciner. Weak (10% to 15%) hot oleum  overflows  back\nthrough the oleum cooler, where it is cooled before being  pumped\nback to the make-up tank at the Tesoro chemical plant.\n\nOleum is a cloudy, oily, dense liquid. It is also referred to  as\nfuming sulfuric acid. Oleum is a solution of sulfur trioxide in\nconcentrated  sulfuric acid. Sulfur trioxide is  emitted  to  the\natmosphere upon release of oleum.

The intent for this\n       safeguard is to provide an intrinsically safe system to capture\n       and contain an oleum release. This safeguard was implemented in\n       1993 as part of the effort to comply with Uniform Fire Code 80\n       for hazardous materials.\n       \n       The pad is sloped to a drain designed to drain the contents\n       of the Oleum Boiler in about 1 1/2 minutes - Implemented in 1993\n      \n       Oleum is drained to a water-filled sump, where  oleum\n       combines  with water to form non-fuming sulfuric  acid  -\n       implemented in 1993\n       \n       Oleum is handled in magnetic drive pumps to eliminate seal\n       leakage - implemented in 1994 with continued improvements in 1998\n       for more reliable magnetic drive pumps\n       \n       All relief valves discharge into closed systems. The intent\n       is to prevent oleum spray outs through a flanged connection from\n       hydro - stat pressure condition and the two relief valves, one\n       for incoming and return, were installed in 1991.\n       \n\n\n1.4  FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere  have  been  no  accidental releases resulting  in  deaths,\nsignificant injuries, or significant property damage  onsite,  or\nresulting   in   offsite  deaths,  injuries,"
