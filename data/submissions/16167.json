              "Description": "What Henkel's Cincinnati plant does to prevent chemical release incidents!\n\nHenkel's Cincinnati plant uses safety systems and procedures to prevent accidents. The systems are reviewed regularly and, where needed, improved.\n\nAll equipment is constructed to State of Ohio and nationally recognized codes and designed to withstand the maximum pressure, temperature and corrosive nature of the contained chemical.  \n\nSpecial instruments continuously monitor process conditions, such as temperature and pressure, and automatically alarm if they go outside acceptable ranges.  Critical alarms trigger safety interlocks that shut down the process.   \n\nTo maintain the integrity of our equipment, verification checks are performed at frequencies recommended by the equipment manufacturers.  Equipment deficiencies are addressed immediately.\n\nQualified personnel complete a full, in-depth Process Hazards Analysis every five years as specified by OSHA regulations.  Recommendations are developed to further protect our employees, neighbors and local environment.\n\nOperating instructions have been written to detail how processes are safely started, operated and shut down.  These procedures are accuracy-certified each year, per OSHA regulations.\n\nAll operators, maintenance mechanics and contractors are trained and qualified to perform their job duties.\n\nEngineers, operators and mechanics jointly complete a final safety check prior to introducing hazardous chemicals into a new or modified process.\n\nManagement personnel must authorize all changes to the chemicals used, equipment, or operating conditions.  Potential safety and environmental impacts must be remedied before any change can take place.\n\nWork permits are necessary prior to working on equipment that last contained hazardous chemicals.  These permits are used to verify that the equipment has been properly prepared to prevent a chemical exposure or fire.\n\nOur entire site perimeter is fenced.   Guards are stationed at plant gates around the clock and also perform routine patrols of the facility.\n\nAll chemical release incidents are investigated and actions taken to prevent recurrence.\n\nTriennial audits are performed to insure the chemical release prevention program requirements are followed.",

      "SummaryText": "INTRODUCTION\n\nAt Henkel Corporation's Cincinnati, Ohio manufacturing plant, protection of employees, the public and the environment is considered to be the most important responsibility.  A key element of the plant's protection program is the development and implementation of plans to prevent accidental chemical releases.  In addition, if an accidental release should occur, plant personnel are prepared to respond in an organized and effective manner.  \n\nThe plant's accident prevention and emergency response programs have been developed in accordance with federal and state regulations, industry standards, and guidance from local emergency response organizations.    Although these programs have been highly successful - the plant has never had a significant chemical release - efforts are continually being made to improve them.  \n\nThe plant's Risk Management Program (RMP) plan was prepared to comply with federal regulatory requirements regarding the prevention of accidental chemical releases (40 CFR 68, Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions).  The purpose of the regulation is to reduce the potential for an accidental chemical release and strengthen emergency response planning at the facility and within the community.  The RMP plan describes the incidents that would have the most catastrophic effects (the \"worst-case release scenarios\") and several scenarios of lesser magnitude (\"alternative release scenarios\"). Although it is technically infeasible for the worst-case release scenarios described in this plan to occur, the information is provided to support conservative emergency response planning.  In this way, the community is well prepared to respond to incidents of lesser magnitude, which are more likely to occur.\n\nAreas that could be impacted by an accidental chemical release were identified using RMP*Comp (Ver 1.06), which was developed by U. S. EPA for accidental chemical release modeling.\n\nHENKEL CORPORATION\n\nHenkel Corporation, which is part of the worldwide He"

A variety of processes are operated at the plant to produce 370 different products derived from animal fat or vegetable oil.  The plant, originally constructed in 1885, is situated on 105 acres of land.  Of this, about 70 acres have been developed. Part of the plant is located in the City of Cincinnati and part is located in the City of St. Bernard.  The two parts are separated by the Mill Creek, a tributary of the Ohio River.  Fatty acids and fatty alcohols are the major products produced at the Cincinnati plant.  Glycerin, esters and surfactants are also produced.  These products are used in household and industrial cleaners, personal care products, biodegradable synthetic lubricants, adhesives, agricultural products, plasticizers, and other special applications.  \n\nThe plant is subject to numerous environmental, health and safety regulations and is regularly inspected by agency representatives.  The following activities are specifically regulated:\n\n7 Air emissions - permits issued by Ohio EPA,\n7 Wastewater - discharge permit issued by the Metropolitan Sewer District,\n7 Oil spill prevention - subject to OPA-90 regulations,\n7 Storm water - permit issued by Ohio EPA,\n7 Hazardous waste management - U. S. EPA ID# OHD093903235,\n7 Process safety - subject to OSHA Process Safety Management Rule,\n7 Emergency planning - subject to SARA 311/312 reporting, and\n7 Toxic chemical release reporting - subject to SARA 313 reporting (ID # 45232 HNKLC4900E).\n\nDESCRIPTION OF REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe Cincinnati plant handles two chemicals in sufficient quantities to be covered by the RMP regulations.

Hydrogen, which is regulated as a flammable substance, is used as a process ingredient in the Hydrogenation processes that are part of the Fatty Alcohol and Stearic Acid manufacturing operations.  All of these processes have been assigned to RMP Program Level 3.\n\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS \n\nFollowing U. S. EPA guidance, an offsite consequence analysis (OCA) was performed to determine the potential for an accidental release of a regulated substance to affect the public or the environment.  The OCA included both worst-case release scenarios (WCSs) and alternative release scenarios (ARSs).  Considering the design of the regulated processes and the plant's accident prevention programs, it is virtually impossible for the WCSs to occur.  Although it is highly unlikely that the ARSs would ever occur, the ARSs represent release scenarios that are at least somewhat feasible. \n\nThe main objective of the OCA was to determine the furthest distance (called the endpoint distance) at which certain conditions might exist as a result of an accidental chemical release.  Most people at the endpoint distance would be able to walk away from the exposure without any long-term health consequences, although some short-term consequences are possible.\n\nWORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIOS \n\nThe WCS for ammonia is a catastrophic failure of a high- pressure receiver, resulting in a release of 19,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia over a 10-minute period.  Even though numerous controls are in place to prevent such a release and to mitigate its impact, they were not taken into account in evaluating this accidental release scenario.  The maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 200 ppm (0.14 milligrams per liter) for this WCS is 1.7 miles.\n\nThe WCS for hydrogen is a catastrophic failure of the liquid hydrogen storage tank, resulting in the release and explosion of 11,000 pounds of hydrogen.

Since processes at the plant that are regulated under the RMP regulations are also subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nThe Cincinnati plant encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team.  Employees have access to all information created as part of the facility accident prevention program.  Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the plant and addresses each accident prevention program element.  In addition, the facility has a number of initiatives under way that address process safety and employee safety issues.  These initiatives include forming teams to promote both process and personal safety.  The teams typically have members from various areas of the plant, including operations, maintenance, engineering and plant management.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nThe Cincinnati plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.

The maximum distance to the endpoint (1 psi overpressure for a vapor cloud explosion) for this WCS is 0.2 miles.  \n\nThe facility has modern, redundant systems designed to prevent these scenarios from ever happening.  See the discussion below under \"GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM STEPS\" for details.\n\nALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS \n\nThe ARS for ammonia is a flange leak in a high pressure transfer line, resulting in a release of 9,500 pounds of liquid ammonia over 19 minutes.  The 19-minute release duration is the approximate time it would take for the liquid level in the system to drop below the level of the flange.  At that point, emergency response personnel could safely enter the area and close a manual valve to completely stop the leak.  Some of the liquid ammonia vaporizes before it can be washed with water into the plant's wastewater treatment facility.  No other mitigation measures were taken into account in evaluating this scenario.  The maximum distance to the endpoint of 200 ppm (0.14 milligrams per liter) for this ARS is 0.2 miles. \n\nThe ARS for hydrogen is a rupture of the liquid hydrogen delivery line, resulting in a release and explosion of 7,500 pounds of hydrogen.  No mitigation measures were taken into account in evaluating this scenario.  The maximum distance to endpoint for a vapor cloud explosion is 0.1 miles.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe Cincinnati plant has an excellent record of accident prevention.  The RMP regulations require companies to report all significant releases from regulated processes that occurred during the past five years.  The plant has not had any releases subject to reporting.

The plant ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\n\nThe plant also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  The information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, etc. This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nThe plant has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within the program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nThe plant primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations.

This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options being implemented in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the plant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least once every five years, and they will continue to be conducted at this frequency until the process is dismantled.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.  Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nThe plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as unit startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, normal shutdown, and initial startup of a new process.  These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.

New employees receive basic training in plant operations if they are not already familiar with such operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skill demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted at least every three years.  All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\nContractors\n\nThe plant uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.
