It is our policy to adhere to all federal, state, and local laws.  If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to notify the Fenton Fire Protection District Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency.  \n\n\n\nA description of the facility and the regulated substances handled: This facility is a finished product storage and distribution warehouse.  Finished product stored in the aerosol warehouse includes aerosol pesticide products with a composition of flammable propellants. Several types of flammable propellants are used in the pesticide aerosol can products, which include the following: NP-70 (propane/n-butane), Dimethyl Ether (DME), and Difluroethane (HFC 152A).  The quantity of packaged aerosol cans stored in the warehouse exceeds the RMP 10,000 lbs. threshold quantity for NP-70 (propane/n-butane), Dimethyl Ether (DME), and Difluroethane (HFC 152A).  The Difluroethane (HFC 152A)/Dimethyl Ether mixture is chosen as a representative sample since it is the worst-case impact for a single container (can).  The RMP modeling is based upon a vapor cloud explosion scenario with an equal mixture of Difluroethane (HFC 152A)/Dimethyl Ether.\n\n\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps:  This facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule and all applicable state and local codes and regulations for storage of aerosol products.  The warehouse facility complies with the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) Code 30B Manufacture and Storage of Aerosol Products (2015). \n\n\n\nFive-year accident history:  The Fenton warehouse is a new storage location beginning in December 2021.  There is no five-year accident "

We have discussed this policy with the fire department and they are aware of their responsibility.  In addition, the storage of threshold quantities of flammable aerosols has been communicated to the St. Louis County LEPC.\n\n\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety:  None. Facility is new construction in 2021 and safety systems were approved by St. Louis County and and Fenton Fire Marshal.\n\n"
