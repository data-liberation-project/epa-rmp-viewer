      "SummaryText": "In order to provide a safe working environment for the employees of Newport M.U.D., we have set up a risk management program.  A safety program is also in place to insure that all employees are well informed and educated about plant safety and accidental releases.  The primary activity at the sewage treatment plant is to remove solids from the waste water and provide disinfection to the effluent prior to discharging it into the receiving stream.  Disinfection is accomplished by adding chlorine to the water in the chlorine contact chambers.  The chlorine gas is stored in one ton cylinders in an outside area with a roof only.  There are now a total of two cylinders on site with a total capacity of 2,400 lbs.  The worst case scenario would be a release from the two active cylinders due to a chlorinator or manifold failure.  This is unlikely because the chlorine system is inspected daily and any indication of a possible release would be immediately taken care of.  In the event of a release, the operator on duty would notify the Crosby Fire Department, Harris County Sheriff's Department, and the emergency contact specified in the Emergency Response Plan.  Residents, schools, etc. would also be notified and evacuated if needed.  Personnel attend periodic safety meetings, schools/seminars, and participate in drills in order to facilitate emergency response and minimize the duration of an accidental release.  There has not been a chlorine release in the past five years at the waste water treatment plant."
