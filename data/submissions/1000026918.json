We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public as well as protection of the environment.  This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented,including:\n\n\n\n* A description of our facility and use of substances regulated by EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP)\n\nregulation\n\n* An overview of our accidental release prevention programs\n\n* A five-year accident history for accidental releases of chemicals regulated by EPA's RMP rule\n\n* An overview of our emergency response program\n\n* The certifications that EPA's RMP rule requires us to provide\n\n* The detailed information (called data elements) about our risk management program\n\n\n\nConsistent with the User Manual for the RMP filing system, this Executive Summary provides only a summary overview of the RMP program at the Oyster Creek Plant, and is not intended as a comprehensive listing of all relevant program elements.\n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES:\n\n\n\nOur facility produces polypropylene using a variety of chemicals and unit operations. The process utilizes the regulated flammable substance propylene along with catalysts, hydrogen and ethylene as feedstocks. The process contains the RMP-regulated substance propylene and propane above the threshold quantity in storage vessels and reactors, columns, tanks and piping within the unit.  Propane is mixed with propylene as an impurity; however, when calculated separately both are above the threshold quantities. The process also utilizes titanium tetrachloride in quantities well below the RMP threshold quanti"

The primary accident release and prevention program at the Braskem Oyster Creek Plant is Process Safety Management (PSM).  The PSM program at the plant is designed to constitute a fully comprehensive program for the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous chemicals. We take a systematic, proactive approach to preventing accidental releases of hazardous chemicals. Our management systems address each of the key features of successful prevention programs including:\n\n\n\n* Process safety information\n\n* Process hazard analysis (PHA)\n\n* Operating procedures\n\n* Training\n\n* Mechanical integrity\n\n* Management of change\n\n* Pre-startup safety review\n\n* Compliance audits\n\n* Incident investigation\n\n? Employee participation\n\n* Hot work permit\n\n* Contractor standards and oversight\n\n\n\nWe actively encourage participation from all employees in every aspect of process safety management. Process safety information is readily available to all employees concerning chemicals used, process technology and equipment design. Employees participate in PHA revalidation studies and PHA studies required by our Management of Change Program. Procedures are established and implemented to provide information to employees relative to safe and effective job performance. Employee suggestions for improvement are encouraged. Experienced employees are involved in training. Employees and contractors are trained and are included in the investigation of incidents and accidents.\n\nAs prescribed by our Management of Change policy, Pre-Startup Safety Reviews enhance the safety of both startup and continued operation of new installations or modifications. Our Mechanical Integrity Program includes written "

The Oyster Creek Plant's Hot Work Permit policy is strictly enforced to ensure that hot work in potentially dangerous areas does not occur.\n\n\n\nThese individual elements of our prevention program are designed to work together in the prevention of accidental chemical releases. Our company and our employees are committed to the standard that these management systems set for the way we do business, and we have specific accountabilities and controls to ensure that we are meeting our own high standards for accident prevention.\n\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\n\n\n\nWe keep records for all significant accidental chemical releases that occur at our facility.  Braskem acquired the relevant process operation from The Dow Chemical Company, effective July 27, 2011.  Therefore, with respect to actions, evaluations and other information relevant to risk managing planning (RMP) for the process unit, any such activity performed or occurring prior to July 27, 2011 did not occur during the period of Braskem ownership.\n\nBased on information available to Braskem, during the past five years, there have been no releases of propylene or other chemicals at the Oyster Creek Plant that have had an adverse impact on employees, the community, or the environment. \n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM:\n\n\n\nWe maintain an emergency response plan which provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations. Furthermore, we coordinate our plan with I-park owner, The Dow Chemical Company Texas Operations, and community emergency response plans (LEPC). We would utilize the CAER hotline to alert the community in the event of danger.\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nBraskem plans to pursue recognition of the plant as a VPP STAR site as Braskem America (formerly VPP STAR certified with The Dow Chemical Company)\n\n\n\nRelative to Braskem's dev"

Therefore, with respect to actions, evaluations and other information relevant to RMP for the process unit, any such activity performed or occurring prior to July 27, 2011 did not occur during the period of Braskem ownership.  Nonetheless, to the extent that the prior owner of the process operation conducted any relevant evaluation, including a process hazard assessment, with respect to the process, Braskem regards such evaluation as continuing to be applicable to the process operation, since the equipment and process activities have (for purposes relevant to RMP) been retained in all material respects since the date of Braskem's initial ownership.  Therefore, in providing within this electronic submittal information responsive to specific inquiries regarding prior dates on which certain relevant events occurred, Braskem identifies, where appropriate, the date of such event even if prior to Braskem's initial ownership to the extent that such event or activity remains relevant for RMP purposes to Braskem's on-going operation of the regulated process."
