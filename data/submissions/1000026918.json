The primary accident release and prevention program at the Braskem Oyster Creek Plant is Process Safety Management (PSM).  The PSM program at the plant is designed to constitute a fully comprehensive program for the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous chemicals. We take a systematic, proactive approach to preventing accidental releases of hazardous chemicals. Our management systems address each of the key features of successful prevention programs including:\r\n\r\n* Process safety information\r\n* Process hazard analysis (PHA)\r\n* Operating procedures\r\n* Training\r\n* Mechanical integrity\r\n* Management of change\r\n* Pre-startup safety review\r\n* Compliance audits\r\n* Incident investigation\r\n\u00bf Employee participation\r\n* Hot work permit\r\n* Contractor standards and oversight\r\n\r\nWe actively encourage participation from all employees in every aspect of process safety management. Process safety information is readily available to all employees concerning chemicals used, process technology and equipment design. Employees participate in PHA revalidation studies and PHA studies required by our Management of Change Program. Procedures are established and implemented to provide information to employees relative to safe and effective job performance. Employee suggestions for improvement are encouraged. Experienced employees are involved in training. Employees and contractors are trained and are included in the investigation of incidents and accidents.\r\nAs prescribed by our Management of Change policy, Pre-Startup Safety Reviews enhance the safety of both startup and continued operation of new installations or modifications. Our Mechanical Integrity Program includes written"

The Oyster Creek Plant's Hot Work Permit policy is strictly enforced to ensure that hot work in potentially dangerous areas does not occur.\r\n\r\nThese individual elements of our prevention program are designed to work together in the prevention of accidental chemical releases. Our company and our employees are committed to the standard that these management systems set for the way we do business, and we have specific accountabilities and controls to ensure that we are meeting our own high standards for accident prevention.\r\n\r\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\r\n\r\nWe keep records for all significant accidental chemical releases that occur at our facility.  Braskem acquired the relevant process operation from The Dow Chemical Company, effective July 27, 2011.  Therefore, with respect to actions, evaluations and other information relevant to risk managing planning (RMP) for the process unit, any such activity performed or occurring prior to July 27, 2011 did not occur during the period of Braskem ownership.\r\nBased on information available to Braskem, during the past five years, there have been no releases of propylene or other chemicals at the Oyster Creek Plant that have had an adverse impact on employees, the community, or the environment. \r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM:\r\n\r\nWe maintain an emergency response plan which provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations. Furthermore, we coordinate our plan with I-park owner, The Dow Chemical Company Texas Operations, and community emergency response plans (LEPC). We would utilize the CAER hotline to alert the community in the event of danger.\r\n\r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\nBraskem plans to pursue recognition of the plant as a VPP STAR site as Braskem America (formerly VPP STAR certified with The Dow Chemical Company)\r\n\r\nRelative to Braskem's dev"

Therefore, in providing within this electronic submittal information responsive to specific inquiries regarding prior dates on which certain relevant events occurred, Braskem identifies, where appropriate, the date of such event even if prior to Braskem's initial ownership to the extent that such event or activity remains relevant for RMP purposes to Braskem's on-going operation of the regulated process."
