Facility staff works closely with other city and county agencies to coordinate safety and emergency response training activities.\n\nThe WPCP utilizes chlorine (CAS No. 7664-41-7) in its wastewater treatment process during the warm weather months of April through October.  Chlorine is received in a 55-ton or 90-ton railcar and stored in two 10,200-gallon storage tanks.  One railcar is delivered inside a locked fenced area around a rail siding located south of the facility parking lot.  Liquid chlorine is transferred in compliance with U.S. Department of Transportation regulations from the railcar to the storage tanks through an underground pipeline as the pressure differential between the railcar and storage tanks allows.  Dry, oil-free, compressed air is used to empty the railcar of residual liquid chlorine.  The two chlorine storage tanks are located indoors and are connected to the chlorination system.  Chlorine sensors continuously monitor the air in the rooms where chlorine is used and stored.  If more than 5 ppm of chlorine is detected, an alarm sounds alerting facility personnel of a possible leak.\n\nThe WPCP has safely operated the present chlorine process, without incident, since it was installed in 1969.  The facility is continually evaluating ways to improve the safety of this chlorine system.  Two new chlorinators were installed in November 1999, to replace two older units.  The two indoor, chlorine storage tanks were emptied and thoroughly inspected, tested, and recertified in January 2001.  A new hypochlorite system has been designed to replace the present chlorine system.  It is anticipated the new hypochlorite system will be installed within the next five years, as part of a planned plant expansion. \n\nThe facility is covered by the Allen County L"
