All applicable procedures of the Cal/ARP Program are adhered to. DCIV's emergency response policy involves the preparation of response plans which are tailored to the facility and to the emergency response services available in the community.\n\nDCIV stores dry fertilizer and pesticides and stores and blends liquid fertilizer for sale and application to farmland. The facility stores the following quantities of regulated substances:\n?Anhydrous Ammonia - 290,285 pounds\n?Aldicarb (Thimet 15G) - 1,364 pounds\n?Carbofuran (Furadan 4F) - 405 pounds\n?Dimethoate (Dimethoate E267) - 6,983 pounds\n?Disulfoton (Di-Syston 8 and 15G) - 1,728 pounds\n?Endosulfan (Endosulfan 3EC,Endosulfan 50WSB) - 721 pounds\n?Formetanate hydrochloride (Carzol) - 2,070 pounds\n?Methidathion (Supracide 2E) - 1,640 pounds\n?Methomyl (Lannate SP) - 2,160 pounds\n?Oxamyl (Vydate LV) - 470 pounds\n?Paraquat dichloride (Gramoxone Extra) - 622 pounds\n?Phorate (Thimet 20G) - 584 pounds\n\nAtmospheric dispersion modeling has to be performed to determine the distance traveled by the toxic substance released before its concentration decreases to the \"toxic endpoint\" selected by the EPA (0.14 mg/L for anhydrous ammonia; 0.0003 mg/L for aldicarb; 0.00043 for carbofuran; 0.03 mg/L for dimethoate; 0.002 mg/L for disulfoton; 0.0008 mg/L for endosulfan; 0.018 mg/L for formentanate hydrochloride; 0.02 mg/L for methidathion; 0.01 mg/L methomyl; 0.0017 mg/L for oxamyl; 0.0001 mg/L for paraquat dichloride and 0.0001 mg/L for phorate).

Because the anhydrous ammonia storage is in proximity of each other, the total amount of anhydrous ammonia that potentially could be released would amass to approximately 290,285 pounds (lbs). The offsite consequence analysis for this scenario was performed for the following set of conditions.\n\nWhen atmospheric dispersion modeling for the worst case scenarios were performed using the EPA assumptions, a distance to toxic endpoint of 4.9 miles and an estimate of population potentially affected of 47,500 persons were obtained for the release scenario. \n\nThe alternative release scenario involved the release of each toxic substance stored at the facility. The amount of aldicarb released was predicted to be 1,364 lbs and the distance to toxic endpoint was 1.8 miles. The amount of anhydrous ammonia released was predicted to be 128,900 lbs and the distance to toxic endpoint was 0.72 miles. The amount of carbofuran released was predicted to be 405 lbs and the distance to toxic endpoint was 0.73 miles. The amount of dimethoate released was predicted to be 6,983 lbs and the distance to toxic endpoint was 0.35 miles. The amount of disulfoton released was predicted to be 1,728 lbs and the distance to toxic endpoint was 0.71 miles. The amount of endosulfan released was predicted to be 721 lbs and the distance to toxic endpoint was 0.71 miles.
