If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to notify the Three Tribes Fire Management and request that they respond to the emergency.\r\n\r\n3.2  Description of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\r\n\r\nBFX Midstream, LLC (BFX) owns and operates a portable refrigeration type gas dew point control and liquids recovery skid designed to recover hydrocarbon liquids from produced gas prior to gathering and final treatment for WPX Energy, Inc. (WPX) at the Etstatis Pad. The system is designed to remove liquids from gas at the wellhead.  The refrigeration system can operate at subzero temperatures. BFX uses this system to remove liquids from produced gas prior to flaring. Four LPG portable storage tanks will be used for liquid products storage. Each has a maximum capacity of 18,000 gallons. BFX limits the maximum fill to 80% of the tank volume or 14,400 gallons each which is equivalent 82,224 lbs. of flammable liquids. The worst-case scenario would be that all the tanks exploded and the total pounds of flammable liquids used for the analysis is 328,896 lbs.\r\n\r\n3.3  Worst-Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s)\r\n\r\nThe LPG storage tanks are the largest process at 14,400 gallons each. Should a spill occur, all of 57,600 gallons from the four tanks of LPG is assumed to be released in the worst-case release scenario. Per 40 CFR 68.25 (1), for regulated flammable gases handled as liquids under pressure the total quantity in the vessel is assumed to be released as a gas over a 10-minute period resulting in a vapor cloud explosion. The resulting distance to the endpoint extends offsite, and public receptors are within the distance to the endpoint. The"

The system is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with ASTM standards.\r\n\r\n3.4.1  Management System\r\n\r\nWPX and BFX have developed a simplified management system to plan, organize, implement and control the risk management program elements. The management system activities are further discussed below.\r\n\r\nPlanning - The HRG Pad has an overall risk management program policy that clearly identifies the goals and objectives of the risk management program.\r\n\r\nOrganizing - BFX is responsible for ensuring that written procedures for each risk management program element are developed to meet identified goals and objectives. BFX and their operators hold meetings for the purpose of integrating and coordinating each risk management program element.\r\n\r\nImplementing - BFX provides training to all operators regarding initiating the process elements, implementing the process elements, and documenting the elements during the meetings. Personnel are provided with initial training on the applicable risk management procedures. Refresher training is provided on an as-needed basis but is conducted at a minimum following any changes to the program elements or"
