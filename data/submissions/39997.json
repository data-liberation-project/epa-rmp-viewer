The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released. The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first-aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post incident cleanup and decontamination requirements. In addition, the refinery has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment, as well as instructions that address the use of emergency response equipment. Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties. The emergency response program is updated when necessary, based on modifications made to refinery processes or other refinery facilities.\n\nThe overall emergency response program for the Cherry Point Refinery is coordinated with the Whatcom County Local Emergency Planning Committee. This coordination includes periodic meetings of the committee, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials, and industry representatives. The refinery has emergency response organizations. This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to emergency drills that involve the emergency response organizations.\n\nPREVIOUSLY PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThe ammonia tank was replaced with an improved, smaller tank.

This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.. However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe BP Cherry Point Refinery, located in Blaine, WA, operates a variety of processes to produce petroleum products from crude oil. The refinery has several regulated flammables: isobutane, pentane, propane and flammable mixtures. In addition, the refinery uses ammonia, which is a regulated toxic substance. Other toxic substances common to refineries were evaluated. Hydrogen sulfide, sulfur dioxide and mercaptans do not exceed their respective T/Qs and therefore are not reported. The regulated processes consist of the following units:\n\nCrude/Vacuum Unit\n\nThe Crude/Vacuum Unit consists of two processes. The Crude Unit is the initial process unit in the refinery. It is designed to take raw crude oil, remove salt and sediment, then heat and fractionate the crude into finished and intermediate products. The Vacuum Unit is designed to process crude tower bottoms in the vacuum diesel fractionator (VDF) tower and the vacuum tower. Negative pressure, a vacuum, is required to fractionate this heavy material without forming coke. The Crude Unit is Program 3 because of regulated flammable mixtures.\n\n#1 Reformer/Naphtha HDS Unit\n\nThe #1 Reformer/Naphtha HDS Unit consists of two processes. The purpose of the #1 Reformer/Naphtha HDS Unit is to convert the low octane gasoline feed fractions from the Naphtha HDS and Hydrocracker units into a stabilized high octane blending"

Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis performed at Cherry Point will be either HAZOPs (hazard and operability studies) or What If-Checklist studies. The HAZOP and What If-Checklist processes are based on the principle that a team approach to hazard analysis will identify more problems than when individuals work separately and combine results. The PHA team consists of individuals with varying backgrounds and expertise who are brought together and, through collective brainstorming, thoroughly review the hazards of the process.\n\nThe team's findings are forwarded to local management for resolution. Implementation of mitigation options are tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each finding is documented, tracked to completion and retained.\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the refinery periodically updates ands revalidates the hazard analysis results. These periodic reviews are conducted every five years. The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.\n\nOPERATING PROCEDURES\n\nThe Cherry Point Refinery maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process. These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.

New employees receive basic training in refinery operations. After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks. After operators demonstrate having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently. In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level. This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years. All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training. A modern, up-to-date, fully programmable computer-driven simulator is also available for Crude Unit emplyees to practice unit operation. The simulator is fully functional and can duplicate all unit characteristics. The display panels, which are identical to those used in our control room are realistic. The simulator can also be used to simulate proposed changes to determine whether safety parameters could be violated.\n\nCONTRACTORS\n\nThe Cherry Point Refinery uses contractors to supplement its work force during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities. Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the refinery has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow the site safety rules, and (6) inform refinery personnel of any hazards that"

In addition, the refinery evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor. Refinery personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\nPRE-STARTUP REVIEWS\n\nThe Cherry Point Refinery conducts a process startup safety review for any new facility or facility modifications that require a change in the process safety information. The purpose of the safety review is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and the equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment in service. This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all-supporting systems are operationally ready. A safety review involves field verificationof the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\n\nMECHANICAL INTEGRITY\n\nThe refinery has well established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition.  The basic aspects of this program include: (1) conducting training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting identified deficiencies, and (5) applying quality assurance measures.

If a deficiency is identified, employees correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service, or a team will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment.\n\nAnother integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance. The Cherry Point Refinery incorporates quality assurance measues into equipment purchases and repairs. This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.\n\nSAFE WORK PRACTICES\n\nThe Cherry Point Refinery has long-standing safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety. Examples of these include: (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) a procedure for safe removal of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (4) a permit and procedure to control \"hot work\" activities, and (5) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space. These procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\n\nMANAGEMENT OF CHANGE\n\nThe Cherry Point Refinery has a comprehensive system to manage changes to the process. This system  requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology, procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented.

Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures are updated to incorporate these changes. In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training for the change.\n\nINCIDENT INVESTIGATION\n\nThe refinery promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury. The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident. The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a reoccurence, and forwards these results to refinery management for resolution. Corrective action taken in response to the investigation teams' findings and recommendations are tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees who could be affected by the findings. Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years so that the reports can be reviewed during future PHAs and PHA revalidations.\n\nCOMPLIANCE AUDITS\n\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, the refinery periodically conducts an audit to determine whether procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented. Compliance audits are conducted at least every 3 years. Both hourly and management personnel participate as audit team members.
