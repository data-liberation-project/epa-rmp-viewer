The District encompasses approximately 15,695 acres and is located in an area with residential, commercial, and recreational areas.  The Steiner Ranch Wastewater Treatment Plant has a service area of approximately 6000 acres and serves approximately 15,000 people.  Parts of the District's service area are located within the jurisdiction of the City of Austin, the City of Lakeway, and the City of Bee Cave.\r\n\r\nThe Steiner Ranch Wastewater Treatment Plant is located in the Steiner Ranch sub-division near Lake Austin in Austin, TX. This wastewater treatment plant uses chlorine gas as a disinfectant.  The chlorine is stored on-site in ton cylinders.  The maximum supply stored on-site is approximately 8,000 pounds.  \r\n\r\nThe process system consists of four (4) one-ton stainless steel cylinders and an all vacuum feed / injection system.  The chlorine feed/injection equipment is located in a small storage building adjacent to the storage structure which houses the ton cylinders. Two (2) of the four (4) one-ton cylinders are kept in service during normal operation and two are used as spare.  A chlorine leak detector, set to 1 ppm, has four (4) remote sensors mounted approximately 1-inch above the floor and is connected to an audible alarm system that also pages the operator in the event of an emergency.  Of the four (4) remote sensors, one (1) is located in the chlorine-feed building, while the remaining three (3) are mounted around the one-ton cylinder storage structure. The chlorine system is monitored during the week several times a day by an on-site operator and is monitored daily on the weekends.  Preventative maintenance is performed regularly with the equipment serviced annually regardless of condition.\r\n\r\nField personnel and the general mana"

This training includes hands on experience with SCBA, Level A suits, and liquid and gas identification.  Emergency equipment is maintained on-site.\r\n\r\nTravis County WC&ID No. 17 has developed an Emergency Response Plan, which is maintained on-site at the Steiner Ranch Wastewater Treatment Plant Office. A copy of the Emergency Response Plan is also kept at WC&ID No. 17's main office located approximately 5 minutes from the wastewater plant.  In the event of an accidental release of chlorine gas, emergency response will be coordinated with Travis County Emergency Service District No. 6.  Travis County ESD No. 6 is located approximately 5 minutes from the wastewater treatment plant and the Lakeway Regional Medical Center is located approximately 15 minutes from the plant.  There have been no reportable accidental releases of chlorine gas in the past fifteen years."
