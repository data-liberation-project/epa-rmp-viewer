Accidental Release Prevention & Emergency Response Policies:\nThe PPG Aurora Distribution Center complies with applicable Illinois and US EPA regulations, Department of Transportation and OSHA requirements for the storage, handling and shipping of flammable aerosol containers.  PPG also follows applicable Coatings Care (registered service trademark) Codes of Management Practices including community Awareness code of Management Practices, and PPG?s own Community Awareness and Emergency response (CAER) Policy to assure emergency preparedness and foster community right-to-know.  PPG Aurora also trains employees in accident prevention, hazard communication, emergency response, safe material handling procedures and fork truck driving safety.  All of these activities form an integral part of PPG's overall Environmental, Health and Safety policy to distribute products in a responsible manner that protects employees, neighbors, customers and the environment.\n\nII. Regulated Substances Handled on Site:\nThe PPG Aurora Distribution Center is a part of the Architectural Finishes business unit.  The facility stores paint related products in aerosol containers, of various sizes, for distribution to dealers of PPG owned stores and home centers throughout the United States.  Some of the aerosols contain propane, butane, isobutene and methyl ether, which are used as propellants.  These four materials are regulated as flammable substances under the EPA RMP regulations.\n\nIII. Worst-Case Release Scenario:\nWorst-case analysis consisted of a 1lb release resulting in a vapor cloud of 0.01 miles (53 ft).  The flammable aerosols are stored within the facility in a designated storage area; therefore the vapor cloud would be contained within the facility walls.\n\nIV. General Accidental Release Prevention and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps:\nThe Aurora Distribution Center complies with OSHA PSM and EPA RMP regulations for the safe stor"

Under the RMP regulations the Aurora facility?s aerosol storage process is classified as a Program Level 1 because the worst-case scenario does not result in off-site impacts and there have been no accidental releases in the past five years that meet the RMP criteria. \n \n\nV. Five Year Accident History:\nThe Aurora Distribution Center is operating in a newly constructed facility.  PPG will begin utilizing the facility to store aerosols as of January 22, 2007.  Should an incident occur it shall be reported, investigated and documented accordingly under the RMP regulations.\n\nVI. Emergency Response Procedures:\nPPG Aurora Distribution Center coordinates emergency response activities with the local fire department.  Additionally, the facility periodically reviews and trains employees on the written emergency response plan and evacuation procedures.\n\nVII. Planned Changes to Improve Safety:\nPrevention programs utilized at the Aurora Distribution Center include a fire prevention plan, aerosol storage operating procedure, equipment inspections, fire suppression systems, inventory and storage controls and employee training as a result a PHA completed under OSHA PSM regulations.  These systems and safe guards are periodically assessed for effectiveness, at least every 5 years under OSHA PSM regulations."
