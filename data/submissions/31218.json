Toluene Diisocyanate (TDI), which is\r\nregulated by EPA's risk management program rule, is one of the\r\nreactants required to manufacture polyurethane foam.  TDI is\r\nreceived at the plant by tanker truck.  It is stored in 2 tanks\r\nlocated in the contained bulk storage tank room.

In particular, equation D-1\r\nof that guidance document was used to estimate pool evaporation\r\nrates based upon information published by the National Institute\r\nof Standards.  A table using this technique was developed and\r\nthe specific distances extrapolated from that table. \r\nMeteorological conditions of 1.5 mph and 96 degrees F at 72%\r\nrelative humidity were used.
