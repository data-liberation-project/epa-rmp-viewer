Wherever possible refrigeration system components are located in areas that are not as likely to become damaged (i.e., tanks and pipe runs are placed away from and protected from forklift and truck traffic). The facility maintains an ongoing emergency response program that prepares for safe evacuation and timely response by trained personnel.\n\n\n\n2.0 SEFF Miami and Anhydrous Ammonia.\n\n\n\nApproximately 17,724 lbs. of anhydrous ammonia is contained within the SEFF Miami refrigeration system. A Risk Management Plan has been developed as required, and is maintained in order to reduce the possibility of an accidental release of ammonia from the system. \n\n\n\n3.0  Accidental Release Prevention Program and Prevention Steps.\n\n\n\nSEFF Miami complies with all rules and regulations that pertain to the safe storage and use of anhydrous ammonia. Specific regulations include: OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) rule; OSHA Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response (HAZWOPER); OSHA Hazard Communication (HAZCOM); OSHA Employee Emergency Plans and Fire Prevention Plans; EPA Risk Management Plans (RMP). \n\n\n\nSpecific prevention steps have been implemented to increase the safety of operation of the ammonia refrigeration system. Specifically, an emergency shut down push button has been installed outside of the engine room, enabling remote shutdown of the ammonia refrigeration system. The ammonia system is inspected daily, and all refrigeration service valves have identification tags. Twenty-four hour Hazardous Materials Technician/Incident Commander Training has been completed for all facility managers, maintenance personnel, and refrigeration technicians.

The program includes initial and annual refresher training for employees who respond to toxic chemical releases or potential releases. It also includes written procedures for proper first aid and emergency medical treatment to treat human exposures. Procedures for using emergency response equipment, and procedures to review/update the emergency response plan are also developed. The facility emergency response plan is coordinated with the local fire department as required by the Emergency Planning and Community Right to Know Act.\n\n\n\nDuring normal workday operation, the facility emergency response plan consists of employee notification (public address system) and evacuation, followed by notification of the Miami Fire & Rescue Department, Norland Station #38, 575 NW 199th St., by dialing 9-1-1.\n\n\n\n5.1  With continued refrigeration preventive maintenance and improvements this will significantly reduce the possibility of any major release. \n\n\n\n6.0  Planned Changes to Improve Safety at SEFF Miami.\n\n\n\nPlans that have been implemented to improve anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system safety at the SEFF Miami facility and consists of the following engineering and administrative controls: \n\n1.
