Hydrogen, in the amounts handled by our facility, exceeds the threshold quantity set by EPA.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and state rules and regulations.  Air Products manages the safety of the regulated processes by means of operating procedures, equipment testing and inspections, safety devices (e.g., alarms, shutdowns, instrumentation, relief devices) inherent in the design of this facility and other controls and systems designed to prevent accidental release of hazardous chemicals.  Safe work practices and training of our personnel supplement the inherent safe design of the plant.\n\nOur emergency response program is based upon OSHA's HAZWOPER regulation.  The emergency response plan includes procedures for the notification of the local fire authority and Hazardous Materials unit so that appropriate measures can be taken by local responders to control accidental releases.\n\nThis document has been prepared in accordance with the EPA's Risk Management Plan regulation (40 CFR, Part 68).  The substances and processes considered during the preparation of this RMP and the scenarios described were selected based on criteria established in the regulation.\n\n2.  The stationary source and regulated substances handled:\n\nThe primary purpose of this facility is to manufacture hydrogen gas.   Hydrogen is used by our customer in their manufacturing process.  Natural gas (predominantly methane) is received by our plant via pipeline and used as our feedstock.  The feedstock is compressed, mixed with steam, and sent to the reformer furnace.  In the reformer furnace, the feedstock and steam are heated in the presence of a catalyst to approximately 1550 degrees F, where a chemical reaction takes place that converts the mixture into hydrogen, carbon monoxide, and carbon dioxide.  The carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide are then separated from t"

The pure hydrogen is then delivered to the customer via pipeline.  Backup is provided by a liquid hydrogen storage system.\n\nThe liquid hydrogen storage system consists of one 70,000 gallon tank and a bank of ambient air vaporizers.  The liquid hydrogen is delivered by tank truck.  Vaporized liquid hydrogen is used to provide the customer's needs when the hydrogen plant is not operating for an extended period of time.\n\nThe regulated process at this facility is the hydrogen production (reformer) plant and the backup systems.  Hydrogen is the only regulated substance handled at this facility in an amount exceeding the threshold quantity.  The combined maximum amount of hydrogen and hydrogen-containing flammable mixtures at this facility is 44,260 pounds.\n\n3.  The general accidental release prevention program and specific prevention steps:\n\nThe facility developed prevention program elements based on the Federal EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Plan and OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation.  This facility was designed and constructed to comply with applicable state and industry codes.\n\n4.  Five-year accident history:\n\nThe liquid hydrogen tank was installed in April of 1967.  The hydrogen plant and gas storage system were brough on-line in 1967.  In the last five years there have been no accidents involving, or accidental releases of, flammable gas that resulted in any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site; or known off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n5.  The emergency response program:\n\nThe facility's emergency response program is based upon OSHA's HAZWOPER standard.  At this site, employees are trained to recognize emergencies and initiate emergency response with outside agencies.  They have been trained to OSHA's First Responder Awareness Level.  The "

Emergency response activities have also been coordinated with the Lyndora Fire Department for fires related to the flammable process.  Periodic drills are conducted to review the effectiveness of our emergency procedures.\n\n6.  Planned changed to improve safety:\n\nThe facility resolves findings from PHA's and Near Miss incidents, some of which result in modifications to the plant design and operating procedures."
