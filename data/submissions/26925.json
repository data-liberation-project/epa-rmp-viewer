              "Description": "An accidental release prevention program is in place to minimize the risk of hazardous chemical releases in accordance with the EPA Risk Management Program requirements (40CFR 68).  This prevention program covers those processes that handle regulated substances above the threshold amount.  The prevention program provides a structured approach to preventing accidents.  Some of the specific activities in the prevention program include: Process safety information is accessible at all times.  A hazards review was conducted as part of preparations for RMP compliance.  Written operating procedures are used for training and guiding the work of operations.  Training is provided to all employees that operate the system.  A program is in place to maintain the system and equipment.  Incidients are investigated and actions taken as a part of continuous improvement efforts.  Routine audits are conducted to assure safe practices are being followed.  In the unlikely event of a spill or release involving a hazardous material, an emergency response plan providing procedures to be followed to minimize the potential impacts of a release or spill has been developed.",
