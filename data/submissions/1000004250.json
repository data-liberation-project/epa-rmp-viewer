The Facility Policy\n\nThe owners, management, and employees of  the FARMERS COOP ELEVATOR ASSN. OF LEVELLAND, TX are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire company, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information\n\nA? The primary activity at the facility is the storage of fertilizers for sale to farmers.\nA? Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for both direct application of fertilizers for crop production nutrients.\nA? The maximum quantity stored would be 131,325 pounds in our one 30,000 gallon storage tank.  Due to the RMP Submit Program rounding requirements the 131,325 is rounded to 130,000.\n\n3. The worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario.\n\nA. The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be  131,325 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards.  Due to the rounding requrement of the RMP Submit progrram the 131,325 is rounded to 130,000.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 2.4 miles.\nB. The alternative release scenario based on the most l"
