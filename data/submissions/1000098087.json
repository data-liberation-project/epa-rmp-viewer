The facility has an ammonia refrigeration system that provides refrigeration capacity to seven (7) refrigerated rooms.\r\n\r\n1.2.2 Facility Location\r\n\r\nWawona Frozen Foods is located at 1265 N Minnewawa Ave, Clovis, CA 93619. The latitude and longitude of the high pressure receiver is 36.854449, -119.707924. The facility is located approximately 1 miles north of state highway 168 in a rural area surrounded primarily by civilian housing and educational centers (Buchanan High School and Alta Sierra Intermediate School).\r\n\r\nAccording to FEMA Flood Map Service, the facility is located in an area of minimal flood hazard.\r\n\r\nWawona Frozen Foods is not located in an Alquist-Priolo Fault Zone as defined by the California Department of Conservation. In addition, a review of United States Geological Survey (USGS) fault maps revealed that there are no faults in close proximity to the site. The USGS 2018 One-Year Model revealed that Wawona Frozen Foods has a 1-2% chance of experiencing potentially minor-damage due to ground shaking in 2018.\r\n\r\n1.3 General Accident Release & Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\r\n\r\n1.3.1 General \r\n\r\nWe inform our employees engaged in process operations of the dangers of an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia in annual safety meetings.

As such, the information, procedures, policies, and documentation that make up this program must be made easily accessible and updated as necessary.
