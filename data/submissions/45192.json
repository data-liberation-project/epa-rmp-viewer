      "SummaryText": "Accidental Release Prevention Policy:  The most common time for an accidental chlorine release is during the cylinder change out procedure.  Under City plocy, this is allowed only with the properly trained personnel, proper self contained air pack and back-up operators to assist if a leak occurs.  After the change out of the cylinders is complete all connections are checked for leaks with ammonia.Emergency Response Policy:  In case of chemical release, the operator is notified by a chlorine gas detector and auto dial telephone system.  It is the City's policy to notify the Jacinto City Fire Department which is the first responder.  The fire department evaluates the situation and notifies the public through the LEPC's One Call System.  Stationaly Source:  The stationary source of a possible chemical release is the Wastewater Treatment Plant at 12202 1/2 Market Street Road, Jacinto City, Texas 77029.  The chemical stored and used above the EPA's Threshold requirement at this location is one ton cylinders of chlorine.  Worst case Release Scenario:  The release of chlorine at a rate of 200 pounds per minute from a ruptured one ton cylinder would affect an area with a radius of 1.3 miles.  These cylinders are rotated on a regular basis at which time they are returned to the chemical supplier for inspection and refill.  Alternative Scenario:  The release of chlorine at a rate of 37 pounds per minute form a broken one half inch vapor feed line would affect an area with a radius of 0.1 miles.  The one half inch feed lines are attached to the chlorine cylinder with a vacuum regulator which shuts down the chlorine flow if a leak occurs in the feed line and vacuum is lost.  Accidental Release Prevention Program:  It is the policy of the City of Jacinto City Department of Public Works to maintain all chemical feeding equipment and storage facilities in order to prevent accidental chemical releases.  Daily inspections by City personnel allow early detection of possible equipment"

Five Year Accident Histories:  The facility has not experienced an offsite accident in the past five years.  Emergency Response Program:  In case of a chlorine release, the procedure is to notify the fire department by phone as to wind direction, type of leak and size of the leak.  The fire department evaluates the situation and notifies the public through the LEPC's One Call System and by personal notifiction.  Safety:  The City remains committed to maintaining its safey record and will continue education for its employees.  The City's personnel attends safety classes taught through the Texas A & M Extension Service.  Public Works conducts weekly safety meetings at which time chlorine safety is taught to all personel."
