This system requires that any change executed address the following: the technical basis for the proposed change; the impact of the change on safety and health; modifications to operating procedures; necessary time period for change; and authorization requirements for the proposed change.  \n\nAffected process safety information (e.g., mechanical, electrical/instrument, chemical, and operating limits) and procedures (e.g., operating, maintenance, and safe work) are updated to incorporate these changes. In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on the change.\n\nPasadena Plastics Complex conducts a Pre-startup Safety Review for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information. A PSR is conducted for the following types of changes: equipment, facilities, and/or process chemicals, technology, and software. The PSR serves as a final check prior to the introduction of highly hazardous chemicals into the process at a new facility and conducted prior to start-up, commissioning, or engagement of the change, for existing, modified facilities.  The PSR must confirm the following: a PHA has been performed for new facilities and that PHA recommendations have been resolved; MOC requirements have been executed for changes to modified facilities; construction and equipment installation is in accordance with design specifications; training of each employee involved in operating a process has been completed; and, safety, operating, maintenance, and emerge"

The composition of investigation teams varies with the complexity of the incident, but the underlying philosophy is one of employee/contractor employee involvement, as appropriate.  \n\nPasadena Plastics Complex is a member of the TOP (Triangle of Prevention) Program.  This program is a Systems of Safety process developed by United Steal Workers (USW) Union utilizing a logic tree investigative methodology to determine the root causes of accidents, incidents and near misses.  The TOP program is comprised of three interdependent elements:  1) measurement of the success of the facility?s health and safety systems, 2) systems of safety and incident investigation training program and 3) a full-time union health and safety representative program.  The incident investigation process is fully administered by the TOP Facilitators.\n\nOnce the results of the incident investigation are available, incidents including findings and recommended actions are summarized and communicated throughout the Complex.  The full incident investigation report is available to any employee upon request through the Safety Department or through the Knowledge Management System (KMS).\n\nAn incident review team, comprised of a cross section of employees, meets on a monthly basis to review incidents that have occurred.  The review identifies important trends, global lessons learned and potential safety issues that need additional attention. The results of these reviews are shared with employees through the Sequential Safety Meeting process as part of the Employee Safety Process.\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nPasadena Plastics Complex conducts compliance audits to periodically evaluate the effectiveness of the PSM Program at Pasadena Plastics Complex; to ensure that each p"

Compliance audits are conducted at least every three years.  The audit team is comprised of a variety of multi-disciplined employees who utilize a set of self-audit checklists based on the OSHA PSM standard.  Audit findings and responses are entered and maintained in a corporate computer-based tracking system.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and the two most recent audit reports are retained.  \n\n\nCHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION\n\nThe processes at Pasadena Plastics Complex have hazards that must be managed to help ensure continued safe operation.  The Accident Prevention Program summarized previously is applied to all OSHA PSM / EPA RMP covered processes at the plant.  Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by (1) equipment failures and (2) human errors.\n\nIn addition to the Accident Prevention Program activities, Pasadena Plastics Complex has safety features on many of its units to help (1) contain/control a release, (2) quickly detect a release, and (3) reduce the consequences of (mitigate) a release.  The following types of safety features are used in various processes:\n\nRelease Detection.\n\nRelease detection system connected to a plant-wide Emergency Alarm System.\n\nRelease Containment/Control.\n\nPeriodic inspection of process equipment.\n\nInspections by Operators each shift.\n\nRoutine leak detection and repair program for all system components.\n\nRemotely activated valves to isolate and limit release.\n\nEmergency equipment shutdown systems that are activated automatically, locally or remotely.\n\nDiked and sloped area with sump for spill containment.\n\nRelief devices to prevent system overpressure.\n\nAutomatic overfill prevention instrumentation.\n\nSpecialized \"excess flow\" valves to restrict release.\n\nState-of-the-art release preve"
