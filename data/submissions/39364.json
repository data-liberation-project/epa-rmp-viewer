The facility is located at 1385 Binford Dr, Auburn Alabama.The parcel is describes as being in the northeast 1/4 of Section 5, Township 18 N, Range 26E. The subject site cinsists of approxiamately 13 acres, bounded by residential property to the west, south and east. The Auburn 7.5 Minute Quadrangle Topographic Map, USGS 1983 shows the elvation at the site to approxiamately 600 feet above sea level. The surface water flow is in a southerly direction towards a tributary of Lake Wilmore  The facility treats water from Lake Olgetree foe use as portable water for the city of Auburn, Alabama.  Chlorine gas is used to treat the water to reduce bacterial contamination. The chlorine gas process is ioslated to reduce the probability of an incident and the operators are thoroughly trained in the handling of the one ton cylinders of chlorine. A review of the process indicatedthat the worst case secenario is the release of a one ton cylinder that is being placed into service. The release would allow chlorine to migrate off site to the south-southeast, along a natrual drainage fall line toward a residentail area. The envelope of exposure will br some1.1 miles.The most likely, alternative scenario is the release of a partially full cylinder, containing less than a ton of chlorine, with the same flow pattern and traveling .42 miles. In both cases the emergency response involes the activation of the local Emergency Repose program and the potential evacuation of the residents. The site has a prevantion program in place that addresses the following program elements: Hazard review, Operating Procedures, Training maintenance, Incident Investigation and Compilance Auditing.These programs are used for the entire operation and for the seecific use of chlorine. The site has had no incidents in the last five years and has an ERP the involes local public safety and HAZMAT teams. In the furt"
