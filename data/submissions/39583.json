      "SummaryText": "We have adopted this Program in order to implement 40 C.F.R. 68, the federal requirements regulating Risk Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals.  This Program will help prevent the occurrence of, or minimize the consequences of, catastrophic releases by stating our policies and procedures for the management of process hazards in start-up, operation, inspection, maintenance and the other matters addressed in the federal standard.  Our Program calls for maximum employee participation and includes all elements of the employee participation provisions of the standard.  We shall, as a minimum:  (1) consult with employees and their representatives on the conduct and development of the process hazard review and other elements of the risk management plan, and (2) provide to our employees and their representatives access to the process hazard review and all other information required to be developed under that standard.  The City of South Houston believes that preventative maintenance is the key to minimizing the potential for accidental releases.  Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) have been reviewed and revised to enable the employees to perform their work is a safe and efficient manner.  The City of South Houston has taken steps to train the operators, supervisors, and maintenance crews to be knowledgeable in the emergency response program.  The training includes classroom and hands on training on the proper use of emergency response equipment and procedures.  Above all, all employees know where the phone numbers for the first responders are located should a release occur."
