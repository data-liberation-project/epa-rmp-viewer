Today, Hawkins has become more specialized by working with customers with very exacting specifications seeking appropriate and innovative alternatives to meet their needs.\n\n\n\nHawkins is based in Roseville, Minnesota with branches throughout the United States. Hawkins serves customers in the Industrial sector in the fields of energy, electronics, additives, chemical processing, pulp and paper, medical devices, and plating.  Food manufacturers, processing plants, and pharmaceutical concerns across the nation benefit from Hawkins' chemical distribution, blending, and related expertise. \n\n\n\nHawkins' mission is to exceed our customers' expectations as a high-quality, service-oriented chemical supplier.

Members in good standing with the National Association of Chemical Distributors.\n\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled:  The Hawkins - Centralia Facility is an additive manufacturing facility that manufactures, stores, and distributes several materials used by the farming industry and other uses.  The products covered in our Risk Management Plan for this facility is aqua ammonia solution >20% concentration (NOT anhydrous ammonia).  \n\nPrevention Program:  Accident prevention is achieved through handling procedures that properly protect chemicals during transfer, storage, and manufacturing.  This starts with delivery of aqua ammonia solution in DOT approved tank-trailers and then transferring the product into a 12,500-gallon, carbon steel storage container.  Unloading of the product from the trailer to the storage tank is conducted in a containment area that is designed to catch any accidental spills.  The storage tank is in a containment area of the warehouse and is equipped with high level indicators to help prevent accidental overflow.  Prevention continues by having employees trained in proper handling procedures and using unloading checklists.  Employees are also equipped with proper personnel protective equipment to safely store raw materials and manufacture and package additives for customer delivery.  Once ammonia is added to the mix tanks, it is diluted below 20% and is no longer regulated by RMP.  Adherence to OSHA workplace rules is just another part of our safety program.  We also follow industry standards, such as those of the National Association of Chemical Distributors to ensure that our equipment and procedures are protective of the health and safety of our employees, the environment, and the surrounding community.\n\n\n\n5-Year Accident History:  As a result of our diligence, there has not been an accidental rel"

Don proper personal protective equipment (SCBA), stop the release, make necessary notifications, and clean up the release.\n\n2.    If necessary, call the local fire department for hazmat assistance.\n\n3.    If necessary, evacuate to a safe distance.  \n\nThe local fire department has toured the facility and is aware of the chemicals on site.   \n\n\n\nPlanned Changes:  While Hawkins desires to continually improve safety, there are no specific changes planned other than to continue compliance with industry standards and government regulations and our own commitment to \"Think Safe! Be Safe!\"\n\n"
