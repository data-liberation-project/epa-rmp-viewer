The DEC uses anhydrous ammonia as a necessary part of reducing the emissions of nitrogen oxides to the atmosphere.  Storing a large quantity of ammonia can be a hazard if it is not handled properly. Calpine Corporation takes its safety obligations in storing and using ammonia as seriously as we take controlling emissions from the power plant. The following document describes what could happen if there were to be an accident, the steps we take every day to ensure a safely operating plant, and what to do in the event of an emergency.\n\n1.2  Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nThe DEC accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates proven technology, staff training on operation and maintenance practices, and tested management system practices.  All applicable procedures of the State of California and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Prevention Program are adhered to, including key elements such as training, systems management, and emergency response procedures.  \nIt is the policy of Calpine Corporation that every employee is entitled to a safe and healthful place in which to work and live. Calpine Operations and Maintenance Department incorporates the concepts of environmental responsibility and productivity with safety resulting in efficiency and productivity.  As part of Calpine?s obligation to protect the integrity of human, environmental, physical, and financial resources, and to conserve and\nefficiently utilize those resources, Calpine will: \n?    Comply fully with laws regulating environmental protection and employee health and safety\n?    Furnish work places free of recognized hazards likely to cause injury to employees, the public, or the environment\n?    Train employees in safe and environmentally conscious practices and require compliance with environmenta"

Provide a professional staff to maintain and support environmental, health and safety programs\nThis document complies with the EPA Risk Management Program under Section 112 (r) of the Clean Air Act (CAA) Amendments of 1990, 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 68, and the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program under California Code of Regulations (CCR) Title 19, Division 2, Chapter 4.5.  This document summarizes our existing health and safety programs, our internal management response procedures, and ongoing actions that are designed to prevent or minimize impacts of accidental releases of ammonia to the environment.  DEC has prepared a stand-alone emergency action plan to handle any potential accidental releases.\n\n1.3  Facility Description and Regulated Substances Information\nDECis located on approximately 20 acres within a 139-acre parcel of land owned by Dow. The 20 acre site is leased to DEC by Dow. The site is located in the city limits of Pittsburg in Contra Costa County at the border of the City of Antioch, and is approximately 35 miles northeast of San Francisco. \nThe facility currently stores anhydrous ammonia, a regulated toxic substance under RMP and CalARP regulations, in one 15,000-gallon double walled steel storage tank at 85% capacity, that is located inside a secondary containment area.  Anhydrous ammonia is used at DEC to reduce nitrogen oxides (nitric oxide and nitrogen dioxide) created during the combustion of natural gas and exhausted from the three  Combustion Turbine Generators (CTG) and Heat Recovery Steam Generators (HRSG) duct burners.  Anhydrous ammonia  vapor is drawn from the top of the storage tank and diluted with air, and injected into the three Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) units to reduce the NOx emissions. \nThe maximum quantity of ammonia stored at DEC exceeds the federal RMP and CalARP specified threshold quantities of 10,000 pounds and 500 p"

The anhydrous ammonia process is a Program 3 process.\n\n1.4  Offsite Consequence Analysis Results\nThe offsite consequence analysis includes consideration of two release scenarios, identified as ?worst case? and ?alternative? release scenarios.  The worst-case release scenario requires that a release of the entire contents of the single largest vessel or pipe be evaluated for offsite impacts.  Only passive or administrative controls can be considered under the worst-case release scenario.  The worst-case release scenario for DEC is the rupture of the ammonia storage tank, resulting in a release of 72,433 pounds of ammonia over a 10-minute duration.  In practice, this type of total release from a storage tank would be unlikely to occur during the lifetime of the plant.  The storage tanks and associated piping are all outside, therefore no building mitigation was considered. \nThe offsite consequence analysis for anhydrous ammonia was conducted using the EPA provided software RMP*Comp. \nThe ARS is during unloading, resulting in a release of 1,420 lbs. \nThe results of the OCA for the worst-case release scenario indicate that the distance to the toxic endpoint is 3.1 miles. The estimated population is 82,460. \nThe results of the ARS indicate the distance to the toxic endpoint is 0.3 miles. The CCCHSD ARS indicates the distance to the toxic endpoint is 0.5 miles. The estimated population for both alternative release scenarios is zero.\n\n1.5  Summary of the Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps \nManagement System\nRisk Management Program regulations require those facilities with processes subject to Program 3 to develop a management system to oversee the implementation of the RMP elements.

The program elements such as process hazard analysis, compliance audits, and incident investigation result in the development of additional safeguards.  Some of the physical safeguards that are part of the original design and are already in place include the following:\nAmmonia Storage Tank.  The storage tank is provided with local pressure indicator (in psig) and level indicators (in percent volume).  The tank also has pressure safety valves,  temperature gauges, and anhydrous ammonia  leak detectors.

Four SensAlert ammonia  leak detectors transmitters are provided and alarm locally and in the Control Room in the event of an ammonia leak. Two leak detectors are located beside the vaporizers and one leak detector is inserted into the PRV line.  A leak detector also is located by the unloading station. \nThe detectors trigger a local alarm and DCS alarm when a concentration of 50 ppm of ammonia is detected in the air.  If a concentration of 100 ppm is detected, the leak detection system alarms to the Pittsburg Fire Department. There is no automatic function provided with the leak detectors.  Subsequent measures from this high alarm activation will rely on the operator action.\nThe underground portion of the piping has secondary containment/single-walled pipe.   \nAlarm System.  A common trouble alarm is provided both to the main control panel and DCS on any of the following conditions:\n?    Low storage tank level ? the storage tank low pressure alarm indicating that the vaporizer system has malfunctioned is provided in the DCS .  The alarm also is used to indicate that the storage tank needs to be refilled.\n?

A wet pipe sprinkler deluge water system is provided around the storage tank to dissipate the anhydrous ammonia vapor cloud in case of a leak.  The system will be manually activated locally at the anhydrous ammonia  tank or from the Control Room in the event of an anhydrous ammonia leakage.  The deluge system is not automatically activated because in the event of a large quantity of liquid anhydrous ammonia , adding water can cause a violent reaction and accelerate the release of ammonia  vapor.\nFire Safe Stop Valve. An emergency fire safe stop valve is provided on the main vapor line from the storage tank.  This stop valve is wired directly to the DCS system.

Details such as maximum intended inventory, safe upper and lower operating temperatures and pressures, and codes and standards used to design, build, and operate the processes are on file at the facility.  Calpine Corporation verifies that that equipment complies with recognized and generally accepted good engineering practices by specifying that the latest codes and standards be used for the design of the plant, conducting a seismic assessment to confirm that the process meets structural codes, and by reviewing the ammonia process in the process hazard analysis.  Calpine also has scheduled reviews of the risk management program to update safety information if there is a major change that would make existing information inaccurate.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis \nEvaluation of new equipment and processes has and will continue to be implemented in an effort to protect employees, the public, and the surrounding environment.  \n    HAZOP was conducted on 12/7/2005 and reviewed on 5/1/2006. After reviewing the process safety information, the PHA team used a P&ID, dividing the ammonia process into five nodes that were used to systematically identify causes of potential anhydrous ammonia releases. \nThe PHA team brainstormed recommendations to reduce the risk of accidental anhydrous ammonia releases for each significant release scenario. Significant release scenarios were defined as any accidental release that would probably occur during the lifetime of DEC and could result in an onsite inju"
