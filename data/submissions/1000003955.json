The facility stores Anhydrous Ammonia solely for the internal production of polyphosphatic liquid fertilizer.  This process is performed on an annual basis (at most) by an outside contractor.  The finished product is not considered a hazardous material.  \n\n\n\nKugler Oil Company, the parent of the Burlington Fertilizer Operation  is a family owned corporation located in McCook, Nebraska.  The owners live in McCook, surrounded by friends and neighbors who are also their customers.  The principal officers of the parent company as well as the manager and a majority of the employees at this location are very active in the affairs of their local communities. Each of us is as interested in the health and welfare of our neighbors as we  are of our own families.\n\n\n\nThe facility has two 30,000 gallon pressure vessels for the storage of Anhydrous Ammonia.  The rail siding adjacent to the facility has the capacity to hold three railcars which hold approximately 80 tons of Ammonia each.  All other chemicals stored at this facility are retained in less than reportable quantities.\n\n\n\nIn constructing this plan, many alternative scenarios were envisioned which  could involve the accidental release of ammonia gas. The most probable of these unlikely scenarios might be the release of excess pressure due to natural solar heating of an overfilled anhydrous ammonia storage tank. With the release of 100 pounds of liquid material over a ten minute period, the maximum predicted travel of the resulting vapor cloud would only involve only four residents within the predicted 0.1 mile radius of exposure. \n\n\n\nThe Kugler Oil Company has always been very pro-active in meeting accepted industry standards for storage and handling of the various chemicals with which they deal.  Safety is of paramount concern and to that end they hire an internal Safety Director,  provide for a Safety Committe"

Part of the Management Directive for the Company safety program states that it is the intent of management that full implementation of the safety program will benefit this facility, and as such it is a high priority of the facility.  The benefits will include preventing accidents, reducing overall operating costs by reducing down time, repair costs, time and costs spent in training new employees, reducing workers compensation claims costs, and increasing productivity through a better trained and motivated workforce.  To this end, it is the responsibility of management to provide a workplace free of  hazards.  By extension the safety of the community  surrounding our facilities is of as much concern as for our employees as ourselves.\n\n\n\nIn the unlikely scenario where an ammonia vapor cloud would leave the premises of the Burlington Fertilizer Plant, our employees are trained to inform the local population. Coordination has been effected with the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) whose agencies, primarily the Burlington Fire and Police Departments can provide for notification of those residents likely to be affected so that they may in turn evacuate the area. The Burlington Fire Department  personnel are invited make regular visits to the facility to become familiar with the premises and equipment. \n\n\n\nThe Kugler Company at this and all similar locations requires that all materials and procedures meet the State of Colorado and Industry Standards, ANSI Z61.1, for construction of Ammonia handling facilities.  The Burlington personnel which operate this  facility are regularly trained on the maintenance and operation of all facility equipment.  A systematic program of preventative maintenance  is in effect. Our goal is to be a good neighbor and maintain an operation in consonance with the natural environment and the surrounding residents.
