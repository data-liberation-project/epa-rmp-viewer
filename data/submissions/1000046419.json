There are a number of 1,000 gallon nurse tanks for lease to farmers.  The maximum amount handled at one time would be a semi trailer on site to unload.  They typically hold 41,000#.\n\n\n\n3.  Worst Case Scenario and Alternate Case Scenario\n\n\n\nThe Worst Case and Alternate Case release scenarios have been removed at the request of the EPA.  This is a security issue and is dictated by the homeland security act.  \n\n\n\n4.
