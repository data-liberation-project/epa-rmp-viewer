There is also a sensor in the diked area to provide early warning of a leak.\n\nEach storage tank is equipped with an independent high-level shutoff mechanism to prevent overfilling.  \n\nShould a leak occur, a remotely operated shutdown switch is in place, which would close all transfer and nitrogen valves on the offloading lines, shut down the transfer pump and close the storage tank fill lines.\n\nA remotely operated sprinkler system can be employed in the offloading area in case of a spill, which would reduce the amount of vapor released.\n\nThe storage tank diked area can immediately be covered in foam in the evident of a leak, which suppresses vapor formation.  This foam system operates automatically in case of fire, but can also be operated remotely from the process control room if a leak were detected.  Foam can also be directly injected into the storage tanks from the process control room.\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nWe have not experienced any accidents or incidents that meet the RMP definition.  The Acrylamide Plant has operated with no lost time accidents since beginning operation.\n\nSafety Philosophy\n\nThe Ciba Suffolk site has a strong safety culture, led by our site manager.  Our guiding principles are the six codes of management practice found in the Chemical Manufacturer\u00bfs Association\u00bfs Responsible Care initiative.

The committee, which meets monthly, monitors PSM issues, hosts training activities and performs PSM audits.  Regarding employee H&S, the Suffolk site has been a Virginia Occupational Safety & Health Voluntary Protection Program (VPP) STAR facility since October 2001.  Since April 1999, our employees have safely worked over five years and 4 million man-hours without a lost time accident.  The site\u00bfs VPP Committee performs bimonthly sitewide H&S audits and a self-evaluation of the site\u00bfs VPP program performance is conducted annually.  We also have a site Safety Committee, which provides a forum for communicating H&S concerns; all employees are invited to participate in the monthly meetings.  \n\nOur CAER program is evidenced by our participation in the Ciba Community Advisory Panel (CAP), the Suffolk Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and other community outreach efforts.  The CAP is comprised of Ciba employees, residents of our neighborhood, civic leaders and emergency services representatives.  The CAP, which meets monthly, provides a forum for our neighbors to express their interest and concerns with the site.\n\nEmergency Response\n\nOur emergency response efforts are led and directed by our Emergency Response Team (ERT) Steering Committee, which meets quarterly to review progress, allocate resources, schedule training and liaise with the Suffolk LEPC.  Our ERT is currently comprised of approximately 55 Ciba emergency responders and support personnel.  Of the 55 personnel, there are 5 people certified as Emergency Medical Technicians (EMTs), with another group in the process of certification.

      "SummaryText": "Facility Description\n\nEstablished in 1983, the Suffolk facility of Ciba Specialty Chemicals Corporation (Ciba) has approximately 320 employees on-site and operates around the clock, seven days a week.  Our three finished product plants produce chemicals that are used in all phases of water treatment, from municipal wastewater treatment to paper making.  Additionally, our Monomers group produces raw materials used by the finished product plants.  The site covers 225 acres on the west side of Wilroy Road, \u00bd mile north of the Wilroy Industrial Park.  \n\nRMP Chemicals on Site\n\nWe have two chemicals on our site that are listed under the RMP rule: acrylonitrile and ammonia solution.  Ammonia is stored at levels below the RMP thresholds.  Acrylonitrile is used in the manufacture of acrylamide, our main raw material used in at the site.  \n\nProcess Description\n\nIn January 1997 we began operating a plant that produces acrylamide, a chemical we had previously imported or purchased.  We utilize a process called catalytic hydration to produce acrylamide.  The end result is a solution of acrylamide in water.  This continuous process (which runs around the clock, seven days a week) is operated by well-trained process technicians using a state-of-the-art computer control system.  The plant is shut down at least once a year for preventive maintenance and equipment inspection/testing. \n\nAcrylonitrile is delivered to the site exclusively in top-offloading railcars.  It is unloaded into one of three storage tanks in rotation, which are never filled to more than 80% capacity.  The in-process inventory of acrylonitrile is, in comparison to the storage inventory, very low due to its rapid conversion to acrylamide.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Measures\n\nThe probability of a significant release of acrylonitrile is extremely remote based on the design, construction, operation and testing associated with acrylonitrile offloading and storage.  Prevention measures include the following:\n\nA der"
