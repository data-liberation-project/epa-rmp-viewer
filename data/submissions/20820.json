This wastewater treatment plant is responsible for the treatment of the sanitary waste from several surrounding subdivisions, households and small local businesses.  Greenwood Utility District contracts the operation of this wastewater treatment plant to Aquasource Services & Technologies, Inc.  Both Greenwood Utility District and Aquasource Services & Technologies, Inc. are committed to the safe operation of the wastewater treatment plant.  The wastewater treatment plant uses chlorine gas to disinfect the wastewater prior to its release from the plant.  The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) lists this substance as a hazardous substance.  The chlorine gas is delivered and stored in one ton gas cylinders, no more than two cylinders are ever stored at the facility.  Greenwood Utility District, in compliance with EPA regulations, has developed a Risk ManagementPlan.  This Risk Management Plan assists both Greenwood Utility District and Aquasource Services & Technologies, Inc. to ensure the safe operation of the wastewater treatment plant.  As a part of the Risk Management Plan air dispersion modeling was performed to predict the potential impact of a chlorine release from the facility.  Two release scenarios were modeled, a worst case and an alternative release.  The model that was used to predict the impact of the two release scenarios was an EPA developed and approved dispersion modeling program.  The worst case release scenario that was modeled assumed a complete loss of inventory in a short period of time.  The consequences of such a release would result in offsite impacts of chlorine for 1.9 miles from the facility.  As a result of such a release several households, schools and a recreational park could be impacted.  The second release scenario, the alternative release, assumed a leaking valve or rupture disk on a chlorine cylinder.  The offsite impact for"

This scenario results in minimal offsite consequences and could effect only a few households close to the facility.  The wastewater treatment plant has had no history of releases of chlorine. Greenwood Utility District has coordinated with the local fire department to ensure that in the event of an accidental release, that qualified and trained individuals will respond quickly to minimize offsite impacts.  In addition, Aquasource Services & Technologies, Inc. employ's only licensed wastewater treatment plant operators.  These operators have been certified by the state of Texas for the operation of wastewater treatment plants.  Both Greenwood Utility District and Aquasource Services & Technologies, Inc. are committed to the ongoing safe operation and handling of hazardous substances and equipment that are necessary in order to provide the service to the community."
