The Facility Policy\n\nThe owners, management, and employees of Union County Co-op, are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2.

We are distributors of Anhydrous Ammonia, a product regulated by U.S. E.P.A. We receive Anhydrous Ammonia by truck and store on site in one (1) 30,000 gallon storage tank and distribute to our customers in wenty-two (19) 1,000 gallon nurse tanks. This gives our facility a maximum storage capacity of 219,000 pounds of Anhydrous Ammonia. Our customers then use the nurse tanks in applying the fertilizer to the soil.\n\n3. The Accident Release Prevention Program\n\nThe facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1, published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc., and the Standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\". Additional information contained in our Safety and Environmental Manual and the Rules and Regulations of the Indiana State Chemist concerning Anhydrous Ammonia are also utilized.\n\n4. The Five-Year Accident History \n\nThere have been no accidental releases of Anhydrous Ammonia in the past five years that have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility or to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite injuries, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n5.
