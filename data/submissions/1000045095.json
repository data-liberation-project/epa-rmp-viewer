The machine room houses the majority of the refrigeration equipment.\r\n\r\n\r\n1.3\tDescription of the Accidental Release Prevention Program\r\n\r\nRuiz Foods has prepared a facility safety policy and procedures program specifically tailored for the facility.  The facility has a program level 3 accident release prevention program for the ammonia refrigeration system that complies with OSHA's Process Safety Management Standard and EPA's Chemical Accidental Prevention Provisions.  The program consists of the following elements:\r\n\r\no Employee Participation Program\r\no Process Safety Information\r\no Process Hazard Analysis\r\no Operating Procedures\r\no Training Program\r\no Contractor Safety Program\r\no Pre-Startup Safety Review Procedures\r\no Mechanical Integrity Program\r\no Hot Work Permit Procedures\r\no Management of Change Procedures\r\no Incident Investigation Procedures\r\no Compliance Audit Procedures\r\n\r\n\r\n1.4\tFive-Year Accident History\r\n\r\nThere have not been any ammonia-related incidents at the Ruiz facility in Florence, SC during this time (5 yr. period) that resulted in significant on-site or offsite consequences.\r\n\r\n\r\n1.5\tEmergency Response Program\r\n\r\nThe Florence"
