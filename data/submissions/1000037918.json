      "SummaryText": "INTRODUCTION: \n\nRentech Nitrogen, LLC (Rentech), East Dubuque, Illinois (\"Facility\") manufactures nitrogen fertilizers and related products for agricultural and industrial use.  The products produced include Anhydrous Ammonia, Urea (liquid and solid), Nitric acid, liquid Ammonium Nitrate solution, Urea Ammonium Nitrate (UAN) solution, and liquid Carbon Dioxide.\n\n\n\nSince the Facility has more than 10,000 pounds of Anhydrous Ammonia, it is required to submit a Risk Management Plan (\"RMP\") and comply with the requirements of 40 C.F.R. Part 68.  The Facility is subject to the Program 3 requirements for Anhydrous Ammonia. \n\n\n\nHIGHLIGHTS OF THE SAFETY PROGRAM: \n\nThe Facility's Safety Vision states: \"We, the employees of Rentech [Nitrogen], utilize teamwork, communication, and education, with the full support of management, to achieve safety excellence.\" The Facility utilizes this vision statement as a reminder of the priority of achieving safety excellence. Employees are highly involved in creating and implementing safety programs and safety systems at the facility, with a focus on continuous improvement. \n\n\n\nHighlights of the safety program include:\n\n?    Extensive employee participation in the development, implementation, and review of safety systems and programs at the facility. \n\n\n\n?    A well-developed, extensive training program that ensures that employees and contractors are knowledgeable on the safety programs and their job duties\n\n\n\n?    An excellent emergency response team. Many of the employees on the emergency response team are also highly involved with the community volunteer fire and HazMat teams.\n\n\n\n?    Strong community relations are an important part of the Facility's safety program. The Facility is an active member of the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and has representatives attend LEPC meetings on a regular basis.  \n\n\n\nRecent changes to improve safety at the Facility include:\n\n?    Installation of a new ammonia safety flare.\n\n\n\n?    Modernization of the contr"

Installation of a containment dike around the ammonia storage tanks. \n\n\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety at the Facility include:\n\n?    Installation of a new vaporization and/or vent system for the ammonia vent header and safety flare header.\n\n\n\n?    Continued modernization of the control systems for the Ammonia and Urea plants.\n\n\n\n?    Installation of a new air dryer for facility instrument air\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM STEPS\n\nThe Facility encourages all employees to participate in all facets of process safety and accident prevention. Examples of employee participation include updating and compiling technical documents, networked computers that provide all employees instant access to up-to-date safety information, participation in Process Hazard Analyses, and continuous employee training. \n\n\n\nThe Facility has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled. Within this system, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards. \n\n\n\nThe facility also utilizes a comprehensive Incident Reporting and Incident Investigation program to determine root cause(s) and appropriate corrective action(s) for incidents that occur.  \n\n\n\nWell established mechanical integrity practices and procedures are in place to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems.  \n\n\n\nIn addition, an established hot work permit procedure for fire prevention is in place to ensure all safety precautions are taken before any hot work is started in a non-designated hot work area.\n\n\n\nThe Facility has implemented a contractor safety program that includes procedures to hire and use contractors who accomplish the desired job tasks without compromising the safety and health of facility or contractor employees.\n\n\n\nT"

This system requires that the process changes be reviewed to ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and verify that existing controls have not been compromised. Affected process safety information (chemical hazard information, process operating limits, equipment information) and operating and maintenance procedures are updated to incorporate these changes. In addition, all affected personnel receive training on the change.\n\n\n\nACCIDENT HISTORY: \n\nThe Facility has an excellent safety record with no fatalities (deaths) of personnel or contractors at the plant since it was constructed in 1965.  The Facility has had one accident meeting the 5 year accident history RMP criteria.  Information on this incident is detailed in section six of the RMP submittal.  We are confident that the policies and programs in place at our facility will help us to continually improve our safety performance in the years to come.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM: \n\nAn excellent emergency response team is in place at the Facility. Many of the employees on the emergency response team are also highly involved with the community volunteer fire and HazMat teams. Emergency response drills are held each year. In addition, the Facility emergency response team has responded to nearby incidents at the request of the community. \n\n\n\nApproximately seventeen employees are on the Facility emergency response team. Training for these personnel is extensive. This training includes classroom instruction, hands on review of the equipment, and several incident simulation drills conducted each year.
