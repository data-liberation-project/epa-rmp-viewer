It was also built in compliance with the Uniform Mechanical Code and Uniform Building Code applicable at the time of construction. The system contains numerous safety devices including sensors which stop the compressors if temperatures or pressures exceed or drop below established limits, and safety relief valves which vent ammonia gas to a water diffusion tank if the pressure in the system exceeds their set point.  In addition, ammonia detectors are located in selected areas of the facility, and will shut down equipment if ammonia is detected.  Lastly, an emergency dump box contains switches and valves to turn off equipment and vent ammonia if necessary.\n\nThe ammonia system at this facility consists of vessels which are interconnected, or which are co-located such that a release of ammonia could impact the ability to operate vessels which are not directly connected.  Therefore, the facility is treated as a single process.\n\n3.\tAMMONIA RELEASE SCENARIOS\n3.1\tWorst Case Scenario\nAt Simonian Fruit Co., the worst-case scenario is the failure of our high pressure receiver which can contain up to 14,500 lbs of ammonia.  Following the instructions set forth in EPA's Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration (40 CFR Part 68), we considered the failure of one vessel.  We did not include any liquid ammonia in the piping connected to the failed vessel.  This vessel is located in the mechanical room, and the release would be passively mitigated.  The ammonia would be released over a ten-minute period.  Using the program RMP*Comp we estimate that the ammonia would travel 0.5 miles (urban conditions) before dispersing enough to no longer pose a hazard to the public.  A map showing the area that would be affected is located in Appendix A.\n\nIn our opinion, it is extremely unlikely that the worst-case scenario will ever take p"

Our receiver meets industry standards for manufacture and quality control of pressure vessels; ammonia is not corrosive in this service; pressure safety relief valves limit the operating pressure in this vessel; and our operators are trained in the safe operation of our system. \n\n3.2\tAlternative Case Scenario\nThe alternative release scenario selected by Simonian Fruit Co. is as follows. A high-pressure safety relief valve lifts abruptly and fails to reseat.  This can occur when the inlet pressure exceeds the valve setting pressure.  The purpose of these valves is to prevent over-pressurization, which can lead to ruptures or pipe bursts.  These valves are designed to open and close with accurate performance, but occasionally the piston or diaphragm set gets caught on debris and causes the valve to stick in the upright (open) position.  The industry rated release rate for our high-pressure safety relief valve is 57.6 lbs/min.   It is assumed that the leak would continue for 10 minutes until the header pipe was switched over to the backup safety relieve valve. Following industry practice Simonian Fruit Co. relief valves are installed in pairs with a switch over valve.  The discharge is piped to a release point that is remote from the faulty valve, so the valve can be serviced or replaced in an area that is free from the hazard of the ammonia release.  The discharge would be released to the atmosphere, and under this scenario approximately 600 lbs. of ammonia would be released over a time period of about 10 minutes.\n\nThe likelihood of this release scenario is decreased by the fact that our relief valves are set at the ASHRAE 15 standard -- 25% above maximum system pressure.  This safety factor provides sufficient spring force on the valve seat to maintain a tight seal and still allow for setting tolerances, external temperature extremes, and other factors that cause settings to vary.  In addition, we visually inspect our relief valves on a regular basis.\n\nThe EPA"

This program uses approved data for variables such as wind speed/atmospheric stability class, ambient temperature/humidity, height of release, surface roughness, dense or neutrally buoyant gases, and temperature of released substance.  The RMP*Comp program calculated that the ammonia would travel less than 0.1 miles (unmitigated urban conditions) before dispersing enough to no longer pose a hazard to the public. A map showing the area that would be affected is located in Appendix A.\n \n4.\tGENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE & AMMONIA SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\nThe ammonia refrigeration systems at the  Simonian Fruit Co. facility are an integral part of the overall business.   The system can contain a total charge of up to approximately 14,500 lbs. It is extremely important that it is maintained and operated in a safe and efficient manner.  Management is committed to making sure that all employees are made aware of the potential danger of an ammonia leak.\n\nOur refrigeration personnel monitor the ammonia refrigeration system/process and keep an active journal of all procedures and transactions that pertain to ammonia.  In addition, the system/process is checked weekly by our outside refrigeration contractor, California Controlled Atmosphere, who also performs an annual pre-season preventative maintenance review of our system/process equipment. \n\nWe inform our employees of the dangers of an accidental release of ammonia in pre-season safety meetings.  New employees are made aware of the potential risk of ammonia in an employee orientation meeting.  During these meetings we also discuss preventative measures, such as evacuation, in order to be prepared for a release.\n\nOur ammonia refrigeration system was designed and built by professional refrigeration engineers in accordance with ANSI/IIAR Standard for Equipment, Design, and Installation of Am"

Federally, Title 29 CFR 1910.38 and 1910.119), HAZWOPER (standard (in California CCR Title 8, Section 5192, Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response, and Title 29 CFR 1910.120). \n\nStrategically, we will respond minimally to a release.  Under this plan we will call emergency personel and evacuate the facility. All response activities would be done by the local fire department and the Fresno County Fire Department Hazardous Materials Response Team.\n\nEvery year at the beginning of the season we review with our employees our evacuation procedures in the event of an emergency, including an ammonia release. \n\n7.\tPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\nOur company has an outstanding safety record, one that we are quite proud of.  Many policies and procedures have been implemented to promote overall plant, worker and public safety.  Nevertheless, Simonian Fruit Co. continually strives to improve in all areas, including safety.  Preparation of this Risk & Process Safety Management Program has been the primary recent improvement, and implementation of the program is our plan for improved safety in the near future.\n\nThe Risk & Process Safety Management Program has been written so that program elements are aligned with Simonian Fruit Co. business practices rather than the order presented in the law.  Thus, Safe Operating Procedures are grouped together for the benefit of our system operator.  Safe Operating Policies are grouped together so that appropriate office staff may administer them."

It is an interactive framework that guides safe action for Simonian Fruit Co. employees, but allows for feedback and continual improvement.  Through the Risk & Process Safety Management Program Simonian Fruit Co. will continue to profit while maintaining overall plant, worker and public safety."

      "SummaryText": "nia system that provides refrigeration capacity to multiple cold rooms equipped with forced air tunnels for cooling fruit.  Two rooms are designated as precooling rooms, while five others are cold storage rooms.  Both kinds of rooms are equipped with bunker style evaporator coils that contain chilled liquid ammonia.  There is a cooled loading dock area as well.  A computer system provides substantial control and alarm capability.  \n\nHigh pressure liquid from a high pressure receiver is piped to a series of a liquid feed solenoid valves.  From there, high pressure liquid is piped to each cold room, where it passes through an expansion valve into a low pressure accumulator vessel mounted on the outside walls of the rooms.  Low temperature liquid circulates by thermal convection through the evaporator coils located behind bunker walls in the cold rooms.  Low pressure and temperature gas collects in the accumulator vessel, and passes through a pressure regulator into a suction line.  The suction line returns the vapor to one of two primary accumulator vessels located in the engine room, which separates any residual liquid from the gas.  The gas is piped to reciprocating compressors which elevate the temperature and pressure of the gas.  The high pressure discharge from the compressor is sent to water cooled evaporative condensers where the high pressure gas ammonia is liquified and returned to the high pressure receivers. Liquid separated from the suction return gas in the primary accumulator vessels drains into liquid transfer vessels.  Operation of a float switch activated solenoid valve raises the pressure in the liquid transfer vessel to the point the liquid can be drained into the high pressure receiver.  There are three high pressure receivers; two vertical tanks in the engine room and one horizontal tank in a shed alongside the building, however, they are piped together so that they act in concert.   \n\nThe facility was built by professional refrigeration engi"
