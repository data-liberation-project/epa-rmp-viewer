Jones water plant has quantities of regulated hazardous chemicals above the EPA threshold.  The A.M. Jones plant is un-manned and Operators from the West Mitchell Hammock Water Plant remotely monitor all operations via SCADA.  Operators conducts daily inspection, maintenance and operates at the A.M. Jones Plant;.  The West Mitchell Hammock Plant is absent any RMP chemical at or above threshold levels.  The City has a unified Risk Management Program which applies to each plant.  Only the A. M. Jones Water Treatment Plant operations and policies are presented in this Plan.\n1.1.\tACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION/EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES     (A)\nThe City of Oviedo A. M. Jones Water Treatment Plant accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates technologies, procedures and management practices.  The plant prevention program complies with all applicable procedures of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) 40 CFR-68 Prevention Program under the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990.\n1.2.\tMANAGEMENT SYSTEMS (A) (1)\nThe City of Oviedo has a management system in place which is lead by the Utilities Manager, who oversees the implementation and on-going use of the RMP elements.  This program, along with other City-wide and plant-specific policies, eliminates and /or reduces the likelihood of a hazardous chemical release at the plant.

      "SummaryText": "afety Information.\n1.5.1.\tREGULATED SUBSTANCE (b) (2)\nChlorine is the only regulated substance on site which exceeds the EPA 40 CFR-68 rule threshold quantity of 2500 pounds.  The City of Oviedo chlorine process was installed as part of the process of purifying water for public consumption.  It operates under permit from the State of Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FL DEP).  The chlorine is received, stored and distributed to four process control injection systems. \nChlorine is an EPA and OSHA-listed toxic chemical.  It is an irritant and it is corrosive.  Chlorine is a halogen with the formula Cl2.  It is a chlorinating or oxidizing agent that is not flammable.  It has a 1 ppm OSHA ceiling Permissible Exposure Limit (PEL) and a NFPA health rating of 4, severe; with immediate and delayed health hazards.  Chlorine is not a carcinogen.\nThe maximum threshold quantity stored on site is 15 each one ton containers.  This equals 30,000 pounds.\n2.\tHAZARD ASSESSMENT\nA hazard assessment was performed to determine the effects a release would have on the public. For chlorine, the distance a set endpoint concentration of the gas would travel must be determined.  In addition, an estimate of the population that could be affected by a release of chlorine was determined, and sensitive receptors such as hospitals, schools, and nursing homes were identified. The hazard assessment considers two release scenarios-a worst case and an alternative case and also compiles the five-year accident history for the WTP chlorine system (see section 4 below: five year accident history).\nTwo offsite consequence analyses were conducted which include two chlorine release scenarios.  The first is a \u00bfworst case release\u00bf.  The second is a more probable \u00bfalternative release scenario\u00bf.  The first scenario is defined by EPA, which states that \u00bfthe operator shall assume that the maximum quantity in the largest vessel is released as a gas over 10 minutes\u00bf due to an unspecified failure.

The 3 ppm endpoint is the Emergency Response Planning Guideline Level 2 (ERPG-2).
