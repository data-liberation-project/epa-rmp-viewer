Jones Water Treatment Plant at 1600 Alafaya Woods Blvd, Oviedo, Seminole County, Florida.  This plant is one of two water plants operated by the City.  Only the A. M. Jones water plant has quantities of regulated hazardous chemicals above the EPA threshold.  The A.M. Jones plant is un-manned and Operators from the West Mitchell Hammock Water Plant remotely monitor all operations via SCADA.  Operators conducts daily inspection, maintenance and operates at the A.M. Jones Plant;.  The West Mitchell Hammock Plant is absent any RMP chemical at or above threshold levels.  The City has a unified Risk Management Program which applies to each plant.  Only the A. M. Jones Water Treatment Plant operations and policies are presented in this Plan.\n1.1.    ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION/EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES     (A)\nThe City of Oviedo A. M. Jones Water Treatment Plant accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates technologies, procedures and management practices.  The plant prevention program complies with all applicable procedures of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) 40 CFR-68 Prevention Program under the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990.\n1.2.    MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS (A) (1)\nThe City of Oviedo has a management system in place which is lead by the Utilities Manager, who oversees the implementation and on-going use of the RMP elements.  This program, along with other City-wide and plant-specific policies, eliminates and /or reduces the likelihood of a hazardous chemical release at the plant.  An organizational chart defining the lines of authority and responsible staff is included in the plants RMP Process Safety "

The program addresses each of the EPA Program Level 3-listed 12 elements, plus RMP elements needed to implement the program and the like elements in place at the plants.

STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE HANDLED AT CITY OF OVIEDO, FLORIDA SITE (B)  \nThe City of Oviedo A. M. Jones Water Treatment Plant is un-manned.  The West Mitchell plant has eight (8) full-time employees engaged in water treatment plant and field operations that include Chlorine used as part of the A.M. Jones plant treatment process.\n1.5.    SITE DESCRIPTION (B) (1)    \nThe site is owned and operated by The City of Oviedo and managed by its Utilities Department.  The site is located at 1600 Alafaya Woods Blvd, Oviedo, Seminole County, Florida.   The 2 acre site is located in an area, boarded by SR 250 Alafaya Woods Blvd on the east and by a school Stenstrom Elementary on the north, residences of Sugarberry Terrace on the south.\nThe Plant includes a separate covered chlorine storage area and adjacent control room plus injection feed distribution system that is contained in a separate process room as well as at various injector points? cabinets.\nThe boundaries of the chlorine system subject to the RMP regulation include the Bulk Chlorine Storage area, Chlorine scale area and Feed Control room, associated vent makeup, exhaust systems and chlorine injection cabinets at various injection points.  These are detailed in the Process and Instrument Drawings (P&ID) which are part of the plant Process Safety Information (PSI).  All drawings are maintained in the plants RMP Process S"

REGULATED SUBSTANCE (b) (2)\nChlorine is the only regulated substance on site which exceeds the EPA 40 CFR-68 rule threshold quantity of 2500 pounds.  The City of Oviedo chlorine process was installed as part of the process of purifying water for public consumption.  It operates under permit from the State of Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FL DEP).  The chlorine is received, stored and distributed to four process control injection systems. \nChlorine is an EPA and OSHA-listed toxic chemical.  It is an irritant and it is corrosive.  Chlorine is a halogen with the formula Cl2.  It is a chlorinating or oxidizing agent that is not flammable.  It has a 1 ppm OSHA ceiling Permissible Exposure Limit (PEL) and a NFPA health rating of 4, severe; with immediate and delayed health hazards.  Chlorine is not a carcinogen.\nThe maximum threshold quantity stored on site is 15 each one ton containers.  This equals 30,000 pounds.\n2.    HAZARD ASSESSMENT\nA hazard assessment was performed to determine the effects a release would have on the public. For chlorine, the distance a set endpoint concentration of the gas would travel must be determined.  In addition, an estimate of the population that could be affected by a release of chlorine was determined, and sensitive receptors such as hospitals, schools, and nursing homes were identified. The hazard assessment considers two release scenarios-a \"worst case\" and an \"alternative case\" and also compiles the five-year accident history for the WTP chlorine system (see section 4 below: five year accident history).\nTwo offsite consequence analyses were conducted which include two chlorine release scenarios.  The first is a ?worst case release?.  The second is a more probable ?alternative release scenario?.  The first scenario is defined by EPA, which states that ?the operator shall assume that the maximum quantity in the largest vessel is released as a gas over 10 minutes? due to an unspecified failure.

      "SummaryText": "e alternative scenario is defined as ?more likely to occur than the worst-case scenario?.\nAtmospheric dispersion modeling was performed to determine the distance traveled by the chlorine released before its concentration decreases to the ?toxic endpoint.?  The EPA specified endpoint for chlorine is 0.0087 mg/l which equals 3 ppm. The 3 ppm endpoint is the Emergency Response Planning Guideline Level 2 (ERPG-2).  This is defined by the American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA) as the ?maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects or symptoms which could impair an individual?s ability to take protective action.?  The residential population within a circle with a radius corresponding to the toxic endpoint distance was defined, ?to estimate the population potentially affected.?\n2.1.    WORST CASE   (C) (1)\nAtmospheric dispersion modeling for the worst case scenario was performed using the EPA assumptions and EPA?s RMP Comp Program.  Assumptions used were: \n?    liquefied under pressure, \n?    lb release, urban surroundings, \n?    no mitigation measure.  \nResults demonstrate a distance to the toxic endpoint of 1.3 miles containing 5.3 square miles of area assuming an urban topography without an enclosure.  The residential population that could potentially be affected by the release is reported as well as the data is maintained on site. Census 2000 demographic data was utilized when creating the re-submit.  There are residences, seminary, industry included in that release area (schools, commercial facilities and parks).\n2.2.    ALTERNATIVE CASE   (C) (2)\nThe alternative release scenario involves the failure of the regulator of the pressure system or the wip on pipes/valves connected to one of the one-ton containers.  This failure was defined during the recent Process Hazards Analysis.  This failure is equal to creating a 0.03 squ"
