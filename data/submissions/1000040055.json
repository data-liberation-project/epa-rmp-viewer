      "SummaryText": "A.The Keokuk Municipal Waterworks (KMWW) located at 8 N. Water Street in Keokuk, Iowa uses many systems (refer to section d. below) to prevent accidental releases of chlorine. Should a release occur KMWW employees are trained in what to do. One operator is always on duty. The Local fire dept. will provide support responders and provide fire response.\r\n  \r\nB. The KMWW property consists of approx. 5 acres, bounded by Main St. on the South, Water St. on the East or River side, First St. on the West side and the power plant employee parking lot on the North. The plant produces potable water for the City of Keokuk. Mississippi river water is conveyed to the plant through a screen house located upstream of the locks for dam #19. Treatment chemicals are delivered by truck. Chlorine is use to disinfect the final water product before storage and distribution. 2000 lb. chlorine cylinders are currently stored at the 1938 treatment facility.\r\n\r\nC. The offsite consequence analysis's considered two scenarios: Worst case and an alternative for chlorine.\r\nThe worst case scenario is defined by EPA, which states the the owner/operator shall assume that the maximum quantity in the largest vessel is released and vaporizes to gas over 10 minutes due to an unspecified failure. The alternative scenario is defined as more likely to occur than the worst case scenario.\r\n\r\nThe distance traveled by the chlorine released before its concentration decreases to the toxic endpoint selected by EPA as 3 ppm, which is the Emergency Response Planning Guideline Level 2 (ERPG-2). This is defined by the American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA) as the maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects or symptoms which could impair an individual's ability to take protective action. The residential population within a circle with a radius corresp"

      "SummaryText": "onding to the toxic endpoint distance was defined, to estimate the population potentially affected.\r\n\r\nThe chlorine worst-case release scenario assumes full cylinder of liquid, 2000 pounds. This amount will be lost in the 10 minute period by EPA definition. Therefore the spill rate is considered to be 200#/min. RMP offsite consequence analysis guidance, RMP version 1.06 was used for worst case end-point determination. At the worst case concentration of chlorine sensors in the chlorination room will automatically alarm the alert the operator of a problem. The endpoint radius for this worst case scenario is 1.3 miles or 6,900 ft. The population inside this area in all directions is 4,000. For toxic gas releases the only population that will potentially be affected are those within an elliptical plume extending downwind of the release point. This plum area, or footprint, is approx. 6% (one-twentieth) of the area of the full circle,\r\n\r\nAn alternative chlorine release assumes a leak of 0.4 pounds from the vacuum piping. EPA's Reference table 3 was used for toxic gas modeling. The toxic end point for this quantity and up to 21lbs/min of release to be 320 ft. and would reach only travelers on the bridge and any people in the church to the south.\r\n\r\nD. KMWW's accidental release prevention program is based on the following key elements.\r\nTrained and state certified operators operate the chlorine system.\r\nUse of vacuum regulators for all chlorine down stream of the 1 ton cylinders.\r\nPerformance of a hazard review of the equipment and procedures.\r\nUse of inspection and auditing programs.\r\n\r\nE. In June of 2013, when connecting the chlorine vapor line and vacuum valve to a full ton cylinder, a leak occurred, because of miss alignment of the lead washer.  This was considered a near-miss.  The Operator sensed the leak and immediately closed the valve.  The operator moved away to where the assisting mechanic was waiting.  No injury occurred.  The mechanic and operator allowed t"

The mechanic explained with a new washer and showed how to align the vacuum valve and connect it.  He then showed how to inspect it, before cracking open the valve.  No injuries, death or damages have occurred on or off site due to chlorine.\r\n\r\nF. The KMWW plant has an Emergency Response Plan and coordinates with the local fire dept. The fire department visits the plant at least annually. First aid, evacuation, Tornado, explosion and chlorine release scenarios are addressed. KMWW operators are involved in this porgram as key personnel with working knowledge of the chlorine system.\r\n\r\nG. Mass flow meters allow operators instant feedback of chlorine flow conditions via the SCADA and remote operator interface systen throughout the plant.  A less than 1% sodium hypochlorite generation system was installed and started operation on August 6, 2013.  The chlorine system has been used for back-up for warranty repairs on three occasions.  Chlorine was also needed to supplement the disinfection required in late February and a large part of March 2014 due to drastic changes in raw Mississippi water.  Organics and ammonia increases and the raw water hardness was less than 50% of its normal level.  This situation required use of both the new and old disinfection systems.  This unknown river condition has prompted a fifty percent capacity increase for <1% sodium hypochlorite generation.  That generator had been planned for when water production capacity would increase.  Completion of that third generator and the back-up 12% sodium hypochlorite system and training for it, will allow complete removal of chlorine from this facility."
