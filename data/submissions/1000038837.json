It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal, State, and local regulations. If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to immediately notify the Northwood Fire Department (via a 911 call) and request that it respond to the emergency. Incidental to the notification to the fire department, a call to the Hancock Emergency Management Agency will be made.\r\n\r\nWhile we have planned for an emergency, it is acknowledged that a real emergency will be unexpected and may very well be much different and cannot be ensured to duplicate what may have be planned. In reality, the situation that develops may not happen in the manner in which it has been planned. In that event, what may have been planned will serve only as a guideline to follow.\r\n\r\nThe Emergency Action Plan for this facility describes certain procedures that are intended to minimize the hazards associated with human health and the environment from fires, explosions, the sudden and unexpected release of chemicals (i.e., Anhydrous Ammonia), tornadoes, bomb threats or other accidents or acts of God which might occur on our premises. The primary emergency coordinator for the Northwood, Iowa location is the Location Team Leader.                                                    \r\n                 \r\nDESCRIPTION OF THE ANHYDROUS AMMONIA STORAGE/DISTRIBUTION PLANT AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCE HANDLED AT VIAFIELD, NORTHWOOD, IOWA:\r\n\r\nThe facility is a bulk anhydrous ammonia storage and distribution plant. The anhydrous ammonia that is stored at  this facility is distributed to agricultural crop producers in the surrounding area who utilize the anhydrous ammonia for crop nutrient purposes. \r\n\r\nThe system consists of multiple storage vessels with associated piping, valve, liquid pump(s) and other miscellaneous equipment.

The anhydrous ammonia system is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with ANSI Standard K-61.1-1999 with amendments and State law. The system is protected from major releases by internal excess flow valves, check valves, relief valves, manual shut-off valves, and emergency shut-off valves. The load out risers used in filling nurse tanks are protected by breakaway couplers designed to immediately stop the flow of ammonia if the line or a hose breaks. All of the main storage tank valves are locked when not in use.\r\n\r\nSince this facility is located in relatively close proximity to the Town of Northwood, provisions have been designed to notify all affected persons. An evacuation plan is in place.\r\n\r\nIn addition the company has specific operating procedures in place intended to minimize the potential for an accidental (and potentially catastrophic) release of anhydrous ammonia. Finally, Viafield has extended to the Northwood Volunteer Fire Department the opportunity to visit our anhydrous ammonia plant, to participate in mock emergency simulation training, and to avail themselves of specific anhydrous ammonia health hazard information and training provided by the company.\r\n\r\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\r\n\r\nViafield, Northwood, Iowa has never had an accident involving anhydrous ammonia that caused death, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations or shelterings in place.\r\n\r\nTHE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM:\r\n\r\nIn the event of an emergency involving our anhydro"

In the unlikely event that the Northwood Fire Department is unable to adequately respond to an emergency at our Northwood location, the Fire Department with whom Northwood has a reciprocal agreement will be summoned.  We have discussed this policy with the fire department and Hancock Emergency Management Agency. Members of the fire department and the Hancock Emergency Management Agency have inspected our anhydrous ammonia plant. In addition, copies of photographs taken of our plant have been provided (for reference) to both entities.\r\n\r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY:\r\n\r\nThe plan is to minimize those hazards to human health and to the environment that are associated with accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  Employees working at the bulk storage plant make routine observations prior to and during transfer operations of the anhydrous ammonia from the storage vessel(s) to nurse tanks.  In so doing, they are able to detect problems before they arise.  This routine inspection identifies any portion of the system which may be under stress or about to fail.  Repairs can be made before they become problematic.  Employees are annually trained to recognize the hazards associated with storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia.  In addition to annual training for employees who have been on the job for a number of years, the company conducts training for new hires.  This training includes classroom instructiion, on-site training at the plant, and follow-up observation to determine their individual comprehension and understanding of the new hire.  Finally, the company routinely invites local fire department personnel to visit the site.  In the event that the local fire department request assistance in training its employees on anhydrous ammonia, the company cooperates fully in their"
