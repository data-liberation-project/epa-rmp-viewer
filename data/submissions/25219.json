      "SummaryText": "THE OTTAWA COOPERATIVE ASSOCIATION IS AN AGRICULTURAL RETAILER THAT SPECIALIZES IN GRAIN STORAGE AND THE SALE OF AGRICULTURAL INPUTS FOR PRODUCTION.  THE TOTAL CAPACITY OF OUR NH3 PLANT IS 132,000 TOTAL POUNDS.  THE PLANT CONSISTS OF 1-18,000 AND 1-12,000 GALLON TANKS.\n\nTHE WORST CASE SCENARIO WOULD BE THE RELEASE OF THE  TOTAL CONTENTS OF THE LARGEST STORAGE TANK WHICH INCLUDES 79,000 POUNDS.  THE DISTANCE TO ENDPOINT WOULD BE 1.89 MILES AND HAS THE POTENTIAL TO AFFECT 2500 AREA RESIDENTS.  THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE WOULD HAVE A RUPTURE OF A TRANSFER HOSE, RELEASING 11,908 POUNDS AND HAVE A DISTANCE TO ENDPOINT OF .83 MILES AFFECTING NEARLY 1200 CITIZENS.\n\nTHE FACILITY HAS IMPLEMENTED THE PROVISIONS OF ANSI K-61, OSHA 29 CFR 1910.111 AS WELL AS THE KANSAS DEPT OF AGRICULTURE.  THE STATE INSPECTS OUR PLANT ON A ANNUAL BASIS AND WE COMPLY WITH ALL THEIR REQUEST FOR IMPROVEMENT.  OUR EMPLOYEES ARE TRAINED ON A REGULAR BASIS IN GENERAL SAFETY, THE HAZARDS OF AMMONIA, OPERATING PROCEDURES AND MAINTENANCE PROCEDURES OF A TYPICAL FACILITY.  THE EMPLOYEES ALWAYS WEAR THE APPROPRIATE GLOVES AND GOGGLES DURING LOADING OPERATIONS.  ADDITIONALLY, CLEAN SAFETY WATER IS ON HAND DURING NURSE TANK FILLING OPERATIONS.  WITH THIS IN MIND, IT'S ESPECIALLY EASY TO REPORT THAT NO ACCIDENTAL RELEASES HAVE OCCURED AT THIS LOCATION WITHIN THE LAST FIVE YEARS.\n\nTHIS FACILITY HAS A WRITTEN EMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN AND HAS BEEN SHARED WITH THE LOCAL FIRE DEPARTMENT.  THE FIRE DEPT IS AWARE OF THE DANGERS OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA AND THEY'VE AGREED TO ASSIST IN THE EVENT OF AN EMERGENCY INCIDENT."
