This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, including the training of personnel and the consideration of safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, our highly trained personnel, working in cooperation with appropriate governmental agencies, will quickly respond to, control, and contain the release. In the unlikely event of a catastrophic release, the Refinery, working in conjunction with local emergency management staff, is well-prepared to respond and mitigate adverse consequences to the community and the environment. The Refinery maintains an accurate and comprehensive emergency response plan. This plan is also maintained in the Douglas County Emergency Government Center. Emergency notification of the public is coordinated through local governmental agencies.\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nSuperior Refining Company LLC, located in Superior, Wisconsin, operates a variety of processes to produce petroleum products from raw crude oil, including fuel gas, propane, butane, fuel oil, gasoline and asphalt. The Refinery has several regulated flammables, such as propane and butane as well as hydrogen fluoride (HF), which is a regulated toxic substance.\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM STEPS\n\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at the Refinery.

The Refinery has a computerized process control system, which helps the operators to ensure that the process is maintained within these limits. Process control systems, monitoring instruments, highly-trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems) provide a safe operating environment.\n\n\n\nThe Refinery also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment. This information includes, e.g., materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, etc. This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nSuperior Refining Company has a comprehensive program in place to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled. Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\n\n\nThe Refinery primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations. HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques. The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary. \n\n\n\nThe Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) team findings are forwarded to management for"

This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention. All approved mitigation options being implemented in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained pursuant to normal document retention policies.\n\n\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, Superior Refining Company periodically updates and revalidates the HAZOP analysis and results. These periodic reviews are conducted at least every five (5) years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating. The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained pursuant to normal document retention policies. Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained pursuant to normal document retention policies.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nSuperior Refining Company maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process. These written procedures can be used as a reference by operators and provide a basis for consistent instruction of new operators. These written procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate. The written procedures are maintained current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the Management of Change process. \n\n\n\nIn addition, the operating procedures at the Refinery provide guidance on how to respond to upset conditions for specific proce"

This information, along with written operating procedures, is readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, Superior Refining Company has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in process operations.  All new employees receive basic training in refinery operations, as well as training on the refinery safety and PSM/RMP programs and OSHA's 40-Hour HAZWOPER Standard 29 CFR 1910.120(q).\n\n\n\nAfter successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks, and to train on the written operating procedures. After new operators demonstrate (e.g., through written tests and skills demonstration) adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner, they can work independently.\n\n\n\n In addition, operators periodically receive refresher training on operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained. This refresher training is conducted at least every three (3) years. All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training. Superior Refining Company also conducts annual HAZWOPER training to provide all operating and maintenance employees with spill response training as outlined in OSHA's HAZWOPER Standard and has a system in place to provide operators with regulatory training updates. Training manuals are available to the operators.\n\n\n\nContractors\n\nSuperior Refining Company uses contractors to supplement its work force.
