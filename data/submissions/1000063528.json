This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, including the training of personnel and the consideration of safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, our highly trained personnel, working in cooperation with appropriate governmental agencies, will quickly respond to, control, and contain the release. In the unlikely event of a catastrophic release, the Refinery, working in conjunction with local emergency management staff, is well-prepared to respond and mitigate adverse consequences to the community and the environment. The Refinery maintains an accurate and comprehensive emergency response plan. This plan is also maintained in the Douglas County Emergency Government Center. Emergency notification of the public is coordinated through local governmental agencies.\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nSuperior Refining Company LLC, located in Superior, Wisconsin, operates a variety of processes to produce petroleum products from raw crude oil, including fuel gas, propane, butane, fuel oil, gasoline and asphalt. The Refinery has several regulated flammables, such as propane and butane as well as hydrogen fluoride (HF), which is a regulated toxic substance.\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM STEPS\n\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at the Refinery. Because processes that are regulated by the EPA RMP regulation are also subject to the OSHA PSM standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements that are part of the RMP Prevention Program and"

Each element of the OSHA PSM standard is assigned an element leader and the responsibilities of the element leaders are outlined in the PSM program, which is maintained at the Refinery.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nSuperior Refining Company encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management, accident prevention, and operations. Examples of employee participation include, but are not limited to, compiling technical documents, serving on various committees, development of procedures, and participating as members of process hazard analysis (PHA) teams. Employees have access to information created as part of the refinery accident prevention program. Specific ways that employees are involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an Employee Participation Plan. In addition, the Refinery has a number of programs in place that address process safety and employee safety issues. These processes include forming teams to promote both process and personal safety. Team members are from various areas of the plant, including operations, maintenance, engineering, and plant management.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nSuperior Refining Company maintains a variety of technical documents that are used to help ensure safe process operation. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information. Chemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in safety data sheets (SDS). This information is available to all employees through a computerized access system, and supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.

The Refinery has a computerized process control system, which helps the operators to ensure that the process is maintained within these limits. Process control systems, monitoring instruments, highly-trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems) provide a safe operating environment.\n\n\n\nThe Refinery also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment. This information includes, e.g., materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, etc. This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nSuperior Refining Company has a comprehensive program in place to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled. Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\n\n\nThe Refinery primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations. HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques. The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary. \n\n\n\nThe Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) team findings are forwarded to management for"

This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention. All approved mitigation options being implemented in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained pursuant to normal document retention policies.\n\n\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, Superior Refining Company periodically updates and revalidates the HAZOP analysis and results. These periodic reviews are conducted at least every five (5) years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating. The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained pursuant to normal document retention policies. Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained pursuant to normal document retention policies.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nSuperior Refining Company maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process. These written procedures can be used as a reference by operators and provide a basis for consistent instruction of new operators. These written procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate. The written procedures are maintained current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the Management of Change process. \n\n\n\nIn addition, the operating procedures at the Refinery provide guidance on how to respond to upset conditions for specific proce"

This information, along with written operating procedures, is readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, Superior Refining Company has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in process operations.  All new employees receive basic training in refinery operations, as well as training on the refinery safety and PSM/RMP programs and OSHA's 40-Hour HAZWOPER Standard 29 CFR 1910.120(q).\n\n\n\nAfter successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks, and to train on the written operating procedures. After new operators demonstrate (e.g., through written tests and skills demonstration) adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner, they can work independently.\n\n\n\n In addition, operators periodically receive refresher training on operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained. This refresher training is conducted at least every three (3) years. All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training. Superior Refining Company also conducts annual HAZWOPER training to provide all operating and maintenance employees with spill response training as outlined in OSHA's HAZWOPER Standard and has a system in place to provide operators with regulatory training updates. Training manuals are available to the operators.\n\n\n\nContractors\n\nSuperior Refining Company uses contractors to supplement its work force.

The Superior Refining Company evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the contractor selection process. Refinery personnel monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\n\n\nPre-Startup Safety Reviews (PSSR)\n\nSuperior Refining Company conducts a PSSR for facility modifications that warrant a change in the process safety information or operating procedures. The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and the equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service. This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that supporting systems are operationally ready. The PSSR team uses checklists to verify aspects of readiness. A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves as a final check that program requirements are properly implemented.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nSuperior Refining Company has well-established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition. The basic aspects of this program include: (1) conducting training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting identified deficiencies, and (5) applying quality assurance measures.

Superior Refining Company has a comprehensive training program for all maintenance workers. Written maintenance procedures help ensure that work is performed in a consistent manner. Inspections and tests help ensure that equipment functions as intended and verify that equipment is fit for service (e.g., adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels). If a deficiency is identified, the deficiency will be corrected before placing the equipment back into service. The temporary use of equipment would be allowed only after the system is reviewed to determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment until a repair can be made (e.g., reduction of pressures or temperatures). The temporary use of equipment is covered under the Management of Change (MOC) policy, which addresses these types of issues.\n\n\n\nAnother integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance. Superior Refining Company incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs. This helps ensure that equipment and parts are suitable for their intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made. \n\n\n\nSafe Work Practices\n\nSuperior Refining Company has long-standing safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety. Examples of these include (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of all personnel, (2) a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) procedures for safe removal of hazardous materials before process piping or equipment is opened, (4) a permit and procedure process to control spark-producing activities (i.e., hot work), and (5) a permit a"

Compliance audits are conducted at least every three (3) years. Both hourly and management personnel participate as audit team members. The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to Refinery management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are retained at the Refinery pursuant to normal document retention policies. \n\n\n\nCHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nHazards inherent in the processes at the Refinery are managed to ensure continued safe operation. The accident prevention program summarized previously is applied to EPA RMP-covered processes at the Refinery. Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by (1) equipment failures or (2) human errors.\n\n\n\nIn addition to the accident prevention program activities, Superior Refining Company has safety features on many units to help (1) contain and control a release, (2) quickly detect a release, and (3) reduce the consequences of (mitigate) a release. The following types of safety features are used in various processes:\n\n\n\nRelease Detection:\n\n* Fixed hydrocarbon detectors with alarms\n\n* Fixed hydrogen sulfide detectors with alarms\n\n* Fixed hydrogen fluoride detectors with alarms\n\n* Portable hydrocarbon/H2S detectors\n\n\n\nRelease Containment and Control:\n\n* Process relief valves that discharge to a flare to "

Procedures are available to all personnel in a Standard Practice Instruction (SPI) manual maintained at the Refinery.\n\n\n\nManagement of Change\n\nSuperior Refining Company has a comprehensive system to manage changes to processes. This system requires that changes to items or activities such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before implementation. Changes are reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage new hazards and (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change. Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures, are updated to incorporate these changes. In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided necessary training on the change.\n\n\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nSuperior Refining Company promptly investigates incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire, explosion, or toxic gas release that caused major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury. The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident. The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to Refinery management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with employees (includi"

Also, Superior Refining Company has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment, as well as instructions that address the use of emergency response equipment. Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties. The emergency response program is reviewed when necessary and updated based on modifications made to refinery processes. \n\n\n\nThe overall emergency response program for Superior Refining Company is coordinated with the Douglas County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC), Douglas County Emergency Management, Superior Fire Department, Superior Police Department, Douglas County Sheriff's Office, and state and federal agencies through the Incident Command System. This coordination includes periodic meetings of the LEPC, which includes local emergency response officials, government officials, and industry representatives. Superior Refining Company has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate community officials (e.g., the fire department, regional hazmat team) and emergency response organizations through the 911 system. In the event of a release that so warrants, 911 would be called with information on potential community impact(s). The local community government and response personnel would then initiate the proper response warranted by the situation. This system provides a means of facilitating quick response to an incident, as well as notifying the public of an incident if necessary. In addition to periodic LEPC meetings, Superior Refining Company conducts periodic emergency response exercises that involve refinery personnel, contractors, and emergency response organizations.
