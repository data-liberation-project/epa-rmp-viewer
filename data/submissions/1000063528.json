Superior Refining Company has a comprehensive training program for all maintenance workers. Written maintenance procedures help ensure that work is performed in a consistent manner. Inspections and tests help ensure that equipment functions as intended and verify that equipment is fit for service (e.g., adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels). If a deficiency is identified, the deficiency will be corrected before placing the equipment back into service. The temporary use of equipment would be allowed only after the system is reviewed to determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment until a repair can be made (e.g., reduction of pressures or temperatures). The temporary use of equipment is covered under the Management of Change (MOC) policy, which addresses these types of issues.\r\n\r\nAnother integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance. Superior Refining Company incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs. This helps ensure that equipment and parts are suitable for their intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made. \r\n\r\nSafe Work Practices\r\nSuperior Refining Company has long-standing safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety. Examples of these include (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of all personnel, (2) a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) procedures for safe removal of hazardous materials before process piping or equipment is opened, (4) a permit and procedure process to control spark-producing activities (i.e., hot work), and (5) a permit a"

These procedures (and others), along with training of personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely. Procedures are available to all personnel in a Standard Practice Instruction (SPI) manual maintained at the Refinery.\r\n\r\nManagement of Change\r\nSuperior Refining Company has a comprehensive system to manage changes to processes. This system requires that changes to items or activities such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before implementation. Changes are reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage new hazards and (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change. Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures, are updated to incorporate these changes. In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided necessary training on the change.\r\n\r\nIncident Investigation\r\nSuperior Refining Company promptly investigates incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire, explosion, or toxic gas release that caused major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury. The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident. The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to Refinery management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with employees (includi"
