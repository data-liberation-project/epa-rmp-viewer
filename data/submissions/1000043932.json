The facility has developed and maintains accident prevention WTP programs to prevent and mitigate the effects of hazardous chemical releases. \r\n\r\n2. Description of Stationary Source\r\n\r\nThe Highland  WTP is located on at 1020 Highland Avenue, Orlando, Orange County, Florida.  Highland WTP adds chlorine in their chlorination process in order to disinfect  the City's water supply.\r\n\r\nLiquefied chlorine gas is stored in up to twenty one-ton containers at the Chlorination process building.  Ten one-ton containers are always connected to the process.  Five one-ton containers are on-line at one time feeding the system with five on standby when those are exhausted.  There are ten more one-ton cylinders in storage.  The total chlorine inventory in the process at any one time is 40,000 lbs.  This is greater than the 2,500 lb. RMP threshold quantity for chlorine.  This process is enclosed in a building.\r\n\r\nThe chlorine building at Highland is equipped with an automated chlorine scrubber system.  The scrubber system is activated by two chlorine detectors which are located inside the building, one in the chlorine dock area and one in the chlorination room.  If the chlorine detectors indicate that chlorine is present at a concentration above the preset level, the louvers of the building will automatically close and the scrubber will start.  The scrubber fan will pull the released chlorine gas through the scrubber, which chemically removes the chlorine from the air.  The scrubber can handle a full one-ton container of chlorine before the scrubbing medium is exhausted.  The chlorine detectors are also interlocked to an audible and visual alarm at the site and audible and visual alarms on the Operator's control panel at the Pershing Control Center.  The Control Panel will also indicate to the operator that the scrubber has star"

      "SummaryText": "ted.  When the Operator sees the chlorine alarm, he can dispatch OUC personnel and City or County emergency response personnel to the site immediately if necessary.  Additionally, an emergency shutoff valve actuator is installed on each chlorine ton container, which allows remote isolation of the container contents in an emergency.\r\n\r\n3. Prevention Program\r\n\r\nFor the Chlorination process, this facility exceeds the chlorine threshold quantity for the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard, 1910.119, however this is an unmanned site and is therefore not subject to the PSM requirements.  For RMP compliance purposes, this places the Highland  WTP  Chlorination process in the Program 2 level.  The Highland facility will address all elements for the Prevention Program 2 as required by the RMP rule.\r\n\r\nThe Prevention Program 2 contains the following elements: a Process Hazard Review of the process, Process Safety Information,  Preventative Maintenance Program, and Operating Procedures. Compliance Audits, Safety Training, and Incident Investigation have also been incorporated into this program to promote continued safe operation and prompt correction of deficiencies.  The Prevention Program receives full support of plant management and involvement of employees at all levels.\r\n\r\n4. Accident History\r\n\r\nIn the past five yesrs, the Highland facility has had no accidental releases of chlorine that meet the RMP rule criteria for reporting in the 5-year accident history.\r\n\r\n5. Emergency Response Program\r\n\r\nThe Pershing Control Center has an Emergency Response Procedure in place. The Plant Operator at the Pershing Control Center has accident assessment capabilities and can respond immediately to all emergencies by dispatching appropriate personnel to the site. The OUC Water Production mechanics have been trained in chlorine safety and have a procedure for addressing small releases of chlorine. The current procedure has been coordinated with the Orlando Fire Department and Ha"
