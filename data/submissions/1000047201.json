Our commitment to Safety and Environmental Protection in the Air Liquide Large Industries U.S. LP (ALLIUS), Freeport Plant must extend beyond the gates. As part of the community, we have a responsibility to our customers and to those who live in the surrounding area. Through safety, concern for the environment, and community involvement, we can develop a true partnership with our customers and neighbors.\n\n\n\nRegulated Chemical\n\nThe plant produces a \"syngas\" (Hydrogen-Carbon Monoxide mixture) which is sold to industrial customer(s). The processes used to create this mixture involve pretreated natural gas, and bulk CO2 removal. The plant also produces steam and electricity. The plant is designed for continuous operation and is designed for inherently safe operation.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention\n\nThe flammability of this process makes it necessary for the Freeport Plant to observe certain safety precautions to prevent unnecessary exposure, and reduce the threat to personnel and nearby members of the community. It is ALLIUS' policy to adhere to all applicable federal and state rules and regulations. Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle the material including equipment design and safe handling procedures used to operate the equipment. ALLIUS' release prevention program is based on inherently safe design, effective written procedures, training, and an overall commitment to safe work practices. The Hydrogen-Carbon Monoxide gas mixture equipment meets or exceeds design codes and standards. Operations and maintenance personnel are thoroughly trained on proper procedures and safety hazards.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response\n\nALLIUS's Freeport plant has developed a comprehensive Emergency Response Program. In the event of an accidental release, the emergency response plan includes notifying the local Fire Departm"
