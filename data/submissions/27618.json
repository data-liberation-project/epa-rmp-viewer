The site is a OSHA VPP Star site and it's Quality and Environmental management systems are certified for ISO 9001 and ISO 14001 standards.\n\nThe Process Safety Information documentation and updating functions are assigned to different department managers and detailed in the \"Site Employee Participation Plan\" document.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis are coducted on a five year schedule by suitable process hazard analysis teams. The teams are composed of a team leader, personnel having knowledge of production and maintenance procedures and a production operator. Normally the HAZOP and What If / Checklist methods are used. The completion of recommendations are tracked by an electronic data base. The Process and Quality (PQC) Manager is responsible for implementation of this RMP element.\n\nThe Standard Operating Procedures (SOP's) are written and updated by the process and production engineers / supervisors. The Production Manager is responsible for keeping the SOP's current. The SOP's are verified and certified for correctness once a year. The SOP's are available to relevant personnel via a LAN system and a Hard copy of each SOP is available in the applicable production area.\n\nThe training is planned and tracked by the Safety and Training Manager according to the annual training plan. The training materials include manuals, lesson plans, video tapes, overheads and  field equipment. The uderstanding of the training is verified by written tests, oral examinations and demonstrations. Any one or all of these may be employed. The training activities are tracked by a training database.\n\nThe Engineering Manager is responsible for implementation of the Mechanical Integrity Program.

A committee consisting of various technical personnel reviews  and approves all MOC requests. The completion of all action items is tracked and documented via an electronic database.\n\nAnnual and tri - annual compliance audits are coordinated by the PQC Manager.  Normally they are led by corporate expert personnel. Deficiencies are noted and scheduled for system improvements by the responsible managers. The completion of recommendations is tracked and documented via an electronic database.\n\nThe Incident Investigation Program  consists of a detailed procedure incoporated in the Safety Procedures Manual. All regulated chemical releases are investigated by the area supervisor by forming an incident investigation team  and issued as preliminary reports to a committee. The committee reviews the reports to ensure that root causes have been identified and suitable corrective actions have been proposed. The Safety and Training Manager then issues a final incident investigation report by incorporating information and feed back from all sources and reviews. The final reports are distributed to all supervisory personnel, who in turn discuss these with their employees in their safety contacts. All action items are tracked and the completion is documented vis an electronic database.\n\nThere is a written Employee Participation Plan document, which describes  the major requirements of various RMP elements and  how the employees participate in their implementation.

Mitigation systems used are dikes, sumps, sprinkler systems, deluge systems, water curtains, hazmat foam system, fire fighting foam systems, mineral oil dump systems and neutralization. Most of process areas are monitored by leak detection and alarms systems for toxic and flammable leaks.Operator refresher training is conducted on prescribed basis of the operator training program. The preventive maintenance program conducts inspections and tests to assure operation of preventive devices.
