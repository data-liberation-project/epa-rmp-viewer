The following summary addresses the necessary steps taken to comply with these regulations.\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nLion Oil Company (Lion) has developed the Process Safety Information (PSI) program with the participation and input of our employees from management, supervisory, hourly, and technical positions at the El Dorado refinery.  This program requires that all Lion employees contribute to the collection and retention of PSI that is covered under OSHA\u00c2\u00bfs PSM Standard, 29 CFR 1910.119 (d) (1-3) and EPA\u00c2\u00bfs RMP Standard, 40 CFR 68.65 (a-d).  Several process units at Lion contain a sufficient amount of highly hazardous chemicals to be covered by the OSHA PSM Standard and the EPA RMP Standard.  Lion recognizes the value of the good engineering and management principles promoted by these regulations and has chosen to apply some elements of the PSI Program to units and areas of the refinery that are not covered by the PSM/RMP regulations.  \n\nComplete and accurate written information concerning process chemistry, process technology, and process equipment is essential to an effective PSM Program and to a process hazard analysis (PHA).  The information addressed by this program is an essential resource for conducting PHA\u00c2\u00bfs; employee training, contractor safety, mechanical integrity, procedures, pre-startup safety reviews, management of change, emergency preparedness, and insurance and compliance audits.

These documents are available to all employees via a computerized MSDS management system.\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nThe refinery processes that contain quantities of regulated substances above threshold quantities are evaluated for potential hazards using the hazop method supplemented by checklists and what-if lists as necessary.  The evaluations are conducted by a team consisting on personnel fimilar with the evaluation methods, refinery operations, maintenance, safety, training, and environmental compliance.

This commitment is demonstrated by an accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as the design of new systems, installation of equipment, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at the refinery.  It is the company policy to implement reasonable controls to prevent the foreseeable releases of regulated chemicals.  However, in the event that an accidental release occurs, an emergency response plan that designates the roles of individuals has been established to mitigate the impact of the release within practical limits.  \n\n\nThe Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nThe Lion Oil Company refinery in El Dorado processes sour crude oil at a production rate of approximately 75,000 barrels per day (42 gals/bls).  The petroleum products include gasoline, diesel, asphalt, coatings, and small quantities of other intermediate products.  The refinery operation produces or uses several regulated substances including propane, butane, hydrogen gas, hydrogen sulfide, and chlorine.  Flammable mixtures make up the majority of these regulated substances.\n\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s)\n\nFor program level 3 processes, one worst case toxic and one worst case flammable release scenario was reported in the RMP, each of which represents the greatest distance to endpoint for the respective hazard class.  In addition, at least one alternate case scenario was reported for each hazard class.\n\nThe toxic worst case and alternate case scenarios both involved the accidental release of chlorine used in treating cooling water at the #6 cooling tower.

The worst case toxic release scenario is a total failure of a chlorine cylinder that would result in a 2000 pound liquid and gaseous release of chlorine causing off-site consequences.  The alternate toxic release scenario is the partial damage to a chlorine cylinder that could result in approximately 1300 pound release causing off-site consequences.  Employee training, PPE and leak repair kits would be mitigating factors to these releases.  \n\nSeveral release scenarios were evaluated in order to identify appropriate worst and alternate case flammable scenarios.  Of the scenarios evaluated, a catastrophic failure of Tank 536 was identified as the worst case flammable release scenario.  This release could potentially include approximately 3.5 million pounds of flammable hydrocarbon mixture resulting in a vapor cloud explosion causing off-site consequences.  The alternate case flammable release is a failure of the 185 Tank resulting in the release of approximately 300,000 pounds of flammable hydrocarbon mixture.  Such a release could result in a vapor cloud explosion (VCE) and a boiling liquid expanding vapor explosion (BLEVE) both resulting in off-site consequences.  Employee training, PPE, and both fixed and mobile fire suppression equipment are in place to mitigate the results of these releases.  \n\nIs should be noted that the worst case and alternate case flammable release scenarios presented in this hazard assessment are based on very conservative situations which are unlikely to occur.  A detailed Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) explosion consequence study of the refinery was recently completed by ABS Consulting in January of 2009.  This CFD study evaluated a number of potential explosion scenarios within the process units at the refinery based on detailed, site-specific information.  None of the detailed"
