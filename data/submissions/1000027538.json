Save Mart's safety and environmental policies are administered by the Facility Maintenance Manager, who conducts periodic inspections of the facility to ensure compliance, and oversees the entire safety and environmental programs, including the PSM/CalARP/RMP Program.\n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\n\n\nSave Mart is located at 9999 Niblick Street, in Roseville, California.  The facility is approximately 0.8 miles west of Highway 65 and 5.8 miles north of Interstate 80.  The area immediately surrounding the facility is urban with a mixture of light commercial/industrial areas with a few scattered residential areas nearby.  \n\n\n\nThe primary business of Save Mart is to provide cooling and storage of food products. In order to conduct operations, the facility maintains a refrigeration system containing a maximum of 25,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia, a regulated substance.  The refrigeration system, consisting of piping, valves, and equipment, cycles ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, and then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration for the storage of produce.  Typical operating conditions range from 32 psig on the low pressure side of the system to 135 psig on the high side.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nThe Save Mart ammonia refrigeration system has many safety features.  Much of the safety of the system is inherent in the policies and procedures that govern the operation of the system.  For example, the facility operates in accordance with Cal/OSHA's Process Safety Management regulation.  The facility conducts prev"

These safety features include ammonia sensors in the engine room.  In addition, the majority of the ammonia is maintained inside the engine room and just outside of the engine room (condensers). All pressure vessels are equipped with pressure relief valves that vent to the atmosphere.\n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nIn the past five years (March 2007 to March 2012), there have been no significant releases of ammonia at the facility that exceeded the Federal Reportable Quantity of 100 pounds or the state requirement mandating immediate reporting of any release or threatened release of a hazardous material.  In addition, there have been no injuries resulting from an ammonia release, nor any releases or \"near misses\" that warranted an internal incident investigation.\n\n \n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe Save Mart facility has an emergency response plan in effect.  The Emergency Response Plan (Plan) is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of this PSM/RMP/CalARP document. This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n\n\n  1.)  To save lives.\n\n  2.)  To minimize and avoid injuries.\n\n  3.)  To protect the environment.\n\n  4.)  To minimize property damage.\n\n\n\nThe operator of the facility maintains a safety committee whose members are the designated emergency coordinators for the facility.  The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures, which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed "

This Plan was reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM, RMP and CalARP regulations.\n\n\n\nIn case of an ammonia emergency, the facility plans to evacuate all employees and contractors and activate the facility's response plan to respond to the situation.  If necessary, they will alert the local emergency responders (fire department) for assistance. The facility plans to coordinate emergency response efforts with the fire department on a periodic and ongoing basis.\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nThe Process Hazards Analysis Revalidation, conducted on March 14, 2012, including a Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) study and a Facility Inspection, provided mitigation measures to improve safety at the Save Mart facility.  The Save Mart safety committee is planning to complete several items over the next year, as a continual effort to provide a safe work environment for their employees.  These changes include the following items:\n\n\n\n1. Continue to train all employees in the facility Safety Plan/Programs.\n\n\n\n2. Continue to have employee involvement in Safety Plan Development.\n\n\n\n3. Continue employee involvement through safety team participation.\n\n\n\n4. Continue internal and external safety audits/inspections and implement changes as needed.\n\n"
