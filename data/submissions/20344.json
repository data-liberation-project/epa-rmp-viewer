Facility Policy:  The management and employees of Growers Cooperative, Inc. are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia through the use of proper equipment, regular inspections, maintenance and training of all persons that work with anhydrous ammonia.  Should an accidental release occur, this facility has worked with the local fire department and local emergency planning committee so they can plan for response to a release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2.  Facility Information:  The primary activity at this facility is the storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application to the soil as a crop production nutrient.  The maximum quantity stored is 170000 pounds.  This facility stores anhydrous ammonia in 2 tanks.  \n\n3.  Worst-Case Scenario:  Failure of the largest storage tank when filled to the maximum allowed capacity of 85% would release the total contents or 80000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia as a gas in a period of ten minutes.  Company procedures and equipment design standards limit the maximum filling capacity of tanks to 85% of capacity.  The distance to the endpoint of dispersion based on the model used is 1.9 miles.\n\nAlternative-Case Scenario:  The alternative-case scenario is assumed to be a release of 11908 pounds of anhydrous ammonia in a period of two minutes from the rupture of a 2 inch transfer pipe.

The prime Refrigerant used is Anhydrous Ammonia in a closely controlled and monitored environment. The Refrigeration system is Computer controlled with built in safeguards which is monitored 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. The facility has personnel \"on call\" at all times that are trained and qualified to handle any emergency situation that may arise. The system is monitored in each Room that the process takes place by a computer linked detection system.  \n\nAmmonia is a self-alarming substance with a distinctive pungent odor. Due to this odor, persons exposed to ammonia vapor will not voluntarily stay in the area of even small concentrations (these concentrations would not result in health risks). The Department of Transportation classifies ammonia as a non-flammable. Ammonia will burn however, but only in a very narrow and high range of concentration with high temperature. \n\nThe U.S. Occupational and Health Administration (OSHA) have made a determination on the permissible exposure of ammonia to people. The maximum allowable exposure for eight hours is 50 PPM (parts per million). \n\n\nWorst Case Scenario \n\nThe worse case scenario of an ammonia spill at the Sumter, SC facility was chosen to be a vessel rupture. We have conducted our own modeling as guidance for this report. The RMP Ammonia Program Plan was closely followed to ensure compliance.

The release rate is 500 pounds per minute in a 10-minute period, with a 1.5 mph wind; the distance to the end point equals 0.3 miles. There are no schools, hospitals, prisons or recreational areas within the scope of this model. There are however, office and industrial buildings in the affected area.
