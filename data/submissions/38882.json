The City WWTP has a total of eight employees in which are all trained in chlorine safety and how to handle any accidental release of chlorine.  At the wastewater plant we have four selfcontrained airpacs and we also have two complete ton emergency repair kits for ton cyclinders.  Also the City of Forest Fire Dept. has one complete ton emergency repair kit and the fire fighters are trained in how to handle a chlorine release.  The Fire Dept. is trained to put up a water curtain if needed to contain the release as much as possible.  We also have a chlorine sensor and alarm to alert the operator at the wastewater plant of any problem.  The operator at the plant checks all of the chlorination system at least every two hours.  If we have a release that requires people to evacuate for a certain are we use the police dept. and all forces to accomplish this action."
