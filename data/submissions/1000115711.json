Should an accidental release occur, this facility with assistance from\ncorporate personnel shall respond accordingly. This facility has worked with the local fire\ndepartment and local Tennessee Emergency Management team so they can plan for response\nto a release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment in its close\nproximity.\n\n(a)\tAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response.  Public and employee safety, as well as environmental protection, are primary issues of concern to Eco-Energy Stone Mountain, LLC (Eco).  Accidental release prevention and emergency planning are a key factors in the design, construction and operation of all Eco facilities.  Eco facilities are constructed in accordance with applicable codes/standards and are evaluated to ensure that the equipment complies with recognized and generally accepted good engineering practices.  Eco facilities are equipped with many engineering safeguards (i.e.:  pressure relief valves, shutdowns, alarms, etc.) that are designed to prevent situations that would require an emergency response.  This information is provided to applicable outside agencies that might be called upon for assistance in an emergency situation (i.e.:  police department, fire department, EMS, etc.).\n\n(b)\tStationary Source and Regulated Substances.  The Stone Mountain Rail Terminal is a stationary source as defined in 40 CFR 68.3.  The regulated substances at the facility are flammable chemicals including Natural Gas Liquids (NGL), butane, and propane.  NGLs are an aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbon mixture containing N-pentane, iso-pentane"

      "SummaryText": ", N-butane, iso-butane, propane, ethane, and methane.  As a flammable mixture, these chemicals have an RMP regulated threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds.  Chemicals enter the facility via truck, rail, and pipeline transport, are stored temporarily in pressure vessels while on site, and are dispensed off-site by truck and rail transport.\n\n(c)\tWorst-Case Release Scenario, Alternative Worst-Case Release Scenario, and Administrative/Mitigative Controls.  The worst-case release scenario (WCRS) would be a rupture of a Product Storage Tank.  Such a release has the potential to form a vapor cloud that could explode with a 10% yield when exposed to an ignition source.  Using the EPA's Risk Management Program RMP*Comp (TM) for Offsite Consequences Analysis, the greatest WCRS endpoint of 1psi was calculated to be 0.9 miles from the tank.  Using EPA's census data, MARPLOT, and knowledge of the area, it was determined that 280 residents or public receptors were within this WCRS distance.  An alternate release scenario was performed using the same procedure described above, except that a 3% yield was used in accordance with guidance.  The resulting endpoint was 0.3 miles from the tank.  Using Census data from MARPLOT, it was determined that 50 residents were within the alternate WCRS distance.  \n\nVarious administrative and engineering controls have been implemented/installed as safeguards to prevent deviations outside safe operating limits.  Administrative controls include utilizing a well-trained operation and maintenance staff that periodically visit and inspect the facility.  Engineering safeguards include such things as high pressure/overpressure relief valves, high-pressure shutdowns, high temperature shutdowns, high level shutdowns, etc.\n\n(d)\tHazard Communication Program.  Eco has developed and implemented a Company Hazard Communication Program that ensures:  1) an SDS is on file for all hazardous chemicals used or stored in the facility; 2) all applicable containers of haz"

      "SummaryText": "ardous chemicals are properly labeled/marked; and 3) employees receive annual training on the Company's Hazard Communication Program.\n\n(e)\tFive Year Accident History.  The Stone Mountain Rail Terminal has not had a regulated flammable chemical release in the previous five years.\n\n(f)\tPlanned Changes to Improve Safety.  Eco is always looking for ways to improve their safety program.  Eco believes the effectiveness of the safety program is directly proportional to employee involvement and senior management support.  Recently revised all operating\nprocedures with the team and underwent thorough training program. New EH&S software has\nbeen implemented. Process Hazard Analysis has been completed and recommendations are being evaluated and addressed."
