We fall into the Program 2 Prevention Program.\n\n     We have liquid chlorine in quantities above the threshold quantity as specified in Section\n68.115 of 40 CFR Part 68, and therefore must comply with the RMP program.  This program\nprovides our facility with an integrated approach to identifying and managing the hazard posed by\nregulated substances.  Under this program, our facility has assessed and continues to assess\nhazards to determine how accidental releases can impact the public health and environment.  \nBecause we are committed to the success of our written risk management program, we encourage\nall suggestions.  We strive for a comprehensive, integrated prevention system, which obtains clear\nunderstanding, safe behavior, and involvement in the program from every level of our facility, as\nwell as the general public.\n\n     The City of Independence Water Department's Courtney Bend Water Treatment Facility\nhas been treating well water at its current location since 1955.  The plant is located on the south\nside of the Missouri River, about 1/4 mile west of M-291 Highway.  The plant is capable of\ntreating 42 million gallons of water per day.  Chemicals used to treat the well water are stored at\nthe plant.  Liquid chlorine is stored in an elevated rack outside the operations building in 15 1-ton\ncontainers.  Anhydrous ammonia is stored inside the building in 150-pound cylinders, for a total\nof 2,250 pounds.  Our ammonia storage falls below the threshold quantity for 40 CFR Part 68. \nAlso used in the treatment process is lime (ca"

All our plant staff have been trained at the\nOperations Level of Hazwoper (8 hours).  Staff members who will assist in chlorine leak response\nhave been trained at the Technician Level (24 hours).\n\n                    Five-Year Accident History\n\n     We have had no accidental releases of chlorine in the last five years.  In addition, the\nCourtney Bend Water Treatment Plant has had no significant chlorine releases in its 45-year\nhistory.\n\n                     Emergency Response Plan\n\n     As stated previously, our emergency response plan was developed with assistance from\nour City of Independence Emergency Management Coordinator, and several local fire\ndepartments.  Trained water plant staff members will respond to small chlorine releases, such as a\nleak in piping.  In the unlikely event of a major chlorine release (such as a ruptured ton container),\nemergency response personnel will be contacted.  Sugar Creek, Independence, and Kansas City\nFire Departments will respond as needed.  In such a case, water department trained staff will be\navailable to provide assistance as needed.  Provisions are made for notifying the public, as may be\nappropriate.\n\n                Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n     Although the water plant has not had a major chlorine release in its history, we are making\nimprovements to enhance our plant safety.  Currently, an enclosure and scrubber system is\nbeing designed for the chlorine storage rack.  We anticipate construction to begin in late 1999. \nThis enclosure will increase plant worker safety, and will significantly red"

Lime requires special handling due to its\nhydro-thermic nature, but is not listed on the EPA's list of hazardous chemicals.  \n\n           Worst-case and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\n     The Water Department used RMP*Comp to determine the affected area of our worst-case\nand alternative release scenarios.   For our worst-case scenario, we used the parameters specified\nin the regulation (40 CFR Part 68.22).  RMP*Comp determined that our area of impact if\nreleasing one ton of liquid chlorine under these parameters would be an area within a 3-mile\nradius.  Although we left the area as a circle in our risk management plan, we believe that an\nactual release will not follow a perfect circle.  The water treatment plant sits below the river bluff. \nAbout = mile south of the plant, the topography rises considerably.  Since chlorine gas is heavier\nthan air, it is unlikely that chlorine would travel 3 miles to the south of the treatment plant. \n\n     Landview was used to estimate population residing within the 3-mile radius.  We consider\nLandview's computation of 6900 people to be high.  We counted the population within a 1.5-mile\nradius at 55 persons, using property owner information. \n\n     For our alternative release, we selected a scenario that would be more likely to occur than\nthe release specified in the worst-case scenario.  We prepared a model based on a twenty-pound\nchlorine release.  The model did not show any chlorine would leave plant property.  This scenario\nis based on a possible leak in the piping that runs from the chlorine storage rack to the treatment\nbuilding.  This area is the most unprotected area, and might be the most likely place for a leak to\noccur.\n\n     Our facility is required to comply with state and federal Emergency Planning and\nCommunity Right-to-Know laws, which require that we notify local and state emergency planning\ncommittees of the ty"
