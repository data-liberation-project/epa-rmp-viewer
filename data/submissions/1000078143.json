If an accidental release should occur, the Facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment. A detailed Consolidated Contingency Plan (CCP) has been developed and will be implemented in the event of an accidental release.\n\n\n\n\n\nES - 2.0 | FACILITY INFORMATION\n\n\n\n* The Facility is a retail agricultural facility whose primary activity is the storage and sale of fertilizers in addition to the sale of pre-packaged agricultural chemicals to agricultural operations in Northern California. Applicable NAICS codes for this facility include 42491 (Farm Supplies Merchant Wholesalers) and 325311 (Nitrogenous Fertilizer Manufacturing).\n\n\n\n* Anhydrous ammonia (NH3) is received, converted, stored, and distributed for direct application as crop production nutrients.\n\n \n\n* Anhydrous ammonia is converted to aqua ammonia (ammonium hydroxide) and reacted with super phosphoric acid (SPA) to produce ammonium phosphate [10-34-0] fertilizer).\n\n\n\n* Anhydrous ammonia is received by truck and stored in either an 18,000-gallon storage tank (bullet) or a 30,050-gallon storage tank.\n\n\n\n* The anhydrous ammonia storage vessels are filled to no more than 85% of shell volume. \n\n\n\nVessel     Capacity          Maximum Volume     Amount of NH3 \n\nBullet 1   18,000 gals       15,300 gals        78,642 lbs\n\nBullet 2   30,050 gals       25,542 gals        131,286 lbs\n\nTotals     48,050 gals       40,842 gals        209,928 lbs\n\n\n\nThe maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia handled is 209,928 pounds.\n\n\n\n* Aqua ammon"

The most recent review of safety information pertaining to the covered processes took place on February 1, 2019.\n\n\n\nHazard Review:  A hazard review of the ammonia processes is conducted every five years or as needed by changes in the processes. The most recent update of the hazard review for the anhydrous ammonia and aqua ammonia processes was conducted on November 20, 2018. There were no high risk hazards identified through the hazard review updates.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures:  Written standard operating procedures have been developed for the covered processes and are reviewed and revised as needed. The operating procedures were last revised on January 30, 2019.\n\n\n\nTraining:  The Dixon Wholesale Facility staff, as well as Grow West corporate staff, understands that incidents involving the accidental release of regulated substances can be reduced by having trained operations and maintenance staff.

The maintenance program includes equipment inspection, preventative maintenance, recordkeeping, and training. The latest equipment inspections were conducted on October 2, 2018 and the latest review of maintenance procedures was conducted on March 15, 2019.\n\n\n\nRMP Change Management:  Operation, safety, and environmental issues must be reviewed prior to initiation of a process change to ensure that they do not compromise the operational safety and integrity of the Anhydrous Ammonia Process, and to minimize adverse effects to worker safety and public health. The Facility RMP Change Management (RMPCM) procedures are used to evaluate all changes to process materials, controls, equipment, and procedures.\n\n\n\nPre-Startup Review:  The pre-startup review applies to additions or modifications to the Anhydrous Ammonia Process that require the safety information to be revised or updated. Whenever changes in affected processes are identified or planned, they must be evaluated as to the need for a pre-startup safety review. This assessment is undertaken in conjunction with the RMPCM review. Additionally, a pre-startup safety review is performed in conjunction with the RMPCM review when the proposed change requires modifications to the safety procedures.\n\n\n\nCompliance Audits:  Periodic compliance audits to assess the effectiveness of the written plan must be "
