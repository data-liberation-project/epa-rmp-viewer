This document has been prepared in order to address the following issue:\n\n??A?    Acknowledge the construction and operation of a new source with processes subject to the RMP regulations and requirements.\nThe RMP addresses the requirements of the California Accidental Release Program (CalARP) as adopted by the State of California as outlined in California Code of Regulations (CCR), Title 19. These requirements build upon the provisions of the ??A?general duty clause??A? of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, and the federal RMP program requirements in 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 68, which require the following activities of all facilities which produce, process, store, or handle listed substances:\n\n??A?    identify hazards\n??A?    design and maintain a safe facility\n??A?    prevent releases\n??A?    minimize consequences of releases\nThe accepted approach to accomplishing the above is to have a documented RMP, which outlines all the steps and procedures a facility will take to prevent and mitigate accidental releases. OMEC has chosen to prepare and implement its RMP in advance of operation of the aqueous ammonia system in order to fulfill its obligations with respect to the General Duty clause and to protect its employees and the surrounding community from the effects of accidental releases.\n\nPursuant to CCR Title 19, Section 2745.3, the following summary is given:\nThe RMP applies to the OMEC facility located at:\n\n647 Alta Road, San Diego, CA 92154\n\nThe proposed OMEC facility is a natural gas fired combined cycle (2:1) nominal rated 600 megawatt (MW) powerplant. The facility consists of two combustion turbines and common to both turbines is a steam turbine generator. The facility is proposing to install a ??A?selective catalytic reducti"

Aqueous ammonia (29.4 percent solution) will be used as the reaction reagent in the presence of a precious metal catalyst to complete the NOx emissions control process. Aqueous ammonia will be stored in a stationary storage tank rated at 16,000 gallons, filled to 85 percent capacity. Aqueous ammonia will be delivered to the site approximately every 6 days.\n\nSubstance Used/Stored:  Aqueous Ammonia 29.4 Percent Solution (CAS# 7664-41-7)\n\nFacility SIC: 4911    NAICS Code: 221112\n\nThe proposed facility would not be subject to the Process Safety Management provisions of 29 CFR 1910 and California Code of Regulations (CCR) Title 8 Section 5189. Based on the above, the proposed facility would be classified as a Program Level 2 source. The accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at the facility are delineated in Sections 4.0 and 14.0, respectively. A brief description of the prevention and emergency response policies is as follows.\n\nAccident Prevention Program Policies and Elements:\n\nThe accident prevention program is implemented through an established set of policies and programs including, but not limited to, the following:\n\n??A?    Inspection and maintenance program for all system equipment\n??A?    Monitoring of employee and contractor use of the system\n??A?    Emergency Action Plan\n??A?    Lockout/Tagout Procedures and Program\n??A?    Confined Space Entry Program\n??A?    Employee Safety Training Program\n??A?    Compilation of substance information (MSDS)\n??A?    Periodic compliance audits\n\nAn integral part of the prevention program are the following plans:\n\n??A?    Hazardous Materials Business Plan \n??A?    Injury and Illness Prevention Plan \n??A?    Spill Containment Control and Countermeasure Plan \n??A?    Hazardous Waste Storage and Handling Procedures \n??A?    Hazard Communication Program \n??A?

Establishment of criteria defining an emergency\n??A?    Staff training and responsibility assignments\n??A?    Emergency notification procedures (on and off-site)\n??A?    Evacuation procedures\n??A?    Emergency response procedures\n??A?    Incident investigation and follow-up procedures\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program is comprised of the following elements:\n\n??A?    Proper maintenance of all system equipment\n??A?    Proper operation of all system equipment\n??A?    Internal operating policies with respect to ammonia tank capacity\n??A?    Comprehensive personnel training\n??A?    A written emergency action plan\n??A?    A written hazardous materials management plan\n??A?    Documented safety procedures for employees and contractors\n??A?    Inclusion of ammonia specific health, safety, and response data in the RMP\n\nThe project is a new source and has not experienced an accidental release of ammonia or any other hazardous substance in the last 5 years.\n\nThe proposed emergency response plan and procedures for OMEC will be based upon the emergency action plan (EAP) for the OMEC (see Section 14.0 and Appendix I). The San Diego Rural Fire District HazMat Unit will be the first responder in an ammonia emergency. OMEC personnel will perform \"awareness\" duties only, which simply means that once the ammonia spill or release is discovered, OMEC personnel will make the proper notifications and set the emergency procedures in motion. The HazMat Unit will handle spill/release response and mitigation. In the event of a major release, OMEC will join forces with the HazMat Unit and State/County OES personnel in a \"unified command effort\" until the"

Periodic inspection of ammonia tank, containment area, pumps, piping network,   flow controllers, and injection grid.\n??A?    Monitoring of tank and system pressures and temperatures.\n??A?    Monitoring of unloading/delivery procedures.\n??A?    Installation and use of ammonia detector(s) in the main tank area.\n??A?    Provide all required safety and response equipment.\n??A?    Provide a chemical specific training program.\n??A?    Access to the OMEC facility site is controlled and fenced.\n\nThe piping and distribution network is equipped with a number of manual and automatic valves, which effectively limit the amount and duration of any accidental release. System pressures and flow rates will be monitored at the main plant control room console. Review of the piping and instrumentation diagrams (P&IDs) indicates that there are numerous pressure, temperature, and level indicator sensors, which will be reported directly to the distributed control system (DCS) for operator confirmation and action.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:\n\nPresently, Calpine is operating a number of similar peaking and base loaded power generation facilities in California. Data developed from the operational experience at these facilities will be directly applied to the operation and safety aspects of the OMEC facility. Operational and safety issues identified at any Calpine facility are immediately analyzed for applicability to other operational sites. Additionally, the following will be used to identify and track safety improvements at OMEC.\n\n??A?    Completion of the initial PHA for the OMEC facility\n??A?
