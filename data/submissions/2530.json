It is our intent to be recognized by our customers, employees, community, and stakeholders as a responsible business committed to continual improvement in environmental, health and safety (EH&S) management in all business activities.  To that end we shall:\n\n7 Establish objectives and targets that consider environmental aspects and health and safety issues as an integral part of our business decision making process.\n7 Comply with all applicable laws, regulations, permits, Lucent worldwide standards and other requirements to which we subscribe.\n7 Provide a workplace which supports prevention of injury and illness by fostering a safety and health culture that encourages employee participation and individual accountability.\n7 Develop employee knowledge and understanding of EH&S issues related to job functions.\n7 Promote conservation of resources in design, manufacture and use of our products by reusing, recycling and by adopting processes which conserve the use of raw materials, energy and water.\n7 Promote pollution prevention by striving to reduce the generation of waste from existing and future operations.\n7 Communicate this EH&S policy to all employees and make it available to the public.\n7 Engage the participation of the communities in which we do business.\n\nImplementation of this policy is a primary management objective and the responsibility of all employees.

The products manufactured at the facility include integrated circuits and optoelectronic devices.  The facility's products are used in a wide variety of communications equipment, including telephones, switching, and transmission equipment, data processing equipment, and computers.\n\nThe facility includes multiple clean rooms and product assembly and test areas of various levels of cleanliness and electrostatic shock discharge control necessary to manufacturing.   The two chemicals under consideration for the Lucent-Reading Risk Management Program (40 CFR Part 68), hydrogen chloride (RMP Program 3 process) and trichlorosilane (RMP Program 1 process), are used in the polysilicon reactors on the second floor of the facility.  Hydrogen chloride from the bulk system is used in the epitaxial reactors on the second floor of the facility.\n\nHydrogen chloride (HCl) is stored as a liquefied gas under pressure in two tube trailers housed in a masonry building at the southeast corner of the facility (Building 39).  Each tube trailer includes seven (7) 3,000-pound, stainless steel, horizontal cylinders of HCl when completely full.  The maximum quantity of HCl stored in the Risk Management Program (RMP)-covered process is 42,000 pounds (14 tubes at 3,000 pounds each).\n\nThe bulk HCl system (the RMP-covered process - Program 3) includes the following major safety systems to minimize the chances of release of HCl to the atmosphere:\n7 Fourteen (14) stainless steel cylinders with pneumatic isolation valves, 13 of which are normally closed\n7 Corrosion resistant double-walled piping network, including Hastelloy inner piping and stainless steel outer piping, with a monitored static vacuum between the inner and outer walls\n7 Masonry building with HCl-resistant wall and floor coatings, sloped floors, and a spil"

The container head space will be pressurized by argon for delivery of the liquid TCS to the process reactors through a double-walled, stainless steel piping system.  The bulk TCS system will be located south of the bulk hydrogen chloride system. \n\nThe bulk TCS system (the RMP-covered process - Program 1) will include the following major safety systems to minimize the chances of release of TCS to the atmosphere:\n7 Stainless steel mobile ISO containers covered by 2-hour fire-rated insulation and argon-pressurized head space for liquid delivery\n7 Containment dike designed to contain greater than 110% of one (1) ISO container\n7 Fire detection and foam fire suppression systems\n7 Gas detection and alarm systems which will trigger multiple shut-down actions upon detection of TCS\n7 Corrosion resistant double-walled piping network, including stainless steel inner and outer piping, with a monitored static vacuum between the inner and outer walls\n7 Valve manifold boxes for isolation, containment and control of liquid distribution systems\n\n3)  Worst-case release scenarios and alternative release scenarios\n\nThe worst-case and alternative release scenarios evaluated for the hydrogen chloride Program 3 process were as follows:\n\n7 Worst-case release scenario - 3,000 pounds of HCl contained as a gas liquefied by pressure in a single cylinder is released over a"

The public receptors within the distance to endpoint include schools, residences, hospitals, recreation areas, and commercial, office and industrial areas.  There are no environmental receptors, as defined in the regulations, within the distance to endpoint.\n\nThe risk of occurrence of the worst-case scenario is effectively zero, since the bulk HCl system has numerous active and passive mitigation measures and administrative controls in place to prevent the release of any HCl into the environment.  Some of the major control systems designed to prevent the release of HCl are listed in the previous section (Section 2 - Description of the facility and the regulated substances handled).\n\n7 Alternative release scenario - The rupture disk for a single cylinder of HCl fails and releases 3,000 pounds of HCl over a 15 minute period into the masonry building (passive mitigation system) which houses the HCl tube trailers.  The emergency release scrubber treats the release such that the maximum concentration of HCl in the outlet gas stream from the scrubber is 25 parts per million (ppm).  Using RMP*Comp, the distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.030 mg/L was estimated to be 0.10 miles (528 feet).  No residential population, no public receptors and no environmental receptors exist within the distance to endpoint.\n\nThe risk of the rupture disk failing at the Reading facility is effectively zero, since the HCl tubes are filled and tested off site, under the control of the HCl supplier.  \n\nThe worst-case release scenario evaluated for the trichlorosilane Program 1 process was as follows:\n\nWorst-case release scenario - 42,500 pounds of trichlorosilane, a flammable liquid, contained in a si"
