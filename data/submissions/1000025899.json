The Riverside Plant also maintains a site-specific Emergency Action Plan.  In addition, operating procedures and equipment design codes and standards associated with the operations at the Facility are maintained. Furthermore, the facility has coordinated the emergency response with the Ascension Parish Office of Emergency Preparedness (OEP) and the Geismar Fire Department.  For these reasons, the Riverside Plant meets the exceptions listed in 40 CFR 68.90(b), and therefore the Facility is not required to have the Emergency Response Program as described in 40 CFR 68.95.  \r\n\r\nA site map, MSDSs, and a list of chemicals kept on-site are maintained at the Facility. Complete details on the Emergency Response Program required under the PSM Rules are included in the Riverside Plant's PSM Plan, which is kept on-site as a separate document.   \r\n\r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\n\r\nThe Facility last completed a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) in January 2008 to assess potential areas to improve safety at the Facility.

      "SummaryText": "EVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICIES\r\n\r\nThe Riverside Plant maintains a policy of safe NGL fractionation operations, reducing to the greatest extent possible hazards associated with the extraction processes, and reducing subsequent risk to the surrounding community, employees, and the environment.   \r\n\r\nThe Riverside Plant has procedures in place, including both on-site activities and coordination with off-site responders that are to be followed in the event of a flammable material release.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\r\n\r\nThe Riverside Plant receives NGL as raw feed via pipeline, tanker trucks and rail cars.  The NGLs are fractionated into ethane, propane, butanes and natural gasoline products.  Ethane is further processed through liquid amine treating, re-compressed and returned to a transmission pipeline for off-site sale.  Propane, n-butane and iso-butane are stored in pressurized vessels prior to injection into a transmission pipeline for off-site sale, or off-site transfer via truck, rail, or barge.  Natural gasoline is stored in floating-roof tanks prior to off-site shipping by barge.\r\n\r\nThe Riverside Plant processing has been evaluated for RMP applicability.  No RMP-regulated toxic substances are stored at the Facility above RMP threshold quantities.  NGL, propane, butane and iso-butane are all RMP-regulated flammables and are stored above RMP threshold quantities.  Ethyl mercaptan is also stored at the Facility; however, it does not exceed RMP threshold planning quantities.  The following list presents the storage capacities and largest tanks for all RMP-regulated chemicals stored over threshold planning quantities at the Facility:\r\n\r\nPropane:  Total storage capacity (1,594,309 gal/6,664,211 lbs); Largest tank  (76,167 gal/318,377 lbs)\r\nIso-butane:  Total storage capacity (1,451,939 gal/6,824,114 lbs); Largest tank  (432,446 gal/2,032,494 lbs)\r\nn-Butane:  Total storage capacity (739,723 gal/3,602,453 lbs); Largest tank  (172,335"

The Facility also stores used oil, heating oil and light crude oil, all of which are not RMP-regulated.\r\n\r\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\n\r\nThe Riverside Plant maintains a consistent accidental release prevention program to eliminate or minimize releases of NGL and natural gas condensate. As previously indicated, the Prevention Program required under 40 CFR 68 is identical to the Prevention Program required under OSHA's PSM. The Riverside Plant's Prevention Program 3 elements, as required under 40 CFR 68 Subpart D, are included in the facility's PSM Plan, which is kept on-site as a separate document. Required elements include: \r\n\r\n\u00bf\tEmployee Participation,\r\n\u00bf\tProcess Safety Information,\r\n\u00bf\tProcess Hazard Analysis,\r\n\u00bf\tOperating Procedures,\r\n\u00bf\tTraining,\r\n\u00bf\tContractors,\r\n\u00bf\tPre-startup Review,\r\n\u00bf\tMechanical Integrity,\r\n\u00bf\tHot Work Permits,\r\n\u00bf\tManagement of Change,\r\n\u00bf\tIncident Investigation, and\r\n\u00bf\tCompliance Audits.\r\n\r\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nThe Riverside Plant has had no accidental releases of NGL, propane, iso-butane, or n-butane that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on-site, or off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or any environmental impact for the period of five (5) years prior to January 2012.  \r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\r\n\r\nThe Emergency Response Program requirements for Program 3 Facilities are very similar to those required under the PSM rule. The Emergency Response Program required under the RMP and PSM Rules must be site-specific and comprehensive, including the following elements:\r\n\r\n\u00bf\tPublic and emergency response agency notification procedures;\r\n\u00bf\tProp"

      "SummaryText": "The Riverside Fractionation Plant (Riverside Plant), located near the town of Geismar in Ascension Parish, Louisiana utilizes more than the threshold quantity of a regulated flammable substance (10,000 pounds) in the processing of natural gas, where natural gas liquids (NGL) are fractionated into ethane, propane, butanes and natural gasoline products. Therefore, this Facility is subject to the Risk Management Plan (RMP) requirements codified in Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations Part 68 (40 CFR 68) administered by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).\r\n\r\nThe Riverside Plant is also subject to Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (29 CFR 1910.119) and public receptors are located within the worst-case release scenario for the plant. Therefore, the Riverside Plant is subject to Program 3 requirements as stated in 40 CFR 68.10. OSHA's PSM standard closely parallels requirements outlined in USEPA's RMP Rule. All elements required by USEPA's 40 CFR 68 - Program 3 Prevention Program are also required by OSHA's PSM. \r\n\r\nThe Riverside Plant has not had an accidental release of a regulated substance where exposure to the substance, its reaction products, overpressure generated by an explosion involving the substance, or radiant heat generated by a fire involving the substance led to any off-site death, injury, or response or restoration activities for an exposure of an environmental receptor within the last five (5) years. \r\n\r\nThe Riverside Plant employs 23 full-time employees on-site who will ensure the proper operation and maintenance of the Facility. \r\n\r\nEnLink Midstream Operating, LP (EnLink), formerly Crosstex Energy, last submitted a full RMP 5-year update to the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) in January 2012 for the Riverside Plant.  The current RMP includes administrative updates associated with the change from Crosstex Energy to EnLink.  \r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PR"
