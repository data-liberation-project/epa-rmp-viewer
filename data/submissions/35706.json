      "SummaryText": "Process:\n\nCarolina Culinary Foods, LP is a further processing facility that is in continuous operation.  Carolina Culinary Foods utilizes a refrigeration system that is a closed loop system containing anhydrous ammonia.  The entire amount of anhydrous ammonia on site is approximatly 32,000 pounds and is entirely contained in one system that is used for plant refrigeration and product freezing.  Carolina culinary Foods is comitted to the Safety of the ammonia refrigeration system and the requirements under the Risk Management Program of 40 CFR Part 68 and the Process Safety Management Program of 29 CFR 1910.119.\n\nAccidential Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policy:\n\nCarolina Culinary Foods, L.P. is dedicated to the safe operations of its refrigeration system and to the safety of the employees, public, and environment.  Carolina Culinary Foods conducts employee training in accordance with theOSHA Hazard Communication Standard 29 CFR 1910.1200.  We also perform annual HAZWOPER training and retraining of key employees who will perform entry work during an ammonia release.  Carolina Culinary Foods has also invited the South Congree Fire Department and Lexington County HAZMAT members onsite to make them more aware and informed of our plant, process, and system.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Release Scenarios:\n\nCarolina Culinary Foods has developed models of the release senarios at this facility to identify potential affected areas.  A commercial computer model, Phast Professional, was used to develop the models.  This is not an exact prediction of what would occur in the event of a release, but an estimate of the affected area and the res"

This model assumes the release of all the vessel contents.  Depending on wind direction, residences and businesses at a distance of 3.48 miles could be affected.  Approximatly 23,726 people live within a 3.48 mile radius of the facility.  Thistype release is not likely to occur because of the strigent construction codes for pressure vessels and annual inspections of the pressure vessels.                                                         \n\nThe \"alternative release scenaro\" involves an over pressurization of the condensing tower resulting in a relief valve discharge.  A discharge of the of the relief valve at approximatly 59 pounds per minute for 9 to 10 minutes, would result in a total of 577 pounds of ammonia being released.  This would result in a release endpoint of 0.16 miles.  Depending on the wind direction, residences and businesses could be affected.  Approximatly 42 people live within the 0.16 mile radius generated by this release senerio.\n\nFive Year Accident History:\n\nNo accidents in past five years.\n\nGeneral Accidental Relaese Prevention Program:\n\nCarolina Culinary Foods is subject to OSHA's Process Safety Management Standard and has implimented a Process Safety Management Program to minimize the exposure of it's employees, the public, and theenvironment from an anhydrous ammonia release.  The ammonia system is constantly monitored by computer and employees to insure that all equipment is operating within expected parameters.  Procedures have beenwritten and implemented on how to properly isolate and shutdown the refrigeration system components in the event of an emergency.  Multiple safety devices are used on each piece of equipment to protect from an accidental release.\n\nEmergency Response Program:\n\nCarolina Culinary Food"

      "SummaryText": "s has developed a plan to provide notification and evacuation of plant employees and the surrounding public.  Procedures have been developed to notify the South Congree Fire Department and Lexington County HAZMAT Team to respond to any substantial ammonia release.  Procedures have also been developed for the notification of the Lexington County LEPC and the Department of Health and Environmental Control (DHEC).  Key employees have been trained in either 24 hour or 40 hour HAZWOPER so they will be able to assist the South Congree Fire Department and Lexington County Hazmat with stopping an ammonia release.  Members of the South Congree Fire Department and Lexington County LEPC have been invited on site to become more familiar with the process and the plant layout.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nPeriodic Inspections and tests are performed on the system, including an annual complete inspection and a 5 year indipendent inspection.  Carolina Culinary Foods, L.P. performs a complete review of the refrigeration process when there have been changes to its design.  Through this review process, we identify and implement changes to improve system safety."
