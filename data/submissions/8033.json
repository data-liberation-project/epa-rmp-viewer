The Facility has used a proactive process of identification, evaluation, and mitigation to prevent and or control chemical releases.\n\nThe Facility's program involved a systematic approach designed to critically evaluate all components of the chlorination processes: design, technology, operation, maintenance procedures, emergency plans, training programs, and other pertinent process elements. \n\nAfter evaluating the operations, the Facility took proactive steps to ensure that inventories of chlorine at each site were managed efficiently and safety and training programs were updated. \n\nThe Facility has also reinforced its plans to manage public safety in the event of a release. Several meetings have taken place involving the Water Resources Department and Fire Department.\n\nThe City of Titusville takes seriously its responsibility to operate its water treatment plant in a safe manner and has therefore, taken the above mentioned proactive measures.",
