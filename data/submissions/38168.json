This belief covers on and off-job injuries, occupational illnesses and accidental releases.  DuPont is also committed to keeping its facilities ready to respond to any incident that occurs in spite of our best prevention efforts.\n\nDuPont established PSM on a Corporate basis in 1979.  General definitions, policies and organizational structure that implement PSM are given in Section S21A of the DuPont Safety and Occupational Health Guidelines.  PSM goals, policies and procedures are embodied in numerous corporate manuals and documents such as Engineering Standards, Safety Manuals and Guidelines.\n\nDuPont's LaPorte Plant endorses, adheres to and carries out Corporate PSM policies, procedures and guidelines.  The DuPont LaPorte Plant's Accidental Release Prevention policies come within the scope of the site's existing Process Safety Management (PSM) program.  We apply PSM to all processes and chemicals at this site, not just those covered by the RMP Regulation.\n\nThe stated purpose of the LaPorte Plant's PSM Program is to manage and control the hazards in our processes, to protect individuals, plant equipment, our business integrity, and our community through the elimination of hazards.  PSM involves the application of controls to our processes through operating & maintenance procedures and practices, training, management of change, equipment inspection, and auditing.\n\nThe Principles that govern the DuPont LaPorte Plant's PSM actions are:\n  --All injuries, incidents and occupational illnesses are preventable.  We will work in a proactive,\n     preventive m"

This commitment is further evidenced by the site's RMP 5-Year Accident History - there are none of these incidents on our record.\n\nFACILITY DESCRIPTION AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nThe DuPont facility is situated on about 600 acres of property north and west of the intersection of State Highways 225 and 146, fronting on Upper San Jacinto Bay.  \n\nDuPont is engaged in three (3) major businesses at the LaPorte Plant:\n  --Crop Protection Products - used for improving crop yields and quality at value adding prices\n  --Organic intermediates for Lycra(R) spandex fibers - used in hosiery and swim and athletic wear.\n  --Inorganic acids - used to produce Teflon(R) non-stick coatings and environmentally friendly refrigerants\n  --Plastics for auto safety glass and consumer packaging materials\n\nManagement System\n\nOverall responsibility for the operation of DuPont's LaPorte Plant is vested in a Plant Manager.  All elements of the site's Risk Management Program, including safety, regulatory compliance, prevention of accidental spills and releases, and emergency response fall within the scope of the Plant Manager's responsibilities.  Safety is also considered to be each employee's individual responsibility.\n\nBelow the Plant Manager level, there were three (3) Busin"

The facility is not open to the public.  Security personnel are on duty 24 hours per day, 7 days per week to observe and control all site ingress and egress and  to perform frequent on-site and perimeter patrols.

Employees are trained in several independent ways of reporting actual and/or potential emergency situations and securing assistance.  All methods of emergency reporting result in the sounding of a site-wide alarm.\n\nThe site-wide alarm automatically alerts the entire facility to the emergency, activates one of two previously designated Emergency Operations Centers (EOC) and summons the Emergency Response Team (ERT) to the incident location.  An Emergency Response Team (ERT) is on duty at the facility 24 hours per day, 7 days per week.\n\nThe sounding of the site-wide alarm also initiates a number of other processes including:\n  --immediate mobilization of site emergency response resources\n  --preliminary assessment of the situation\n  --personnel accounting\n  --dispersion modeling to gauge the potential for off-site impact\n  --establishment of a Command Post near the incident location\n\nAt the Command Post, an Incident Commander (IC) takes charge of the situation and organizes and directs the ERT.  The widely recognized National Fire Academy Incident Command System (ICS) is used to manage safety, tactics, strategy, personnel, equipment, logistics and other resources.\n\nThe site's Emergency Response Team (ERT) is trained to a high level of proficiency in incident command, interior structural fire fighting, fume and vapor suppression, emergency medical treatment (EMT) including cardiac care and invasive procedures, high angle and confined space rescue and hazardous material response.  The purpose of the ERT is to assist the facility in safeguarding employees and the community from the threat of fire, injuries, fume releases, medical illnesses, entrapment and other types of emergencies.

The Risk Management Plan has been revised to reflect this change.  Additionally, a business unit has been sold and the substance associated with that particular business is no longer a part of the DuPont RMP.  Administrative controls continue to be inplemented which have decreased the worst-caae distances for several of the scenarios.  Additional work is ongoing and it expected that further revisions will be submitted in the near term."
