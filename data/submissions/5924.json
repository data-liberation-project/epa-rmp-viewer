It is Osnabrock Farmers Coop Elevator's  policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state and local laws.  If an emergency should occur, it is our policy to notify the Osnabrock Volunteer Fire Department and the Cavalier County Sheriffs Department to request that they respond to the emergency.\n\nOsnabrock Farmers Coop Elevator is a country grain elevator making available anhydrous ammonia for sale to its patrons.  The anydrous ammonia plant, located directly northwest of the main elevator and dry fertilizer plant, was constructed new in the summer of 1998 using the latest safety technology.  The anhydrous ammonia plant consists of one 30,000 gallon storage tank, twenty new 1,450 gallon and five new 1,000 gallon nurse tanks, a three inch liquid pump, associated piping, safty valves, excess flow devices, and two fill stands capable of filling two nurse tanks each are also on site.  The storage tank and all nurse tanks are filled to 85% of their capaciy as required for safe handling of the product.\n\nOur worst-case senario would involve the failure of the 30,000 gallon storage when filled to the maximum amount allowed (85% of 30,000 gallons) resulting in the release of the entire contents of the storage tank. \nAn occurance such as this is deemed highly unlikely considering the following:\n1.  The construction and age of the storage tank.  (Built in 1997)\n2.  The function of all safety valves and excess flow devices which shutdown within seconds \n     following the detection of \"free flowing\" product.\n3.  The transfer of anhydrous ammonia is never left unattended allowing for manual shutdown\n     procedures.\n\nSince the anhydrous ammonia plant construction, we have never had an accident involving the accidental release of anhydrous ammonia.\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving our anhydrous ammonia plant, it is our plolicy to notify the"
