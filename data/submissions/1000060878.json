Given the quantity handled, anhydrous ammonia is considered a hazardous substance by EPA.  Many of the properties that make ammonia valuable as a refrigerant also requires that precautions and procedures be in place to protect employee and public health and safety during a chemical emergency.  It is the policy of URM Stores to be in compliance with all applicable federal and state rules and regulations.    \n\n\n\nSafety at our facility is inherent on the manner in which anhydrous ammonia is handled.  While the design of the facility incorporates a multitude of safety devices, safe handling procedures combined with appropriate training of our personnel are key aspects to maintaining safety at our facility.\n\n\n\nWe have a written Process Safety Management (PSM) plan that complies with the regulations stipulated by WAC 296-67-017.  A crucial component of this plan is the Emergency Response Plan, developed in compliance with the Emergency Response provisions of WAC 296-62-3112.  The Emergency Response Plan includes pre-emergency planning and coordinating with outside parties.  This enables those who deal with emergencies to have a course of action to effectively deal with unplanned events.\n\n\n\nFacility Description And Substances Handled\n\n\n\n?    URM Stores is a facility that stores refrigerated and frozen foods.  Production requires the use of a refrigeration system to preserve the integrity of processed foods.  This refrigeration process uses ammonia as a refrigerant.  Access to the facility is restricted to authorized employees, management personnel, and contractors.\n\n?    The regulated substance handled at this facility is anhydrous ammonia.\n\n?    The ammonia refrigeration system maximum inventory is 16,300 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.  There is no standby make-up inventory kept on"

The design and construction of this facility was in accordance with published standards, tests or recommended methods of trade, industry or governmental organizations.  \n\n\n\nURM Stores written PSM plan incorporates many policies and procedures to ensure safe operation and maintenance of this facility.  Plan elements essential to safe operation of the refrigeration system include employee participation, process hazard information, process hazard analysis, operating procedures, training, contractor safety, pre-startup safety review, mechanical integrity, management of change, hot-work permits, incident investigation, emergency response and planning, and compliance audits.  This plan will be reviewed annually and updated as necessary by the URM Stores Safety Supervisor. \n\n\n\nTraining is provided to ensure that each employee involved in operating a process has been trained in an overview of the process, the operating procedures, and safety considerations.  This training uses guidelines developed by the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) and Refrigeration Engineers Technology Association (RETA).  Only qualified maintenance personnel operate and interact with the refrigeration system.  This minimizes the chances of inadvertent error in operation that could lead to a release of ammonia.  Startup, shutdown, and any onstream adjustments are handled by these qualified persons.  \n\n\n\n\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\n\n\nThere has been no incidents involving ammonia at the URM Stores during the past five years (October 2011 - OCtober 2016) that meet the Accident History definition provided by EPA in this rule.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\n\n\nURM Stores has a written Emergency Action Plan developed to ensure that precautions and procedures are in plac"

The refrigeration process has back-up prevention systems to keep processing malfunctions from becoming ammonia release emergencies.  \n\n\n\nURM Stores personnel are trained to fulfill their designated responsibilities in an emergency.  Evacuation drills are held periodically to maintain familiarity with response actions and identify plan elements requiring improvement.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes To Improve Safety\n\n\n\nThis facility started production operations in 1992.  System components meet design specifications in ANSI/IIAR 2-1992, equipment, design, and installation of ammonia mechanical refrigerating systems.  Any upgrades or extensive maintenance work performed in the future will be in compliance with those standards applicable at that time.\n\n\n\nAn independent Mechanical Integrity Inspection was completed in 2016 in addition to a Process Hazard Analysis Revalidation(PHA). Recommendations resulting from these studies are currently underway.  Any recommendations will be completed according to a priority schedule.  "
