      "SummaryText": "Brazos Regional Public Utility Agency (BRPUA) operates the Surface Water and Treatment System (SWATS) Plant which is located at 5912 Matlock Road, Granbury, Hood County, Texas.  The WTP plant provides water to Johnson County Special Utility District and Acton Municipal Utility District from Lake Granbury.  Chlorine gas is used in the disinfection process at the SWATS Plant.  Up to 18,000 pounds of chlorine may be stored at the SWATS Plant.  Because the stored quantity of chlorine onsite exceeds the threshold quantity (?68.130; Table 1), the SWATS Plant developed this Risk Management Plan (RMP).  The SWATS Plant is subject to Program 2 RMP requirements (?68.12(c)).  A Management System overseen by the SWATS Administrator is implemented to ensure that the RMP and associated Prevention Program are implemented correctly and maintained up-to-date. \n\n\n\nThe Prevention Program designed to prevent accidental releases includes all required elements of 40 CFR Part 68.  The TCEQ licensing program for water operators is used as a training tool, along with site-specific RMP training.  TCEQ licensing testing and on-site observation and demonstration are used to evaluate comprehension of all training materials.  Written operating procedures are used in conjunction with on-the-job training to ensure that certified WTP operators are proficient in performing their duties before being allowed to work with chlorine storage and feed systems.  Certified WTP operators conduct daily inspections and any problems with the chlorine systems are corrected and documented.  In addition, the certified WTP operators ensure that the equipment used in the disinfection process is maintained according to the manufacturers' recommendations (?68.56(a)).  Because of these efforts, the WTP has not had a chlorine release that resulted in an injury, either on-site or off-site, within the previous five (5) years (?68.42(a)).  As part of the Program, the SWATS Plant will periodically perform compliance audits, "

These compliance audits and hazard reviews document any planned changes to improve safety (?68.50 & ?68.58).\n\n\n\nThe SWATS Plant complies with the emergency response regulations per Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) 29 CFR ?1910.38, as well as with applicable fire codes and the standards set forth by the Chlorine Institute.  The SWATS Plant is a non-responding facility for emergency response. The SWATS Plant is included in the Hood County Local Emergency Planning Committee's (LEPC) regional Emergency Response Plan.  WTP operators and staff are trained to contact Hood County dispatch via 911 in the event of a release. Hood County dispatch contacts the nearest first responder unit which coordinates the emergency response according to the County's Emergency Response Plan, including the evacuation of surrounding residents when required (?68.155(e)).\n\n"
