The facility is located on Paper Mill Road and is adjacent to Georgia-Pacific Pulp & Paper Mill, Georgia-Pacific Plywood, and Georgia-Pacific Studmill.  The Chemical Facility consists of three primary operations: 1) Formaldehyde Manufacturing  2) Resin Manufacturing  3) Gum and Wood Chemical Manufacturing.  Because the Gum and Wood Chemical Manufacturing process does not contain RMP regulated chemicals above the threshold and is not a PSM covered process, it is not part of this facility's RMP. Overall, the facility employs 181 full-time employees.\r\n\r\nGPC is committed to operating the plant in a manner that is safe for its workers, the public, and the environment.  As part of this commitment, GPC has established a system to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility.  One component of this system is a risk management program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at the plant and that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) regulation 40 CFR part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule).  One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit a risk management plan (RMP Plan) describing the risk management program at the plant. This document is intended to satisfy the RMP Plan requirement of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program at the plant.\r\n\r\nThe risk management program at the Plant consists of the following three elements:\r\n\r\n\u00b7a hazard assessment to help understand (a) the potential offsite consequences of hypothetical accidental releases and (b) accidents that have occurred during the last five years associated with the use of substances regulated by the RMP rule (reg"

Before using a hazardous substance at the Plant, less hazardous alternatives are considered. When a hazardous substance is used at the Plant, GPRI considers the potential for this substance to adversely affect plant workers, the public, and the environment and takes steps to prevent any such effects.\r\n\r\nGPC prevents releases of the hazardous substances used at the facility.
