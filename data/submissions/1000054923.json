      "SummaryText": "Air Products LLC (Port Arthur II Hydrogen / Cogen)\n\n\n\n1.  Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies:\n\n\n\nAt this facility, we manufacture gaseous hydrogen, steam and electricity.  During the manufacturing process, we also use aqueous ammonia to reduce NOx emissions from steam methane reformer (SMR) and heat recovery steam generator (HRSG). Hydrogen, methane, and aqueous ammonia in the amounts handled by our facility are considered hazardous by the EPA. It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and state rules and regulations.  Air Products manages the safety of the regulated processes by means of operating procedures, equipment testing and inspections, safety devices (e.g. alarms, shutdowns, instrumentation, relief devices) inherent in the design of this facility and other controls and systems designed to prevent accidental releases of hazardous chemicals.  Safe work practices and training of our personnel supplement the inherent safe design of the plant.\n\n\n\nOur emergency response program is based upon OSHAs HAZWOPER regulation.  The emergency response plan includes procedures for the notification of the Valero Refinery Emergency Response Team so that appropriate measures can be taken by local emergency responders to control accidental releases.\n\n\n\nThis document has been prepared in accordance with the EPAs Risk Management Plan regulation (40 CFR, Part 68). The substances and processes considered during the preparation of this RMP and the scenarios described were selected based on criteria established in the regulation.\n\n\n\n2.  The stationary source and regulated substances handled:\n\n\n\nThe primary purpose of this facility is the manufacturing of gaseous hydrogen, steam and electricity.  Natural gas is received by our plant via pipeline and used as feedstock.  The feedstock is reacted in the reformer furnace.  By exposing the feedstock to a catalyst in the presence of heat (approximately 1,600 degrees F) and steam, a chemical reaction tak"

      "SummaryText": "es place that converts the feedstock into hydrogen, carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide.  The carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide are then separated from the hydrogen in a Pressure-Swing Adsorption (PSA) system.  The pure hydrogen is compressed and delivered to customers via our pipeline network. \n\n\n\nDuring this process, the steam methane reformer (SMR) furnace and heat recovery steam generator (HRSG).creates products of combustion (such as nitrogen oxides or NOx).  NOx is considered an atmospheric pollutant, but is controlled by injecting aqueous ammonia onto a catalyst bed that is located in our reformer combustion discharge stream.  The aqueous ammonia reacts with the NOx creating molecules of nitrogen and water vapor, both of which are harmless, naturally occurring atmospheric gases.\n\n\n\n3.  The general accidental release prevention program and specific prevention steps:\n\n\n\nThe facility developed prevention program elements based on the Federal EPAs Accidental Release Prevention Plan, and OSHAs Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation.  This facility was designed and constructed to comply with applicable state and industry codes.\n\n \n\n4.  Five-year accident history:\n\n\n\nThere have been no accidents involving or accidental releases of flammable gas or aqueous ammonia that resulted in any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n\n\n5.  The emergency response program:\n\n\n\nThe facilitys emergency response program is based upon OSHAs HAZWOPER standard.  At this site, employees are trained to recognize emergencies and initiate emergency response from outside agencies.  They have been trained to OSHAs First Responder Awareness Level.  The employees receive annual refresher training in their role in the emergency plan.  Emergency response activities have also been coordinated with the Valero Refinery Emergency Response Team.\n\n\n\n6.  Planned changes"
