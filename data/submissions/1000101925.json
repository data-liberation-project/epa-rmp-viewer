Employees participate in PHA\u2019s, and they have access to the PHA\u2019s and other process safety information.  Each operating and maintenance area has a representative on the Plant Safety Committee (EAGLES - Eliminating Accidents Guarantees Lasting Employee Safety) which supports occupational safety activities.  Contractors have a representative on this team.\n\nContractor Safety Program: The plant has a program to ensure that contractors are properly trained and uses the Houston Area Safety Council as a tool to provide the basic HSE training required of a contractor prior to entering a chemical manufacturing facility. All contractor employees must attend the Houston Area Safety Council training and be certified through examination prior to arriving at the plant. In addition to basic training, site specific training is required prior to arriving at the plant.

Scheduled PHAs are conducted every 5 years to revalidate previous hazard reviews, incorporate new Corporate requirements and learnings from incidents.  Corrective actions are recommended and tracked to prevent accidents.\n\nOperating Procedures: Operating procedures provide detail on how to safely operate a process and are kept up-to-date constantly thru a review during any operator training opportunity.  They are also reviewed every five years.  Operating procedures are based on process hazard / risk reviews and are periodically modified as a result of management of change activities or after completion of a process PHA.  These procedures also specifically identify steps/responses that are taken as administrative independent protective layers.

We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to manage the risk for all stakeholders. This document provides a brief overview of our comprehensive risk management activities to prevent and mitigate the possibility of an accidental release of a regulated chemical.\n\nIt is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent the release of a regulated substance.  However, if such a release does occur, our trained emergency response   personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of any release. We also coordinate with the Houston Ship Channel Area\u2019s Channel Industries Mutual Aid (CIMA) organization, which provides additional emergency response expertise.\n\nThe plan has been updated to include a new Propylene Oxide/Tertiary Butyl Alcohol (POTBA) unit that will begin commissioning in late August 2022.
