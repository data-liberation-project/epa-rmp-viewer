The Sheboygan facility consists of a series of one to five story masonry and steel buildings encompassing 388,000 square feet on a 583 acre site. These buildings house a variety of manufacturing, packaging, warehousing and administrative operations. Also present at the site are tanks for the outside storage of liquid nitrogen and various solvents.\n\n\n\nThere are seven major chemical operations conducted at the site. Each major operation is housed in its own building and is described below.\n\nProduction 1 Building - (Pro I) is the site for large scale production of air sensitive materials and compounds synthesized at very low temperatures.  Air-sensitive materials must be handled under an inert atmosphere (nitrogen or argon) since they react rapidly with oxygen and/or moisture in the air.  Pro I produces about many different products in vessels ranging in size from 100 to 4,000 gallons.  There is a warehouse associated with Pro I used for staging starting materials and storing product.\n\nProduction II Building - (Pro II) batch manufactures fine organic chemicals.  Process equipment in Pro II ranges in size from 1 liter to 2,000 gallons.  There is a warehouse associated with Pro II used for staging starting materials and storing product.\n\nProduction III Building - (Pro III) is a site for production of air sensitive materials. Air-sensitive materials must be handled under an inert atmosphere (nitrogen or argon) since they react rapidly with oxygen and/or moisture in the air.  Pro III produces about 370 different products in vessels ranging in size from 30 to 800 gallons.  Pro III also has large scale distillation, drying and workup capabilities.  There is a warehouse associated with Pro III used for staging starting materials and storing product.\n\nProduction IV Building - (Pro IV) produces and packages high purity "

Pro IV produces about 430 different solvent listings in stills ranging in size from 100 to 1,000 gallons. There is a warehouse associated with Pro IV used for staging starting materials and storing product.\n\nProduction V Building - (Pro V) produces and packages flavors and fragrances (F&F) and stains and dyes (S&D).\n\nPackaging III Building - (Pac III) enables the Packaging Department of have filling, labeling, overpacking and warehouse facilities under one roof.  Filling procedures are performed in separate areas: a Bulk Fill Room for handling large containers, an Air-Sensitive Solids room, Air-Sensitive Fill Rooms, Gas Filling, and a Corrosive Fill Room.  Containers of up to 850 liters are handled during filling operations.  The Quality Control, Shipping/Receiving, and Administrative Departments are also housed in this building.\n\nLab 1 Building - (Lab 1) is responsible for the production and development of new products.  Overall, approximately 1000 products are manufactured in glassware ranging from 1 liter to 50 liters in volume.  \n\nMini-Bulk operations repackage larger quantities of chemicals from ISO Tanks and Tank Trucks into smaller containers, which range up to 800 liters in size. The Mini-Bulk facility was added onto the Pro IV warehouse and is designed to handle up to 5,000 gallon ISO Tanks/Tankers. \n\nSummary of Major Hazards\n\nAldrich Chemical has identified 11 chemicals/processes which are covered by RMP. The following eight processes/chemicals are Program Level 1:60-29-7, 107-15-3. 109-66-0, 107-18-6, 67-66-3, 75-35-4, 75-08-1, and 10102-43-9.  The following processes/chemicals are Program Level 2: 75-44-5, 7647-01-0, 10025-87-3.

In all cases the hazard zone was contained onsite.  Aldrich employees could be affected if a worse-case release scenario occurs.   The effects of any release onsite will be minimized by several factors including: 1) Emergency response team manning the site 24/7, 2) Site wide alarm & PA system and 3) Employee training (ie. evacuation drills, safety training, contingency plan training).  These factors are elaborated upon in the Response Action in the Event of a Release section.  \n\nPrevention of Releases\n\n    Aldrich has put in place several measures to improve operations, improve safety and reduce the risk of a release.  More Process Hazard Analyses (PHAs) have been conducted than required under OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) rule and EPA's RMP.  Recommendations from these PHAs have been enacted to reduce the probability of a release.   Periodic testing of pipeline thickness and an automated emergency shutdown system for Mini-Bulk operations are two examples of recommendations which have been enacted.  \n\nOther measures which Aldrich takes to reduce the probability of a release include:\n\n1) Regularly scheduled maintenance of operating equipment\n\n2) Regular review of operating procedures\n\n3) Regular training of operators\n\n4) Institution and enforcement of hot work & line entry programs \n\n5) Learning Management System to monitor employee training\n\nThere are also systems in place at Aldrich to mitigate a chemical release.   All Mini-Bulk operations are conducted in areas which have dikes and sumps. Chemicals are processed and stored in areas which are electrically rated and have been designed to meet National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) guidelines.\n\nSteps Taken "

      "SummaryText": "to Address Hazards\n\nSeveral steps are being taken by Aldrich to continually improve safety at the Sheboygan site and reduce the risk of a release.  The PHAs mentioned above are revisited at least every five years.  Routine safety inspections are performed by the operating departments.  The site safety committee audits these safety inspections.   \n\nAldrich has an incident investigation system in place.  Lessons learned from incidents are passed along to the other operating departments.  Each department has a set of standard operating procedures (SOPs) written by operators which are reviewed and approved by department management and the safety department.   The SOPs are routinely reviewed to ensure they are current and account for any new hazards.\n\nResponse Action in the Event of a Release\n\nAldrich has a 40-hour trained emergency response team to respond to any releases on the site. The response team is capable of level A entries and is staffed on all shifts.  The response team meets 4 times per year to train, review procedures and conduct drills.
