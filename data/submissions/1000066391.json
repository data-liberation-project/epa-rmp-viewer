The Sheboygan facility consists of a series of one to five story masonry and steel buildings encompassing 388,000 square feet on a 583 acre site. These buildings house a variety of manufacturing, packaging, warehousing and administrative operations. Also present at the site are tanks for the outside storage of liquid nitrogen and various solvents.\r\n\r\nThere are seven major chemical operations conducted at the site. Each major operation is housed in its own building and is described below.\r\nProduction 1 Building - (Pro I) is the site for large scale production of air sensitive materials and compounds synthesized at very low temperatures.  Air-sensitive materials must be handled under an inert atmosphere (nitrogen or argon) since they react rapidly with oxygen and/or moisture in the air.  Pro I produces about many different products in vessels ranging in size from 100 to 4,000 gallons.  There is a warehouse associated with Pro I used for staging starting materials and storing product.\r\nProduction II Building - (Pro II) batch manufactures fine organic chemicals.  Process equipment in Pro II ranges in size from 1 liter to 2,000 gallons.  There is a warehouse associated with Pro II used for staging starting materials and storing product.\r\nProduction III Building - (Pro III) is a site for production of air sensitive materials. Air-sensitive materials must be handled under an inert atmosphere (nitrogen or argon) since they react rapidly with oxygen and/or moisture in the air.  Pro III produces about 370 different products in vessels ranging in size from 30 to 800 gallons.  Pro III also has large scale distillation, drying and workup capabilities.

      "SummaryText": "to Address Hazards\r\nSeveral steps are being taken by Aldrich to continually improve safety at the Sheboygan site and reduce the risk of a release.  The PHAs mentioned above are revisited at least every five years.  Routine safety inspections are performed by the operating departments.  The site safety committee audits these safety inspections.   \r\nAldrich has an incident investigation system in place.  Lessons learned from incidents are passed along to the other operating departments.  Each department has a set of standard operating procedures (SOPs) written by operators which are reviewed and approved by department management and the safety department.   The SOPs are routinely reviewed to ensure they are current and account for any new hazards.\r\nResponse Action in the Event of a Release\r\nAldrich has a 40-hour trained emergency response team to respond to any releases on the site. The response team is capable of level A entries and is staffed on all shifts.  The response team meets 4 times per year to train, review procedures and conduct drills.  The response team maintains a response trailer filled with spill response equipment and supplies for use anywhere onsite.  Additional spill response equipment and supplies are kept in each of the operating buildings.  \r\nAldrich also has a Medical Team,  a combination of 15 state License/Certified Medical First Responders and Emergency Medical Technicians.  Besides being able to care for chemical and medical emergencies, the team has been trained  apply c-collars and long board if required, administer EPI for anaphylaxis, and are now being trained to do glucometer testing,  a newly recognized skill by the state of Wisconsin.\r\nThis team gets trained every month and out of which four times a year with the rest of the Emergency Response Team.  \r\n\r\nA site contingency plan details the actions of the response team, other employees, and visitors during a release or other emergency.

In all cases the hazard zone was contained onsite.  Aldrich employees could be affected if a worse-case release scenario occurs.   The effects of any release onsite will be minimized by several factors including: 1) Emergency response team manning the site 24/7, 2) Site wide alarm & PA system and 3) Employee training (ie. evacuation drills, safety training, contingency plan training).  These factors are elaborated upon in the Response Action in the Event of a Release section.  \r\nPrevention of Releases\r\n\tAldrich has put in place several measures to improve operations, improve safety and reduce the risk of a release.  More Process Hazard Analyses (PHAs) have been conducted than required under OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) rule and EPA's RMP.  Recommendations from these PHAs have been enacted to reduce the probability of a release.   Periodic testing of pipeline thickness and an automated emergency shutdown system for Mini-Bulk operations are two examples of recommendations which have been enacted.  \r\nOther measures which Aldrich takes to reduce the probability of a release include:\r\n1) Regularly scheduled maintenance of operating equipment\r\n2) Regular review of operating procedures\r\n3) Regular training of operators\r\n4) Institution and enforcement of hot work & line entry programs \r\n5) Learning Management System to monitor employee training\r\nThere are also systems in place at Aldrich to mitigate a chemical release.   All Mini-Bulk operations are conducted in areas which have dikes and sumps. Chemicals are processed and stored in areas which are electrically rated and have been designed to meet National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) guidelines.\r\nSteps Taken"
