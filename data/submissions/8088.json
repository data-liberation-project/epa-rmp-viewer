WE ARE COMMITTED TO THE PREVENTION OF ANY ACCIDENTAL RELEASE OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA.  IF AND EMERGENCY WERE TO OCCUR, IT IS OUR POLICY TO NOTIFY THE RED CLOUD FIRE DEPT.

A DESCRIPTION OF YOUR FACILITY AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCE HANDLED.    THE PREMARY PURPOSE OF THIS FACILITY IS STORAGE OF FERTILIZERS FOR SALE TO THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR.  ANHYDROUS AMMONIA IS RECEIVED, STORED AND DISTRIBUTED FOR DIRECT APPLICATION.  ACCESS TO THE SITE IS RESTRICED TO AUTHORIZED FACILITY EMPLOYEES, AUTHORIZED MANAGEMENT PERSONNEL AND AUTHORIZED CONTRACTORS.                                                                                                                                                  3.

WE USED RMP COMP TO DETERMINE THE WORST CASE SCENARIO RELEASE AT OUR FACILITY.  FAILURE OF MY LARGEST STORAGE TANK WHEN FILLED TO THE GREATEST AMOUNT WOULD HAVE OFFSITE CONSEQUENCES.                                                                                                                                                 THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO IS BAXED ON THE MOST LIKELY INCIDENT TO OCCUR WHICH IS  A BREAK IN A TRANSFER HOSE.  EACH TANK IS EQUIPPED WITH AN EXCESS FLOW VALVE.           "
