Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe Union Carbide Cypress Catalyst Plant is committed to operating and maintaining all of our processes in a safe and responsible manner.  We have implemented a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public, as well to protect the environment.  These programs include both Union Carbide's Responsible CareR requirements and governmental requirements, such as the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) rule, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard and Louisiana Chemical Accident Prevention Program.\n\n2. Description of the Facility and Regulated Substances\n\nThe Union Carbide Cypress Catalyst Plant is a manufacturing facility that annually produces more than 800,000 pounds of  catalyst.  The material produced  at this facility is sold to 20 customers in the United States and abroad.  SHACb catalyst is used by both Union Carbide and our customers in the manufacturing of polypropylene resin.  The RMP rule requires that if a facility, such as the Cypress Catalyst Plant, has a specific amount (threshold) or more of any one of 140 toxic and flammable chemicals, the facility must follow the RMP rule requirements for that chemical. The Union Carbide Catalyst Plant has one RMP-regulated toxic substance - titanium tetrachloride and one RMP-regulated flammable substance - isopentane.\n\n\n3. Key Offsite Consequence Analysis Scenarios\n\nEPA\u0012s RMP rule requires that we provide information about the worst-case release scenario(s) and alternative release scenario(s) for our facility.

Unless otherwise specified, no credit was taken for administrative controls or mitigation measures in evaluating the off-site impact of the scenarios.  Steps to prevent these scenarios from occurring, and to mitigate their effects should they occur, appear in Section 4.\nA)  Regulated Toxic Chemical \nWorst-Case Release Scenario --\nThis scenario assumes an over-pressure and rupture of a storage tank, releasing 200,000 pounds of titanium tetrachloride as a gas to the atmosphere.  Total contents of tank is released to dike enclosure.  According to EPA\u0012s Offsite Consequence Analysis (OCA) Guidance Table, this release could impact off-site public receptors. The following passive mitigation measure was used in this analysis:\n7 Diked enclosure:  A diked enclosure contains the release and limits the spill area and evaporation rate.\nIn addition, specific steps to prevent this scenario from occurring, and to mitigate its effects should they occur, include:\n7 Relief devices:  Tank Relief device prevents vessel over pressure from any potential sources of pressure increase on the tank.  Relief devices on tank blanketing devices and supply systems are designed to prevent over pressure from external sources.\n7 Overpressure vent to flare: Pressure controls automatically  vent excess pressure to flare systems and alarm on high pressure.\n\n\nAlternative Release Scenario --\nTitanium Tetrachloride:  This scenario assumes failure of a tank truck unloading hose during which results in a liquid spill of 39,000 pounds of titanium tetrachloride, leading to a vaporization of titanium tetrachloride at a rate of 1880 pounds for 310 minutes to the atmosphere.  According to the OCA Guidance Table, this release could impact off-site public receptors.

EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe Cypress Catalyst Plant is located in the middle of the Shell Chemical Plant West Site Facility.  As a result of this unique relationship, Union Carbide contracts the services of Shell Chemical Company and utilizes Shell Chemical\u0012s Emergency Response Program.  \n\nThe Shell Chemical Company maintains a written emergency response program to protect worker and public safety, as well as the environment.  The program consists of procedures for responding to  releases of hazardous substances, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including:\n7 Proper first-aid and medical treatment for exposures\n7 Evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation\n7 Notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs\n7 Post-incident cleanup and decontamination requirements, and\n7 Inspecting, testing, maintaining, and using emergency response equipment.\nThe emergency response program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to facility processes. \n\nThe Shell Chemical  Plant also maintains trained emergency squad to handle fires, explosions, toxic vapor releases, spills, and medical emergencies.  The plant squad trains and drills with local emergency responders to enhance their skills and tactics for responding to an accidental chemical release.  Critiques are held on drills and actual events.  In addition to the plant emergency squad, St. Charles Parish DEP is notified immediately of the incident.  The DEP determines the community impact and takes the appropriate action to protect the community.  Additional resources are also available the mutual aid organizations, if needed. \n\nThe emergency response program provides the essential plannin"

PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nOn-going programs, such as process hazard analysis reevaluations, continually aim to improve process safety.  The following is a list of specific improvements that we are planning to implement at the Cypress Catalyst Plant to help prevent and/or better respond to accidental chemical releases:\n7 A new Corporate program that uses semi-quantitative assessment techniques in process hazard analyses to ensure that controls used for prevention or mitigation of hazards provide adequate protection\n7 A new Corporate program designed to ensure that process safety information is kept up-to-date.\n7 Union Carbide continues to implement a corporate-wide strategy to avoid computer hardware and software systems operating disruptions due to the year 2000 changeover.  The latest information on the company's Y2K efforts can be found on our Internet site -- www.unioncarbide.com. This information will be periodically updated through first quarter 2000.\n7 Installation of new controls to mitigate possible major process hazards resulting from the release of Titanium tetrachloride and Isopentane. A new flammable gas detector for isopentane is being installed that automatically triggers deluge systems, unloading shutdown systems, and alarms.  New critical alarm and instrument control systems and testing programs are being installed and implemented that mitigate over pressure and leak scenarios.  Improved controls that improve  release response action time for transfer pumps are being installed.\n7 New corporate based operator and personnel mandated training programs designed to ensure prevention or mitigation of release scenarios.\n7 Facility audit program to proactively prevent leaks and spills of titanium tetrachloride and isopent"
