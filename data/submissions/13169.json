Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe Union Carbide Cypress Catalyst Plant is committed to operating and maintaining all of our processes in a safe and responsible manner.  We have implemented a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public, as well to protect the environment.  These programs include both Union Carbide's Responsible CareR requirements and governmental requirements, such as the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) rule, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard and Louisiana Chemical Accident Prevention Program.\n\n2. Description of the Facility and Regulated Substances\n\nThe Union Carbide Cypress Catalyst Plant is a manufacturing facility that annually produces more than 800,000 pounds of  catalyst.  The material produced  at this facility is sold to 20 customers in the United States and abroad.  SHACb catalyst is used by both Union Carbide and our customers in the manufacturing of polypropylene resin.  The RMP rule requires that if a facility, such as the Cypress Catalyst Plant, has a specific amount (threshold) or more of any one of 140 toxic and flammable chemicals, the facility must follow the RMP rule requirements for that chemical. The Union Carbide Catalyst Plant has one RMP-regulated toxic substance - titanium tetrachloride and one RMP-regulated flammable substance - isopentane.\n\n\n3. Key Offsite Consequence Analysis Scenarios\n\nEPAs RMP rule requires that we provide information about the worst-case release scenario(s) and alternative release scenario(s) for our facility.

Steps to prevent these scenarios from occurring, and to mitigate their effects should they occur, appear in Section 4.\nA)  Regulated Toxic Chemical \nWorst-Case Release Scenario --\nThis scenario assumes an over-pressure and rupture of a storage tank, releasing 200,000 pounds of titanium tetrachloride as a gas to the atmosphere.  Total contents of tank is released to dike enclosure.  According to EPAs Offsite Consequence Analysis (OCA) Guidance Table, this release could impact off-site public receptors. The following passive mitigation measure was used in this analysis:\n7 Diked enclosure:  A diked enclosure contains the release and limits the spill area and evaporation rate.\nIn addition, specific steps to prevent this scenario from occurring, and to mitigate its effects should they occur, include:\n7 Relief devices:  Tank Relief device prevents vessel over pressure from any potential sources of pressure increase on the tank.  Relief devices on tank blanketing devices and supply systems are designed to prevent over pressure from external sources.\n7 Overpressure vent to flare: Pressure controls automatically  vent excess pressure to flare systems and alarm on high pressure.\n\n\nAlternative Release Scenario --\nTitanium Tetrachloride:  This scenario assumes failure of a tank truck unloading hose during which results in a liquid spill of 39,000 pounds of titanium tetrachloride, leading to a vaporization of titanium tetrachloride at a rate of 1880 pounds for 310 minutes to the atmosphere.  According to the OCA Guidance Table, this release could impact off-site public receptors.
