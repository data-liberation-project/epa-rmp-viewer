Medical exams should include a complete medical history, physical exam, respiratory questionnaire, pulmonary function, blood work, and urinalysis.  The physician may request additional tests/information.\n\nPersonal Protective Equipment;\n \nPersonal Protective Equipment is provided up to Level A protection to be used in Immediately Dangerous to Life or Health (IDLH) situations.  The equipment will be maintained/tested according to the manufacturers guidelines.\n\nMonitoring;\n\nUpon initial entry, air monitoring equipment (gas meters or sampling tubes) will be use to determine chemical levels.  Monitors are calibrated on a semi-annual basis.\n\nPeriodic monitoring will be conducted to ensure conditions have not deteriorated since initial monitoring.\n\nSituations that may require additional monitoring are as follows:\n\n  \u00bf When work begins on a different portion of the site.\n  \u00bf When contaminants other than those previously identified are being handled.\n  \u00bf When a different type of operation is initiated.\n  \u00bf When employees are handling leaking drums or containers or working in areas with obvious liquid contamination.\n\nEmergency Spill Response Equipment;\n\nEmergency Spill Response Equipment is purchased and maintained by the Dairyman's facility. The local Fire Department is responsible for the purchase and maintenance of it\u00bfs own equipment.\n\nEmergency Response Plan Updates;\n\nThe Emergency Response Plan will be tested, reviewed and amended as necessary on an annual basis.\n\nThe plan will also be reviewed and amended if one or more"

      "SummaryText": "of the following occurs.\n\n  \u00bf The plan fails to be effective during an emergency.\n  \u00bf The team updates general procedures.  This may result from a post emergency meeting.\n  \u00bf Emergency phone numbers or contacts change.\n  \u00bf There are changes in the amount, type, or location of emergency response equipment.\n  \u00bf Plan revisions are identified during drills.\n  \u00bf Applicable regulations are revised.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety; \n\n1. Management systems: Ensure that management practices and worker training give priority to accidental release prevention.\n\n2. Personnel training: Provide the facilities anhydrous ammonia refrigeration maintenance technicians and operator personnel additional task based knowledge and hands-on-training to further enhance their technical skills and knowledge. Develop and implement a training program evaluation process to ensure that the employees received the required level of knowledge and skill that was expected\n\n3. Security measures: Improve facilities security by installing building and cold storage area security systems to minimize the potential for unauthorized activities.\n\n4. Process design: Install additional sensors to allow better monitoring of the anhydrous ammonia refrigeration process conditions. Replace older reciprocating compressors with new more efficient reciprocating compressors."
