WORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIOS AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS, INCLUDING ADMINISTRATIVE CONTROLS AND MITIGATION MEASURES TO LIMIT THE DISTANCES FOR EACH REPORTED SCENARIO:\n\nEPA's RMP rule requires that Tippecanoe Labs provide information about the worst-case release scenarios and alternative release scenarios for the facility.  The following are brief summaries of these scenarios, including information about the key administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the exposure distances for each scenario:\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario - Regulated Toxic Chemical - Anhydrous Ammonia\n\nTippecanoe Labs uses anhydrous ammonia as a raw material in fermented products manufacturing.  This worst-case release scenario involves the release of the entire contents of the tank (35,000 pounds) in ten minutes.  According to the EPA's RMP Comp program, using EPA's standard weather conditions, the distance to the toxic endpoint is 3.1 miles.  Approximately 55,000 residents may be affected by this release.  Procedures and alarms limit the volume in the anhydrous ammonia tank to 85% of the tank capacity.\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario - Regulated Flammable Chemical - Ethyl Ether\n\nTippecanoe Labs uses ethyl ether as a solvent in pharmaceutical manufacturing.  This worst-case release scenario involves the entire contents of the tank (44,000 pounds) vaporizing, resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  According to the EPA's RMP Comp program, using an endpoint distance of an overpressure of 1 psi., the flammable endpoint is 0.3 miles.  No residents may be affected, but the explosion may reach a recreation area, the Wabash River.\n\nAlternative Case Release Scenario - Regulated Toxic Chemical - Anhydrous Ammonia\n\nThe alternative release scenario for anhydrous ammonia involves a pipe from the tank being sheared, allowing the contents of the tank (35,000 pounds) to escape in 19 minutes.

      "SummaryText": "ARM (Complex Hazardous Air Release Model) model using typical weather conditions for the Tippecanoe Labs site, the distance to the toxic endpoint is 1.4 miles.  Approximately 3,200 residents may be affected by this release.  Procedures and alarms limit the volume in the anhydrous ammonia tank to 85% of the tank capacity.  Other systems in place to minimize the potential impact of this release include:  routine vessel inspections, proactive maintenance, alarms on critical tank parameters, remote emergency system shutdown stations, excess flow valves, experienced operators and emergency response personnel, and a hazards assessment.\n\nAlternative Case Release Scenario - Regulated Toxic Chemical - Bromine\n\nTippecanoe Labs uses bromine as a raw material in pharmaceutical manufacturing.  The alternative release scenario for bromine involves a transfer hose failure when unloading a supply truck into the storage tank.  This would allow 5,600 pounds of bromine to escape in 94 minutes.  A remotely activated emergency shutoff valve minimizes the amount of bromine released.  According to the CHARM (Complex Hazardous Air Release Model) model using typical weather conditions for the Tippecanoe Labs site, the distance to the toxic endpoint is 1.2 miles.
