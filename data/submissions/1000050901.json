It includes required actions by plant employees as well as required notification and coordination with local responders and agencies. All employees are trained in the execution of the Emergency Action Plan.\n\n\n\nThe Stationary Source and Regulated substances:\n\n\n\nThe Speer Plant is a natural gas liquid stabilization plant. Raw natural gas enters the plant by pipeline. Natural gas liquids separate from the gas stream within the facility's inlet slug catcher. The finished product from the stabilization plant is stored on site and loaded into trucks for local sales.\n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program:\n\n\n\nThe Speer Plant has implemented all the elements of a Program 3 Risk Management Plan (RMP) and all the elements of OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) program. Key elements of these programs include: \n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information: A variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the process.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA): A systematic examination of the plant to identify possible hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards. \n\n\n\nOperating Procedures: The Speer Plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) initial start-up, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) emergency operations, (6) normal shutdown, and (7) startup after turnaround.\n\n\n\nContractors: Speer Plant uses contractors to supplement its workforce during perio"

The program includes Classroom, OJT, and written testing. Employees are tested to demonstrate competency.\n\n\n\nManagement of Change: Changes are reviewed to ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and to verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.\n\n\n\nIncident Investigation:  The goal of each investigation is to determine"

The computerized process control system has its own power backup.\n\nFive-year Accident History:\n\n\n\nNo release of a regulated substance has occurred in the last 5 years that resulted in or could have resulted in off-site consequences.\n\nEmergency Response Program Information:\n\n\n\nThe Speer Plant maintains a written emergency response program to protect employees, contractors, public and the environment from hazards associated with accidental releases of regulated substances.  The program consists of procedures for responding to releases of regulated substances, including the possibility of associated fires or explosions. The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including evacuation plans, accounting for personnel after an evacuation, and notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, if a release occurs.  Employees receive training in these procedures annually to perform emergency response duties. The program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to the gas plant processes. Emergency response program changes are administered through the MOC process.\n\nThe overall emergency response program for Speer Plant is coordinated with Gilcrest / Platteville Fire Protection District. This coordination includes attending periodic meetings, which includes local emergency response officials and industry representatives. The Speer Plant has 24-hour communications capability with the La Salle Fire Department and the Gilcrest / Platteville Fire Protection District.\n\nPlanned Chan"
