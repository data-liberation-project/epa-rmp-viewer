The Schering-Plough Health Care Products facility in Memphis, Tennessee is subject to these regulations because it stores Isobutane in quantities above the listed threshold quantity in the regulation.\n\nThe Person in charge of the RMP Program is Mr. Robert Hopper.  Phone number (901) 320-2384.  24 hour number (901) 320-2364\n\nThe address for this facility is:\nSchering-Plough Health Care Products\n3030 Jackson Avenue\nMemphis, Tennessee 38151 \n\nThis facility is designed to receive, store and distribute finished products in aerosol canisters.\n\nThe worst case scenerio for the facility is the ignition of one canister of a stored aerosol can containing isobutane.  The impact from this scenario is no more than 30 feet.  This impact radius was obtained from the data resulting from an actual release of the covered substance at the facility within the last 10 years.\n\nSchering-Plough Health Care Products is also covered under the OSHA PSM regulations.  Due to the stringent requirements of these regulations, Schering-Plough has active, on-going accident prevention programs in place."
