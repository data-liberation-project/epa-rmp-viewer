PAUL PARK REFINING CO., LLC\n\nJune 2014\n\n\n\nNorthern Tier Energy LLC, St. Paul Park Refining Co., LLC\n\nRisk Management Program Plan\n\n\n\n1.  EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\n\nSt. Paul Park Refining Company, LLC (SPPRC), is committed to operating in a manner that protects its employees and contractors, the public, and the environment.  As part of this commitment, SPPRC has established systems to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility.  One part of these systems is a risk management program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at SPPRC and that complies with the requirements of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (USEPA) rule 40 CFR part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule). One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit a Risk Management Plan (RMP) describing the risk management program at SPPRC.  This document is intended to satisfy the RMP executive summary requirements of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program at SPPRC.\n\n\n\n1.1  Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nSPPRC is committed to the safety of its workers and the public and to the protection of the environment through the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances.  SPPRC employs highly skilled and trained operating personnel and has implemented administrative and operational controls to reduce the likelihood of hazardous substance releases.  In addition, a trained Emergency Response Team (ERT) equipped with dedicated equipment resources is available to respond to a significant accidental release.  The overall emergency response program for SPPRC is coordinated with the facility Emergency Response Team (ERT), an internal Emergency Operations Center team, WAKOTA CAER (a local emergency response cooperative), state and local government agencies, and off-site emergency response resources that could be ca"

SPPRC evaluates each situation and responds based on our internal capabilities and training and, if necessary, contacts the state and local agencies to assist in controlling and containing the release and to prevent and/or reduce the consequences of the release. \n\n\n\nThe SPPRC Refinery Manager has overall responsibility for the development and implementation of the risk management program for USEPA-regulated processes at the facility.  However, the specific responsibilities for certain aspects of that program have been delegated by the Refinery Manager to other personnel who report either directly, or indirectly through other management personnel, to the Refinery Manager.  Those relationships are depicted on the organization chart maintained by the Refinery Manager's staff.  Specific responsibility for the implementation of the Process Safety Management (PSM) and accident prevention program has been delegated to the PSM/RMP Coordinator. Similarly, responsibility for the RMP hazard assessment and risk management plan has been delegated to the PSM/RMP Coordinator.  The emergency response program, including compliance with the RMP aspects of that effort, is the responsibility of the refinery's ERT/Fire Chief.  In keeping with our policy that safe operation is part of every employee's job, many other personnel are also involved in RMP activities on an ongoing basis. \n\n\n\n1.2 SPPRC Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nSPPRC operates a petroleum refinery and petroleum products terminal facility located in St. Paul Park, Minnesota.  Crude petroleum is the raw material used to make a variety of petroleum-based products, including gasoline, diesel fuel, kerosene, and liquefied petroleum gases such as propane and butane.  Many of these products are flammable substances specifically listed by USEPA in the RMP rule and are present in our process units above the USEPA threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds.  In total, we have 15 different proc"

These units are listed in the RMP data included with this summary.\n\n\n\nSPPRC also handles two toxic substances regulated by the RMP rule in sufficient quantity to be covered by the RMP rule.  Hydrofluoric acid (HF) is used as a catalyst in the HF Alkylation unit to make high quality gasoline blending components, and hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is present as a by-product of the desulfurization (sulfur removal) process in the refinery Heavy Distillate Hydrotreating (HDH) unit.\n\n\n\n1.3 Offsite Consequence Analysis\n\n\n\nSPPRC performed an offsite consequence analysis to estimate the potential for an accidental release of a regulated substance that could affect the public or the environment.  The offsite consequence analysis consists of evaluating both worst case scenarios and alternative release scenarios for flammables and toxics as defined by the USEPA.  A worst case release scenario event is unlikely to ever occur.  An alternative release scenario represents a release that might occur during the lifetime of a facility like SPPRC.  Alternative release scenarios can be used to help local emergency responders, such as fire and police departments and the county and state emergency managers, to improve local emergency response planning.  Release scenario analyses have been submitted to USEPA and have shared that information with the organizations involved in emergency response activities.  It should be noted that no events in the magnitude of these worst-case or alternative incident scenarios have ever occurred at the facility.  In the case of some of these incident scenarios, emergency mitigation systems would reduce the consequences of the events should they occur.  In all cases, should such events occur, the emergency response plan would be implemented, local authorities would be notified, and appropriate actions would be taken to protect both employees and the public.\n\n\n\nAs stated previou"

Because the processes regulated by the USEPA RMP regulation are also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) process safety management (PSM) standard and because the OSHA PSM requirements are very similar to the USEPA RMP requirements, this summary also addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements.  The PSM program at this facility has been extended by SPPRC, where necessary, to satisfy USEPA's Program Level 3 accident prevention program requirements.\n\n\n\n    Employee Participation\n\n\n\nSPPRC encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents to participating as a member on the process hazard analysis (PHA), incident investigation, and compliance audit teams.  Employees have access to all information created as part of the SPPRC accident prevention program.  Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at SPPRC and addresses each accident prevention program element.  In addition, SPPRC has a number of initiatives that address process safety and employee safety issues, such as a Behavior-Based Safety Program and monthly employee safety communication meetings.\n\n\n\n    Process Safety Information\n\n\n\nSPPRC maintains a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.

This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known compatibility issues associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  For specific process areas, SPPRC has documented safety-related upper and lower operating limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) in Critical Process Variable Documents.  SPPRC operates equipment within these limits by using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\n\nSPPRC also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, relief system design, applicable codes and standards, safety systems, etc.  This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\n\n\nSPPRC also maintains Troubleshooting Guides for all process units which identify the consequences from operating outside the normal operating range and provides steps for reestablishing operation within the normal operating range.\n\n\n\n    Process Hazard Analysis\n\n\n\nSPPRC"

Within the PHA program, each process is thoroughly and systematically examined by qualified team members to identify specific conditions which could result in accidental releases and to ensure that adequate measures are implemented to manage those hazards.\n\n\n\nSPPRC primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques available.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating experience and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes recommendations for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary. \n\nThe PHA team recommendations are forwarded to local management for resolution.  Approved safety improvements being implemented in response to PHA team recommendations are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each recommendation is documented and retained.\n\n\n\nSPPRC periodically updates and revalidates the PHA results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.

In addition, SPPRC operating procedures provide guidance on how to respond to events that result in exceeding safe operating limits for specific process or equipment parameters.  The written operating procedures are readily available to operators in the process units and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\n\n\n    Training\n\n\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, SPPRC has implemented a company training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  New employees must receive basic training in SPPRC operations. After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  In addition, all operating employees periodically receive refresher training to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years.  All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training. Additional training for operators and other refinery personnel includes fire training and computer based training related to safety and environmental programs.\n\n\n\n    Contractors\n\n\n\nSPPRC uses contractors to supplement its work force during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.

This is accomplished by providing contractors with access to (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, (4) safe work practices, and (5) work permit processes (i.e., for hot work, confined space, etc.) prior to their beginning work.  In addition, SPPRC evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor and conducts annual audits of each contractor's safety program to ensure that the relevant requirements are being met.  Additionally, SPPRC personnel periodically monitor or audit contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\n\n\n    Pre-startup Safety Reviews\n\n\n\nSPPRC conducts a pre-startup safety review for any new equipment or equipment modification that require a change in the process safety information.  The purpose of the review is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and the equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides one additional means to verify that construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that supporting systems are operationally ready.

      "SummaryText": "history indicates a good record with respect to the prevention of accidental releases over the past 5 years. All incidents during the past 5 years were evaluated for potential reporting under the accidental release provisions of the RMP rule which includes on-site impact and off-site impact.  Based on this review, none of the incidents were determined to be a reportable under the provisions of the RMP regulation. \n\n\n\n1.7  Emergency Response Program\n\n\n\nSPPRC maintains a written emergency response program which is in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment.  The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, refinery evacuation plans and accounting for refinery personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post-incident cleanup and decontamination requirements.  In addition, SPPRC has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment, as well as instructions that address the use of emergency response equipment.  Employees receive training in these procedures to perform their specific emergency response duties.  The Emergency Response Team conducts additional training sessions so that they can safely handle potential emergency situations.  The emergency response program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to refinery processes or facilities. \n\nThe overall emergency response program for SPPRC is coordinated with the facility's Emergency Response Team (ERT), WAKOTA CAER, a local emergency response cooperative, and with offsite response agencies that would be requested to support emergency response efforts as needed.  This coordination includes periodic "

      "SummaryText": "meetings which include local emergency response officials, local government officials, and industry representatives. SPPRC has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate government officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., fire department).  This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.  In addition to participating in periodic mutual aid meetings, SPPRC conducts periodic emergency drills that involve emergency response organizations, and the refinery provides periodic refresher training to local emergency responders regarding the hazards of regulated substances in the refinery. \n\n\n\n1.8      Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nSPPRC constantly strives to improve the safety of its operations through periodic safety reviews, the incident investigation program, and a program soliciting safety suggestions from the workers.  SPPRC resolves all findings from PHAs, some of which result in modifications to the process.  \n\n\n\nThe following types of changes are planned during the next 5 years:\n\n\n\n?      Alky Quantitative Risk Analysis (QRA) Upgrades - Supplemental HF release mitigation upgrades consisting of an additional water mitigation curtain around acid circulating equipment and an automated shutdown/isolation system based on signals from local HF detectors;\n\n?      Relief System Improvements - Redesign and replacement of the HDH flare knockout drum to comply with the requirements of API 520 and 521 by increasing the  of the knockout drum;\n\n?      Tank Rundown Temperature Indication - Installation of temperature monitoring equipment and alarm instrumentation for rundown streams to storage tanks that have the potential for hazardous releases due to the presence of water or product vaporization;\n\n?      Elimination of Threaded Pipe - Implement a project to identify threaded piping components in hydrocarbon service in need of replacement to eliminate the potential for leakage "
