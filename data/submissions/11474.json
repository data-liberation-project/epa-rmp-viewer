      "SummaryText": "Amrex Chemical Company is a wholesale chemical distributor that warehouses and repackages a variety of hazardous and nonhazardous chemicals.  The facility's prevention program includes implementation of procedures to address employee safety and to reduce the risk of accidents involving hazardous chemicals.  This program has been successful in that there have been no reportable accidents.  The facility is subject to both OSHA's Process Safety Management reequirements and EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP) requirements.  The only chemical stored at the Loughlin Road facility that exceeds threshold quantity for RMP requirements is formaldehyde.  The toxic endpoint for both the worst case and alternative case scenarios were calculated to be 0.1 miles.  The WCS was based on the complete release of a full drum of formaldehyde to the outside.  RMP*Comp was used to estimate toxic endpoint distances."
