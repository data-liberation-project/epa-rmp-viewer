The MWTP has established four levels of events involving the potential for a chlorine leak or an actual chlorine leak.\n\nLEVEL I.\nChlorine containers are being delivered by the vendor or are being installed by plant personnel. Response to small leaks occurring upon connection of container or at other times involves shutting valves and isolating sections of lines and equipment for needed repair. Notification of the Fire Department's Emergency Response Commander is voluntary.\n\nLEVEL II\nMaintenance or replacement is being performed for a faulty online device such as a tank valve. Chlorine is not being released. However, the device cannot be easily isolated or the chlorine evacuated. Though this operation is routine, the procedure by Plant Personnel will not begin until Fire Department personnel are adjacent to the Plant site in a standby role.\n\nLEVEL III\nChlorine gas is being released but the situation is under control. Liquid chlorine is not being released. The chlorine scrubber is operating properly, the release is contained in the chlorine building, "

      "SummaryText": "and the release rate is not excessive.LEVEL III represents an emergency that requires a \"911\" call to the Fire Department. Under no cicumstance will entry be made into the chlorine storage building or repairs begun until Fire Department personnel arrive on the scene. Stopping a leak with a chlorine container repair kit not be attempted for a LEVEL III situation.\n\n LEVEL IV\nChlorine gas is being released and the situation may be out of control. The release rate is large or could likely become so. The release may include liquid chlorine. The chlorine scrubber may not be operating. The release has or likely will escape the chlorine storage building and threaten the surrounding area. Human life and health at and near the plant site could be endangered. Under no cicumstances will entry be made into the chlorine storage building or repairs begun until Fire Department personnel arrive on the scene. If it becomes necessary to use a chlorine container \"B\" kit, repairs will made by a trained HazMat team either from the City of Arlington or the City of Fort Worth. The City of Mansfield has mutual aid agreements with both th Arlington and Fort Worth Fire Departments and the Arlington Fire Department has HazMat teams in close proximity to the City of Mansfield.\n\nAs indicated above, MWTP personnel will not attempt to stop a major leak. However, procedures have been established for notifying the Firee Department and for protecting, rescuing, and accounting for plant personnel. Procedures have also been established for for notifying nearby schools and other public places and residences potentially affected by a chlorine leak. Depending on the severity of the leak and prevailing wind conditions, people will be advised to either move immediately upwind of the leak or to remain indoors with windows closed and air conditioners and ventilation systems turned off.\n\nFACILITY DESCRIPTION / REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nThe MWTP is 20 MGD water treatment facility. Chlorine, aqueous ammonia,"

      "SummaryText": " and chlorine dioxide are handled at the MWTP. However, only chlorine is stored in quantities subject to the requirement of 40 CFR 68.\n\nWORST CASE AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nThe worst case scenario assumes a 1,100 pound release over ten minutes with a wind speed of 1.5 meters/second, an \"F\" stability class, and urban topography. A passive mitigation factor of 0.55 has been assumed as the chlorine containers are stored in a building. Using the Breeze Haz model and the above assumptions results in a worst case distance to toxic endpoint of 1.54 miles. The chlorine scrubber was assumed to not operate during the worst case release.\n\nThe alternative release scenario assumed a valve or pipe failure resulting in a one inch diameter opening. Using the above mentioned model a wind speed of 3.0 meters/second, a \"D\" stability class, urban topography, and a 0.55 mitigation factor resulted in a 0.72 mile distance to the toxic endpoint for chlorine. Credit was not taken for the chlorine scrubber in the altenative release scenario because the scrubber, if operating as designed, would prevent any measurable offsite impact."
