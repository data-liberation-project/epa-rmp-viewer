A representative of the Florida Bureau of LP Gas visited and inspected this facility on 05/12/98.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThis facility was constructed in 1950 and is in compliance with NFPA-58 Standard. In June of 2000, we plan to place guard posts along plant piping to protect from vehicle contact. And July 2000 we plan to replace 150 PSIG valves on the barge dock with 300 PSIG valves and flanges. These planned changes will meet and / or exceed NFPA-58, 1998 Edition."
