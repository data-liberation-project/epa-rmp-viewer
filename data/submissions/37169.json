      "SummaryText": "OVERVIEW\nHeetco, Inc. (Heetco) owns and operates the Heetco Farm Center (HFC), a fertilizer mixing and distribution operation, in La Belle, a rural community in northeast Missouri (Facility). This HFC maintains a 30,000 gallon anhydrous ammonia storage tank containing a maximum of 115,000 pounds of unrefrigerated, pressurized liquid anhydrous ammonia. HFC also maintains as many as fifty (50) 1,000 gallon nurse tanks for use by farmers during agricultural application of the anhydrous ammonia during farming activities. Anhydrous ammonia is a listed toxic substance subject to Section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act Amendments, Risk Management Plans.\n\nIt is the policy of Heetco to adhere to all applicable Federal and State rules and regulations. Safety at the facility depends on the training of employees, adherence to safety procedures and standards, and safety devices inherent in the design of the facility.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN\nThe purpose of the plan is to ensure the protection of employees in an emergency situation. The personal safety of each employee is and always will be of primary importance to Heetco. The plan includes procedures for notification of the local emergency authorities.\n\nWORST CASE SCENARIO\nAn explosion of the largest tank on-site (30,000 gallons) when filled to the maximum intended capacity would release 115,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia into the atmosphere. It is assumed for this scenario that the entire contents of the tank would be released as a liquid spill with vaporization to the atmosphere in a ten (10) minute period. The distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L was calculated to be 5.6 miles. This distance extends past the site boundary and encompasses several residences and other businesses.\n\nALTERNATE RELEASE SCENARIO\nThe alternate release scenario is assumed to be a release from a pipe during a 15 minute period. The maximum release rate from this scenario is 7,520 pounds per minute. The toxic endpoint of this scenario is 1.6 miles. T"

Employees have been trained in the processes, procedures, and Emergency Response Plan.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nNo accidents have occurred at the HFC during the past five (5) years."
