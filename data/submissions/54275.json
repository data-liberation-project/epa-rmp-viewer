This  water treatment plant compose of two plants with two chlorine process  in the same site.  The New wastewater tratment palnt (3.0 MG) and the Old (1.5 MG) used only for recirculation are owned by Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Authority (PRASA) which is a Government Agency.  PRASA has developed the RMP following the Program #3 for the Management and Prevention of Risks associated with the storage and handling of the toxic substance used as for water disinfection.  The RMP was prepared in compliance with EPA 40 CFR Part 68.  The Prevention Program was prepared in accordance with OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation, as established in 29 CFR Part 1910.119.\n\nAccidental Release:\nIt is PRASA policy to comply with EPA and OSHA Federal and State applicable requirements. Chlorine is a toxic substance regulated by EPA, for that reason both facilities are observing the appropriated engineering controls.  The  design is to improve safety and as a part of the Prevention Plan implanted to protect the wellness of workers, employees, contractors, visitors and immediately surrounding areas and inhabitants.\n\nThe Stationary Source and Regulated Substance handled.\nSanta Isabel Old and New Wastewater Treatment Plants are located close to the Mar Caribe where the plant discharges the treated water.  The chlorine is used as a disinfectant to destroy the microorganism that could cause illness in humans and contamination of the ocean.\nThe chlorine is delivered from the PRASA Chlorine Warehouse and Distribution Center at Puerto Nuevo to the plant in one (1) ton containers.  Santa Isabel Old Wastewater Treatment Plant could have a storage maximum volume of 4,000 pounds distributed in two (2) containers.  One container is connected to chlorinator using 20 pounds per day. The chlorine flows to the vacum dosificator and from it  the chlorin"

For the New plant two containers are connected to chlorinators (90 pounds per day) the chlorine flows to the vacuum dosificator and from it the chlorine solution is sent to ejectors, where it is combined with the used water at the end of plant\u00bfs process. \n\nWorst Case Scenario:\nThe Worst Case Scenario for the New plant was determined as indicated in the EPA Wastewater Treatment Plant, as per Appendix F Supplemental Risk Management Program Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants.  This guidance considers the release of the Chlorine Gas of the entire container (2,000 pounds) during 10 minutes and other specifications related to the weather conditions and a radio of 3 miles, for a chlorine concentration equal or higher than 3 ppm, which is the American Industrial Hygiene Association exposure limit above which it is determined human health will be affected.  Using the Landview 6 Simulator and the US Census 2000, it was identified that 11,837 public receptors are inside the 3 miles radio.  No known environmental receptors (state parks, or official designated wildlife preserves) are located within this radio area.  The ALOHA Modeling Dispersion Program was used to simulate the gas dispersion. Same scenario was determined for the Old plant but the public receptors identified this time were 11,851 inside the 3 mile radio. No known evironmental receptors are located inside the 3 miles radio.\n\nAlternative Case Scenario:\nThe more realistic scenario was also simulated as per EPA Wastewater Treatment Plants parameters, as a release of the total content of a 2,000 pounds container, but throughout a 3/8 inch pipe leak.  In such case the end point distance is calculated as 0.2 miles and 126 public receptors were identified over the most recent map.  No known environmental receptors are located within the radio area.\n\nGeneral Accident Release Prevention Program \nPRASA is actual"

Standard Operational Procedures (SOP\u00bfs) are already in place to comply the OSHA and PROSHO requirements in order to keep all the involved parties aware of the hazardous and risk related to the chlorine.  List of all SOP\u00bfs are indicated in the PSM report and are located in the plant.\n\nEmergency Response Program:\nPRASA has various SOP\u00bfs to manage emergency programs associated to a release of the chemical and also related to the emergency actions to be taken before and after hurricanes and other atmospherics events.\n\nFive years Accident History:\nNo mayor release of chlorine in excess of ten (10) lbs has been reported during the last five years. \n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:\nPRASA has implemented in Santa Isabel Old and New Wastewater Treatment Plants, a vacuum operated systems to improve the control of the process and the safety of the chlorine handling and storage.  It is still needed to reinforced administrative activities related to containers handling and transportation,  preventive maintenance and audits. Recommendations were given on that regard on last PHA dated August 20, 2008."
