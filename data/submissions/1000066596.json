The regulated substances of concern and focus of this document are ammonia and sulfur dioxide. The following topics are addressed in the Executive Summary:\n\n\n\n?    Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n?    Stationary Source and Regulated Substance\n\n?    Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\n?    Five Year Accident History\n\n?    Emergency Response Program\n\n?    Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\n\n\nE&J Gallo - Livingston uses ammonia to provide refrigeration for wine cooling. The facility also uses sulfur dioxide to preserve wine.  E&J Gallo senior management is not only committed to offering superior service, but also to maintaining a safety and environmental program to promote a safe environment for all its employees and the surrounding communities.  E&J Gallo - Livingston's safety and environmental policies are administered by the EHS Manager, who conducts regular inspections of the facility to ensure compliance, and oversees the entire safety and environmental programs at the facility.  These programs include hazard communications, lockout/tagout, Hazardous Materials Emergency Business Plan, employee safety manuals, Emergency Response Plan, as well as the Risk Management Plan.\n\n\n\nE&J Gallo personnel circulate throughout the plant, taking note of unusual conditions in any portion of the systems. In the event that an ammonia or sulfur dioxide leak is discovered, the person nearest to the leak will alert any personnel in the immediate area who are unaware of the danger, and Maintenance Manager and/or their supervisor. The Maintenance Manager and/or supervisor will determine what procedures and personnel are necessary to remedy the problem. Emergency agencies will a"

River Rd. in Livingston, California, which is approximately 2.3 miles east of Highway 165 and 3.6 miles southwest of Highway 99.  The area immediately surrounding the facility is rural with a mixture of agricultural and sparse residential areas. The regulated substance of concern at E&J Gallo - Livingston is anhydrous ammonia.\n\n\n\nThe facility uses ammonia as a refrigerant within nine closed ammonia refrigeration systems. Each of the nine refrigeration systems, consisting of piping, valves, and equipment, cycles ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration for wine chilling.\n\n\n\nE&J Gallo also stores sulfur dioxide in one-ton cylinders. The one-ton cylinders serve as the supply to fill smaller hand-held sulfur dioxide cylinder \"guns\" (100 pound guns). The portable dispensing \"guns\" are filled at a one ton cylinder and transported throughout the facility as needed for the wine making process. The sulfur dioxide cylinders and guns are always outdoors. Sulfur dioxide is used at facility to sparge the headspace of the wine tanks, preventing unwanted organism growth on the surface of the wine and to meet sulfur compound level specifications.  A maximum of 40,000 pounds (20 one-ton cylinders) of sulfur dioxide is stored in the East Storage location.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nA prevention program is in place to minimize the risk of hazardous chemical releases in accordance with the California Occupational Safety and Health Administration (CalOSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (Section 5189 of Title 8, CCR) and the EPA Risk Management Program. This prevention program covers those proce"

Some of the specific activities in the prevention program include:\n\n\n\n-Process safety information is provided to all applicable employees upon hire and is accessible at all times.\n\n-In depth process hazard analysis are completed every five years by qualified personnel using techniques approved under the PSM standard.\n\n-Written operating procedures (kept up to date) are used for training and guiding the work of operators.\n\n-Training is provided to all employees upon hire, and refresher training is given at least every three years or upon request.\n\n-Operators, mechanics, and contractor personnel are qualified, trained in the general hazards in the facility, and informed of any temporary situations affecting safety.\n\n-Pre-startup safety reviews are conducted to insure that conditions for safe operation have been satisfied prior to starting new or modified equipment.\n\n-A program is in place to maintain the mechanical integrity of the process, which includes written procedures, training requirements, equipment deficiency requests for employees, work orders, scheduled maintenance, and documentation.\n\n-A hot work permit system assures that work is done safely and properly.\n\n-A management of change system is in place to ensure that changes are managed safely.\n\n-Incidents are investigated and actions are taken as part of a continuous improvement effort.\n\n-Routine audits are conducted to assure that safe practices are being followed.\n\n\n\nThis systematic approach to process safety involves employees and strives for continuing improvements in overall safety. The training, qualifications, and safety awareness of the operations, maintenance, and management personnel are a key element in reducing and mitigating accidents.\n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nAn investigation into the facility's accident "

The Emergency Response Plan (Plan) is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of the PSM/RMP/CalARP document. This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n\n\n1. To save lives.\n\n2. To minimize and avoid injuries.\n\n3. To protect the environment.\n\n4. To minimize property damage.\n\n\n\nThe E&J Gallo facility maintains a safety committee whose members are the designated emergency coordinators for the facility. The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia and sulfur dioxide health hazards, and mitigation procedures, which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility. This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year. This Plan is reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations.\n\n\n\nThe E&J Gallo - Livingston facility has a trained Emergency Response Team onsite that responds to emergency situations, including chemical releases. The facility plans to coordinate emergency response efforts with the fire department on a periodic and ongoing basis. At a minimum, there is an annual emergency response drill that is coordinated with emergency medical responders, Merced Department of Environmental Health, and the local Fire Department.\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nThe Process Hazard Analysis Revalidation, including a Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) study and a Facility Inspection, provided mitigation measures to improve safety at the E&J Gallo facility. The facility's safety committee is planning to complete several items over the next year, as a continual effort to provide a safe work environm"
