Therefore, the Building #12 scenario was used to determine the consequence analysis component for the worst case scenario.\n\n\fAlternative scenarios for the four systems were considered and it was determined that due to the facility administrative controls, the multiple safeguards pertinent to the ammonia process, and the fact that there has never been an offsite release at this facility in the past 30 years, there was no alternative scenario which would have an offsite consequence.  However, if there is a potential loss of ammonia it would be due to a possible loss from a relief valve within the system.  The predicted release would consist of approximately 50 pounds of anhydrous ammonia released over a ten minute period.  The release inside the building would have no offsite consequence.  An outside release would possibly have a 0.1 mile offsite consequence, yet would probably not leave the property, and there would be no offsite receptors affected."

The 345,000 square foot facility utilizes approximately 75,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant within four separate, enclosed systems for ice manufacturing and storage.\n\nThe complex consists of four individual ammonia refrigeration systems with a standard refrigeration design using anhydrous ammonia as its refrigerant.  These systems are contained in Building #2, Buildings #11 and #12, Building #14, and Buildings #15 and #16.  Within all four systems the compressors have numerous protective controls (motor overload, high discharge temperature, high discharge pressure, low suction pressure, and low oil pressure) that will shut down the compressor if operating limits are violated.  The compressors are continually monitored; the Building #14 system compressors are also controlled by a computerized operating system.\n\nThe Building #2 ammonia system consists of three compressors operating at +10 F.  The compressors receive ammonia gas from two refrigerant recirculators, compress the gas, and discharge the hot, high pressure ammonia through oil separators to three condensers located on the roof.  The evaporative (forced air, water cooled) condensers transfer the ammonia's heat to the atmosphere and return the condensed (liquid) ammonia to the high pressure receiver.  High pressure liquid ammonia is then transferred to the two recirculators.  The liquid ammonia is pumped at an approximate two to one ratio from the recirculators to the ice machines through liquid flow regulators where the flashing ammonia removes heat from the water, creating ice.  From the ice machines the ammonia gas and liquid combination returns to the recirculators to begin the refrigeration cycle over again.\n\nBuildings #11 and #12 are a freezer warehouse complex consisting of 81,753 square feet.

The facility considered worst case release scenarios relating to the four separate ammonia systems in their respective buildings.  This involved calculating worst case scenarios utilizing the RMP*Comp modeling program.\n\nThe Building #2 model considered the release of 5,870 pounds of liquid ammonia from an intermediate pressure vessel, during a 10 minute release.  This was used as the release source as it is the vessel which would house the largest amount of regulated substance at any given time for this system.  The scenario endpoint was 0.3 mile.  This scenario generated a toxic endpoint of 200 ppm , the maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed nearly all individuals can be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects or symptoms which could impair an individuals ability to take protective action.\n\nThe scenario for Building #12 consisted of the catastrophic loss of 6,167 pounds of liquid ammonia in a 10 minute release from a high pressure receiver.  In this scenario the toxic endpoint was 0.7 mile.\n\nThe modeled scenario for the Building #14 system was the catastrophic release of 7,666 pounds of ammonia in a 10 minute release.  Although somewhat larger than the amount released in Building #12, the toxic endpoint for the Building #14 model was only 0.4 mile.  In this scenario the ammonia is liquid due to refrigeration as opposed to pressure and the size of the building then contributed to additional mitigating circumstances.\n\nThe final scenario for the Building #16 system consisted of the release of 4,055 pounds of liquid ammonia during 10 minute release.  As in Building #16 the ammonia is liquified under pressure and the toxic endpoint was 0.6 mile.\n\nIn reviewing the four worst case scenarios it was noted that the release from Building #12 would cover the same area as any release from the other three syst"
