Introduction\n\n\n\nA Risk Management Program has been implemented at the Carl Buddig and Company (Carl Buddig) facility located in Montgomery, IL for the reduction of accidental releases of hazardous materials. This Risk Management Plan (RMP) summarizes the management, administrative, procedural, and technological controls that work together to minimize the risk to site personnel, contractors, visitors, and the community and environment at large of hazardous chemical releases. The updated 5-year RMP is organized to correspond with specific U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) RMP, Program 3 of 40 CFR 68, definitions and requirements of Subpart G, including: \n\n\n\nIntroduction;\n\n\n\nCarl Buddig and Company policies to protect health, environment, and safety;\n\n\n\nFacility identification and regulated substances covered processes;\n\n\n\nHazard Assessment;\n\n\n\nPrevention Program;\n\n\n\nFive-Year Accident History;\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Plan; \n\n\n\nEmergency Communications;\n\n\n\nSpill Reporting / Environmental Release Procedures;\n\n\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety; and\n\n\n\nManagement Program\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nII. Carl Buddig Policies To Protect Health, Environment, and Safety\n\n\n\nRisk management and safety are important concerns at Carl Buddig; this updated 5-year RMP formalizes and documents these activities. Carl Buddig is committed to conducting its operations in a safe and responsible manner and to reducing risks to human health and to the environment. It is Carl Buddig policy to comply with all applicable federal, state, and local rules and regulations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis RMP has identified potential hazards and has taken steps to design and maintain a safe facility in order to prevent releases, and minimize the consequences of accidental releases, which could occur. RMP addresses potentially catastrophic chemical releases that could result in immediate harm and acute health effects to offsite receptors (public and environment\n\nal).

Facility Identification\n\n\n\nThe Carl Buddig and Company facility is located at 2125 Rochester Dr. in Montgomery, Illinois. The facility is a producer of custom and specialty meat products. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe NAICS code for the facility is 311612. Many areas of the plant are refrigerated to preserve meat and meat products. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe facility uses ammonia for refrigeration, and is regulated under 40 CFR Part 68, the EPA RMP Rule. There are two (2) refrigeration systems onsite that are used for refrigerating meat and meat products. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe amount of ammonia currently present in the east refrigeration system is approximately 25,000 pounds. The east refrigeration system is used to cool production rooms, holding freezers, and the office area. This system is a single stage system with five (5) high stage compressors. Evaporators in the production areas are fed with high pressure liquid from the receiver, through the accumulator.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe amount of ammonia currently present in the west refrigeration system is approximately 0 pounds. The west refrigeration system is used to cool production rooms and holding coolers. It is a single stage system with three (3) high stage compressors. Evaporators in the production areas are fed with high pressure liquid from the receiver, through the accumulator. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe total amount of ammonia onsite, considering the quantities in the east ammonia refrigeration system and the west ammonia refrigeration, is approximately 25,000 pounds, which is above the minimum threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds. \n\n\n\n\n\nIV.

Appendix D consists of the offsite consequence analysis data and maps for the alternative release scenario. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVI. General Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\n\n\nA prevention program is in place to minimize the risk of hazardous chemical releases in accordance with the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (29 CFR 1910.119) and the EPA Risk Management Program. However, as discussed through out this document Carl Buddig and Company is actively working on improving this program. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis prevention program covers those processes that handle ammonia above the threshold quantity for both PSM and RMP rules. The most recent audit of the PSM program was conducted on March 12, 2015, and the next audit will occur before March 12, 2018, in compliance with the requirement to conduct PSM audits every three years. The elements of the PSM / Program 3 prevention program and a brief description are listed below.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation - Carl Buddig and Company has updated a site-specific employee participation plan that ensures employees and their representatives are consulted when conducting and developing process hazard analyses and other information required to be developed under the PSM/RMP regulation. In addition, the employee participation program will ensure employees and their representatives have access to process hazard analyses and all other information required to be developed under PSM/RMP. \n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information - Carl Buddig and Company maintains a site-specific PSI program that ensures information pertaining to the hazards, technology, and equipment of the process are properly developed and maintained. \n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis - Carl Buddig and Company has updated a site-specific PHA program that ensu"

In addition, this program ensures PHAs are conducted in accordance with OSHA and EPA regulations and ensures findings and recommendations of PHAs are properly documented. Carl Buddig and Company conducted a thorough PHA study for the East and West ammonia refrigeration systems during September of 2014.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures - Carl Buddig and Company has updated a site-specific procedure that ensures operating procedures provide clear instruction for different phases of process operations and ensures they are properly maintained. Carl Buddig and Company updated operating procedures for both the East and West refrigeration systems in February of 2015. Annually, the operating procedures will be reviewed and certified as accurate.\n\n\n\nTraining - Carl Buddig and Company has updated a site-specific training procedure that ensures employees operating the ammonia process have the knowledge to safely operate the process, are aware of the potential hazards of the process, and understand the causes of process problems.\n\n\n\nManagement of Change - Carl Buddig and Company has updated a site-specific management of change procedure that ensures changes (except for replacement in kind) to the ammonia process, such as additions of new equipment or changes in operating, maintenance, or other procedures are documented. \n\n\n\nPre-Startup Review - Carl Buddig and Company has updated a site-specific pre-startup safety review procedure that ensures a safety review is performed when modifications to the ammonia process are significant enough to require a change in PSI.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity - Carl Buddig and Company has updated a site-specific mechanical integrity procedure that ensures written preventative maintenance procedures are developed and maintained, \n\npreventative maintenance tests and inspections are properly documented, and employees mai"

This procedure will also make provisions to ensure a report is prepared at the conclusion of the investigation and findings are promptly addressed. \n\n\n\nCompliance Audit - Carl Buddig and Company has updated a site-specific compliance audit program that ensures compliance audits are conducted at a minimum of every three years to verify that Carl Buddig and Company PSM/RMP practices and procedures are adequate and are being followed. \n\n\n\nHot Work Permits - Carl Buddig and Company has updated a best management practice for hot work. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVII.
