THE WORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO FOR ANHYDEROUS AMMONIA WOULD BE THE RELEASE OF THE TOTAL CONTENTSOF STORAGE TANK RELEASED AS A GAS OVER A TEN MINUITE PERIOD. THE MAXIMUM QUANITY RELEASED WOULD BE 140,000 POUNDS WHICH REPRESENTS THE VOLUME OF THE 30,000 GALLON STORAGE TANK AT 85% CAPICITY AS LIMITED BY MDESIGN STANDARDS. THE DISTANCE TO THE ENDPOINT[POINT OF DISPERSION TO 220PPM] IS 1.12 MILES.\n\n      B. THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO FOR ANHYDEROUS AMMONIA BASED ON THE HAZARD REVIEW IS A TWO MINUITE RELEASE FROM A BREAK IN A 3 INCH PIPE.  THE DISTANCE TO THE ENDPOINT[POINT OF DISPERSION TO 220PPM] IS .78 MILES.\n\n4.
