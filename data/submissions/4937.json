      "SummaryText": " Dutch Quality House-II stores and uses one chemical that is regulated by EPA's Risk Management Program.  This chemical is Ammonia for refrigeration.  We currently have maximum storage capacity of 18,000 pounds of Ammonia at the Dutch Quality-II facility.\n\nDutch Quality House-II believes that the ammonia we store and handle on site has very real and potential dangers.   However, it is important to keep the risks in perspective.   Dutch Quality House-II's ammonia storage and handling facilities:\n1.  are properly designed\n2.  have effective operation and maintenance procedures\n3.  employ trained operators and technicians\n4.  periodically conduct safety audits, and\n5.  are constantly upgrading its processes to meet or exceed industry standards\n\nDutch Quality House-II also has taken a proactive approach towards coordinating emergency efforts with the Bossier City Fire Department.  The Bossier City E.M.A. has a copy of our emergency response program and is well trained and prepared to respond to the potential spills and leaks that may occur at the Dutch Quality House-II facility.  The Bossier City Fire Department conducts annual site visits to our facility.  \n\nA facility which maintains high standards, such as Dutch Quality House -II, provides less public risk than a facility that does not provide safe operations.  Dutch Quality House-II complies with Federal OSHA rules and guidelines for safe handling, storage and operation of ammonia systems.  We also utilize outside ammonia system experts to periodically inspect our systems integrity, train system operators and upgrade systems to improve safety.  As a result of Dutch Quality House-II's safety program, Dutch Quality House II has had no releases of ammonia which resulted in any off site injury or illiness in the past five years.\n\nBecause of the large quantities of ammonia Dutch Quality House-II stores on site, there is a very small probability that there could be off-site consequences if a major leak occurred.

      "SummaryText": "ality House-II used EPA's OCA Guidance for off-site consequence analysis of ammonia.\n\nWORST-CASE SPILL\nIn the event of a worst-case ammonia release (18,000 pounds in 10 minutes), a .7 mile radius around the Dutch Quality House-II facility may have to be notified and possibly evacuated.  According to 1990 Census Data, 326 people in the surrounding community may have to be notified that an evacuation may be necessary.\n\nALTERNATIVE-CASE SPILL\nA 500 pound release was used to determine an alternatiave-release scenario, which could result in a release of ammonia that could travel .1 mile and should not have toxic impact on the general public.\n\nCONCLUSION\nDutch Quality House II believes that the poultry industry should proactively inform the public of the potential dangers and the actions that Dutch Quality House II has taken to minimize these dangers.  Dutch Quality House-II has a long-great ongoing relationship with the community.  We encourage any and all citizens who have concerns or questions to contact our facility.  We look forward to continuing our relationship in Bossier Parish."
