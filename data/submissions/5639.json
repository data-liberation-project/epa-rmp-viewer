The residential population within a circle with a radius corresponding to the toxic endpoint distance has to be defined, to estimate the population potentially affected.\n\nThe worst case release scenario at the water treatment plant involves a failure of a one ton container of chlorine.  The offsite consequence analysis was performed using conditions pre-defined by EPA, namely the release of the entire amount as a gas in 10 minutes, use of the one hour average ERPG-@ as the toxic endpoint, and consideration of the population residing within a full circle with a radius corresponding to the toxic endpoint distance.  EPA set these conditions to facilitate the performance of the offsite consequence analysis; however the assumptions used may be unrealistic because:\n                (1) Only a fraction of the compressed liquified chlorine released to the atmosphere flashes as a \n                      vapor.  The remianing unflashed liquid forms liquid-droplet aerosols.  This results in the \n                      formation of a very dense chlorine cloud consisting of vapor and liquid droplets, with\n                      dispersion characteristics significantly different than for a cloud consisting only of chlorine\n                      gas.\n                (2) It is not appropriate to compare a 10 minute release to an one hour average standard\n                (3) Only the population within an elliptical plume extending downwind of the release point\n                      is potentially affected.\nEPA mandated certain meteorological conditions for the worst case release, namely Atmospheric Stability   Class F and wind speed of 1.5 meters/second.\n\nWhen atmospheric dispersion modeling for the worst case scenario was performed using the EPA assumptions, a distance to toxic end point of 1.3 miles.

This rupture would cause a hole in the cylinder of approximately 1 inch in diameter.  Using EPA approved guidelines this size of an opening would release 150 pounds/minute of chlorine.  Meteorlogical conditions of Atmospheric Stability Class D and wind speed of 3.0 meters/second gives us a distance to toxic endpoint of 0.2 miles.  An estimate of 25 people potentially affected was obtained.\n\n\nThe RWSB accidental release prevention program is based on the following key elements:\n              (1) High level of training of the plant opertors and personnel\n              (2) Preventative maintenance program\n              (3) Use of effective operating procedures\n              (4) Performance of a hazard review of equipment and procedures\n              (5) Implementation of an auditing and inspection program\nChemical specific prevention steps include the availability of self-contained apparatus, to be worn by the operators during connection/disconnection of the chlorine supply, awareness of the toxic properties of chlorine, and the presence of a chlorine detector.\n\n\nThere  have been no accidental releases of chlorine at the facility in the past five years.\n\n\nThe facility has an emergency response program, which has been coordinated with the Russellville Fire Department and the Franklin County LEPC.

All applicable procedures of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Prevention Program are adhered to.  The RWSB emergency response plans which are tailored to our facility and to the emergency response services available in the community, and is in compliance with the EPA Emergency Response Program requirements.\n\n\nThe H.E. Neal III Water Filtration Plant processes approximately six million gallons of water a day.  This plant furnishes water for the City of Russellville along with areas outside the corporate limits of the city.  The treatment plant is located just west of the city, next to Lake Elliott.  The amount of chlorine handled is two one-ton cylinders, only one is in process at a time.  The facility is manned around the clock with trained water treatment operators who can respond to any alarm that may occur.\n\n\nThe offsite consequence analysis includes consideration of two chlorine release scenarios, identified as worst case release and  alternative release.  The first scenario is defined by EPA, which states that       the owner or operator shall assume that the maximum quanity in the largest vessel is released as a gas over 10 minutes, due to an unspecified failure.  The alternative scenario is defined as  more likely to occur than the wost case release scenario.\n\nAtmospheric dispersion modeling has to be performed to determine the distance traveled by the chlorine released before its concentration decreases to the toxic endpoint selected by EPA of 3ppm, which is the Emergency Response Planning Guideline Level 2 (ERPG-2).  This is defined by the American Industrial Hygiene Association as the maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing irr"
