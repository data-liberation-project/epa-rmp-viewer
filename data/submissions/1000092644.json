The PSM/RMP includes all Program 3 Accident Prevention Program elements: Management System, Employee Participation, Process Safety Information, Process Hazard Analysis, Operating Procedures, Training, Contractor, Pre-Startup Review, Mechanical Integrity, Hot Work Permit, Management of Change, Incident Investigation, Emergency Response, Compliance Audits, and Trade Secrets.\n\n\n\nAmmonium Polyphosphate (APP) fertilizer is produced by blending anhydrous ammonia with super-phosphoric acid in a reacting chamber and then mixing with water.  The process equipment is physically connected by process piping to the 18,000 gallon stationary anhydrous ammonia pressure vessel.  The process equipment consists of a Stationary Reactor (SR) that is owned and operated by the Facility.  The SR ancillary equipment includes liquid pumps, process piping, reacting chamber, valves, evaporative cooling tower, flow meters, and pressure and temperature gauges.  The SR does not have any storage capabilities for anhydrous ammonia. The APP product is not subject to the RMP rule.\n\n\n\nFacility Process Operators: (1) transfer anhydrous ammonia, super phosphoric acid, and water to the SR; (2) monitor flows, temperatures, and pressures; and (3) transfer APP to storage.  The Facility is responsible for training its Operators in accordance with the PSM/RMP Operating Procedures and maintaining the equipment in accordance with the PSM/RMP Mechanical Integrity Program.\n\n",

The PSM/RMP describes the Accident Prevention Program that includes: Management System, Employee Participation, Process Safety Information, Process Hazard Analysis, Operating Procedures, Training, Contractor, Pre-Startup Review, Mechanical Integrity, Hot Work Permit, Management of Change, Incident Investigation, Emergency Response, Compliance Audits, and Trade Secrets.\n\n\n\nThis Facility stores and handles anhydrous ammonia in a single stationary pressure vessel (PV).  The process equipment includes: (1) one 18,000-gallon PV and ancillary process piping, valves, liquid pump, gauges (volume, temperature, and pressure), and safety systems (cable actuated emergency shutoff valves, backflow check valve, excess flow valves, and bulkhead).\n\n\n\nThe Facility receives anhydrous ammonia by a Contractor that transports the anhydrous ammonia with a commercial cargo tank.  The commercial cargo tank is temporarily parked on the Facility property while the anhydrous ammonia is transferred to the stationary PV.  The Contractor performs the transfer of anhydrous ammonia from the commercial cargo tank to the stationary PV.  The Facility does not own or operate the commercial cargo tank.  The Contractor is responsible for training their operators and maintaining their equipment.  At a minimum, the Contractor must (1) have in place and certify compliance with applicable and relevant DOT, OSHA, state and local regulatory requirements, (2) make available to the Facility and EPA upon request any contractor-related documentation necessary to demonstrate compliance, and (3) certify that it has in place emergency shut-down procedures for anhydrous ammonia transfer operations.  The Facility coordinates with the Contractor on Emergency Contingency procedures and will provide access to the Facility PSM/RMP upon request by the Contractor.\n\n\n\nTrained Process Operators operate the covered process which includes the: (1) monitoring of temperature, volume, and pressures during storage; and (2) transfer of anhydrous ammonia from the stationary PV to Covered Process 2 (Fertilizer Blending).  These operations are conducted in accordance with the PSM/RMP Operating Procedures.  Trained personnel perform maintenance on this covered process in accordance with the PSM/RMP Mechanical Integrity Procedures.\n\n",

      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\n\nThe Helena Agri-Enterprises, LLC Mason City, IA Facility has submitted this updated electronic RMP in compliance with the provisions of the Clean Air Act ? 112(r), OSHA 29 CFR ? 1910.119, and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) at 40 CFR ?68. The OSHA PSM and EPA Subpart D RMP standards are applicable to the two covered processes operated at this Facility.  This electronic RMP summarizes the policies and procedures implemented by the Facility to minimize the likelihood of an accident, and to ensure that a response to a release will be implemented in a proper and timely manner.\n\n\n\nPURPOSE FOR UPDATING RMP\n\n\n\nThe Facility is submitting this as a 5-year update in accordance with the rule. All accident prevention elements have been reviewed and/or updated.   \n\n\n\nIt is important to note that the maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia that is stored and handled at the Facility is 83,949 lbs.  Although the maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia that is stored and handled at the Facility is 83,949 lbs, the total quantity reported in this EPA RMP Report is 167,898 lbs.  The reason for this is because the single anhydrous ammonia pressure vessel (i.e. 83,949 lbs) is counted a second time to account for the Fertilizer Blending (APP) process that is connected to the single stationary pressure vessel.  \n\n\n\nFACILITY\n\n\n\nThe operations at this Facility consist of chemical storage and handling, fertilizer blending, and distribution.  One chemical (i.e. anhydrous ammonia) is stored and handled at quantities that exceed the regulatory threshold quantity.  Covered processes operated at this Facility include:\n\n\n\nCovered Process 1: Anhydrous Ammonia (NH3) Storage and Handling\n\nCovered Process 2: Fertilizer Blending (APP) \n\n\n\nOFF-SITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\n\n\n\nWorst case and alternative case consequence analyses were completed for the two (2) covered processes.  The worst case scenario for Covered Processes 1 and 2 assumes that all the contents in the largest singl"

The release scenario consists of the PV being punctured on the side at the ground level and the release is modeled as a ground level horizontal jet at the maximum temperature. \n\n\n\nThe alternative (or more likely to occur) scenario for Covered Process 1 assumes a 1-minute release from a violent rupture of a 2-inch transfer hose caused by an impact or pull-away during a transfer operation.  This alternative scenario considers active mitigation of the safety equipment (i.e. emergency shutoff and excess flow valves on the commercial cargo tank; and cable operated emergency shutoff valves, backflow check valve, and excess flow valves on the PV side of the bulkhead), and operating procedures that the Facility uses to safeguard against releases from ammonia transfer operations.\n\n\n\nThe alternative scenario for Covered Process 2 assumes a 30-second release of anhydrous ammonia due to a 2\" braided hose failure during a transfer event from the pressure vessel to the SR.  This alternative scenario considers active mitigation of the safety equipment (i.e. cable operated emergency shutoff valves at the PV), and operating procedures that the Facility uses to safeguard against releases from ammonia transfer operations.\n\n\n\nACCIDENT PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe Warehouse Person implements the risk management planning process at this Facility. The Warehouse Person is assisted by other trained personnel as directed. The Warehouse Person is responsible for ensuring that its employees are properly trained in the implementation of the Program 3 Accident Prevention Program elements as related to their responsibilities.  The accident prevention program elements addressed in the PSM/RMP combined program includes: Management System, Employee Participation, Process Safety Information, Process Hazard Analysis, Operating Procedures, Training, Contractor, Pre-Startup Review, Mechanical Integrity, Hot Work Permit, Management of Change, Incident I"
