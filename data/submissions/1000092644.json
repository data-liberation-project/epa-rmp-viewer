      "SummaryText": "e pressure vessel (i.e. 18,000 gallons) are released.  The release scenario consists of the PV being punctured on the side at the ground level and the release is modeled as a ground level horizontal jet at the maximum temperature. \r\n\r\nThe alternative (or more likely to occur) scenario for Covered Process 1 assumes a 1-minute release from a violent rupture of a 2-inch transfer hose caused by an impact or pull-away during a transfer operation.  This alternative scenario considers active mitigation of the safety equipment (i.e. emergency shutoff and excess flow valves on the commercial cargo tank; and cable operated emergency shutoff valves, backflow check valve, and excess flow valves on the PV side of the bulkhead), and operating procedures that the Facility uses to safeguard against releases from ammonia transfer operations.\r\n\r\nThe alternative scenario for Covered Process 2 assumes a 30-second release of anhydrous ammonia due to a 2 braided hose failure during a transfer event from the pressure vessel to the SR.  This alternative scenario considers active mitigation of the safety equipment (i.e. cable operated emergency shutoff valves at the PV), and operating procedures that the Facility uses to safeguard against releases from ammonia transfer operations.\r\n\r\nACCIDENT PREVENTION PROGRAM\r\n\r\nThe Warehouse Person implements the risk management planning process at this Facility. The Warehouse Person is assisted by other trained personnel as directed. The Warehouse Person is responsible for ensuring that its employees are properly trained in the implementation of the Program 3 Accident Prevention Program elements as related to their responsibilities.  The accident prevention program elements addressed in the PSM/RMP combined program includes: Management System, Employee Participation, Process Safety Information, Process Hazard Analysis, Operating Procedures, Training, Contractor, Pre-Startup Review, Mechanical Integrity, Hot Work Permit, Management of Change, Incident I"

      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThe Helena Agri-Enterprises, LLC Mason City, IA Facility has submitted this updated electronic RMP in compliance with the provisions of the Clean Air Act \u00a7 112(r), OSHA 29 CFR \u00a7 1910.119, and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) at 40 CFR \u00a768. The OSHA PSM and EPA Subpart D RMP standards are applicable to the two covered processes operated at this Facility.  This electronic RMP summarizes the policies and procedures implemented by the Facility to minimize the likelihood of an accident, and to ensure that a response to a release will be implemented in a proper and timely manner.\r\n\r\nPURPOSE FOR UPDATING RMP\r\n\r\nThe Facility is submitting this as a 5-year update in accordance with the rule. All accident prevention elements have been reviewed and/or updated.   \r\n\r\nIt is important to note that the maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia that is stored and handled at the Facility is 83,949 lbs.  Although the maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia that is stored and handled at the Facility is 83,949 lbs, the total quantity reported in this EPA RMP Report is 167,898 lbs.  The reason for this is because the single anhydrous ammonia pressure vessel (i.e. 83,949 lbs) is counted a second time to account for the Fertilizer Blending (APP) process that is connected to the single stationary pressure vessel.  \r\n\r\nFACILITY\r\n\r\nThe operations at this Facility consist of chemical storage and handling, fertilizer blending, and distribution.  One chemical (i.e. anhydrous ammonia) is stored and handled at quantities that exceed the regulatory threshold quantity.  Covered processes operated at this Facility include:\r\n\r\nCovered Process 1: Anhydrous Ammonia (NH3) Storage and Handling\r\nCovered Process 2: Fertilizer Blending (APP) \r\n\r\nOFF-SITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nWorst case and alternative case consequence analyses were completed for the two (2) covered processes.  The worst case scenario for Covered Processes 1 and 2 assumes that all the contents in the largest singl"
