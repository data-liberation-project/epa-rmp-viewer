Atlanta Terminal stores various grades of gasoline and ultra-low sulfur diesel and transfers the products to local distributers and end-users in the vicinity of Georgia, Georgia. This facility also operates a Butane Blending Process to allow for butane to be injected into gasoline prior to delivery. The Butane Blending Process is considered covered under the Risk Management Plan rule as it includes storage of butane in above-ground pressurized storage vessels in excess of the identified threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds. Butane is received by truck, stored in 2x 60,000 gallon vessels, and blended into gasoline.\r\n\r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\r\n\r\nAtlanta Terminal has a strong commitment to worker and public safety and invests appropriate resources in accident prevention. The Butane Blending Process has been designed and installed in accordance with Recognized and Generally Accepted Good Engineering Practices including National Fire Prevention Association Code #58 - Liquefied Petroleum Gas Code. Written operating and maintenance procedures have been developed and employees and contractors are trained in their proper execution.  In addition, a written Facility Response Plan is in place and employees are trained in the expected emergency response actions. Atlanta Terminal is considered a \"non-responding Facility\". If an emergency were to occur, it is the company's policy to notify the local responding agencies through the 911 service and evacuate.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND MAINTENANCE PROGRAM\r\n\r\nThe Butane Blending Process was designed and constructed in accordance with the National Fire Protection Association Code #58 - Liquefied Petroleum Gas Code. In addition"

      "SummaryText": ", the Process is compliant with the fourteen (14) elements of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's Process Safety Management regulations for Highly Hazardous Chemicals (29 CFR 1910.119). \r\n\r\n\r\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nThere has been no accidental release from the butane process at the Atlanta terminal that has required reporting under the RMP rule within the past five years.\r\n\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\r\n\r\nThe facility is considered a non-responding facility.  It maintains a written Facility Response Plan.  Within the past five years the butane storage and blending process has had no accidental releases that have caused offsite impacts provided in the RMP rule.  In the event of fire or explosion, or a release of a regulated substance from the butane process, entry within the distance to the specified endpoint may pose a danger to public emergency responders.  Therefore, emergency responders should not enter the area unless directed through the unified or incident command process.  The undersigned certifies that to the best of my knowledge, information, and belief, the information submitted is true, accurate, and complete.\r\n\r\n\r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\n\r\nNo changes are currently planned to the butane process.  As opportunities for improvement associated with the butane process arise at the Atlanta Terminal, they will be evaluated by Buckeye Partners L.P."
