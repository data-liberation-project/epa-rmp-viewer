If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, county LEPC, EPA, and other applicable authorities to mitigate the release and minimize its impact on people and the environment.\n\n2.  Facility and Regulated Substance Handled  \n\nThe primary activity at this facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a fertilizer for crop production. \n\n3.  Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThis facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by The American National Standards Institute (ANSI), and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\".  The facility has also complied with the Ohio Department of Agriculture \"Regulations For Storing And Handling Fertilizer Anhydrous Ammonia\".\n\n4.  Five-Year Accident History\n\nThere has been one accidental release of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years.  The release was due to a leaking valve on a hose end at the loadout riser.  The release resulted in the evacuation of Tower Automotive factory, across the road from the facility and within the alternate release distance.  The hose end valve was replaced as corrective action, and phone numbers for Tower Automotive were posted at the plant telephone.  \n\n5.  Emergency Response Program\n\nThe facility has: \n-a wri"

Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at this facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed by company personnel and by the Ohio Department of Agriculture to assess the safety of equipment and procedures.  There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation as this time."
