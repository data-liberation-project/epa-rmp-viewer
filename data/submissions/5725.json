In this water treatment plant facility (Bossier City Water Plant), we handle chlorine which is considered hazardous by EPA, OSHA, etc.  The same properties that makes chlorine valuable as a water treatment chemical, also makes it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling chlorine.  Overall, the prevention of unnecessary human exposures, reducing the threat to our own personnal health as well as our co-workers, and reducing the threat to nearby members of the community is the main goal of incorporating this risk management plan into our daily operations.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal and state rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the manner inwhich we handle chlorine combined with the safety devices inherent in the design of this facility, with the safe handling procedures that we utilize, along with the training of our presonnel.\n\nOur emergency response (action) program was developed with the assistance of Environmental Data Services, Inc.  The emergency response polan includes the procedures for notification of the Caddo-Bossier Office of Emergency Preparedness, which helps to notify any potentially affected neighbors.  In the event of an emergency that cannot be mitigated solely by manual shutoff of a chlorine system, notification to the Caddo-Bossier Office of Emergency Preparedness will be made to aid in notification of the surrounding population (318-425-5351).\n\nThe primary purpose of this facility is to treat the water system by utililzing chemicals such as chlorine.  Chlorine is received by individual one ton cylinders and stored until needed.  Chlorine is fed into the waste water system by automatic feeders.  All cylinders operated on a vacuum system.  This vacuum system will prevent the continual operation of the system if there is an increase or decrease in operating pressure on the cylinders or feed lines.  Acess to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, aut"

      "SummaryText": "horized management personnel, and authorized contractors.\n\nThe regulated substance handled at this facility is chlorine.  The maximum amount of chlorine that can be stored at this plant is 12,000 pounds.\n\nThe worst case sccenario is failure of the largest storqage tank when filled to the greatest amount allowed, which would be a release of 2,000 pounds of chlorine.  Active mitigation has been considered for this scenario consisting of manual shutoffs, as well as the vacuum system.  Passive mitigation has also been considered for this release scenario, which would be the release into an enclosed space with contact with outside air.  It is assumed that the entire contents of the cylilnder are released as vapor.  The distance to endpoint of 0.078 mg/l for the worst case scenario is 3.5 miles.\n\nAn alternate release scenario was determined for this facility; however, based on the type of prevention system in place, the alternate release should be minimal.  The vacuum system has been determined to be effective in preventing small amounts of chloirne fromm escaping upon system failure.  An estimation based on the line capacity for the feeder lines would be approximately 10 pounds released into the atmosphere.  This amount of vapor chlorine would result in a distance to endpoint of approximately 0.07 miles.\n\nThis water treatment facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule, and with all applicable state codes and regulations.\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of chlorine from this facility in the past five years.  The automatic vacuum system limits the amount (if any) of chlorine that escapes durine operational periods.  Operators of the chlorination system are required to check instrument, cylinders, feed systems, etc on a daily basis to aid in the prevention of accidental releases.\n\nOur emergency response (action) plan was developed with the assistance of Environmental Data Services, Inc.
