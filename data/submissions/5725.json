              "Description": "Bossier City Water Plant is a municipal water treatment facility.  This facility falls under the NAICS Code 22131.  Our safety information was last reviewed and updated March 18, 1999. nWew are subject to the handling codes of the National Fire Protection Association for Compressed Gas Cylinder Storage, American National Standards Institute, and the American Society of Mechanical Engineers.  These standards, along with applicable (though not required) OSHA standards have been implemented through written manuals.  Even though this is a municipal facility, and is not governed by OSHA regulations, Bossier City WaterTreatment Plant has decided to use Process Safety Management as the prevention program.  To prevent/limit releases, this facililty uses an automatic feed and shutoff vacuum system, manual shutoff valves, and pressure regulators.  This facility also uses chlorine detection alarms which indicate a release with a visual and audible alarm.  Operating and training procedures were reviewed last on March 18, 1999.  All employees (plant operators) go through their training on the operating procedures when hired, and throughout their employment.  The employees at Bossier City Water Treatment Plant are trained in the classroom during safety meetings, and on-th-job training.  The last review of the maintenance procedures was also on March 18, 1999.  There have been no incidents or accidents in the past five years.  The last hazard review was conducted on March 18, 1999 by use of a fault tree analysis.  The prevention program for this facility is required to be a Level 2, however, a Level 3 PSM Prevention Program has been added for a more effective release prevention program.",

In this water treatment plant facility (Bossier City Water Plant), we handle chlorine which is considered hazardous by EPA, OSHA, etc.  The same properties that makes chlorine valuable as a water treatment chemical, also makes it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling chlorine.  Overall, the prevention of unnecessary human exposures, reducing the threat to our own personnal health as well as our co-workers, and reducing the threat to nearby members of the community is the main goal of incorporating this risk management plan into our daily operations.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal and state rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the manner inwhich we handle chlorine combined with the safety devices inherent in the design of this facility, with the safe handling procedures that we utilize, along with the training of our presonnel.\n\nOur emergency response (action) program was developed with the assistance of Environmental Data Services, Inc.  The emergency response polan includes the procedures for notification of the Caddo-Bossier Office of Emergency Preparedness, which helps to notify any potentially affected neighbors.  In the event of an emergency that cannot be mitigated solely by manual shutoff of a chlorine system, notification to the Caddo-Bossier Office of Emergency Preparedness will be made to aid in notification of the surrounding population (318-425-5351).\n\nThe primary purpose of this facility is to treat the water system by utililzing chemicals such as chlorine.  Chlorine is received by individual one ton cylinders and stored until needed.  Chlorine is fed into the waste water system by automatic feeders.  All cylinders operated on a vacuum system.  This vacuum system will prevent the continual operation of the system if there is an increase or decrease in operating pressure on the cylinders or feed lines.  Acess to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, aut"

      "SummaryText": "horized management personnel, and authorized contractors.\n\nThe regulated substance handled at this facility is chlorine.  The maximum amount of chlorine that can be stored at this plant is 12,000 pounds.\n\nThe worst case sccenario is failure of the largest storqage tank when filled to the greatest amount allowed, which would be a release of 2,000 pounds of chlorine.  Active mitigation has been considered for this scenario consisting of manual shutoffs, as well as the vacuum system.  Passive mitigation has also been considered for this release scenario, which would be the release into an enclosed space with contact with outside air.  It is assumed that the entire contents of the cylilnder are released as vapor.  The distance to endpoint of 0.078 mg/l for the worst case scenario is 3.5 miles.\n\nAn alternate release scenario was determined for this facility; however, based on the type of prevention system in place, the alternate release should be minimal.  The vacuum system has been determined to be effective in preventing small amounts of chloirne fromm escaping upon system failure.  An estimation based on the line capacity for the feeder lines would be approximately 10 pounds released into the atmosphere.  This amount of vapor chlorine would result in a distance to endpoint of approximately 0.07 miles.\n\nThis water treatment facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule, and with all applicable state codes and regulations.\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of chlorine from this facility in the past five years.  The automatic vacuum system limits the amount (if any) of chlorine that escapes durine operational periods.  Operators of the chlorination system are required to check instrument, cylinders, feed systems, etc on a daily basis to aid in the prevention of accidental releases.\n\nOur emergency response (action) plan was developed with the assistance of Environmental Data Services, Inc.
