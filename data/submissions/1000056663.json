Ching \n\nReviewed on:  02/22/2016\n\n\n\n\n\nKauai Coffee Company, LLC (KCOF) maintains a number of buildings and facilities throughout its ??????-3,100 acre plantation that include the Maintenance and Machine Shops, Electric Shop, Factory Lab, Kanani and Pali Uli Milling buildings, Orchard buildings, Main Office, and Visitor Center.\n\nAlthough Kauai Coffee Company takes precautions to prevent them, emergencies do occur. When they do, they require quick, correct and decisive responses.  Employees have been informed of the company's planned response to emergency situations, and they are expected to adhere to these guidelines.\n\nI.    Emergency Evacuation Plan\n\n    For any spills or accidental release of a hazardous substance, employees will follow plans specific to the substance that has been released.\n\nII.    Critical Operations\n\n     If any emergency occurs on a project involving propane, combustion engine equipment or electrical tools, Kauai Coffee Employees will shut off propane sources at the cylinders and turn off all equipment before evacuating, provided employee safety is not jeopardized by doing so. \n\n\n\nPlanning / Questions to discuss:\n\n?    Does this project involve the use of propane?  Yes or No?\n\n?    Does this project involve the use of combustion engine equipment?      Yes or No?\n\n?    Does this project involve the use of electrical tools or other ignition sources?  Yes or No?\n\n?    Does this project involve the use of other critical operations not listed?      Yes or No?\n\n\n\n     If our employees are not able to shut off propane supplies, the fire department or other responding emergency agency will be notified of the presence and locations of the propane tanks.\n\n\n\n     List locations of propane on this site:\n\n1.

As a precaution, chemicals are stored on spill pans, trays, or containment areas.  Employees who mix chemicals also pour over a spill pan to minimize the potential for spills.  However, as a worst case scenario, the spill of Paraquat Dichloride will be corrected as follows:\n\n\n\n1.    Control the spill at its source\n\n2.    Contain the spill to prevent from spreading or contaminating soil from entering sewage and drainage systems or any body of water\n\n3.    Clean up spill immediately, observing precautions outlined in chemical SDS.\n\n4.    Cover entire spill with absorbing material and place into compatible disposal container.  Scrub area with hard water detergent (e.g. commercial products such as Tide, Joy, Spic and Span, etc.)\n\n5.    Pick up wash liquid with additional absorbent and place into compatible disposal container\n\n6.    Once all material is cleaned up and placed in a disposal container, arrange for disposal.\n\n\n\nFor spills related to gasoline and/or diesel fuel, a Spill Prevention, Control, and Countermeasures (SPCC) plan is in place.\n\n\n\nTraining for pesticide safety and Worker Protection Standard will be done on an annual basis for all employees with potential exposure to chemical hazards.\n\n\n\nEmployees who mix and apply chemicals are monitored an on a daily basis with occasional observations by department supervisor and/or manager.\n\n\n\n    -  Accidental release:  During the past 5 years, Kauai Coffee has not had an accident involving an accidental release.\n\n\n\n List locations of paraquat dichloride on this site:\n\n1.
