As a precaution, chemicals are stored on spill pans, trays, or containment areas.  Employees who mix chemicals also pour over a spill pan to minimize the potential for spills.  However, as a worst case scenario, the spill of Paraquat Dichloride will be corrected as follows:\r\n\r\n1.\tControl the spill at its source\r\n2.\tContain the spill to prevent from spreading or contaminating soil from entering sewage and drainage systems or any body of water\r\n3.\tClean up spill immediately, observing precautions outlined in chemical SDS.\r\n4.\tCover entire spill with absorbing material and place into compatible disposal container.  Scrub area with hard water detergent (e.g. commercial products such as Tide, Joy, Spic and Span, etc.)\r\n5.\tPick up wash liquid with additional absorbent and place into compatible disposal container\r\n6.\tOnce all material is cleaned up and placed in a disposal container, arrange for disposal.\r\n\r\nFor spills related to gasoline and/or diesel fuel, a Spill Prevention, Control, and Countermeasures (SPCC) plan is in place.\r\n\r\nTraining for pesticide safety and Worker Protection Standard will be done on an annual basis for all employees with potential exposure to chemical hazards.\r\n\r\nEmployees who mix and apply chemicals are monitored an on a daily basis with occasional observations by department supervisor and/or manager.\r\n\r\n\t-  Accidental release:  During the past 5 years, Kauai Coffee has not had an accident involving an accidental release.\r\n\r\n List locations of paraquat dichloride on this site:\r\n1.\t  Weed control department storage\r\n\r\n List locations of diesel fuel on this site:\r\n1.\t  Con-vault: 1,000 gal\r\n2.\t  Above-Ground Storage tanks behind equipment shop (currently drained to approximately 1,000 gal) to be removed in 2016)\r\n\r\n List locations of gasoline on this site:\r\n1.\t  Con-vault:  1,000 gal\r\n\r\nIII.\tMethods to Account for Kauai Coffee"
