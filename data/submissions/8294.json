Employees have\nbeen assigned various tasks to ensure that all elements of the RMP are implemented.  We have\ndeveloped many different forms to assist employees in recording and documenting the various\nelements of the RMP. \n\nAt the time of submittal of this Risk Management Plan, there have been no accidental releases of\nchlorine or sulfur dioxide at our facility in the past five years.  However, in the event that there is\nan accidental release of chlorine or sulfur dioxide, an Emergency Action Plan has been written in\ncompliance with 29 CFR 1910.38.  The Facility is also included in the community emergency\nresponse plan.  Employees at our facility do not respond to accidental releases of chlorine and sulfur\ndioxide, but coordinate with outside responders.  Therefore, in accordance with 40 CFR 68.90, an\nEmergency Response Program is not required for our facility.  In the event that a chlorine or sulfur\ndioxide release occurs, all employees are required to evacuate the process area and report the\nincident.  The emergency action plan consists of evacuation procedures, facility emergency numbers,\nand coordination with the City of Bradenton Fire Department.  The plan also addresses notification\nprocedures to the public and the local emergency response agency.   \n \nWe participated in the local Safety Street demonstration and are willing to conduct tours of our\nfacility for members of the public."

      "SummaryText": "THE CITY OF BRADENTON WASTEWATER TREATMENT FACILITY\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nThe City of Bradenton Wastewater Treatment Facility is a facility whose primary activity is the\ntreatment of wastewater.  The Facility uses two regulated toxic substances at the Facility.  The first\nsubstance is chlorine (CAS 7782-50-5) which is used as a disinfectant to treat wastewater during the\nchlorination process.  The second substance is sulfur dioxide (CAS 7446-09-5) which is used during\nthe dechlorination process to remove the residual chlorine from the effluent and maintain discharge\ncompliance.  \n\nThe chlorination process consists of chlorine storage and the chlorination system used to disinfect\nthe wastewater.  The chlorination process begins with the withdrawal of chlorine from the chlorine\ncylinders by a vacuum created by vacuum regulators mounted on the cylinders.  The chlorine gas\ntravels through PVC pipes to chlorinators, where the chlorine supply is regulated and measured. \nFrom the chlorinators, chlorine is mixed with reuse water by chlorine injectors to produce a solution\nwhich is injected into the effluent water for disinfection. \n\nThe dechlorination process is similar to the chlorination process.  It consists of the sulfur dioxide\nstorage and the dechlorination system.   Sulfur dioxide is withdrawn from the sulfur dioxide\ncylinders by a vacuum created by vacuum regulators, passed through PVC pipes to the sulfonators,\nfinally to the sulfur dioxide injectors where sulfur dioxide in solution is injected into the chlorinated\neffluent.  \n\nThe hazard assessment was performed on the chlorination and dechlorination processes using the\nUnited States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) RMP*CompTM. Model.  The worst-case\nrelease scenario was assumed to be the release of a one ton cylinder  for a duration of 10 minutes in\nan enclosed building.  For this scenario, the off-site consequence analysis indicated that off-site\nreceptors could be potentially impacted by the release o"

      "SummaryText": "the release of chlorine or sulfur dioxide due to human error, our prevention program\nensures that operating procedures are current and reviewed annually.  Training also plays a vital part\nin our program.  Employees and contractors working near or on the chlorination and dechlorination\nprocesses are required to be trained in the processes and the hazards of chlorine and sulfur dioxide. \n \n\nTo prevent equipment failure that could result in an accidental release, our program ensures that\nequipment inspections, tests, and preventive maintenance in accordance with accepted engineering\npractices and includes manufacturer's recommendations.  All chlorine and sulfur dioxide cylinders\nare examined upon delivery and are rejected if there are any signs of damage.  In addition, equipment\npertaining to the chlorine and sulfur dioxide processes are visually inspected daily.  The potential\nfor a chlorine or sulfur dioxide release is greatly reduced in the chlorination and dechlorination\nprocesses due to the use of a vacuum system from the point of withdrawal to their points of\napplication.  In the event that there is a failure in chlorination or dechlorination equipment, the\nsystem will automatically shutoff (i.e. failsafe).  \n\nAll existing and proposed future chlorination and dechlorination equipment have been designed\naccording to applicable standards and codes.  The Facility maintains records and documentation on\nequipment inspection and tests.  Precautions are taken to ensure that new equipment and processes\nare inspected and tested, that all changes on the process are authorized, and employees are informed\nof changes.\n\nThe Facility performed a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) to address the hazards in the chlorination\nand dechlorination processes and to evaluate and control where the potential for chlorine and sulfur\ndioxide releases exist.  Employees were involved in determining hazards of the processes and\nsubsequent consequences.  The chlorination and dechlorination processes"

      "SummaryText": "f chlorine or sulfur dioxide.  The alternative\nrelease scenario selected for the Facility was a failure scenario developed during the process hazard\nreview and analysis.  The alternative release scenarios for chlorine and sulfur dioxide were similar. \nFor each scenario, a 0.25-inch diameter whip connecting a one-ton cylinder to the process system\nmanifold is sheared off, creating a leak in the system.  The Facility has the capability of responding\nto and stopping the leak within one hour of detection.   For this scenario, the off-site consequence\nanalysis indicated that off-site receptors could be potentially impacted by the release of chlorine or\nsulfur dioxide. Although off-site areas would be impacted for the worst-case and alternative release\nscenarios, we believe that safety procedures and mitigation measures will reduce the potential for\noff-site consequences and subsequent risks to the surrounding community.  Our safety devices\ninclude chlorine leak detectors, sulfur dioxide leak detectors, alarms, and an automatic system shut-\noff feature triggered by a loss in system vacuum.  In addition, the chlorine and sulfur dioxide\ncylinders are housed in a building with exhaust fans and vents which would dilute the chlorine and\nsulfur dioxide gas concentration should a release occur.\n\nIn order to fulfill the requirements of the Risk Management Program (RMP), we have developed an\naccidental release prevention program and emergency action plan for our facility. The accidental\nrelease prevention program satisfies the requirements for the EPA RMP and the Occupational Safety\nand Health Administration's (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) program.  The prevention\nprogram ensures that our facility is operated under safe conditions and that any risk of an accidental\nrelease of chlorine or sulfur dioxide is minimized.  The program has been written to reduce the\npotential of an accidental release due to human error, or equipment failure at our facility.  In order\nto prevent"
