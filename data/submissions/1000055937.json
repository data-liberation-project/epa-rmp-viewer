PERS also includes a system to notify any of several listed local employees in event of a release.\r\n\r\nFive - Year Accident History:\r\n\r\nThere has not been a release of Anhydrous Ammonia within the past five years that has caused any death, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor to our knowledge have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program:\r\n\r\nThis facility is included in the written Community Emergency Response Plan as prepared by  the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  We also include these materials in our own Emergency Action Plan in accordance with OSHA Standard 29CFR 1910.38.   We have provided State and Local authorities all Community Right-to-Know information requested as well as that required under SARA Title III  (EPCRA).  Our written employee safety programs include pre-emergency planning and employee training in accordance with OSHA standards, and are offered for review at any time by our Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) to ensure they conform to the community plan(s).  We actively encourage participation in our Anhydrous Ammonia training programs by the local fire department(s), local emergency response team, community planners, etc. that may be expected to respond to an incident at our site.  \r\n\r\nPlanned changes to improve safety:\r\n\r\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at all of our facilities.

The maximum quantity released based on 85 % tank capacity as limited by design standards, the distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm)  miles based on EPA's RMP -Comp Program (Version 1.06), as well as possible public and environmental receptors within the area have been provided to the County LEPC (Local Emergency Planning Committee) to assist them in their planning.   \r\n\r\nAlternative release scenario:\r\n\r\nThere has not been an actual release of Anhydrous Ammonia during the last 5-years at the site.  We believe the most likely release would be caused by a break in a transfer hose.  Transfer hoses are protected by manual,  self closing excess flow , and pull away valves so our alternative release scenario is based on the loss of contents from the largest hose used (off loading transportation equipment).  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is determined per instructions by EPA guidance.\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Program:\r\n\r\nOur Anhydrous Ammonia accidental release program is based on guidelines found in the American National Standards Institute, Inc. (ANSI) standard K-61.1 Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia; and the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) standard 29CFR 1910.111 Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia.   We conduct annual employee training on the safe handling, transportation and distribution of Anhydrous Ammonia, and have installed safety equipment including, but not limited to: Excess flow valves,  Breakaway couplers at risers,  Emergency shut-off valves,  Barriers to avoid damage by trucks or other vehicles, and Lock outs to prevent tampering when the site is unattended.   We also maintain routine contact with our local fire department and emergency response personnel; and have provided and/or participated in safety training exercises on Anhydrous Ammonia.

During the balance of the year little if any product transfer occurs .  The maximum quantity handled at a given time would be the off loading of a semi-trailer vehicle tank. \r\n\r\nThe Anhydrous Ammonia storage facility is operated on an as needed basis with staff present only during the receiving and reloading of product for delivery.  Total annual hours at the work site do not meet the 2,080 hour requirement to qualify as a full time employee on site therefore we are required to report zero in item number 1.11    Our facilities have adequate lighting, and are inspected  at various times of day and night throughout the year.
