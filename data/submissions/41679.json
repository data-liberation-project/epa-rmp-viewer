      "SummaryText": "Wright Corporation (Wright) is a chemical manufacturing facility located in a rural area of Acme, North Carolina, in Columbus County.  Wright manufactures several types of products including formaldehyde, formaldehyde-based products, silanes, siloxanes, and specialty chemicals. This report documents the Risk Management Program (RMP) required at the Wright facility in Acme, North Carolina.\n\nWright began operation in 1959 and has produced a variety of products throughout its history.  As a member of the Synthetic Organic Chemical Manufacturers Association\u00bfs Responsible Care program, Wright is committed to safeguarding the community, workplace and environment.  The management team, including Wright\u00bfs chairman of the board, is an advocate of this program and supports it fully.\n\nWright is also ISO 9002 certified.  This certification assures that Wright follows regimented procedures for purposes of quality control.  In doing so, this encompasses safety and environmental goals for efficient and continuous operations.  The ISO program also serves as a basis for well organized procedures and programs, which is an important aspect of the RMP.\n\nThe RMP regulation is closely associated with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation.  Wright complies with PSM and has completed PSM requirements for ammonia and formaldehyde.  Compliance with the PSM provisions establishes a program for Wright to apply to RMP.  Specifically, the components of the Level 3 RMP prevention program elements are identical to the components required by PSM.\n\nWright is committed to making significant efforts to prevent situations which would pose threats to employees, the surrounding public, and the environment.  Wright's commitment and proactive efforts have been realized as Wright has not had any reportable releases of ammonia or formaldehyde during the past 5 years.\n\nThe processes are designed and operated with numerous automatic and manual fail"

      "SummaryText": "safe measures.  All operators undergo frequent training on proper operation of the equipment in addition to receiving routine safety training.  However, in the event of an unforeseen release, Wright has a written emergency response plan that provides for immediate response by trained, onsite personnel.  All response efforts for major incidents are coordinated with the Columbus County Local Emergency Planning Committee and the Acme-Delco Fire and Rescue teams.  This ensures that Wright is prepared to quickly mitigate and control any accidental release, even the remotely possible catastrophic event.  All of Wright\u00bfs programs aimed at safety and response are routinely reviewed and updated.  The employees are involved in this process with the management team.\n\nThe substances at Wright that are present in sufficient quantity to require RMPs are ammonia (both anhydrous and aqueous) and formaldehyde.  Ammonia and formaldehyde are both listed as regulated toxic substances.  Anhydrous and aqueous ammonia are stored in 30,000 gallon cylindrical tanks.  There are two tanks containing anhydrous ammonia and one tank containing aqueous ammonia at a concentration above 20 percent.  A fourth ammonia tank is also present at the facility, which contains aqueous ammonia at a concentration less than 20 percent, and is therefore not subject to the RMP regulation.  Formaldehyde is stored in several tanks at the Wright facility.  The two main 100,000 gallon tanks that contain 37 to 50 percent formaldehyde/water solution were the focus of this RMP program.\n\nAs required by the RMP regulation, the worst case and alternative case scenarios were analyzed for these two regulated substances.  For all worst case scenarios, it was assumed that the entire contents of a tank would be released in ten minutes.  In each case, administrative controls of not filling a tank to maximum capacity were considered (e.g., the formaldehyde tanks are not filled above 90 percent of the maximum).  Passive mitigatio"

      "SummaryText": "n measures were considered for ammonia and formaldehyde as both substances are stored within concrete diked areas that would limit the exposed area of a pool and thereby reduce the release rate to the environment.  However, this mitigation measure had little or no affect on the results for ammonia as it was assumed to be released as a vapor.  None of the worst case scenarios are expected to occur because of Wright\u00bfs operational, safety and response programs.  \n\nAlternative release scenarios were based on line ruptures, which are more likely possible events.  In addition to the administrative control and passive mitigation measures mentioned previously, other active mitigation systems were also considered for the alternative case scenarios.  Specifically, emergency or excess flow valves were considered in determination of the maximum amount that could be potentially released.  In addition, Wright has the capability of neutralizing a formaldehyde release by either spraying the pooled spill with water or aqueous ammonia.  Either would reduce the amount released to the atmosphere by approximately 75 percent.\n\nAll modeling was completed using EPA\u00bfs RMP*Comp model, with the exception of the modeling for ammonia.  The modeling for ammonia was completed using the Process Hazard Analysis Software Tools (PHAST) model, which is a more sophisticated model than the conservative algorithms utilized in the RMP*Comp model.  This model was chosen to more accurately represent the characteristics of anhydrous ammonia.  A conservative approach was still followed to examine the consequences of the worst alternative release case.\n\nIn summary, Wright is committed to safeguarding the community, workplace, and environment.  The conservative, proactive, safety-conscious approach that Wright used to prepare and implement the Risk Management Program is the same approach that is utilized in operating the facility.  As a result, the risk of potential releases that could impact company employees"
