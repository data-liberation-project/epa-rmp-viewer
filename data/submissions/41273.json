Referenced documents, such as the Comprehensive Emergency Management Plan, Process Safety Management Plan, and SPCC plans are maintained at the facility and are available for inspection.\n\nPrevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nIt is the policy of PCS Joint Venture, Ltd (PCS JV) to prevent accidental releases through the use of preventive maintenance programs, testing, calibrations, routine maintenance, inspections, replacement of equipment as necessary, and training of personnel. A work order system is in place for employees to formally report deficiencies and track progress until completed.\n\nThe PCS JV policy is to provide a safe work environment for all employees, contractors, visitors and neighbors. This extends to the design, training, and implementation of a program that will result in saving lives and reducing property damage during an emergency.\n\nIt is PCS JV policy to operate in an environmentally responsible manner consistent with environmental knowledge, policies, and regulations. Operations of the facility are designed so as not to adversely affect the environment of the surrounding area during normal operating periods or emergency situations.\n\nPCS JV attempts to prevent emergencies from ever occurring. However, should an event occur, the immediate goal is to keep the emergency and its effects within facility boundaries and not allow it to present a threat to the health and safety of the general public.\n\nPreserving life is the prime consideration. All procedures will be carried out in a manner to minimize risk to employees and emergency response personnel. Rescue and medical activities have priority over all other actions.\n\nIt is the emergency response policy of PCS JV to immediately notify the City of Moultrie Fire and Police Departments of a release of anhydrous ammonia that exceeds the reportable quantity.

PCS JV manufactures normal superphosphate and complete grades of NPK fertilizers. Ammonia is used in the process as a form of nitrogen for the NPK fertilizers.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is delivered to the PCS JV facility by railcar. It is stored in a tank. The tank is capable of storing 100 tons of anhydrous ammonia. The anhydrous ammonia is transferred from railcars to the storage area using specially designed hoses, piping, and pumps. Safety features of this system include a fail-close valve system in case power is lost and excess flow valves in case of line failure.\n\nWorst Case and Alternate Case Scenarios\n\nBoth scenarios were developed using the DEGADIS model. The DEGADIS model is listed in 40 CFR Part 51, Appendix W as an EPA Guideline Model. It will calculate a release rate given storage conditions and specific leak parameters. It incorporates detailed thermodynamic factors for the release. Many experts consider this to be the most accurate or realistic model used for similar RMP applications.\n\nThe worst case scenario is assumed to be the release of 100 tons of anhydrous ammonia over a ten-minute period from the storage tank. This release is expected to impact offsite areas.\n\nThe alternate case scenario is assumed to be a release of 20 pounds of anhydrous ammonia over a period of one minute. This release is expected to impact offsite areas.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe PCS JV facility is in full compliance with the OSHA Process Safety Management rule. Additionally, the use of Safety and Operating Procedures provide a system to prevent accidental releases by focusing on specific components of each shipment. The safety and operating procedures manuals contain detailed job descriptions related to each task. The manuals are reviewed annually and revised as necessary to address any changes. Each shipment receives a detailed pre-unloading inspection,"

Employees and contractors are trained regularly to insure proficiency in all phases of the operation.\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nThere have been no reportable releases that have affected offsite receptors during the last five years.\n\nThe Emergency Response Program\n\nThe PCS JV facility has developed an Emergency Management Plan designed to address prevention, preparation, response and recovery from a wide variety of potential emergencies. This includes an accidental release of a regulated substance at the facility. The facility, its employees and business operations are susceptible to emergencies such as natural disasters, severe weather, and man-made hazards. The Emergency Management Plan, in conjunction with the Risk Management Program and OSHA's Process Safety Management Program aid in managing potential emergency situations. The Process Safety Management program is integral to the RMP. It consists of procedures for Process Hazard Analysis, Operating Procedures, Mechanical Integrity, Employee Involvement, and Management of Change.\n\nEmergency response is coordinated with the local fire and police departments. Emergency response personnel are trained annually.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nPCS JV's ongoing training program helps insure that all personnel are prepared in the event of an emergency. Through the Process Hazards Analysis and Process Safety Management programs, we are always reviewing changes to make our operation as safe as possible.\n\nG:\\SPCC\\RMPMoul/cbp/599"
