The plant treat wastewater from over 70,000 people in Anne Arundel County. The facility  is designed to remove pollutants from wastewater before discharging the reclaimed water inot the Chespeake Bay. As part of this treatment system, chlorine and sulfur dioxide are used for disinfection and declorination respectively. Chlorine and sulfur dioxide are stored at the facility in one-ton cylinders. Disinfection and dechlorination are common processes used by many wastewater treatment plants in the United States.\nAWARF personnel have designed and implemented a Process Safety Management (PSM) program to ensure safe operation of the disinfection and dechlorination processes. As part of the PSM program,a process hazard analysis has been conducted to evaluate the safety of each of these processes. The minimum amount of chemicals required to meet the facility's discharge permit parameters is stored in an enclosed brick building. Standard operating procedures have been written for the safe handling of chlorine and sulfur dioxide. Annual training is provided to facility personnel in safe handling and use of the two chemicals, and a strict preventative maintenance program has been implemented for each process. Monitors are installed in the enclosed chemical building to detect any leaks. If a leaks is detected, building ventilation systems shut off automatically preventing any chemical from escaping from thestorage building. In the event of a leak, Anne Arundel County Fire Department Hazardous Materials (HAZMAT) unit is contacted and ,if necessary, they will slowly and safely mitigate the situation under controlled conditions. No releases of chlorine or sulfur dioxide have occurred at the facility resulting in any off-site impacts.\nCoordination between the HAZMAT unit and the facility personnel enhances and ensu"
