The information available for each hazardous substance typically includes toxicity information and permissible exposure limits, physical data, reactivity and corrosivity data, thermal and chemical stability data, and hazards of mixing substances in the process.  MSDSs for hazardous substances handled in each process are available in the Plant's MSDS book so the personnel have ready reference to this information.  In addition, MSDSs are provided to the LEPC and the fire department for use in helping formulate emergency response plans.\n\nThe engineering design documents include the operating parameters and the design basis and configuration of the equipment in each covered process.  The available information includes operating parameters, block flow or simplified process flow diagrams, process chemistry, maximum intended inventories, safe upper and lower limits for parameters such as temperature, pressure or flow, consequences of deviations from established operating limits, design basis and configuration of equipment, piping and instrument diagrams including materials of construction, electrical classification, safety systems, applicable design codes and standards, and design basis for relief and ventilation systems.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nThe Mocane Gas Processing Plant has a comprehensive pr"

Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nThe Mocane Gas Processing Plant uses a combination of What If analysis and checklists to perform these evaluations.  What If analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience, as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process, as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures and the team makes recommendations for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\nThe Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) team findings are forwarded to local and corporate management for resolution.  Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate from the original design safety features, the plant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every five years by the PHA team.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nThe Mocane Gas Processing Plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as unit start-up, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, normal shutdown, and initial start-up of a new process.  These procedures can be used as a refe"
