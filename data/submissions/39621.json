The Emergency Action Plan (Plan) is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of the PSM/RMP document which is maintained at the facility.  This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n  1.)  To save lives.\n  2.)  To minimize and avoid injuries.\n  3.)  To protect the environment.\n  4.)  To minimize property damage.\n\nS&S Foods maintains a safety committee whose members include the designated emergency coordinators for the facility.  The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year.  This Plan was reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations.\n\nS&S Foods will coordinated emergency response efforts with the local fire department and with the contracted refrigeration operation and maintenance firm.  In the case of an ammonia-related emergency, it is the policy of S&S Foods to evacuate and to allow the fire department/HazMat Team to respond to the emergency.  The S&S Foods Chief Engineer / Engineer will be available for guidance and assistance.\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nThe S & S Foods facility began operation of the facility in 1998.  The building was constructed in 1984 with several additions/modifications taking place since then. The ammonia refrigeration system was designed and constructed in accordance with all applicable federal, state, and local regulations including the Uniform Mechanical Code (1994 updated to 1997), Uniform Building Code, and the Uniform Fire Code.  The refrigeration system at the facility was installed with and has operated using R-22, a freon-based refrigerant.  It was designed with the intent"

The initial ammonia charge is to be received by the system at the time that the Phase 3 expansion is finalized which includes the addition of a process spiral freezer (IQF), several evaporators for new cold rooms, one compressor, and two vessels.\n\nThe refrigeration system was shut down, purged of R-22, and restarted using ammonia in November 2000.  The facility processes meat products that are distributed to fast food establishments.  The facility is located at 1120 W. Foothill Blvd. in Azusa, California, just north of the Interstate 210 freeway, between Irwindale Avenue and Vernon Avenue.  The immediate area is primarily commercial with some light industrial and residential areas.  The ammonia system was upgraded to meet the requirements of the current applicable federal, state, and local regulations including the Uniform Fire and Mechanical Codes.\n\nThe refrigeration system uses approximately 14,000 pounds of ammonia to maintain low temperatures for cold storage and for blast freezing product.  The cold storage areas include: Finished Goods, Raw Goods, Blend/Grind, Dock, Freezer, IQF (Individual Quick Freeze), Fajita Process.  There are also multiple spiral production freezers.\n\nThe refrigeration cycle begins with the transfer of high pressure liquid ammonia from the Thermosyphon Receiver (TSV-1) to the High Pressure Receiver (HPR-1), which is the main liquid storage vessel in the system.  The HPR transfers high pressure liquid through the Intercooler (IC-1) in order to subcool it prior to routing to each of three Low Pressure Receivers (LPR-1, LPR-2, LPR-3).  Each Low Pressure Receiver operates an independent system with a specific process or storage freezer(s).  The HPR also supplies high pressure liquid to the Controlled Pressure Receiver (CPR-1), which maintains a constant pressure through the use of pressure regulating valves.  CPR-1 is the main liquid supply"

As the liquid ammonia enters the various evaporator/freezer coils, it expands, reducing the temperature.\n\nAs heat from the room (or product in the Spiral Freezers) is transferred to the low temperature liquid ammonia in the coils, the ammonia is (partially) vaporized.  The suction from the evaporators is pulled to the Suction Accumulator vessel (AC-1).  The suction from each of the spiral freezers is returned to the corresponding Low Pressure Receiver.  Four compressors (HC-1, HC-2, LC-1, and BC-1) pull the gaseous ammonia from the suction vessels and work in combination to compress the low pressure ammonia to high pressure gas (hot gas).  The hot gas is discharged through a common header to the Condensers (EC-1, EC-2), where fans and sprayed water are used to condense the ammonia in the coils back into a liquid.  As the ammonia changes phase into liquid, the heat from the system is discharged to the atmosphere.  The liquid is then drained into TSV-1.\n\nHot gas (high stage compressor discharge) is also used for defrost in the evaporators and for pressurizing liquid transfer tanks associated with the recirculator vessels.  The system also has an emergency dump tank (into which a common relief header vents), which is kept full of water. \n\nThe S&S Foods ammonia refrigeration system has many safety features.  Much of the safety of the system is inherent in the policies and procedures that govern the operation of the system.  For example, the S&S Foods facility operates in accordance with OSHA's Process Safety Management regulation.\n\nThe S&S Foods facility including the ammonia system was designed and constructed in accordance with the Uniform Mechanical Code which specifically outlines requirements for the safe operation of the ammonia refrigeration system.  These safety features include a water diffusion tank, ammonia sensors in the machine room as well as sensors in the cold storage areas, and automatic shut down systems that prevent equip"

The ammonia sensor in the machine room is interlocked to: 1) provide alarms for facility operators (via a telemetry system), 2) shut down the system, and 3) activate emergency ventilation that scrubs ammonia through a water reservoir.  There is also an emergency button located outside the machine room that when manually activated, will shut down the machine room equipment.\n\nIn addition, the majority of the ammonia inventory is centrally located (inside the machine room and just outside of the machine room).  All pressure vessels are equipped with pressure relief valves that automatically engage in case of a high pressure situation and vent through a common header to a water diffusion tank.\n\nAmmonia refrigeration systems do not experience any chemical reactions or internal corrosion.  The only composition change that occurs within the systems are phase changes, as ammonia is cycled through various stages of liquid and vapor, similar to a household refrigerator.  The refrigeration system is a closed-loop system without any regular emissions or releases.  Any leaks are noted and repaired immediately.\n\nIn addition to the Uniform Mechanical Code, the facility will operate in accordance with the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) guidelines.  In particular, the IIAR Bulletin 110, \"Startup, Inspection, and Maintenance of Ammonia Refrigeration Systems.\"\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nNRC - 652436\n\nThis ammonia refrigeration system began operation in late November 2000. The initial charge was approximately 17,000 pounds. About 3,000 pounds was added to system in January 2001. Race engineering added approximately 4,900 pounds  (1000 gallons) to system on 4/9/2003, which was the first ammonia addition since ammonia startup in 2000/2001.  Race engineering added an additional 4,900 pounds of ammonia on 5/13/2003, and conducted an examination of all piping and valves in the system with sulfur sticks to identfy any leaks. No l"

Facility shut down was scheduled for 5/25/2003 to isolate water supply to condenser and inspect. A small leak in the east condenser tube bundle was discovered and repaired.\n\nThe east condenser bundle had lost the zinc coating associated with the galvanizing of the tube bundle. Operations involved a single chemical feed pump with chemical distribution provided by the circulation of the water.\n\nThe addition of ammonia on 4/9/2003 offsets losses from startup in 2000/2001. The estimated time period of the continuous leak is more than the period from 4/9/2003 to 5/25/2003, or greater than 46 days. Total ammonia added during this incident is about 14,700 pounds. The rate of ammonia discharged through the hole in condenser tube bundle increased with time duration in the incident, as the hole became larger due to the flow of ammonia as time elapsed. Assuming that two of the 1,000 gallons  ammonia additions to the system were a result of this incident and that the third 1,000 gallons ammonia addition was result of normal operation, then the incident release amount is 9,800 pounds. Assuming the incident total time period is twice the investigative period of 4/9/2003 to 5/25/2003, then the total incident time period calculated is 92 days. Therefore the average release per day is 107 pounds/day.\n\nThe release was to water and was discharged with plant wastewater to the Sanitation District of Los Angeles County. Based on average plant water use, and ammonia losses at 107 pounds/day, equaled 1,245 gallons water/pound of ammonia.\n\nAt a later date the entire tube bundle was replaced. Tubes are now allowed to accumulate a slight coating of mineral deposit to arrest corrosion, Individual chemical feed pumps now service the west and east sections of the condenser.
