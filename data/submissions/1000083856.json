The covered process underwent an initial process hazard analysis (PHA) and will continue to undergo periodic review/re-validations at least every five years or as required by Management Of Change (MOC). The PHA team consists of members with the appropriate experience to define the hazards and mitigating controls of the process and also represents a cross-section of the employees working in the process. For future PHA reviews, local and corporate management will review the PHA team findings and develop a resolution action plan for each item, which will be documented, tracked and ultimately closed in the Airgas action item database tracking system. The facility manager is responsible for prioritizing and tracking implementation of the action plan to closure.\r\n\r\nOperating Procedures (OP):\r\n\r\nAirgas maintains controlled written procedures that address various modes of liquefied and gaseous ammonia process operations, such as: (1) unit initial startup; (2) unit normal operations; (3) unit temporary operations; (4) unit emergency shutdown; (5) unit emergency operations; (6) unit normal shutdown and; (7) unit startup after turnaround or emergency shutdown. Additionally, the emergency shutdown procedure includes conditions that will prompt a shutdown and identifies qualified and responsible operators to complete the steps in a safe and timely manner. Airgas operating procedures have safe operating limits identified along with consequences of unsafe deviation. Procedures further provide steps for operators to take that will correct or avoid an unsafe deviation. Airgas procedures are used by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators. These procedures are reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate by the facility manager."

The plan outlines action to be taken at the plant by personnel and visitor/contractors if an uncontrolled ammonia leak occurs, large or small. Plant employee/operators will not respond directly to an ammonia leak and attempt to mitigate a catastrophic release. Instead they will support and communicate with emergency responders, local response agencies, and provide outside agency notification in the event of an uncontrolled ammonia release. The emergency action plan provides for the evacuation of Blissfield facility personnel and visitors. The Airgas Blissfield facility has provided their emergency action plan to and coordinates the plan annually with a local Blissfield Fire Station and Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC). Should an emergency involving the release of ammonia occur that will have off-site consequences, Airgas will contact the Fire Department and local support authorities, who will coordinate appropriate action for the affected community.\r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:\r\n\r\nSafety is an inherent part of the culture at Airgas and enhancements in safety and operations are actively discussed and supported. The Blissfield CO2 production facility continues to review its processes for possibilities of improvement to the covered ammonia process, operational methods, and new technology to lower risk.
