If an accidental release should occur, the McGregor Company and the Pendleton retail facility are prepared to work with the local fire department, or any other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.  A detailed emergency response plan has been developed and will be implemented in the event of an accidental release.\n\n2.\tFacility Information\n\no\tThe primary activity at the facility is the storage, and handling of anhydrous ammonia.\n\no\tAnhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed as an agricultural grade fertilizer to local farmers.\n\no\tAnhydrous ammonia is received by truck and stored in one above ground tank(s).  The maximum amount of anhydrous ammonia handled is 80,000 lbs.\n\n3.\tThe Worst-Case Release Scenario and Alternative Release Scenario\n\na.\tAnhydrous Ammonia Worst-Case and Alternative Release Scenarios   \nThe worst-case release scenario involves the failure of the largest storage tank when filled to 85% capacity as limited by regulations. The scenario at this facility would release 80,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia. The distance to the endpoint (the point of dispersion to 200ppm) is 0.94 miles. This figure comes from TFI's DEGADIS model.\n\nThe alternative release scenario, is based on the most likely potential incident that might occur at this facility. We used the scenario that a 2\" transfer hose would break and release 11,908 pounds of anhydrous ammonia for two minutes.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 0.56 miles. This figure comes from TFI's DEGADIS model"

Five-year Accident History\n\ta.\tThere have been no accidental releases or near misses of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that:\n\no\tHave caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor\n\no\tHave resulted in off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n6.

Planned Changes to Improve Safety and Facility Accidental Release Policy.\n\tThe McGregor Company and its 33 retail fertilizer facilities located in Washington, Idaho and Oregon have an outstanding record on safety and environmental issues. We have an excellent safety and maintenance program and have won several regional, state and national environmental respect awards. Safety and environmental improvements are an ongoing process for the McGregor Company and all of its retail fertilizer facilities."
