The project site is located just west of the City of Blythe and directly adjacent to and east of the Blythe Airport (Figure 1). \n\nThe Blythe Energy Project generates electricity from two high-efficiency, natural gas-fired turbines and one heat recovery steam generator.  The facility SIC code is 4911, and the NAICS code is 221119.  FPL Energy Operating Services is committed to safe, environmentally sensitive operation of the Blythe facility.  The Blythe Energy Project is operated in compliance with all federal, state, and local environmental and safety regulations.  Emergency response coordination procedures are in place with local emergency response agencies.  \n\nAqueous ammonia is the substance of interest for this document.  The covered process includes both the storage and use of aqueous ammonia.  Aqueous ammonia is used to reduce NOx (oxides of nitrogen) in the exhaust gas emissions through a Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) module or DeNOx system. The Blythe Energy Project is physically located in a sparsely populated, largely agricultural area west of the City of Blythe. The nearest areas normally used by the public include the airport to the west and a municipal golf course to the northeast. \n\nA key part of the RMP program is the process hazard analysis (PHA).  A PHA was performed for an aqueous ammonia storage and use process at another facility owned and operated by the parent company of Blythe Energy, LLC (FPL Energy).  That PHA, which is adopted for use at the Blythe facility, was performed using the Hazards and Operability Study (HazOp) procedure per OSHA guidelines and the guidelines published by the American Institute of Chemical Engineers.  The HazOp for aqueous ammonia concluded that potential deviations were of the \u00bfacceptable with appropriate controls\u00bf category or \u00bfacceptable as is\u00bf and id"

A supplemental \u00bfWhat If\u00bf analysis was also performed. \n\nAn off-site consequence analysis was completed for the Blythe Energy Project during the Application for Certification (AFC) process during plant permitting with the California Energy Commission (CEC), and is used to address requirements found in the RMP regulation.  The off-site consequence analysis for the RMP addresses a worst-case release event that postulates the extremely improbable release of the entire contents of the largest storage tank on site.  We do not believe that such an event could reasonably be expected to occur; however, EPA requires us to evaluate this specific worst-case event.  The level of significance for the worst case event has been established by the EPA to be \u00bf the 1 psi overpressure endpoint\u00bf \u00bf in other words, the area within which the pressure is one pound per square inch greater that normal atmospheric pressure (about 14.7 psi). \n\nThe distance to the endpoint of concern for the worst-case event is estimated to be 0.3 miles.  In other words, the area potentially significantly affected by such a worst-case release is limited to a radius less than 1/3 mile from the tank.  Within this radius, there are no public receptors of any kind.  Therefore, the worst-case release event, while extremely improbably, would none-the-less have no impact on the public.  \n\nBlythe Energy Project has complied with the RMP requirements and is committed to review and enhance the program periodically as appropriate and in compliance with the program requirements. The RMP program documents are complete and accessible to all interested persons at all times.  We believe our program is proactive and not only meets regulatory requirements but also confirms our commitment to workplace safety as our number one priority. \n\nAs a part of the preparation of the RMP program, Blythe Energy, LLC reviewed a hazards and operab"

The Blythe Energy Project\u00bfs SCR DeNOx (aqueous ammonia) system is very similar to the model that was reviewed. \n\nThe objective of the HAZOP study is to identify potential hazards and their causes, consequences and appropriate mitigation responses or actions to counter the identified hazards. The HAZOP procedures performed at the other facility were adopted for use at the Blythe Energy Project.  On September 23, 2002, The Blythe Energy Production Team convened to perform a HAZOP study for the Blythe Power Project. This HAZOP study will be reviewed during the annual compliance audit. \n\nThe worst-case release scenario(s) and the alternative release scenario(s)\n\nThe HazOp study reported in section 2.1 of this document shows that the only potentially significant AHM release would be from the ammonia storage and distribution system. The Most Likely Release was identified as a rupture of the distribution piping immediately downstream of the ammonia vaporizer (SCR skid). The release rate would be limited to the capacity of the vaporizer, 1,000 lb/hr. The rupture would cause audible alarms to sound in the facility's control room for ammonia flow and distribution pressure, and NOx emissions.  As a result, it is highly probable that the operators will shut down the ammonia release within 20 minutes.\n\nThere are no sensitive receptors within the immediate area surrounding the Blythe Energy Project. In particular, the nearest school is 4.5 miles east of the Blythe Energy facility.\n\nDispersion modeling was performed using the Area Location of Hazardous Atmospheres model (ALOHA, version 5.2); a program, developed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).

It determines whether a gas cloud with a density substantially greater than air will be formed, and uses either a Gaussian or dense gas algorithm, as appropriate, to determine AHM concentrations in the vicinity of the release point.  Unfortunately, the ALOHA program cannot directly model solutions which contain mixture such as aqueous ammonia (ammonia and water) because the ALOHA program assumes that the entire content of an aqueous ammonia release is anhydrous ammonia and the release behaves with the same physical properties as anhydrous ammonia.  Therefore, using conventional ALOHA program inputs would significantly over predict the threat zone of an aqueous ammonia spill.\n\nNOAA Report No. HAZMAT 93-3, entitled \u00bfModeling Hydrochloric Acid Evaporation in ALOHA\u00bf, published by the Modeling and Simulation Studies Branch, Hazardous Material Response and Assessment Division, Office of Ocean Research Conservation and Assessment, developed a method for modeling mixed solutions such as aqueous ammonia.  The modeling method used in this report is based on determining evaporation rates of low flashpoint materials in solution from a liquid pool.  The evaporation formula in the report is based on pool area, low flashpoint material mass transfer rates, and molecular weight of the material flashing, vapor pressure of the material, gas constant, and ambient temperature.  Once the evaporation rate is established, conventional inputs to the ALOHA program can be used to determine the maximum threat zones.\n\nThe evaporation rate of aqueous ammonia from a tank release in the secondary containment area proposed for the Blythe Energy Project was calculated to be 0.127 kg/s (kilogram per second), at an ambient temperature of 100\u00b0F and wind speed of 1 m/s (meter per second).

At concentrations of 75, 200, 300, 500, 1,000, and 2,000 ppm levels of the airborne ammonia, the ALOHA model predicted maximum threat zones of 0.86, 0.48, 0.39, 0.29, 0.20, and 0.14 miles, respectively.  These results are provided in Attachment C, along with manual calculations for the evaporation rate determination.\n\nThe scenario was also run for stability class D at a wind speed of 5.0 m/s and ambient temperature of 100\u00b0F.  This weather condition represents the likely actual meteorological condition at the Blythe Energy power plant site.  The hand calculated evaporation rate for this condition was determined to be 0.445 kg/s.  The ALOHA program predicted maximum threat zones of 0.24 miles for 75 ppm, 0.14 for 200 ppm, 0.11 miles for 300 ppm, 0.09 miles for 500 ppm, 0.06 miles for 1,000 ppm, and 0.04 for 2,000 ppm concentrations of ammonia.  \n\nWhen comparing stability class F to stability class D modeling results, a significant reduction occurs in the maximum threat zone.  Therefore, the stability class F can be considered the absolute worst-case modeling scenario for a release from the aqueous ammonia storage tanks at the Blythe Energy power plant.\n\nThe nearest residential dwelling from the release point is approximately 0.75 miles.  The nearest likely area with contact to a spill from this area is Hobsonway, 0.43 miles from the aqueous ammonia storage area.  This road, however, is not frequently traveled.  At F stability, only concentrations of 75-ppm ammonia could reach the residential dwelling, and only concentrations of 200 ppm or lower of ammonia could reach Hobsonway.  None of the D stability class results reached the nearest residential dwelling or Hobsonway.  Therefore, potential nearby exposure areas are well below the 300 ppm IDLH (immediate dangerous to life and health) concentration.\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps\n\nAlthough the Blythe Energy Project is not subject to PSM regulations, t"
