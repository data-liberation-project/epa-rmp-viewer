      "SummaryText": "King America Finishing, Inc., Screven County, Dover, GA facility is primarily involved in the bleaching, dyeing, finishing and printing of cotton and manmade fabrics.  Based on the specific product required portions of each sub category the process can/will be used in numerous combinations to meet a customer specification.  The purpose of preparation is to increase dimensional stability, to remove chemicals used in the weaving or fiber preparation, to improve dye affinty/uptake, and to improve strength of the fabric.  The dyeing department is a continuous process and typically consists of dye application, dye fixation with chemicals or heat, washing, and drying.  Finishing  and printing encompasses any of several mechanical and chemical processes perfromed on fiber, yarn, or fabric to improve it appearance, texture, or performance.\n\nA new flame retardant finishing line has been added.  The line utilizes anhydrous ammonia as part of the fabric treatment process.  The anhydrous ammonia is stored in a presurized vessel located to the west side of the facility.  The vessel is a 12, 500 gallon in capacity storing the anyhdrous ammonia is in a liquid state at a pressure of 250 psi.  The ammonia is vaporized by a heating element and transferred to the process.  With the addition of the anyhdrous ammonia the facility is now subject to 29 CFR 1910.119, the Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard, which is designed to prevent the release of highly hazardous chemicals that could lead to a catastrophe in the workplace or the surrounding community.  The facility is also subject to the EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP) which helps reduce chemical risk at a local level.  \n\nTo minimize exposure in the unlikely event of an accidental release, King America Finishing, Inc. has developed a Process Safety Management document and conducted a Process Hazard Analysis.  The Process Safety Management Program and Process Hazard Analysis will incorporate both employee involvement and proces"

The training will include specific safety and health hazards, as well as safe work practices while conducting start-up, normal operation and shut-down of the flame retardant line (FR Range).  Emergency shut-down procedures will also be covered during the training.  \n\nThe ammonia storage tank is rated for 250 psi pressure, and is equipped with pressure relief valves located at the top of the tank and in the vapor production system.  A safety cut-off valve is placed inline in the gaseous ammonia supply line and can be operated via a switch located on the FR Range itself.  Ventilation is provided over the chemical application pad, the drying cans, and through the bottom chamber of the ammonia chamber.  All ventilated air is passed through a scrubber before being discharged to the outside.  \n\nSpecific operating procedures for the FR Range have been developed.  The procedures include start-up, shut-down and emergency shut-down procedures.  As previously mentioned, each employee/operator of the FR Range will be properly trained.  Maintenance of the anhydrous ammonia system has been addressed and is covered in specific maintenance procedures.  The procedures specify the proper purging of the ammonia from the feed lines back to the tank when maintenance is to be conducted on the system.  A monthly inspection checklist has also been developed and will be implemented when the line is up and running.  \n\nKing America Finishing, Inc. has not had any accidents within the past 5 years.The local emergency responders and fire department will be notified of the quantity and location of the anhydrous ammonia onsite via the annual EPCRA reporting.  The local servicing fire department will also be onsite for proper introduction and training of the new FR Range anydrous ammonia supply system prior to line start-up."
