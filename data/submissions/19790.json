The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas.\n\nTo ensure proper functioning, our emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced.  In addition, the plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within our processes that would require a modified emergency response.\n\nAssumption Parish OEP is the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) with which our emergency plan has been coordinated and verified.\n\n7.

This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release should occur, we are coordinated with the Assumption Parish Office of Emergency Preparedness, which provides additional emergency response expertise. \n\n2.\tThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe Grand Bayou Operations primary activity includes the solution mining of salt from the Napoleonville Dome, which is located in Assumption Parish, encompassing a surface area of approximately 1670 acres.  Dow's operations on the Napoleonville Salt Dome began in 1957 with the drilling and mining of the Grace No. 1 well.  Since then, an additional 29 Dow operated caverns have been mined into the dome.  Fifteen of the active carverns are in hydrocarbon service with total storage capacity in excess of 38 million barrels.  Nine caverns are in mining service with a saturated brine deliverability of 8500 gallons per minute.  We have 8 regulated substances present at our facility.  These substances include Ethane, Butane, Pentane, Propylene  [1-Propene], Methane, Ethylene [Ethene], Propane and Chlorine. \n\nThe maximum inventory of Ethane at our facility is 180,000,000 lbs. while Butane, Pentane, Propylene  [1-Propene], Methane, Ethylene [Ethene], Propane and Chlorine are present at our facility in quantities of 37,000,000 lbs., 160,000,000 lbs., 64,000,000 lbs., 850,000 lbs., 120,000,000 lbs., 250,000,000 lbs., and 8000 l"

For alternative release scenario analyses we have employed the EPA's OCA Guidance Reference Tables or Equations and the modeling program PHAST.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 3 toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic release.  In this scenario 2000 lb. of Chlorine is released in a gaseous form over 10 minutes. At Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s windspeed, the maximum distance of 5.6 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.0087 mg/L.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for Chlorine involves the release of 2000 lbs. of chlorine in a gaseous form over 10 minutes.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.0087 mg/L of Chlorine is 2.0 miles.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 3 flammable substances as a class involves a catastrophic release.  In this scenario 1,500,000 lbs. of Pentane is released.  It is assumed that the entire quantity is released as a vapor, which finds an ignition source, with 10 percent of the released quantity participating in a vapor cloud explosion.  Under worst case weather conditions, the calculated distance of 0.9 miles is obtained corresponding to an endpoint of 1 psi overpressure.\n\nAn additional worst case release scenario for Program 3 flammables, involving a catastrophic release, is also included in the RMP because it affects different offsite receptors.  In this scenario 1,500,000 lbs. of Propylene  [1-Propene] is released.  It is assumed that the entire quantity is released as a vapor, which finds an ignition source, with 10 percent of the released quantity participating in a vapor cloud explosion"
