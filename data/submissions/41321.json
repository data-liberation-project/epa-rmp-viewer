The facility employees approximately 35 full time people, and is in operation 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, with the exception of scheduled maintenance shut down periods.  The control room operators are monitoring operations on a continuous basis.\n\nHearland Corn Products has a very aggressive accident prevention and safety program.  Each employee is offered a minimum of four hours of classroom and hands-on instruction each month.  The topics include general OSHA required safety training, EPA compliance seminars, DOT hazardous materials transportation certification, HAZWOPER and emergency procedures, and OSHA process management safety program implementation.\n\nThe facility is designed and built to the current acceptable standards for operations of this type.  Based on \"standard operating procedure\" and \"PSM\" the operations are monitored by computer as well as visual observation for any abnormalities that may develop.  Process sytems and storage areas are designed to be as \"fail safe\" as possible.  Back up systems such as containment areas are in place to control any mishap with minimal negative results. \n\nClose coordination with the local emergency response departments (Fire, Police, Ambulance, Etc.) have been established and are reviewed at least annually.  Site visits and tours have been conducted to insure that any emergency could be addressed without undue delay in understanding facility layout and operations.  Facility emergency response teams are trained to follow the 1910.120 standard to be able to \"merge\" into a unified response with local aid to any size emergency.  \n\nRegular inspections and audits are performed by outside parties (insurance, consultants, fire department, etc.) to insure that properties and procedures are as accident free as possible.  Identified areas needing corrections are addressed in a timely fashion.  Required corrections are implemented by company employees thereby insur"
