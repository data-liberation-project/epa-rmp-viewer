We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and\n\nemergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the\n\npublic as well as protection of the environment.  This section of the document provides a brief\n\noverview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and\n\nimplemented, including:\n\n\n\n A description of our facility and use of substances regulated by EPA's RMP regulation\n\n A summary of results from our assessment of the potential off site consequences from\n\naccidental chemical releases\n\n An overview of our accidental release prevention programs\n\n A five-year accident history for accidental releases of chemicals regulated by EPA's RMP rule\n\n An overview of our emergency response program\n\n An overview of planned improvements at the facility to help prevent accidental chemical\n\nreleases from occurring and adversely affecting our employees, the public, and the environment\n\n The certifications that EPA's RMP rule requires us to provide\n\n The detailed information (called data elements) about our risk management program\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          2.0 STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n\n\n\n\nOur facility produces condensed naphthalene sulfonates under the trade name of LOMAR, alkyl\n\nnaphthalene sulfonates, defoamers and miscellaneous other organic chemicals.  In all, about 250\n\ndifferent products are manufactured at the Cedartown plant, using about 250  raw materials.  \n\n\n\nIn our processes, we use the following chemicals that EPA has ident"
