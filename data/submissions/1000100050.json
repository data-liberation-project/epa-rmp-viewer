This 5-year updated Risk Management Plan (RMP) summarizes the management, administrative, procedural, and technological controls that work together to minimize the risk to site personnel, contractors, visitors, and the community and environment at large of hazardous chemical releases.

It is Baxter policy to comply with all applicable federal, state, and local rules and regulations. \n\nThis RMP has identified potential hazards and has taken steps to design and maintain a safe facility in order to prevent releases, and minimize the consequences of accidental releases, which could occur. This RMP addresses potentially catastrophic chemical releases that could result in immediate harm and acute health effects to offsite receptors (public and environmental).

Baxter is a hospital products and pharmaceutical manufacturer specializing in IV solutions and premixed drugs, IV infusion pumps and administration sets, parenteral nutrition, etc.\n\nThe NAICS code for the facility is 325412. The facility uses ethylene oxide for product sterilization, and is regulated under 40 CFR Part 68, the EPA RMP Rule. \n\nTwo (2), 400 pound cylinders of ethylene oxide are connected to each sterilization vessel at all times. In Vessel 7 drum room there is one (1) sterilization vessel in use at one time and a capacity to store six (6) cylinders, for a total of eight (8) ethylene oxide cylinders or 3,200 pounds. In the new drum room, there are a total of six (6) sterilization vessels used at one time and a capacity to store six (6) cylinders, for a total of eighteen (18) ethylene oxide cylinders, or 7200 pounds. In addition, the total capacity of the outdoor storage facility is thirty (30) cylinders, resulting in a potential of 12,000 pounds of ethylene oxide in the outdoor storage facility. Therefore, the total potential quantity of ethylene on-site is approximately 22,400 pounds.\n\nAn aerial map identifying the site location is included as Appendix A. \n\nIV.\tHazard Assessment \u0096 Worse Case Scenarios (WCS)\nAppendix B consists of the RMP*Submit Printout and contains additional information on the worst-case scenario. Appendix C consists of the offsite consequence analysis data and maps for the worse case release scenario. \n\nV.\tHazard Assessment \u0096 Alternative Release Scenarios (ARS)\nAppendix B consists of the RMP*Submit Printout and contains additional information on the alternative release scenario.

However, as discussed throughout this document Baxter is continuously improving this program. \n\nThis prevention program covers those processes that utilize ethylene oxide above the threshold quantity for both PSM and RMP rules. The PSM and RMP are evaluated, at least, every three (3) years in compliance with the requirement to conduct PSM audits every three years.  The elements of the PSM / Program 3 prevention program and a brief description are listed below.\n\n\u0095\tEmployee Participation \u0096 Baxter has developed a site-specific employee participation plan that ensures employees and their representatives are consulted when conducting and developing process hazard analyses and other information required to be developed under the PSM/RMP regulation.  In addition, the employee participation program will ensure employees and their representatives have access to process hazard analyses and all other information required to be developed under PSM/RMP.  \n\u0095\tProcess Safety Information \u0096 Baxter maintains a site-specific PSI program that ensures information pertaining to the hazards, technology, and equipment of the process are properly developed and maintained. \n\u0095\tProcess Hazard Analysis \u0096 Baxter has developed a site-specific PHA program that ensures a PHA is conducted initially, at a minimum of every five (5) years, and whenever a change is significant enough to require a change in PSI.  In addition, this program ensures PHAs are conducted in accordance with OSHA and EPA regulations and ensures findings and recommendations of PHAs are properly documented.\n\u0095\tOperating Procedures \u0096 Baxter has updated a site-specific procedure that ensures operating procedures provide clear instruction for different phases of process operation"

This coordination effort includes providing the agency with a copy of our EAP, and providing a site diagram and hazardous material information, meeting with Mountain Home Fire Department personnel to discuss the facility\u0092s operations/processes and encouraging periodic on-site inspections and coordination with Mountain Home Fire Department personnel.\n\n \nCurrently, Baxter does not have designated personnel as members of a hazardous materials response team.
