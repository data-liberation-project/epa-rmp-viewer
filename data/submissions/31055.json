For those contractors who work on or near process equipment, the plant has procedures in place, that when followed, ensure that these contractors:\n\n\u00b7 perform their work in a safe manner, \n\u00b7 have the appropriate knowledge and skills to work safely around the process,\n\u00b7 are aware of the hazards in their workplace,\n\u00b7 understand what they should do in the event of an incident,\n\u00b7 understand and follow site safety rules, and\n\u00b7 inform gas plant personnel of any hazards that their work brings and/or that they find during their work.\n\nThe Wingate Fractionator has developed and implemented safe work practices and procedures to control the entrance, presence, and exit of contract employers and employees in covered process areas.\n\nEach contract employee is provided with site-specific training on the hazards that may exist at the plant.  Each contract employee is provided an orientation on the known potential fire, explosion, or release hazards related to the contractor's work and the process, as well as the applicable provisions of the incident response plan.  \n\nContractor safety programs and safety performance are evaluated and become part of ConocoPhillips's contractor selection process.  ConocoPhillips personnel periodically monitor contractor safety programs and performance records.\n\nManagement of Change (MOC)\n\nThroughout the life of any operating facility, changes will often be necessary -- for exam"

The Wingate Fractionator has a comprehensive system in place to manage and document any such changes to the plant's processes.  This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, or other changes be properly reviewed and authorized by a number of people with different functional expertise before being implemented.  This system of managing facility modifications is called Management of Change (MOC).  This system consists of a set of written procedures that are used to identify and eliminate hazards associated with a change to the facility's processes.  MOC ensures that facility modifications are formally reviewed and approved before being implemented.  Changes are reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and (2) verify that existing controls have not been negatively affected by the change.  A part of the MOC process ensures that any chemical hazard information, process operating limits, equipment information, and/or procedures are updated as appropriate to incorporate the effects of the modification.  A critical piece of the MOC process ensures that operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training regarding the process modification.\n\nPre-Startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\n\nThe Wingate Fractionator conducts a Pre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR) for any modification that requires a change in the process safety information.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure before startup of the modified process or unit that the modification was completed in accordance with design specifications.  The PSSR is also intended to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are properly prepared for startup before the modified equipment is put in service.  Another key purpose of the PSSRs is to ensure that"

More specific ways that employees can be involved in the Risk Management Program are documented in an Employee Participation Plan that is maintained at the plant.\n\nIn addition, employees and management have a number of initiatives in place that are designed to improve safety at the plant.  These initiatives are focused on both the plant processes and general worker safety (including slips, trips, and falls), and even off-the-job safety.  These initiatives include safety teams that have been chartered to improve safety, both on and off the job.  These safety teams typically have members from various functional areas of the plant -- including operations, maintenance, engineering, and plant management -- to ensure the team has a broad perspective, which leads to better ideas to improve safety.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\nThe Wingate Fractionator has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the plant's operations and processes are identified and minimized.  This is a systematic procedure in which each part of the process is systematically examined to identify all of the potential hazards associated with the process, and to ensure that appropriate recommendations are developed and implemented to eliminate or control the potential hazards.\n\nThe Process Hazards Analysis procedure utilized at the Wingate Fractionator is carried out by a team of functional experts from engineering, operations, maintenance, and safety, who work with a PHA Facilitator to identify and evaluate all of the potential hazards that could possibly result in a"
