The Wickliffe Mill's core business consists of manufacturing un-coated paper. The Wickliffe Mill is committed to conducting operations in a manner that protects the safety of our employees, the public, and the environment.  \n\n\n\nTo achieve this commitment, the Wickliffe Mill has established detailed policies, procedures, and work practices as part of our environmental, health, and safety (EHS) management system. One component of our management system is a Risk Management Plan (RMP) which assists in identifying and minimizing our risks and is intended to comply with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) regulation found in 40 CFR Part 68, \"Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions.\" The intent of the remaining sections of this document is to provide a summary of the elements contained in the Wickliffe Mill's risk management plan.   \n\n\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:\n\n\n\nPhoenix Paper is committed to the safety of its workers, contractors and the public, and the preservation of the environment, through the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous materials. The Wickliffe Mill has systems in place that provide reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous substances. At the core of our prevention program are policies and work practices for employee and contractor training; procedures for proper operation and maintenance; pre-job planning and hazard assessments; audits and inspections; engineering design and control specifications; and procedures for evaluating process modifications. Additionally, the mill has established numerous environmental and safety policies to ensure the safety and well-being of our employees, minimize potential impacts to the environment and"

The Wickliffe Mill is training more than 100 emergency responders trained to deal with releases of materials specific to our mill operations. An updated emergency response plan contains a formal incident command system to allow a structured and efficient response to mill emergencies. On-site materials and response activities have been reviewed with the Local Emergency Planning Committee and the State Disaster and Emergency Response Coordinator. The Mill conducts periodic training exercises to maintain our readiness to respond to potential releases.  \n\n\n\nWickliffe Mill and Regulated Substances:\n\n\n\nThe Wickliffe Mill is an integrated pulp and paper mill that manufactures bleached pulp and coated and uncoated paper. As part of our operation, the Wickliffe Mill manufactures and/or uses one chemical substances that is subject to the reporting requirements of 40 CFR Part 68. The regulated substance is chlorine dioxide. Chlorine dioxide is manufactured on-site and is used in the whitening of pulp in the pulp mill operating unit.\n\n\n\nNote of Clarification:  Previously, chlorine was used to disinfect raw water used at the Mill.  It was, therefore, included in the previous site RMPs.  However, raw water disinfection is now accomplished without chlorine.   \n\n\n\nIn addition to being subject to 40 CFR Part 68 regulations, the Wickliffe Mill also complies with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) requirements outlined in 29 CFR 1910.119. In general, these two programs (i.e. PSM and RMP) are similar in regulated substances and compliance requirements. As a note of clarification, the Wickliffe Mill consumes significant quantities of methanol (CAS# 67-56-1) which is a regulated su"

However, methanol is not regulated substance listed in the accidental release regulations outlined in 40 CFR Part 68.130, therefore is not included as part of our risk management plan. \n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-specific Prevention:\n\n\n\nThe Wickliffe Mill continually evaluates ways to prevent accidental releases of hazardous substances. In 1994, the Wickliffe Mill implemented the 14 elements of OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) program. The EPA RMP rule, published in 1996, established various levels of prevention program requirements. The chlorine dioxide at the pulp mill is a Program 3 level process. This program level is similar to OSHA's PSM program, except that the RMP program focuses on protecting the public and the environment. A prevention program to meet these requirements has been developed for the chlorine dioxide processes. The prevention program is comprised of the following 12 elements: \n\n\n\n - Process safety information\n\n - Pre-startup review\n\n - Process hazard analysis\n\n - Compliance audit\n\n - Operating procedures\n\n - Incident investigation\n\n - Training\n\n - Employee participation\n\n - Mechanical integrity\n\n - Hot work permits\n\n - Management of change\n\n - Contractors\n\n\n\nIn addition to the required prevention program elements, the Wickliffe Mill has implemented safety features specific to the hazardous substances used at our mill. Chlorine dioxide is generated on-site in a state-of-the-art computer-controlled process. The dilute solution in water is stored in one tank and fed to the process through pumps and piping dedicated for chlorine dioxide service. The materials of construction and delivery system all meet the specifications of the suppliers and general industry standards. Chlorine dioxide detectors are located throughout the areas where chlorine dioxide is present in the pulp mill process areas. These alarms are set to trigger b"

The alarms are audible in the pulp mill control room where displays are constantly monitored.   \n\n\n\nFive Year Accident History:\n\n\n\nThere were no reportable accidents in the last five years involving our RMP covered processes.  The last accident associated with one of the regulated substances occurred in August 1999.\n\n\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program:\n\n\n\nThe Wickliffe Mill has developed a written emergency response program centered on the mill's emergency disaster plan to help make the appropriate response to accidental releases of hazardous substances. The Site is in the process of converting the previous Emergency Response Program to a Phoenix Paper Program.  The program includes information specific to both processes at the mill. The information includes: \n\n\n\n- Evaluation of the accidental release, determination of evacuation and emergency response support, notification to appropriate public agencies and management personnel. \n\n- Controlling and containing accidental releases, including the use of emergency response equipment and the inspection, testing, and maintenance of that equipment. \n\n- Providing first aid and emergency medical treatment for accidental exposure to hazardous substances. \n\n- Training for employees in relevant procedures. \n\n- Procedures to review and update the emergency response program and update employees as necessary. \n\n\n\nIn past year, the Wickliffe Mill maintained an emergency response team of more than 100 members. All workers, contractors, and visitors were trained in appropriate evacuation procedures. The mill routinely conducted emergency response training and drills and each mill area conducted periodic evacuation drills. \n\n\n\nThe Mill was shut-down for 3 years.  In mid 2019, the Mill will resume operations.  The emergency response team will be reinitiated and the afore-mentioned training and drills will recommence within approximately 6 months of Mill recommissioning.   \n\n\n\nD"

Code Red also provides fire-watch and response to small fires.  Full-scale fire protection will be provided by the Local Fire Department.   \n\n\n\nThe Wickliffe Mill emergency response plan complies with the requirements of 29 CFR 1910.38(a) as required by the Process Safety Management rule and has been communicated to local responders. Information has been supplied to local responders as part of the \"TAB Q-7\" of the county emergency operations plan for the Wickliffe Mill. Additionally, the Wickliffe Mill has employees that actively participate on our Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and volunteer on the local fire and rescue squads in our community. \n\n\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:\n\n\n\nThe Wickliffe Mill continually strives to improve the safety of processes at the mill. The chlorine dioxide process safety is evaluated through a periodic review of the respective hazard and operability studies (HAZOP), management of change procedures, incident investigation programs, safety action teams, solicitation of safety suggestions from employees, and through best practices shared within our industrial sector. Presently, no significant modifications to either regulated process have occurred. "
