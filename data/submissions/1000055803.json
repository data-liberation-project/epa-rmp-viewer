      "SummaryText": "Facility Description\n\nThe POET Biorefining-Cloverdale, LLC facility is located approximately one mile north-northwest of Cloverdale, Indiana, in Putnam County.  POET Biorefining-Cloverdale's main product is denatured ethanol for use as motor vehicle fuel.  The facility also produces vegetable (corn) oil and dried distillers grain.  Ethanol production at the facility was initiated in 2007.  The facility was shut down due to market conditions in early 2009.  POET Biorefining purchased the plant and resumed ethanol production circa April, 2011.  POET Biorefining-Cloverdale produces ethanol using the dry mill method. Corn meal is mixed with water and a digestive enzyme to produce starch, which is cooked and liquefied. The resulting mash is cooled and a secondary enzyme is added to convert the liquefied starch to fermentable sugars. Yeast is added to the mash to ferment the sugars to ethanol.  The fermented mash (beer) contains about 10% alcohol and is distilled, then passed through a dehydration system to produce 200-proof anhydrous ethanol. After final dehydration, the ethanol is collected in two 1,000,000-gallon storage tanks.  During product load-out a denaturant (natural gas condensate, NGC) is added to make the ethanol unfit for human consumption, per federal and state requirements.  The NGC denaturant is normally stored in Tank No. 805, which has a capacity of 60,000 gallons (approximately 380,000 pounds), and it may also be stored in Tank No. 802 which has a capacity of 180,000 gallons (approximately 1,140,000 pounds).  NGC is blended in-line with the 200 proof ethanol during load-out to vehicles for transport off-site. The denatured ethanol motor fuel may be shipped from the facility in tank trucks or rail cars.\n\n\n\nChemicals Regulated Under EPA's Chemical Accident Prevention Program\n\nThe NGC denaturant is the only CAPP/RMP regulated chemical which exceeds the CAPP quantity thresholds for applicability of the regulation. The CAPP/RMP regulated process consists of"

The greatest CAPP regulated quantity of denaturant in a tank, vessel or piping system is the quantity in one of two potential the denaturant storage tanks, located in the center containment area of the tank farm.  Line 1.17(c)of this submission is the total quantity of both tanks (though it is not likely that both tanks would be used at near capacity).  As recommended by U.S. EPA's RMP Information Office on June 10,  2013, Line 4.4 of the Worst Case Scenario submission is taken as QR (Eq. D-1; Risk Management Program Guidance for Off Site Consequence Analysis, EPA 550-B-99-009, March, 2009.), i.e., pounds evaporated per minute from the complete loss of contents from Tank 802 (which then pool in the secondary containment basin) and multiplied times ten minutes to reflect the quantity that is estimated to evaporate and participate in an un-contained vapor cloud explosion.   Similarly, line 5.4 of the Alternative Case Scenario submission is taken as QR for one minute to reflect the quantity that is estimated to evaporate and participate in an un-contained vapor cloud fire.  These estimates of Quantity Released were approved via a series of phone communications with the CDX Help Desk and U.S. EPA's RMP Information Office on June 10,  2013, with the stipulation that the calculation method be described in the Executive Summary of RMP Submit. Details of the calculation methodology are in Appendix D of the POET Biorefining-Cloverdale Desktop Risk Management Plan.  \n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policy\n\nPOET Biorefining-Cloverdale is committed to the protection of it employees, the surrounding community and the environment from industrial materials used in the ethanol fuel production process.

There is no facility emergency response team. Employees within their designated work areas will respond to small releases, if such response does not pose a danger to their health or safety. In the event of a larger release, it is the policy of POET Biorefining-Cloverdale to notify the Cloverdale Fire Department, evacuate all employees at the facility, and provide technical and logistics support to the Fire Department Incident Commander.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program, and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nPOET Biorefining-Cloverdale is committed to protection of the environment through the combined use of inspection, maintenance, passive mitigation, employee training and response preparation.  Computer based maintenance software (Maximo) is utilized to implement automatic scheduling and work order generation for covered process  preventative maintenance inspections and tests.  Public access to the facility from the highway is restricted by a gate. Much of the property is fenced, limiting vehicle access. The plant is fully lighted. Personnel are typically on-site 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. There is a multi-camera video surveillance system installed at the property, and a general computer based alarm system. The alarm system includes monitoring of the storage tanks and denaturant blending system (level control and overfill monitors). The alarm system is monitored in the control room for abnormal conditions, which trigger visual control panel alarm lights and audible alarms. Critical aspects of process control can be performed remotely.  The covered process  storage tanks have secondary containment and are included in the facility Spill Preventio"
